### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best razor I have owned yet!</li>
      <li>But this Braun wet/dry razor is the best.</li>
      <li>The shaver bends perfectly with the shape of your face and that&#x27;s that.</li>
      <li>Braun has done a wonderful job on this model compare to their others.</li>
      <li>Now on to the function; this thing performs flawlessly.</li>
      <li>and I have been very impressed with my results.  </li>
      <li>in all this is a great razor !!</li>
      <li>Braun sent me this to try out and it is the best trimmer I have used.  </li>
      <li>and it has it shaved perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very impressed.</li>
      <li>(hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect).</li>
      <li>But after giving it some time, I was quite impressed with the usability and closeness of the shave...</li>
      <li>I got this product from BzzAgent and whst a great place to be!</li>
      <li>Not their best.</li>
      <li>but this one works great!</li>
      <li>and I was very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
      <li>---Excellent battery life.</li>
      <li>Awesome battery life</li>
      <li>have to say that I have not been impressed with the battery life.</li>
      <li>The best part was that I didn&#x27;t need any shaving cream, and there was no razor burn afterward.</li>
      <li>Because of the ease, speed, and fact that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>It was the closest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, and here is why:&lt;br</li>
      <li>The flexible head has a great range of movement</li>
      <li>not as close as a blade shave, but still a great great razor.</li>
      <li>great for travel or on the go&lt;</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
      <li>But with shaving cream, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>The battery life is great</li>
      <li>Does not work great as a beard trimmer</li>
      <li>, it works great in the shower also.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a great electric shaver for about two decades now.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful razor, it gives you a nice close shave without the irritation.  </li>
      <li>The feel is great.  </li>
      <li>So a great product.</li>
      <li>The built in trimmer was great for sideburns</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shaving with foam, however, was great.</li>
      <li>The shower feature is really great too.  </li>
      <li>Works great in the shower, and works with water, gel, cream, and nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shaver does a great job.  </li>
      <li>But all and all it is a very nice unit</li>
      <li>And while the trimmer didn&#x27;t give a closer shave than the foil head, it was still very effective.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice handling grip, so it could never slip away.</li>
      <li>The design and technology of the WF2 is remarkable.</li>
      <li>This razor performed quite remarkably in those conditions as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First thing I noticed about the shaver was the great build quality and superior material choice.</li>
      <li>make sure you have, or get yourself a good trimmer to go along with it !!</li>
      <li>together I think it&#x27;s a great product, although it doesn&#x27;t fit my use case for an electric razor perfectly I will still be using it periodically.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy razor that gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>All in all this is a wonderful shaver with super close shave!</li>
      <li>The handle provides a good grip while using it in the shower</li>
      <li>and surprisingly I had no razor bumps afterwards. </li>
      <li>the shave was not that good.  </li>
      <li>Ive never had good luck with shave quality with electric razors which is why I stopped using them.</li>
      <li>I got to try this razor free from Bzz Agent and Have been using this razor for around a week now and am very impressed</li>
      <li>Best part of this product: I received this as a free promotion through BzzAgent.com.</li>
      <li>in all I would recommend this razor for any of my family and friends that use electric razors as it gives a good shave.  </li>
      <li>you can tell the shaver is well made and feels good in the hand.</li>
      <li>It works well in both circumstances, with a good ergonomic feel to it and a good sense of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice rubberized grip gives you a great hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Waterflex provided by Braun and BzzAgent for review for a month, so I think I have a good handle on this shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of contouring to the shape of your face allowing a close shave&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that the head does swivel.  </li>
      <li>Good price and quality for what your getting .</li>
      <li>It worked perfect and gives a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;d also like to thank Braun for letting me try this product for free, but in no way did that reflect my review because this is an awesome shaver.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;+Seems to have a good battery life</li>
      <li>The battery life is good</li>
      <li>Its has a sweet handle and a wonderful charge life.</li>
      <li>Very good electric razor by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
      <li>and I have been extremely impressed with the razors ability to contour to my face so quickly.</li>
      <li>I am still more in favor of a multi blade shave, but when time is of the essence, this is a great razor.</li>
      <li>The trimmer was great and worked better</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with this razor and would recommend to any one who is considering buying a razor.</li>
      <li>This is the first foil razor that I have ever owned and after using it for a couple of weeks, I have quite impressed with the unit.</li>

      <li>shaving cream/gel or withut it, the Waterflex2 does an amazing job.</li>
      <li>but it was still a good close shave and being able to shave in the shower</li>
      <li>Fantasticly smooth, comfortable and best of all razor</li>
      <li>that with the WaterFlex that is not a problem, as I’ve not needed to use any lotion of any kind after I shave with it.  </li>

      <li>If you have used or are familiar with Braun shavers this shaver is a great option.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to unpackage which is always nice.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was bored at work one day and decided to signup as a bzz agent to see if someday i would get something useful... let me tell you, that this razor, that i recieved from them is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever had. I had a full on beard going when i used this, the trimmer on the back worked like a charm, and the foil electric rozor on front gave me the closest shave i have ever recieved from an electric razor! Thank you Bzzagent, and thank you Braun!</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor free from Bzz Agent and Have been using this razor for around a week now and am very impressed but it&#x27;s nothing less than I expected from Braun. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower as well as dry in the mirror and it delivers the same high quality close shave on each occasion. The convenience of being able to use it in the shower is such a plus point for me, when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and don&#x27;t usually have the time for a traditional wet shave with a razor I know I can use the Braun in the shower cutting down on so much time getting the same results.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and shaving has always been a chore for me. I&#x27;ve tried all forms of electric razors over the years in an effort to get a faster and more convenient shave; however, I never stuck with one for very long since they didn&#x27;t shave close enough, or left stray hairs behind. This Waterflex from Braun is the closest thing I have found to a &amp;#34;blade shave&amp;#34; while also having the added convenience of speed and portability that electrics provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this shaver for free from Braun via (BzzAgent) and I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now. In the past, if I was using an electric it meant that I had to shave with it every single day in order to keep the hairs short enough for the electric shaver to be effective (both foil and disk types). This is not the case with the Braun Waterflex. I am able to skip a day, and the Waterflex is still able to power through the longer stubble. If I go longer than two days between shaves I will still have to revert to a blade to get a smooth shave, but this Waterflex electric has definitely exceeded my expectations in its ability to power through more than a day&#x27;s worth of thick growth and provide a smooth shave. I think this is mostly due to the cutter head having a unique trimmer in the middle of the foil heads (hard to explain, but see the photos I included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially concerned that the trimmer extension was a bit flimsy and would not hold up; however, the trimmer works very well and I have yet to have any issues with it. I like that fact that it extends in one easy motion with your thumb, but only time will tell if it will hold up for the long-haul. The Waterflex as a whole has proved to be very durable, and I especially like the fact that it comes with a Li-ion battery (4.5v) and lasts for many shaves in between charges. At this price point, that is not something that I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a high quality shaver and, if you&#x27;re like me and have avoided electrics because of your beard being too thick, this is the electric for you!</li>
    <li> I found that this product looked promising,  but it faulted in its delivery.  I tried this twice and both times it did not deliver the &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s skin shave&amp;#34; that I was expecting. Thank you Braun for letting me trying this product for free</li>
    <li> The Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver is a solid shaver that works well but is not without some drawbacks. The shaver itself has a nice rubber coating which I like and makes it feel nicer especially considering the light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave quality and operation is similar to other Braun shavers. If you have used or are familiar with Braun shavers this shaver is a great option. It shaves very closely although sometimes you must go over your stubble a couple of times to catch every single hair. The shaving head is a bit smaller and does not flex as much as more expensive Braun models, although for many it works good enough. As for the wet shave function, I tried it myself but do not feel that it shaves any better than using it dry. If you enjoy shaving in the shower it may be of benefit, but for me I would not pay extra for the wet shave capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is where the waterproof aspect of this model really shines. You can clean it the traditional way with a brush  but you can also place it under a running faucet to clean making it even easier. No need to have a cleaning station with expensive refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there are some drawbacks to the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver. One is that the shaver does not work when charging. This makes it not a good candidate to use solely as a travel shaver since if the battery is dead you must charge it before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last and most significant drawback is price. Aside from the wet/dry function I simply do not see the advantage of this shaver over a $50 braun model.such as the series 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was provided the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver for free by Braun in order to review the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice rubber grip&lt;br /&gt;Close shave&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean (can clean under faucet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Shaver does not work when charging, so if battery is dead you can not use plugged in&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with carrying case&lt;br /&gt;Expensive - no clear advantage over braun shavers in the $50-$75 range</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver that does a decent job. It&#x27;s nothing to get excited about, but it could be especially good for traveling due to its small size.  The one major drawback is that there is not docking station for charging.  This is just a personal preference, so it may not matter to some people.  Thanks to Braun for allowing me to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> I have always used a normal $30 razor and just never was satisfied really didnt know there was anything better out there but let me tell you this razor Is worth every penny It cost I have used this razor for about a month now, and never got any burns. It does a wonderful job at getting a close shave without missing hairs. Thanks to Braun for letting me try this product for free</li>
    <li> I received the Braun WaterFlex 2 electric razor that I received free to test thanks Braun. To begin I normally only use clippers to shave my face because electric razors leave me with bumps all over my chin. So I was on the fence about this product. &lt;br /&gt;I first tried Braun WaterFlex dry. It gave me a very close shave, without grabbing and plucking hairs. It was easy to hold and surprisingly I had no razor bumps afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, although I do not usually shave in the shower, I tried it out to see if I would have the same success as I did using it dry. It worked well, was easy to grip, and it was nice being able to rinse the razor out without my wife yelling at me about messing up the sink. &lt;br /&gt;It gave a comparable shave wet and dry. Thanks to Braun I can use an electric shaver again. </li>
    <li> Thanks to Braun for letting me try this for free! My hair is about average in terms of being coarse or fine, I don&#x27;t grow hair quickly but after about a day or two the wife suddenly starts to avoid kissing me... weird.  I have a rotary shaver and a multi-blade razor (Braun as well, and Gillette, respectively) so I feel I have a pretty good base for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it over the first two weeks I&#x27;d switch off between the rotary (with new blades) and the Waterflex, avoiding the multi-blade for the time being. The Waterflex not only cut closer and more smoothly, but I didn&#x27;t really have any irritation, whereas the rotary with new blades still &#x27;grabbed&#x27; the hair some of the time which caused a lot of irritation.  Since then I&#x27;ve completely stopped using the rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to compare to a multi-blade razor, they will always get closer and cut more smoothly, but this shaver is REALLY close to a multi-blade.  If it&#x27;s more of a &#x27;complete&#x27; shave that you are looking for, an electric shaver just isn&#x27;t for you, more than likely.  In my experience, electric shavers just can&#x27;t quite get those few random strands of hair under parts of my chin or on my side burns like a regular razor can.  But, in a pinch, this thing can get you about 95% of the way there, with the remaining 5% not really being noticeable unless touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small side notes specifically about this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;-Works great wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;-The grip for your hand(s) is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-The 3-part shaving system (two foils and the middle... thingy) work together extremely well, you can tell they paid attention to what they were doing.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimming tool on the back is very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great shaver (wet OR dry), but I just can&#x27;t rate it 5 stars since I can&#x27;t get a FULL shave from it.  Definitely better than any rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever used (3 total, in varying price ranges), but it simply can&#x27;t beat multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver as part of a promotion from the brand and I have been very impressed with my results.  For years I have been a Norelco user and being someone with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow come noon each day, my routine has started every morning with an electric shave followed by a shower shave using a hand held razor.  With the Braun Waterflex I have had amazing results.  I read a lot about the OptiBlade cutting system and it lives up to its reviews.  My shaves have been a lot cleaner and I have been extremely impressed with the razors ability to contour to my face so quickly. Especially around my chin and jawline, just as it was described.  Whether shaving dry or while in the shower I have been very happy with my results and I would strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good clean shave.  The battery life is great and I also feel like the precision trimmer is a great addition to this highly quality razor.  Trimming my sideburns has never been easier.  Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the Braun Waterflex Wet and Dry razor.</li>
    <li> I got the Braun Shaver free to review. I do not care for this razor at all.  I tried this in the shower first off.  It just really didn&#x27;t give me a smooth shave at all.  Then I tried it with shaving cream and it left a lot of unshaven spots on my face no matter how hard i pushed.  Over all i am not impressed with this product in the least and would not use it on my own.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a FREE promotion from Braun and it has been a great razor.  Thank you Braun!!  It shaves really close to my skin and does not leave any irriation on my skin.  I like how the razor has multiple options of how to shave: 1) the close razor and 2) the trimmer. Both work really well and shave as designed.  The razor itself is also really comfortable in my hand with the nice soft grips on the side.  As for the battery life, i guess it&#x27;s pretty good as i&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it  hasn&#x27;t had to be charged yet.  When compared to other electrics i have used in the past, this is much better on all counts.  I would definitely recommend this razor to family and friends who are looking for a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun WaterFlex 2 electric razor for free, thanks to Braun. The razor I received was blue, which I thought was cool. It had a soft grip to it and found it extremely convenient to use as it can be used in wet and dry environments. I&#x27;m the type of person who is usually behind schedule, so being able to use the Braun razor in the shower for a quick clean shave was a big plus! Although this razor did give me an amazingly close and smooth shave on my face, I found the razor a little difficult to use on my neck as it didn&#x27;t give the same close shave results. However I was also a little disappointed that I could not use this razor while it was charging, but it didn&#x27;t bother me to much because it charged pretty quickly. The trimmer was great and worked better then I thought it would. I was very satisfied with this razor and would recommend to any one who is considering buying a razor. This Braun Razor was easy to use and easy to clean. Thanks Again Braun for allowing me to test your product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Braun to try for free by BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.  So far it&#x27;s great!  It&#x27;s a simple razor with shower capabilities.  It gives me the nice and clean tight shave that my old razor wasn&#x27;t capable of.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy razor that gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the color blue it was delivered in.</li>
    <li> This is the cleanest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m not just talking about how close it shaves, but what it leaves on the counter when I&#x27;m done.  Braun sent out this free razor to me via BzzAgent.  I opened it up, watched it charge in under an hour, and got to shaving.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much, but boy did it remove my neck stubble.  When I was done admiring the lack of irritation on my neck, I looked and and was totally amazed at the complete lack of loose hair in the sink!  Everything stayed in the head of the razor without being a hindrance to it&#x27;s operation.  Cleaning out the head of the razor was a also very and didn&#x27;t make a mess.  If you need a quick, on the go, electric razor for daily use, hands down, this is it!</li>
    <li> I actually received my Waterflex2 complimentary as a promotion from Braun. I&#x27;ve had it for about 30 days &amp; it has been great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an on the go kinda guy. So between heading to the gym, work, &amp; going out for various events, it has DEFINITELY come in handy. I love that the WaterFlex2 is cordless &amp; has a rechargeable battery. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times, for long &amp; short periods of time. So recharghing the battery was quick. I plugged it up, watched one TV show &amp; it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;With shaving cream/gel or withut it, the Waterflex2 does an amazing job. (of course you should still be mindful if you have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s not forget...It&#x27;s WATERPROOF!! The handle provides a good grip while using it in the shower (So no worries about dropping it...lol). I&#x27;ve tried it in the shower with shaving cream &amp; that works pretty good as well. The swivel head is great because it get really close to most of your facial hair. For myself, it works AMAZING on my cheeks, goatee, &amp; other body parts. But for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t get as close as I need it to on my neck (hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect). Perfect gift for a birthday present or Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> I was able to get a free one as a review product on Bzz Agent and I  really enjoyed it!  However I want a longer beard and this is really more of clean shaven kind of device. I let my friend use it who has to have a clean shaven face for work and he said it&#x27;s a dream to use.</li>
    <li> Thank you Braun for allowing me to use the Waterflex shaver as part of a product promotion !!&lt;br /&gt;To start off I only use electric razors and trimmers on my face with because traditional razors love to irritate my skin. My hair grows very fast, I have very full, thick facial hair when it grows. Electric razors I use take a beating, sometimes I shave twice a day&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was on my 2nd Remington F5-5800 (similar to the style of the Waterflex), now I just use the Waterflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fast moving head, very powerful (fast enough cutting to keep the razor burn down to a minimum, if any)&lt;br /&gt;- Close, smooth shave either wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;- The flexible head has a great range of movement&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Quick charge time&lt;br /&gt;- The longer head makes for a faster shave&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Nice rubberized grip gives you a great hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Beefier than most electric razors out there&lt;br /&gt;- The longer head makes it tricky shaving around sideburns/beards&lt;br /&gt;- Short, coiled charger&lt;br /&gt;- Very weak pop up trimmer (sometimes it cuts, sometimes it snags and rips your hair out)&lt;br /&gt;- Cant use when plugged in/charging (Just make sure you charge it when its dying, it sucks when you have to leave the house with only half of your face shaved)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great razor !! It cut my shave time in almost half (when I dry shave, wet shave takes about the same amount of time). I would recommend it to someone who is a lot like me who has thick facial hair and is looking for an electric razor that would give them a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you have, or get yourself a good trimmer to go along with it !!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver free to try from Braun. I love it! It shaves just as close to the skin as a regular razor does. I like that it can be used in the shower or not, it works great in the shower also. The is Braun!</li>
    <li> First of all I am trying this product for free all thanks to BRAUN!  This is a wonderful razor, it gives you a nice close shave without the irritation.  After a few weeks worth of stubble I was hesitant how it would perform but to my surprise it power right through!  After a few passes my face was as smooth as ever.  I have mainly used it dry but it is also able to be used wet with shaving gel and such.  All in all this is a wonderful shaver with super close shave!</li>
    <li> Solid and welt built.  Works best if you are interested n being completely cleared shaven.  Does not work great as a beard trimmer</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Braun to test and I was very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  As comparison, I previously used a Panasonic Arc 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor exclusively for the last 2 months, and I will not be going back to my Panasonic.  The Braun gives a superior shave both wet and dry and I am impressed with its abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had problems shaving.  I have facial hair that grows in every direction, making it difficult to use a standard razor without tearing my face to shreds.  I started using electric razors in 1985 with an old Norelco and have been using them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun WaterFlex gives a great shave, both wet and dry.  I started trimming around a beard when I first got the razor, but now am clean shaven.  It works well in both circumstances, with a good ergonomic feel to it and a good sense of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the charger cord.  It sticks way out from the plug, and as such, I have to unplug it to keep it out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great razor for the price!</li>
    <li> As a regular Braun series 7 user, I was uncertain as to the level of closeness I would receive from this &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; level WaterFlex 2 shaver provided to me free by Braun for evaluation purposes. To my surprise, I must admit that this electric razor matched my regular daily razor in terms of ease of use and closeness of shave. I don&#x27;t typically use my razor in a wet environment, but for the purposes of this evaluation and the claim of this product, I also tried it with a wet face and gel. This razor performed quite remarkably in those conditions as well. Overall, I would strongly recommend this razor to anyone out there looking to purchase an electric razor as well as those who routinely use manual blades.</li>
    <li> Got this the other day and it was the best shave I have ever had w an electric...I think tht I am now a reformed blade guy</li>
    <li> I wanted to thank the people at Braun for allowing me the opportunity to try the Waterflex Wet and Dry shaver for free.  I am not big into electric razors as they have always irritated my skin due to the thickness of my facial hair.  I have always used a manual razor however upon hearing about this I decided to give it a shot.  There are a lot of pros from my experience and some cons.  We will start with the pros.  This was the best shave I have ever had from an electric razor as it did not irritate my skin and actually cut my hair very close to skin level.  It was quick and painless.  The best part was it worked wet and dry.  Having a wet shave took a little extra time however at the end of the day the shave was the same.  The battery life lasted pretty well too.  The design and shape of the razor was very sleek and light.  I loved the fact that the head does swivel.  Now to the negatives and there are only a few.  The first is there is no docking station to charge the unit overnight.  Not that big of a deal as a charge is a charge no matter where it is plugged into but for space savers not the most space efficient charging mechanism.  The second is around my throat and jaw bone the shave was not that good.  I had to pass over that section of my face a few times and it did not get as close as I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this razor for any of my family and friends that use electric razors as it gives a good shave.  It beats out all other electric razors and is very well designed.  Thanks again braun for a great product.</li>
    <li> First, I would like to say thanks to Braun for letting me try this product for free. This is the first foil razor that I have ever owned and after using it for a couple of weeks, I have quite impressed with the unit. I had a rotary type razor before and the Braun Waterflex unit outperforms it in my experience. It only took me two or three passes to get a nice clean shave, my old razor would require around five passes and would still leave one or two behind. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the unit, is after a short period of time, the unit does get quite warm, not a big deal but it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I am a bearded man that used to hate shaving (therefore the beard).  I still need to trim up the neck line and cheeks and this little guy takes care of those quickly and easily.  Braun sent me this to try out and it is the best trimmer I have used.  I have a couple remingtons that are no where near as powerful and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I tried the Braun Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver free, thanks to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I did not keep using mine.  I have coarse curly hair that grows in all directions, not just one or two.  It just seemed to pull my skin too much and irritate while not giving a close enough shave.  I&#x27;d use it and some hairs were close shaven while some others were still there.  It also left me just before the 5oclock shadow stage and you&#x27;d be able to see stubble half way through the day.  It may work well for others, but for me it wasn&#x27;t what I need for daily use.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver free of charge from Bzzagent in order to review the product. I normally use a single blade safety razor so I&#x27;m fully aware what a close shave is and have the ability to compare the claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed about the shaver was the great build quality and superior material choice. It is everything one would expect from a brand like Braun. I did several tests with the shaver. While wet the semi-rubber-plastic had great grip and the power switch was easy to find while my glasses were off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first test was two days stubble (average growth) in the shower, with just water. I found the shaver did an adequate job although it took longer then my normal shave. I found it hard to reach all the growth under my chin/jaw area as my growth grows inwards towards my neck and the size of the shave head was just too large. I found myself going over the same spots several times which produced some razor burn on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second test was three days stubble in the shower with shaving cream. With the addition of the shaving cream I found my cheeks to be one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. Although I still had the same problems under my chin/jaw area I was left with marginally better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third test was a dry test, which is never my favorite way of shaving due to my sensitive skin. Although it produced better results then other electric razors I don&#x27;t suggest using this dry if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all tests I used the &amp;#34;Precision long-hair trimmer&amp;#34; on my sideburns which worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally when I look at electric razors to get me of a bind. For instance if i&#x27;m late for a meeting and need a quick clean up for running out the door. So my use-case for electric razors centers around 1) dry shaving ability, 2) speed &amp; 3) charging. Dry shaving is very important because I might not be getting in the shower in order to shave because I have to run out the door. Speed because I need to run out the door. Charging because the last thing I want to do I grab my electric razor to get a quick shave and it&#x27;s dead. I&#x27;ve had electric razors in the past that will not shave on a dead battery even when plugged into the wall. This is a huge oversight surrounding my use-case for an electric razor. I was not able to test #3 on this product so I&#x27;m not sure how it reacts when dead and plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together I think it&#x27;s a great product, although it doesn&#x27;t fit my use case for an electric razor perfectly I will still be using it periodically.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work and that can be a huge pain if I&#x27;m running behind. I received the Braun Waterflex as a free gift from Braun and Bzzagent to try out. I fell in love with it as soon as I pulled it out the box. Its has a sweet handle and a wonderful charge life. The pop up trimmer is great for when my wife lines up the back of my neck for me and its pretty often she has to do that one for me. It leaves a nice clean shave for me being that I shave every day. Thank you Braun and Bzzagent for making my morning a lil more simple with the quick clean shave from the Waterflex. I give it Ten plus stars.</li>
    <li> Hoped over to braun from phillips, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Not their best. Works well in shower.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have owned yet! I had an older just straight edge razor by Braun that I have used for years. I got the Waterflex from BzzAgent to test out. When I used the Waterflex for the first time, I could not believe it! I actually threw that old razor in the trash! Immediately! Normally I save everything and anything until it breaks so that really tells you something. It was the closest shave I have ever experienced. I was sure that I would get razor burn since I didn&#x27;t use any gel or cream, just shaved dry. The next day I was still smooth and no bumps or red marks at all! I also have sensitive skin, so this really impressed me! I normally shave in the shower, I tried this the following week and was still loving it! Very flexible, easy to use, close shave, and you can choose how you shave?! Defiantly a winner!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the good people at Braun, I had the pleasure of using the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver for the last few weeks. I shave on a daily basis and this electric shaver does the trick. Right out of the box you can tell the shaver is well made and feels good in the hand. The simple straight forward design is right on and more importantly it gives a great shave. I have used other electric shavers in the pass but always seem to move back to the cartridge razors for one reason or another. I think the WaterFlex may break the streak. It gives a very close shave in less time. I did find I have to make a few passes on parts of my neck to get that perfectly smooth shave, but I had to do that with a cartridge razor as well. The nice thing is even with the extra passes no more razor burn.  The battery life is good I can go two weeks without charging and cleaning is quick and easy. All in all it’s a quality product. Thanks again to Braun for the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> It worked perfect and gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I recently received this shaver at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Firstly, this is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve used in over 8 years. Ive never had good luck with shave quality with electric razors which is why I stopped using them. The first thing I noticed about it was the modern design and color. It really does look like sporting attire. You might expect to see this in a sports dept store. It felt really comfortable to hold even though I have large hands. (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;) I tried this razor on my face first with only water. I was surprised by the quality of shave I got. I was also surprised that I did not develop a rash offer shaving that I recall getting from the electric shavers I used to use. I did use an after shave balm also. After a few uses I decided to try it with a shaving lotion I often use with a manual razor. It shaved really smoothly to my surprise. The built in trimmer was great for sideburns but I did not try it on any other body parts. I&#x27;m really glad I was able to experience and use this shaver. I&#x27;m also excited that I still get to use it.</li>
    <li> First off, thanks to Braun and BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My general overview is that this is a pretty decent shaver, and does exactly as advertised. Though you won&#x27;t get a shave as close as any razor shave would give you, the quality and speed of the dry shave you can get with this is extremely nice. There may be cheaper similar razors, but for the features this shaver has, it&#x27;s a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; ---Excellent battery life. It was fully charged when I got it, and I was able to use it consistently over the course of a couple weeks before the little red battery light started blinking and I remembered this thing actually needs to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;---Super nice bright blue color. Didn&#x27;t expect it, but luckily, I love blue.&lt;br /&gt;---Fairly close, very quick dry shave. When my face gets a little scruffy and I just have 60 seconds to clean things up a little bit before I leave for school, this works great for a fast and fairly smooth facial shave. I never noticed any razor burn either.&lt;br /&gt;---The secondary trimmer on the back was something I used almost more than the main head of the razor. Rather than just my face, I also tried using this razor to shave my thighs/legs and other various hairy parts of the body. I found that the trimmer worked excellent at cutting through thick hair, and the fairly wide edge means you can cut a lot with not very many swipes of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;---Fully wet and dry. Works great in the shower, and works with water, gel, cream, and nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;---No case. You pretty much get the razor, a little protective plastic piece to put over the foil head, a manual, cleaning brush, and the cord.&lt;br /&gt;---While fast and convenient, you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting an absolutely perfectly smooth face shave with just this. It&#x27;s hard to best a manual razor. The shave I get from this though is definitely satisfactory; plenty smooth enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;---Though I got it for free, I feel like this may be a bit expensive at it&#x27;s current price ($105 or so)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other notes: When shaving my legs, The secondary trimmer worked very well at cutting through leg hair, though it wasn&#x27;t anything too thick. And while the trimmer didn&#x27;t give a closer shave than the foil head, it was still very effective. For some reason, using the foil head on my legs didn&#x27;t work too well. I was using a shaving gel, and in the shower, so I feel like the wet elements may have prevented the foil head from getting as close as possible. Maybe I just need to press harder with the razor though. Still, while not replacing my basic Gilette Fusion razor for hard to reach places and super smooth shaves, this very quickly became my new favorite tool for shaving pretty much all other body hair on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, extremely solid product. If you&#x27;re looking for a good, multi-use product for managing pretty much all your body hair needs, this is an extremely convenient, simple, and effective shaver. It probably won&#x27;t replace your razor blades entirely, but I&#x27;ll be consistently using this shaver for a long time because of how effective, easy and convenient it is to use.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver free as a sample from Bzzagent.com.  But this is my HONEST review.  I haven&#x27;t bought an electric razor in over 10 years because they have NEVER given me a close shave.  But let me tell you...  This razor is AMAZING when used wet with a shave FOAM.  Not so much with a cream or gel.  Using it dry is comparable to using a regular razor dry.  It still gets close but it&#x27;s just not the same.  Either way.  This product has changed the way I think and feel about electrics.  With only a 45 minute charge time and an hour worth of battery power this thing is great.  This sideburns trimmer even managed to give a close clean shave.  I don&#x27;t think I will be using my plain razor again, unless this wonderful contraption breaks on me.  Seriously I&#x27;m so amazed that I got it free, but if I had known how awesome it was I would have quickly put up the dough for this!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Braun WaterFlex 2 free thanks to Braun.  The WaterFlex 2 gives me as close a shave as the other brand electric shaver that I have been using for years.  The shaving head on the WaterFlex 2 does not heat up like the electric razor I was using.  I did not experience the usual razor burn that I got from my previous electric razor.  After using the WaterFlex 2, I did not have to use a soothing shaving balm as I did after using my previous electric razor.  The WaterFlex 2 did not pull my hair like my previous razor.  The one thing that I really like about the WaterFlex 2 is that it can be used dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it dry so I could compare it to my current electric razor, and found that it shave just as well as the razor I have been using.  I then tried it using shaving cream, and it worked just as well using shaving cream as it did dry.  Next, I tried it in the shower, and it works just as well in the shower.  The WaterFlex 2 is easy to clean as well; all you have to do is just rinse it off under the faucet.  I really like the fact that the WaterFlex 2 is fully charged and ready to go in one hour, and the two LED display lights for the status of the battery.  When the razor is in use, the charging light will flash green, and when the batter is getting low, the second light will flash red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature of the WaterFlex 2 I like over my previous electric razor is the swivel shaving head, which lets the razor adapt to the contour of my face, jaw line, and chin providing me with even shave.  I also like having the long hair trimmer included on the razor, which makes it easy to trim up sideburns.  I did not experience any nicks from the shaving head or the long hair trimmer.  This electric razor can be used at home or on the go.  I would highly recommend the WaterFlex 2 to anyone.  Thank you Braun for providing me with this amazing electric razor to try free, in the future I will be purchasing Braun products instead of theother brands.</li>
    <li> I got to try out this shaver free thanks to Braun and I must say the Waterflex 2 wet and dry shaver does exactly as it says. I was skeptical about the working in the water part so I tested it by shaving as soon as I go out of the shower and it got me clean shaven in no time. With this though you obviously cant have a soaking wet face or it will have troubles but if you dry your face off a little I have never had a bad shave by doing that. Also it claims to have a battery life of 45 minutes and a charge time of an hour and for the most part those times are about right(my tests ended up a little lower). As for the comfort this shaver has not cut my skin yet and I&#x27;ve done quite a few shaves with it now. The shaver bends perfectly with the shape of your face and that&#x27;s that. Also with my old shaver I would have to go back and reshave parts that my shaver missed but so far with this shaver it does it the first time every time which really saves time and blew my mind. So overall I would highly recommend this product, it looks nice, feels nice, gets the job done, and saves you time as well as making your face shine!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was given the opportunity to try it out by BzzAgent and Braun.  The packaging is pretty nice for a shaver.  It was very easy to unpackage which is always nice.  As soon as you get it out of the box, you know it is a quality product.  The feel is great.  The rubber sides provide really good grip in dry or wet conditions.  The lighting for charging is very easy to see and placed in a convenient spot.  A cool feature with this shaver is the trimmer.  Very easy to use by just sliding up the trimmer feature.  For a trimmer, it gets pretty close which I really like.  The shaver does a great job.  You go over an area once and it has it shaved perfectly. The shower feature is really great too.  It is nice to have a shaver like this.  It works just as well in the shower as it does out.  I use this daily and really like it.  I would recommend this to anybody all day long!</li>
    <li> Not going to lie this Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver that I received free From Bzzagent.com for free is killer. If you’re interested in finding out how to get hooked up with free products that you keep after you get them and test them go check out bzzagent.com it’s easy to sign up fill out a couple surveys to let them know what stuff you like and things you like to do, after that check back for more surveys daily to complete. Before you know it you&#x27;ll be getting asked to try products. But back to the razor, out of the box I hooded it up to charge and in less the 45 minutes it was ready to go. It is very light weight and slim in your hand but is a very solid product. It gets a close shave in or out of the shower. It also is very easy to clean not too many parts to take off and loose in the cleaning process. Being able to use it in the shower in the morning saves time. I would recommend this razor to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> When I first took the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver out of the box, I was somewhat skeptical of the quality. At first glance, the light blue accent pieces on the handle seem cheap and inexpensive, and holding it in my hand, the razor felt too light to be of any quality. But after giving it some time, I was quite impressed with the usability and closeness of the shave... and I discovered that what I had assumed was &amp;#34;poor craftsmanship&amp;#34; was actually an intentional design decision which allowed this razor to be used both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the first time I have used a &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; type razor, I was not sure what to expect. I found that it contoured nicely to the curves of my neck and cut much closer than the &amp;#34;rotary&amp;#34; type razor I was used to. I used to have many little &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34; which were near impossible to remove (unless I made repeated passes which inevitably left my skin feeling irritable). Instead, the Braun WaterFlex 2 did a great job on the first or second pass and to my surprise I experienced no irritability upon changing to this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my only complaint (and the reason I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars) is that the Braun WaterFlex 2 has limited storage for the removed hairs. I am used to cleaning out my razor after many uses, however this razor left small bits of hair in my sink after each shave which needed to be cleaned each time. A minor annoyance for me, but for someone with more facial hair, this could definitely become a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Allows both wet and dry shave&lt;br /&gt;+ Does a good job of contouring to the shape of your face allowing a close shave&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a good, long-lasting battery (have not needed to recharge yet since first charging it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The charge itself has a large head which could not fit in my bathroom due to the proximity of the outlet to the mirror; this was an annoyance, but I have found this issue to be true with most razors&lt;br/&gt;- The razor does not retain the shaved hair; this means cleaning out your sink after every shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was provided the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver through BzzzAgent in order to do a review on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for the past 2 weeks on a daily basis, I have somehow thick facial hair, with that said, it handles most of my shaving with no problems, it does struggle with some specific areas of my beard, I have to keep shaving and shaving, this gives me a minor rash, I have sensitive skin but overall it&#x27;s a great product, build quality is top notch, love the spiral cable and the cleaning is a breeze.  It has become and probably will continue being my daily shaver, blows my old Remington out of the water.  Thanks to Braun and Bzzagent for letting me try this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterflex for free thanks to Braun.  The dry shave was great, the wet shave was even better.  Shaver feels heavy at first, but is made of quality parts.  The heavy feel gives you assurance of a quality purchase.  I will be using it for a ling time.  Thanks for a quality shaver, Braun</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver. I got to try the product for free thanks to Braun and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. The first time I tried this razor was for a dry shave and I it got my face unbelievably smooth. I had a full beard and the trimmer took it close enough to where the head took care of the rest. My face felt like I had a razor shave afterward. The best part was that I didn&#x27;t need any shaving cream, and there was no razor burn afterward. I liked being able to take it in the shower as well, but without a mirror in my shower, shaving is difficult. My skin was smooth in the parts I could get to, but in order to shape my facial hair, I need a mirror. Because of the ease, speed, and fact that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> I tried out the Braun WaterFlex Wet Dry Shaver  for free thanks to Braun and was definitely excited to give it a try. After using it for three weeks, I decided I had enough information to write my review. I have used electric shavers in the past, and have never been impressed. However immediately I was struck by the swivel head design of this shaver. Another added bonus was the light weight design of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I used the waterflex both in and out of the shower, and found I got better results when wet. I had to shave longer when using the shaver dry, and occasionally got a little tug. The rubber design also makes it super easy to hold while in the shower, which is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;The pop up sideburn trim is the easiest I&#x27;ve ever used on an electric razor. And neither left me with any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;What might be the downside of this razor is it likely won&#x27;t ever give you a super close shave. You won&#x27;t ever feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind after using this, and to achieve that would still need to use your regular razor. However, the rustic cattle driver five&#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow is easily attained and maintained with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I have not been impressed with the battery life. Generally I find that I need to charge it every other day, even though I only use it briefly. It still works well for daily use however. Also, cleaning the razor seems to be a bit of a hassle with many pieces to reassemble after a thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterflex provided by Braun and BzzAgent for review for a month, so I think I have a good handle on this shaver&#x27;s performance. Basically, I think it shaves exactly the same as my last Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did three series of running tests, dry, wet, and wet with shaving foam. Dry, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Waterflex and any other shaver--it&#x27;s really hard to get little hairs that lie at odd angles, and it&#x27;s somewhat uncomfortable. I seem to recall Braun stating in their instructions for a different shaver that it would take a while for your face to get used to it, but I never found that to be true and besides--I really don&#x27;t think I should have to adapt to an appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet was trouble. It wasn&#x27;t any more comfortable than dry, and even on less than 24 hours of stubble, it seemed to have a really hard time cutting smoothly. I think the foil was sort of binding up through friction (cohesion?) with my skin and skipping, so I couldn&#x27;t cover my face smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with foam, however, was great. The shave quality wasn&#x27;t changed, so I still had trouble getting really close and catching oddball hairs, but with the (Nivea for men) foam I use, it was magnificently comfortable, more so than shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the ergonomics, the pivoting head and smaller body make it easy and comfortable to handle. The attractive rubber grip is particularly great, it&#x27;s easy to hold onto even when wet and slippery, and so far it&#x27;s helped me not knock it off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what battery life is like, I never ran it down. It has Braun&#x27;s typical excellent construction and easy cleaning. I&#x27;ve dropped all my Braun shavers many times and never had one break, and I&#x27;d expect this one to be just as durable, especially with the rubberized body. I might worry a little about the head snapping off, but if you don&#x27;t hurl one at the floor, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a great electric shaver for about two decades now. I grow a lot of beard, fast, and I end up not shaving as often as I should, plus razor blades are expensive. Braun is clearly the leader of the pack, but at least for me, still can&#x27;t replace a blade. If it shaved as close as one, it would be a complete no-brainer, because shaving wet with foam feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if electric shavers work for you, you want this shaver. If you&#x27;re like me, with a craggy face covered with boar bristles, then you&#x27;ll probably continue on with your fruitless search, forever.ard, fast, and I end up not shaving as often as I should, plus razor blades are expensive.

    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I have been using wet dry shavers for the last fifteen years and this was my third braun brand wet/dry shaver. Unfortunately, this was nothing but disappointment. My beard feels like this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used electric shaver and it has been like this for the last three weeks. I am about to throw it in the garbage and use my old braun series 3 that I had bought two years ago. It still shaves better than this new one!</li>
    <li> This was a good quick razor. I used it dry. It did not give nearly as close as of shave as i was expecting. but it was a quick and clean shave i will keep using it</li>
    <li> This was my very first electric shaver and i couldn&#x27;t believe that it was Braun.  I just received this in the mail today, powered it up and was ready to take on my horrendous beard. This shaver cut my hair with a breeze and i have to say, i have pretty thick facial hair.  It was able to cut the corners of my chin, jaw and neck easily! I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was waterproof too! I took it in the shower with me and the handling was nice and tight. It has a very nice handling grip, so it could never slip away. When i finished shaving, i was absolutely amazing by how close this shaver cut my hair. My face was smooth and refreshing!  Given the fact, that I am able to choose to use this dry or wet sets this shaver apart from the rest. It cuts so perfect, wet or dry! I love how it gives you an LED display on how charged your battery is and the fact that it is a li-ion battery. The trimmer always comes in handy when trimming my beard or side-burns so thats always a plus! It&#x27;s super light weight and can trim through anything. This product was giving to me for free to test out by Braun, so thank you so much Braun!</li>
    <li> I received a Braun WaterFlex to try from Braun as part of a Bzzagent trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I did upon receiving my Braun was to read the instructions. It states very clearly that the Braun will work best with dry skin and hair, which I thought very odd for a razor labeled as wet/dry. So I did my trial dry on one side of my face, and wet for the other. It was pretty obvious that the dry side did shave better with less stubble remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have used an electric shaver for many years as I travel for work and it is helpful to have something that I can use quickly. I usually have to be wary of razor burn with and electric razor, because most razors will pull hair while trying to cut it, and it creates lots of irritation. I am happy to report that I have not experienced that pull and burn that other electrics razors have delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shave, but using it wet isn&#x27;t the best option, but it is an option.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you with a super smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t hurt you at all.&lt;br /&gt;It can reach places where a normal unadvanced razor wouldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I&#x27;m willing to tell all my friends about it so that they can have the same clean experience that I had.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d like to make a HUGE shoutout to BzzAgent and brAun for providing me this amazing product</li>
    <li> I received this shaver free from Braun to test it out. It worked better than my razor offering a smoother shave without any nicks or discomfort in a third of the time. This shaver is fully waterproof and even offers a great shave in the shower. I also like the trimmer blade on the back for longer hairs.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Braun for letting me try this great product out. Fast and great shave. Way better than my other brand.</li>
    <li> I have been a rotary head razor user since I started shaving 10+ years ago. I tried foil razors once back then and didn&#x27;t like them. However, when Braun wanted to send me a free razor through BzzAgent to try out, I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have always had issues with bad razor burn, especially around my jaw line and neck. I have been using this razor for a week now, and have had next to no razor burn, which shocked me. I also get a slightly closer shave than with my old rotary. While I have only used this razor dry, I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well wet. The only downside is it takes a little longer to shave in the mornings, especially on Mondays when I haven&#x27;t shaved for 2 days. But a few extra minutes shaving is a small price to pay for the lack of burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those who have the razor burn issues like I had. Thank you Braun!!</li>
    <li> I currently use a Braun series 5, which I thoroughly enjoy. The Braun WaterFlex is nearly identical when it comes to getting the clean, perfect shave. I love that I can use it wet or dry, it makes a great second shaver when I run out of product and am too lazy to go out and get some. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to adjust the sensitivity as I have a fairly sensitive face, which is why I can&#x27;t use straight razors. Even so, I&#x27;ve never felt that it ate away at my face and it has always left me happy with its performance. Highly recommended! Best part of this product: I received this as a free promotion through BzzAgent.com.</li>
    <li> First off, thanks to Braun for letting me try this razor for free. I&#x27;ve owned 4 different Braun electric razors in the past and have always enjoyed the quality close shave that only a Braun razor can deliver.  The Braun water flex is great because you can use it dry, wet, and with shaving gel. I&#x27;m not a shower shaver but I was interested in using the shaving gel with the shaver. I found that using less shaving gel is better because the shaver can get clogged and gummed up. Frequent rinsing of the shaver can alleviate this. I have sensitive skin and rough stubble and frequently get cut using standard razors so I was pleasantly surprised with the close smooth shave I got using shaving gel. The dry shave was good as well. Overall I think the Waterflex is a quality shaver with good battery life, close shave and can easily be cleaned. The only negative I have is that the shaver didn&#x27;t come with a case. Cheaper Braun models I&#x27;ve owned have had cases which are nice for travel.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun WaterFlex Wet Dry Shaver about a month ago to try out for free thanks to Braun and was definitely excited to give it a try.  I wanted to take some time using it on a regular basis before I wrote this review in order to really run it thru the paces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used electric shavers in the past, but never been overly impressed with them due to bulk or the relatively cheap quality feel they have.  However, after receiving the WaterFlex my thoughts around electric shavers have definitely changed for the better.  The WaterFlex has great ergonomics from its rubber coated body for easy grip and relatively small design.  I never had a problem holding onto this shaver while using it in the shower or in front of the sink.  Its lightweight and compact design made it great for travel as it didn&#x27;t take up much room (or add much weight) to my Toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, many of the electric shavers I’ve had in the past left me with notoriously bad razor burn after using them as they hacked away at my face.  I can say for sure, that with the WaterFlex that is not a problem, as I’ve not needed to use any lotion of any kind after I shave with it.  The sideburn trimmer on the WaterFlex is great too, it’s easy to activate and trims on the first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative thing I can say about it is that after using blades for so long, I’m very accustomed to getting every hair on the first pass.  Perhaps it’s the nature of the foil design or perhaps the contour of my face and neck, but I find myself having to go back over the same area a few times to get all the ‘whiskers’ that it missed on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this is a shaver I’ll be using for quite a while and will enjoy using.  Thanks again Braun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Doesn&#x27;t cut up your face or leave your skin feeling irritated&lt;br /&gt;• Light weight, and fairly compact... great for travel or on the go&lt;br /&gt;• Battery life is solid even when just sitting in the drawer for a week without charging&lt;br /&gt;• No slip rubber Grip&lt;br /&gt;• Waterproof.  No worries about using it around water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;• Need to shave some areas multiple times to get every &#x27;whisker&#x27;st sitting in the drawer for a week without charging&lt;br /&gt;• No slip rubber Grip&lt;br /&gt;• Waterproof.  No worries about using it around water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;• Need to shave some areas multiple times to get every &#x27;whisker&#x27;</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great price compared to local retailers. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For nearly 20 years, ever since my dad informed me that the bad teenage mustache had to go I have only used rotary electric shavers. That is where I come from to this experience of trying the Braun WaterFlex 2 (which I got for free, thanks guys). I&#x27;ve read that this type of shaver (foil) is supposed to be faster and shave closer, this is what I thought of it: Is it faster? Sorry but I can&#x27;t give a definitive answer on that. It might be, but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable to me...maybe if I tried timing it but that kind of a small difference doesn&#x27;t affect me. Does it shave closer? I think it does, particularly in the places I have the most trouble with below my chin on my neck. So far anyway, I haven&#x27;t finished shaving and noticed that sandpaper stubble feel. What I really like though, is that I can use it dry and not feel like I raked off layers of skin. For quite a few years now I&#x27;ve used my rotary electrics wet only because of how raw my face felt if I used it dry (which is my preference). I do not get that raw feeling with this so I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very good electric razor by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried . Good price and quality for what your getting . Highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a good and smooth shave .</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. i have VERY sensitive skin, i always breakout and have red irritated skin after shaving but with this razor i didn&#x27;t have any of that, and being able to shave dry or with cream is an awesome feature! I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close comfortable shave and a reliable razor. I cant thank braun enough for sending this to me to try out! they completely changed my life!</li>
    <li> Got this to try this for free thanks to Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry ! This razor gives you a clean close shave either wet or dry. I am now hooked on this as my favorite razor.  It is convenient and works well. My face is smooth to the touch. #Bzzagent</li>
    <li> Thank you to Braun for providing me with this product for free to test out especially since I am a first time user for a wet electric razor. I have used other foil shavers and trimmers in the past, but nothing as well crafted as this. My first use was wet with shaving gel. I really enjoyed using the long hair trimmer. It was efficient and much easier to use than other trimmers I have had in the past. The trimmer worked quickly without nicking my skin at all. I was hesitant at first to use the shaver with shaving gel, but was amazed at how easy and smooth it worked. I did have some difficulty around my Adam&#x27;s apple and under my jawline, but I do believe that has to do with me getting used to the razor and my naturally sensitive skin. Overall, the product is high quality and easy to use and clean. The product is well made and the grip makes it easy to get a handle even when wet using shave gel or in the shower. With the cost of razor cartridges increasing and the quality of monthly subscriptions in question, this product is a no brainer. I have tried all of the other types of manual razors and now do not think I will ever go back - not when the electric is just as simple to use.</li>
    <li> Super clean/smooth shave! Very impressed. I really don&#x27;t know where to begin.. The design and technology of the WF2 is remarkable. Being waterproof makes its so much easier for me to shave in the shower with ease of cleaning. Being able to shave so well dry is something I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed about, as sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush. A+ shaver, from the battery life to the swiveling head. Very much appreciate Braun sending me the WaterFlex 2 to test. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver free thanks to Braun! However, I was not very impressed. It was a very average razor. The positives were it worked the same both wet and dry which allowed for a very versatile razor. It felt very smooth along my face and did not cause any razor burn or irritation. It was flexible and cordless. However, the bad news was the shaver did not cut or collect the hair very well. I had to keep going over and over the same areas before I finally got a clean cut. This was tedious and disappointing. Also, it barely collected the hair at all leaving for a nice mess of hair to clean up. Overall this razor was very average and did not live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was provided the Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver through BzzzAgent’s to do a review on it.  Razor arrived in retail packaging as I would expect to find it on the shelf.  Box design was clean with good product pictures and plenty of information without over doing it or making the box too busy.  Downside to the packaging is the razor comes cradled in Styrofoam.  I’d much rather see recyclable material like cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;Read through the brief Multilanguage instruction sheet for info on charging.  Initial charge was done quite quick as indicated by the LED’s on the front showing charging status.  While using the razor the LED again shows batteries charge status.&lt;br /&gt;I typically shave with a higher end Norelco with the crazy three head cutter.  I’m a very big fan of my daily shaver (which is also a wet/dry model).  While I am not a fan of shaving in the shower, I did find that the Braun did a better job than expected when I tried it in the shower.  If you are a fan of shaving in the shower then this razor is for you!  Dry performance I didn’t feel like it did as good of a job as my daily shaver.  Over the weekend I used the Braun exclusively, and after each shave in the morning I felt like it was close, but not quite as smooth.  In fact yesterday and today prior to leaving for work I did a quick few passes across my face with the Norelco for the smooth feel.  Overall it’s a good razor, if I were a shower shaver then this would be the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun also has a trimmer/groomer built in, which is a nice function.  My daily shaver, I have to swap heads on, which is a real pain.  With the Braun, I push the trimmer up, even out the side burns, clean up the goatee as well as mustache and never turn the unit off.  Once I got used to the trimmers I think they actually do a better job of trimming than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Pluses&lt;br /&gt;+Great wet shave&lt;br /&gt;+Great Trimmers&lt;br /&gt;+Seems to have a good battery life&lt;br /&gt;+Quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses&lt;br /&gt;-Good, not great, dry shave&lt;br /&gt;-Odd shaped, large charger, you won’t plug anything in next to it&lt;br /&gt;-Non Recyclable interior packaging</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver in Blue to try for Free thanks to Braun and I LOVE it. I don&#x27;t normally like electric shavers because they tend to pull but this one works great! I recommend it to everyone I talk to. I use it 2-3 times a week and my wife loves how it is a close shave. Thanks Braun for allowing me to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> Thanks  to Braun for providing me with this product for free to test. I use to use a different electric shaver but I will definitely be using this one from now on. I normally use this shaver dry but I have tried it in the shower and it works well there as well.  The long hair trimmer works well and doesn’t bother my skin at all. I have sensitive skin and this shaver does not bother my skin at all.  I normally have a lot of difficulty with shavers on my neck but this razor performed way better than any I have used in the past.  Cleaning is a breeze, the foil just pops off and a quick rinse under water does the trick.  I am very happy with this razor and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Braun I have been able to try this new WaterFlex 2 and it works amazing. I had only been using it dry to find out how it worked and now using it in the shower it passed the test and my head is so smooth and it took no time at all. Thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> This foil shaver WaterFlex has done amazing job. Even with your facial hair is longer stubs, with whip shaving cream added to face, rinse blade every so strokes to face, it&#x27;ll give a clean cut just like any true hand razor. Now I just got to get rid of my habits of using a razor for there is no need when I have the WaterFlex. Braun has done a wonderful job on this model compare to their others. As for the dry shave, I just not a fan of it. But with shaving cream, it&#x27;s great. Also even when I shave with the WaterFlex,  my fave stays clean from stubs just as long as it does with a hand razor. So a great product. I got this product from BzzAgent and whst a great place to be! Thank you</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try from Braun, via BzzAgent. Like other shavers, the WaterFlex shaver performs a very neat, close shave. I have tried the product, as recommended, dry (before a shower) and wet (after a shower), and have had positive results both times. What makes the WaterFlex unique is the push-up grooming tool. Most of the shavers I have used in the past, have only performed one function, shaving, and a grooming tool would need to be purchased separately. This one contains both, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shaver also lasts quite long after being charged. I think I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice within the last 2.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I absolutely love it.  It provides a smooth shave with the convenience of shaving in the shower.  The versatility of a good wet/dry foil shaver leaves you with a clean smooth shave that you will love.</li>
    <li> I was selected by BzzAgent to try the Braun Waterflex shaver. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and have used several different electric shavers over the years. All of them have ripped my hairs out and given me razor burn except this one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with its performance and would recommend it to anyone that wants a close comfortable shave with no razor burn. Thanks BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> if there is a case for the Braun Waterflex shaver , i will give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I have really course facial hair and I knew this Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry shaver would be in for a challenge.  I had 2 day stubble and tried the razor dry, wet, and with lathered shave gel.  I felt I had more control and a smoother shave using the shaver dry.  When the shaver and my face were wet, the shaver seemed to slip and I had to go over areas multiple times.  Same thing happened with the lathered shave gel.  In the end, I ended up using my usual multiple blade razor and got the smooth shave I am used to.  Overall I believe this shaver has great features but an electric shaver still cant get as close as a traditional razor.  I will continue to use this shaver for many other grooming needs.  Thanks to Braun for letting me try this product for free.</li>
    <li> Closest shave of all the foil razors i have ever used.  I am still more in favor of a multi blade shave, but when time is of the essence, this is a great razor. It is super ergonomic, charges quickly, and very convenient since you can use it wet or dry. This will be what i pack in my overnight bag for an upcoming vacation. Safer in the bag and just as efficient for vacation.  not as close as a blade shave, but still a great great razor. Thank you braun for the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric razor i have ever used...so far. I have been using electric razors on and off for about 8 years now, some were good, and some were just cheap and bad. But this Braun wet/dry razor is the best. most razors i had would leave stubble, and most times it was very noticeable. With this razor, i can use it with water and it leaves my face smooth, free of stubble. Even in a rush on my way to work or right before i walk into my work place, i look like i just got my face shaved at a salon with a straight razor. The charging time is way better than my ex-razors. I&#x27;ve only charged it twice since i started using it and after using it every 2-3 days since then, it still has charge.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to every male at my job, and even friends that like a clean shaven look. So, i think its safe to say I found a new brand to buy in the future for myself and for gifts. And the price.. way lower then most big brand name electric razors.  Thank you Braun. And I&#x27;d also like to thank Braun for letting me try this product for free, but in no way did that reflect my review because this is an awesome shaver.  My girlfriend thanks you too.</li>
    <li> After receiving a free sample of the Braun Waterflex 2 Wet and Dry shaver from Braun I quickly put it to the test.  It works really well dry, however, it does not shave as well wet.  When I shaved wet with soap I had to go over the same areas a few times so the shave was not as quick but it was still a good close shave and being able to shave in the shower makes the extra time worth it.  I really like the close shave and it is the only electric razor I have ever used that did not knick my skin or leave it chafed.  I used to only shave once a week but since using this razor I&#x27;ve changed to twice a week.  It is just so easy to use and I love being able to shave dry.  It is also very easy to clean.  I just click the top off and rinse it off.  My only real criticism is that the plug in is a little bulky.  Not a huge deal but when travelling it takes up a little more room than I would like.</li>
    <li> I received this produce free from Braun to try out.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  After years and years of trying and then giving up on electric razors I&#x27;ve finally found one that won&#x27;t rip up my neck with razorburn.  I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry, both work well.  I do prefer to use it dry with some of that alcohol based preshave lotion.  Fantasticly smooth, comfortable and best of all razor burn free!  I&#x27;m finally able to enjoy the convenience of an electric razor!</li>
    <li> This twin-foil wet/dry razor has been a vast improvement over my rotary shaver.  The twin-foil design provides a closer shave that traces the contour of my skin better than before.  I find that I seldom need to use a straight razor as a result because of how close this razor shaves, which is a surprise because I used to need the straight razor regularly.  Although the razor is still quite new, the battery life appears to be very long, probably because of its lithium ion battery.  It works well in the wet setting, although I haven&#x27;t really used the wet setting too often because the dry setting is more than sufficient and I don&#x27;t need to go through the extra step of having it wet.  That said, its flexibility has allowed me to multi-task more and take it into the shower if needed.  Definitely a time saver.  Thanks to Braun for letting me try the product for free.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the new Braun WaterFlex 2 Wet and Dry Shaver. It gives such a close and even shave. I like that I can use it wet or dry, making shaving easy and convient at any time. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this razor doesn&#x27;t turn my face red or make me breakout. It gives me a close shave, without any nasty razor bumps. I also like the technology behind the razor as well, by letting you know with the green and red lights rather you need to charge it or not. The razor also contours to the angle your shaving at making it so less nicks or cuts happen. I would highly recommend the Braun razor. I have tried many different razors, but this one stands in a class of its&#x27; own.  Note: I am writing this from my wife&#x27;s profile. I was given this product from Braun for free in exchange for my HONEST opinion.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun WaterFlex 2 electric razor in the mail free from Braun to try. I have been using it daily and I am amazed at how close the shave is and how soft my face is.  I have used many other electric razors in the past, however I thought that I was cursed with a life of scruffiness because I have such a sensitive face.  I would never use the razors long term because I would get ingrown hairs.  I have tried other products but never a Braun with those other razors I would still get razor burn and would be reaching for the bandaids.  The shave that I receive from this razor is just as close as what I would get with a safety razor with five or six blades.  I have the closest shave and my wife loves it.  I can use it daily with shaving cream or lotion and I still do not get razor burn. I have to use it daily since I am part wooly mammoth, lol, that is according to my wife.  The battery lasts a long time and it is nice that I am able to use it in the bath or shower.  It takes the pain out of shaving for me, literally and figuratively.  It is also great that I am able to remove the head after each use and clean it to keep it sharp and working properly.  The casing of the razor is also nice, it is non slip and easy to hold on to, overall I would give it five stars and I have suggested it to a few people.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a promotion through BzzAgent. I think it does a pretty good job of getting a close shave. I have a very thick beard and it can tend to pull once and a while if I am moving too fast. But all and all it is a very nice unit and I do like that can be used both wet and dry.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun WaterFlex 2 free of charge thanks to Braun and BzzAgent. My mission was simple: test out the razor and submit a review. I love free so naturally I was in.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for a few weeks now and I have to admit, even if it wasn&#x27;t free, I&#x27;d still love this razor.  It&#x27;s a very attractive looking razor, wrapped in very bright blue treatment and with a very ergonomic feel in the hand. It&#x27;s very lightweight yet still feels very solid. It doesn&#x27;t have that cheap plastic feel that some lesser razors do. Now on to the function; this thing performs flawlessly. I previously relied on a cheapo razor from another brand which I won&#x27;t mention here, let&#x27;s just say that one has placed in the round file.  I&#x27;ve used the Braun in both wet and dry configurations and was pleased with it&#x27;s performance in both environments. This thing really excels when used in the shower with some shaving cream though. I was able to get as close of a shave this way as I can with my multi-blade manual razor, all while in the convenience of my shower.  The WaterFlex is also great for getting in a quick dry shave and the built in pop-up trimmer is great for getting detailed areas such as sideburns or beards/goatees. I would highly recommend the Braun WaterFlex 2 to anyone looking to step up their shave game, save some time, or just looking to enjoy your shaving experience more.</li>
