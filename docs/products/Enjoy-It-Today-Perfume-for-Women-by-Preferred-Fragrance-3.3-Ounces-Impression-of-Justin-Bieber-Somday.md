    <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t wanna spend all my money on crustin dweeber but I loved the smell of his girl perfume. So! I got the impression! And it smells great! I wish it would last a bittttt longer but I shouldn&#x27;t even complain cause it was a great price! I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Item came in secured nicely, no damage, everything was good and I def enjoyed the product, the perfume is a nice fruity smell and lasts for AGES. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This item smells better than the real thing. When you spray it you are blasted with sweetness - so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweet this isn&#x27;t for you. I was in the mall today and compared it to the real thing, and in my opinion its much better -real someday smells like alcohol initially and this doesn&#x27;t... It&#x27;s just not quite as long lasting. It is also sweeter, almost like a cotton candy type of smell mixed with fruits and then florals. For the price point you can&#x27;t beat it. Wish they made a lotion so it could be layered.</li>
    <li> Really like that this perfume smells just like the actual Bieber perfume....  the bottle is very cute!! The price is wonderful and the fragrance is awesome.</li>
    <li> I did a side by side comparison of the original \\&quot;SOMEDAY\\&quot; fragrance by Justin Bieber and this \\&quot;ENJOY IT! TODAY!\\&quot; fragrance by Preferred Fragrances and I was pleasantly surprised by the result. On first spray, the impression fragrance did not smell anything like the original but as it dried down to the sweet and playful scent of \\&quot;SOMEDAY\\&quot;, it did smell like it and it had a staying power, too.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is wonderful and I do smell the notes of red berries and pear and not too much of its floral notes. It&#x27;s a beautiful combination of sweet and fruity notes with a dry down scent of vanilla and slight hint of musk, very youthful!  It&#x27;s a superb value!</li>
    <li> I love this bottle unfortunately, this triggered my allergies.Major sneeze fest and an instant migraine.I am sure others will love it unfortunately, I was gifted with a sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a Christmas present, and I have been told that they really love it. It smells just like, Justin Bieber&#x27;s Someday. I am so glad that&lt;br /&gt;I gave this perfume a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You, Amazon</li>
    <li> love love love this scent ... for the price it a great buy,, mild and stays on u for a considerable amount of time</li>
    <li> I found this at the dollar store for 3 $ dollars , its not a big deal I wear it for gym the smell goes fast</li>
    <li> I gave it two stars only because I received it on time. I got my package with a big hole in the box! I also received this package with perfume leaking out... The outside of the perfume bottle was slimy and the flower on top was scratched up. Other reviews made it sound like this perfume would smell like cotton candy and I can honestly say I&#x27;m disappointed. This is the worst smelling perfume I have ever received. It smells lmusky and like mildew.</li>
