<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful colors, excellent color payoff. Comparable to the pro expensive palettes that are out there. Great for anyone starting with make up or someone that is already really good at make up!</li>
    <li> Price and shipping was excellent.  Cheaper than ordering direct from the manufacture and surprisingly got here a few days before the estimated shipping date.  Product is a little chalkier than I like (creates a lot of loose powder), but the colors are true to skin once applied.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> I Like BH Cosmetics 10 Color, it´s what I need in my make up bag.   Comfortable to have 10 different colors in same box, it&#x27;s easy to hold it. I really recommended it. You don´t need to buy more blushed you have the most used colors in this palette.</li>
    <li> This item is fakeee don&#x27;t buy it, it don&#x27;t even have the BH cosmetic logo and the make u smell cheap.</li>
    <li> Its a really awesome palette. I was expecting a pinky purple from the picture, but I was let down. Its okay though. There&#x27;s a variety of colors for different skin tones. Comes in handy when I&#x27;m doing someone else&#x27;s makeup. Oh yeah! I like the coral blush too. Its super cute.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the buy! These are some great blush colors.  Perfect for traveling.  Also, the colors are super pigmented!! Excellent prices for BH Cosmetics!! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Good vareity in this pallete.I like all the colors.Almost all of them still show up the same pink on me.But they didnt break my face out if you have sentive skin like me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great products to use in your professional kit or just to start your make up collection. It gives you a variety of colors to play with without have to buy 10 single blushers</li>
    <li> I received the blush pallete with not one color brocken. I love how it applies on the skin. It stays true to the color you see. It has great pigmentation. I definatley reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the pigment &amp; product.  The reason I rated it so low was because 4 of the pots arrived broken and the colors polluted the other still in tact.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  Which is a shame because I really like BH Cosmetics. The care &amp; preperation for shipping should just be reconsidered. As a result,  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I always need different kinds of blushes and my makeup bag is full of them so when I saw this I just had to have it. The shipment was ideal. It was covered in bubble wrap and none of the pallets were broken so that was good. All I can say about this item us perfect! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> this product is good as describe. I like it. the color is pretty. I use it every time I go out.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! MANY COLORS, VERY PIGMENTED, AND LONG LASTING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!! HAHA :)))) it&#x27;s a must have, I have no complains</li>
    <li> This palette has blushes with good pigmentation and great colors for highlight and contrast. I love the variety of the colors.. bold and classic. I used it for a photoshoot and the pictures looked great. I definetly would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, smooth to use and the colors are vibrant and there is a lot of variety. Very happy with this blush palette! The palette is a convenient size to carry as well!</li>
    <li> So glad I decided to get the BH blush Palette. I love all of their products but I was certain after i got the Concealer Palette this would be awesome as well.. I was right!!</li>
    <li> Love this palette! It&#x27;s good size and affordable to buy. Brand and drug store can still be expensive without coupons. With winter my skin tone is paler and I use the brighter lighter colors when getting ready. I use the darker colors during the Spring and Summer seasons. I mixed the colors to if I want to go with a much bolder tones. I recommend this to anyone that love wearing makeup and wants something that will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I am more than happy with my purchase. It arrived in good condition in a timely matter. The blushes are vibrant and at a great deal.</li>
    <li> Product came in one piece! Perfect! I love every single color in the palette! Colors are bight and stay on all day!</li>
    <li> The colors are highly pigmented and go on smoothly.  A little goes a long way.  Great purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> received the blush quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is fun and most of the colors are nice.  the light ones make my skin look sallow, but that is just cuz they are lighter than my skin.  for the price, it is a great value with everyday and some fun occasional blushes.  would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> it got to my house very fast! the colors are very bright, but they seem a little cheap. i didnt expect much to be honest, i just wanted the option of having more colors to use. if you want good quality makeup, dont get this. im going to use it anyway but i really hope i dont breakout from it. some colors are nice but some make you look like an old lady :l.. like the bright pink one. its still kind of cool to have though. but let me just say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
    <li> The quality of the blushes is great you can mix them or just use them for any type of make up. The shipping was fast overall great product</li>
    <li> Really beautiful colors, really nice sizes, the circles are not small at all. The case is really thin and beautiful, it reminded me of chocolate package. I bought several thing this month and this one was the first one to shipped.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette, good variety of colors for all skin tones. However I wished it had a little more red tone colors. Overall good palette</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant, it&#x27;s really pigmented, and depending on your mood you&#x27;ve got a blusher for each day. What makes it even better is the colors can double for contouring! No need for more blushers and contours besides the 10 shades here.</li>
    <li> This blush is so pigmented and I ordered it on January 2,2014 and got it at my door on January 3,2014 I love it you can even use some colors in the pallete  for contouring and some I can use to fill my brows in and I love the variety of blush colors they put in this pallete can not wait to try more BH Cosmetics products.</li>
    <li> You heard it. The colors arent very pigmented and its a very chalky palette. save your money and invest in a nicer brand,</li>
    <li> Love BH cosmetics! I bought a BH 120 eyeshadow palette a while back and fell in love with the brand. Great pigmentation. It says &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; pallet, but there are a few dark shades that I use for contouring.</li>
    <li> Some colors are a little but chalky, but over all great blush palette. I use this palette a lot. M</li>
    <li> I just opened the BH Cosmetic 10 Color Blush Palette. I was upset to see that it was broken. I didn&#x27;t even get to open the package because all the the broken brush. :( Sending it back!</li>
    <li> I love it.all the colors are pigmented and so pretty and it don&#x27;t break out your face.I love it Bh cosmetics is the truth.</li>
    <li> i love this i have had it for a while now and im still usung it but fot some reason it didn&#x27;t have the BHcosmetics logo on it tho. still a great product worth the money!</li>
    <li> Amazing pigmentation!!! Amazing cosmetics line as well! Use this brush palette and the entire BH Cosmetics line on my clients and it looks amazing! Buy this product! You will not be disappointed, as a makeup artist with 4 years of experience I promise you! I will be repurchasing this product!</li>
    <li> NOT VERY PIGMENTED... its okay... but you have to go over it a few times to get the color to show thru its also very chalky...not that satisfied plus it rubs off very easy...</li>
    <li> Love this blush palette! The colors are very pretty and pigmented. I read that others thought this was fake, but it said BH Comestics on my packaging/palette. The palette also arrived fully intact, no damage during the shipping process like I prepared myself for.</li>
    <li> The colors are really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;I used the brushes this morning and I&#x27;m amazed with the results!&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very THANKFUL I found BH COSMETICS.</li>
    <li> I brought this for the vibrant colors but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of pigmentation. But considering the price its a good buy.</li>
    <li> this set of blushes have no the quality of the BH products. Starting with the case and the product smell and texture, they all seems like a bad and cheap copy. I don&#x27;t recomend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup much and this is just what I needed for when I do. Like the colors and nice to on with my brush I use and blends well when using contract and darker color works good. not to dark or light.</li>
    <li> Blushes weren&#x27;t that pigmented, and I personally found many of the colors unflattering.  I just don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it.</li>
    <li> i loved this product the colors are so pigmented. you can mix and match these blushes for any type of skin tone and even use these colors to contour i have no negative coments whats so ever.</li>
    <li> For the price, this blush palette is really nice. Good pigmentation and color choice, and fairly long wear. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Building a Makeup Artist Kit and bought this hoping  this palette would meet most of my needs.  The palette exceeds expectations ;colors give the desired application and very versatile. Next blush purchase will have to be something awe inspiring because this goes all my needs.  Good starting point to build upon.</li>
    <li> This blush palette is PERFECT! It took a bit long to get here, but I live in Spain. It arrived perfectly packaged, protected and intact. The colors are so pigmented and beautiful! It&#x27;s definitely worth it&#x27;s price and has a good amount of good quality blush. You can mix the colors and create looks of your own. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and quality! Always happy with BH Cosmetics! They also make great gifts! I own an eye palette, a lip palette and this palette. Love them all!</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO BH COSMETICS NAME, NO BH COSMETICS BOX, NO NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;IM VERY UPSET. ACTUALLY, DOESNT HAVE A BRAND ON IT, ITS A BLACK BOX, NO LETTERS. THE COLORS ARE SO UGLY AND BAD QUALITY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aspiring makeup artist and I used to always focus on the eyes. After getting tips and tricks down for the eyes (using a bh cosmetics eye shadow palette) I decided I wanted to experiment with blush! And I love it. I will never regret this purchase! And the colors are amazing. There&#x27;s one for every skin tone along with one for every season :)</li>
    <li> all came at the appointed time and undamaged recommend&lt;br /&gt;everything was as I saw on page are respopnsable and fast deliveries</li>
    <li> I tried these out because of Carli beble (i know that is worng! sorry!) on youtube. As always her word holds strong, great product, great company. I would also recomend the BH eye shadow paletts as well, the 88 color neutral palette awesome as well.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. Colors show up really nice and for the price im very pleased. It can definitely be compared to more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Well  this was another gift for the lady, it has good color pigment stays on all day and don&#x27;t need to be reapplied, good selection of blending colors. She loved it!</li>
    <li> Love the mixture of shades you can do sooo much with them!! I use them all love the texture best product I seen in a while for its price .</li>
    <li> I ordered the BH cosmetics 10 Color Professional Blush Palette and received garbage instead. It is soooo obviously fake!!! The make up looks and smells cheap. No where on the packaging or the actual palette does it say BH Cosmetics. In fact, after looking at the case from an angle, I noticed that it said MAC. This seller is obviously in the business of selling make up lovers FAKE makeup!!! Do not buy from this seller unless you want trash!!!! I don&#x27;t even want to buy from Amazon again. They should not allow sellers to sell FAKE product. Soo disappointing.</li>
    <li> I really like this blush palette, granted my skin tone (I am dark skinned from the Caribbean)  may not allow me to use all the colours but it is not as bad as some reviewers on you tube indicated, and even the pix here do not do it justice, it feels so nice and creamy on my skin even though it is not a cream blush,  will buy this again BH does not disappoint</li>
    <li> I have never used bh cosmetics before, so I was very excited.You have all the colors you need for blush in one palette! Not extremely pigmented,but they look great on ANY SKINTONE! The palette comes with a bronzer,too:) LOVE THIS BLUSH PALETTE! Great price,too</li>
    <li> I love bh cosmetics! This is yet another great product- color saturation is intense but easily blendable. I would definitely but this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love how it&#x27;s so pigmented definitely going to be buying again</li>
    <li> Stays on- looks great.</li>
    <li> the powders just flake and it is hard to use... colors are great... wish now it was a cream set</li>
    <li> See my review for the specifc listing where I bought my blush. http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DAPS8GH3Q6OD  or [[ASIN:B00GUP5VMG BH Cosmetics 10 Color Blush Palette, Professional]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the quality and the longevity of the product is really good. I did get a broken blush that had broken blush powder everywhere, BUT I was able to fix it (I&#x27;m too impatient to send it back and order another). So if you&#x27;re like me head over to YouTube or Pinterest and search for DIY broken blush (or powder or eyeshadow) - you&#x27;ll need tissue, rubbing alcohol, something break the blush into dust powder and then to stir, and voila no more broken blush! I took pictures and I wish I could upload it and show you guys. I&#x27;m currently using the blush that was broken (but now fixed!) and it stills wears very nicely!</li>
    <li> i really like this palette. i am a dark skin girl and i love blush. i like to swich up my colors of blush depending on my outfit so this palette gives a variety of looks. will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I like the different arrays of colors in this palette, very cute.&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, I noticed that some of the colors were broken up so I was very sad.&lt;br /&gt;But I love this product, the blushes last all day.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this pallet I can jazz up my make up for any time of the year and any occasion with this. I have had it for a few months and I use it everyday and there is still plenty to use. I have not hit pan on any of the colors. it shipped nicely and well protected, I have nothing bad to say about, it is definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> While this palette is NOT bh, i still enjoy it. Mine did not have a chemical smell, none were broken, and all my are buttery soft and great pigmentation. It’s a knock off palette which i’m a bit unhappy about but overall the product is useable and nice. I would recommend for anyone just starting make up or who are looking for a decent blush palette</li>
    <li> product is not as pigmented as I thought it would be, also not all the sades show up on a medium - Mac NC40 skin tone (or maybe it&#x27;s just me). I usually like all BH cosmetics products but this one just didn&#x27;t blow me away. non the less it&#x27;s still nice and convenient to have options for when doing makeup on others!</li>
    <li> I just love this product and most importantly its very affordable!!</li>
    <li> All the colOrs are are ally nice, goes on well a d blends too! I want to buy not just to have a back up!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this. The colors are so pigmented it&#x27;s unbelievable. I figured since it was so cheap the product would be cheap but I was completely wrong. If you are thinking about getting this I would. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Amazing! The blushes are pigmented and look gorgeous on the skin, most being matte and some with a slight shimmer. The brown makes a decent contour shade for light to medium skin tones, and this palette literally has every colour you would ever need. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This palette has my favorite blushes, and contouring colors for the perfect face. The colors are well pigmented and would work for just about any complexion. A great value!</li>
    <li> Great colors that can be used for blush and/or contour. Was very surprised at how pigmented colors were. Color lasts all day! Great buy</li>
    <li> The shadows look nice. Good price for product. However I was not able to use it because they arrived in pieces. Couldnt use them. Had to send them back. I was so excited when I order them, I really liked them but I&#x27;m afraid to buy them again and just waist time having to return them when they arrive in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;What A Waist Of Time! I read a lot of reviews and the MAIN complaint is product not package correctly. Dust everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck getting it in one whole piece.</li>
