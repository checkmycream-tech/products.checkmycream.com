    <li> Great these as lil gifts for a Tea party, have had it as of yet, I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love it</li>
    <li> the ad was very misleading. I thought that I would be receiving the scrub and the overnight cream. It was all hand cream and nothing else. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got this item as a gift loved it !!! To bad it&#x27;s not avail in stores. Bought as much as I could find online. Anybody who loves scented lotion,I believe would love this!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is soo awesome and smells so great.  It will work to soften the driest of hands and the small mini creams fit in small wristlets or purses to bring with you anytime.</li>
    <li> Great condition and smells wonderful!! Very pleased with my buy!! I&#x27;ll be using these as gifts for my Mary Kay customers :)</li>
    <li> Makes hands soft and subtle. Fragrance free for it would work for either male or female. Great for stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> This a a wonderful product and it works out well for me to carry these sizes in my purse. Also, this product is great for your hands.</li>
    <li> I KNOW THAT THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR BEFORE EXPERIENCE BUT I NEVER RECEIVED THOSE.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for the speedy postage. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay is a fabulous brand, and the packaging in small portions meant I was able to donate for a charitable cosmetics bag.</li>
    <li> Not taking anything away from Mary Kay products which I have been using for over 30 years,I just didn&#x27;t read the entire description to realize the hand lotion was peach scented.  The scent didn&#x27;t agree with my allergies.  So I gave them to friends.</li>
    <li> Whether in travel size or full size, Mary Kay makes the best hand cream ever. It moisturizes without being greasy, and the scent doesn&#x27;t conflict with your perfume, if you wear it. It is an excellent value; the quality rivals much higher priced hand creams.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these. They are for Mary Kay consultants to GIVE away. They are a tax write off as well as .50 each. Go somewhere and buy a full size bottle for $10. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I read about the Mary Kay Satin Hands lotion online.  Someone gave it as a gift so I wanted to give samples of this lotion to each of the ladies that helped plan my baby shower.  I&#x27;m happy with the price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Steve Harvey raved about the lotion.  I&#x27;ve bought dollar store lotion that works better!  Waste of $11.  If you have dry skin, this isn&#x27;t for you.  I wish I had bought coconut oil or cocoa butter.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are so great! I love how small they are. They fit in my purse and are easy to carry with my.</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion, non greasy and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> I passed these out as thank you gifts. They all love it. It has such a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Satin Hands.  It feels so good on my skin.  I can tell the difference immediatel after applying it to my hands.</li>
