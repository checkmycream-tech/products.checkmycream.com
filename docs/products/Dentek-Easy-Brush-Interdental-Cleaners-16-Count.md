      <li>so I&#x27;m able to carry them in my purse or in my pocket without them getting covered with junk.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work very well. Much better than Floss if teeth are not very close together. I like these better than the other brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome, especially if you have an implant and food gets stuck.</li>
    <li> Amazon is great I received only one Package and not 6 and called sent out got it next day this product is great also and I went to dentist for cleaning and didn&#x27;t need much for Plaque or Tartar before needed a lot of scraping and not last time since using these, and my Spin Brush.Will order again when needed&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> A little too thin for me.</li>
    <li> These are really great, handy little tooth brushes/picks.  Gentle on gums, easily removes stuck food. Small and easy to carry anywhere.</li>
    <li> So convenient to keep in my purse.  I have ortho, it is very easy to walk into the restroom and make sure I get food stuck in the brackets out after a meal.  I do not brush right away because it is not recommended.  The acid attack happens 20-40 minutes after you eat.  That is when enamel is at its weakest.  Brushing will cause the top layer, the one with the most fluoride, to be brushed away.  So it is better to rinse with water and use an interdental cleaner instead.  Once the acid attack is over it is safe to brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste.</li>
    <li> These do what they say they will do.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, clean and work.&lt;br /&gt;Good way to get them in volume.</li>
    <li> so glad to find the right type &amp; size since it&#x27;s become hard to find them in retail stores&lt;br /&gt;wish they were as sturdy as they were a few years ago</li>
    <li> Its very useful when you have a bridge. I like the quality and the price.</li>
    <li> These are a better deal than most of the other brands, but I would avoid the ones with fluoride on them.  You should be able to use a proxy brush several times, and the fluoride is gone after sticking it between a couple of teeth. I also didn&#x27;t really like the flavor of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I&#x27;d noticed this had fluoride on the tips.</li>
    <li> Like this...the best thing to use...specially for someone who has a small mouth. ..</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product and a great aid to health for your teeth!  I will purchase this item again and recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are great for getting in between teeth and along the gum lines, and the listed price is much cheaper than what I can get at my local store, luckily they are small enough to easily store a bulk purchase of them</li>
    <li> These work very well, although they cost more than I am comfortable spending.</li>
    <li> Other reviews say these are &amp;#34;use once&amp;#34;; not so.  Great size that is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have two kiddos with braces. These are a necessity in my house. They fit under the wire and between brackets, perfectly. They are great to travel with, when brushing isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and fall apart after one or two uses. So they looked like good buy, but aren&#x27;t because I have to use so many of them.</li>
    <li> Very handy to carry in your pocket or purse.  Easier to use than floss and probably just as good.  I love these things.</li>
    <li> Actually, I use these to apply my mascara. I read an article about using these for mascara and LOVE &#x27;em! I take the interdental brush and coat it with the mascara sparingly then dispose. I have fine thin lashes and am able to apply without clumps. Also, I use them to apply eyebrow gel on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for daily use but never at this great price. My hygienist really noticed the improvement.</li>
    <li> Its for my wife. She likes it and I like the price.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came Fast!</li>
    <li> I love this brush and use it everyday. I love the bulk price and I am planning to keep buying this item in the future. Thanks for the great deal!</li>
    <li> As a dental assistant, I know my hygiene products and in the right oral circumstances, these are the best!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Wish I had found these years ago!  I think they are much better then floss, but you can use both together.  They certainly are a lot easier to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I feel food stick in between my teeth, I quickly uncap this this and use the brush to clean I between my teeth.  What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;The truth is. You can&#x27;t floss everywhere, and frankly, now that I have these I rarely flow, but my dental exams are so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely leave Hime without one in a pocket or purse and they are alway in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to gross you out, but, you will not believe how much stuff you get caught in between your teeth, that you had no idea was there.  It is almost scary...except that I have these to save the day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have turned all my friends and family using these now...even my dentist! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Subscribe and Save to get off 15%.  Sweet deal.&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful, would you please click \\&quot;helpful\\&quot;.  Thank you so much! :))</li>
    <li> These are especially good for sticking in your purse and using in the restroom when you go out to eat and something gets stuck between your teeth.  I think they are a bit thicker than my first preference but they do the job and are conenient</li>
    <li> The only floss that strengthens my gums and cleans them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on a furious mission to get my gums healthy before getting a cleaning [[ ouch!!]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a week and it did do a good job! A lot better than the skinny competitor brands that didn&#x27;t touch jack ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get flossin</li>
    <li> Excellent tool to have on hand to remove in between teeth food particles. Different sizes available as well.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive  teeth and/or gums try DenTek! It has been really helpful. The &amp;#34;Easy Brush&amp;#34; has cleaned areas dental floss didn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has lasted about a week. It can last longer. Of course it depends on your particular situation. It&#x27;s good to have clean sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT irritation!</li>
    <li> Good product, great deal!</li>
    <li> These have fluoride.  I&#x27;m so disappointed!  The product is addictively effective and I wouldn&#x27;t have returned them if they hadn&#x27;t contained fluoride.</li>
    <li> The reviews were right. These are cheaply made not at all like the GUM periodontal brushes. You can only use them about 2 times at the most.  They are basically for tighter spaced teeth as well but still don&#x27;t really do the job I would like.</li>
    <li> They have fluoride coating. Fluoride is a neurotoxin. Very damaging to brain cells.</li>
    <li> PURCHASE MADE DenTek Easy Brush Cleaners interdental, 16 Count (Pack of 6) AND I CAME TO BRUSH INTERDENTAL 10, I DO NOT LIKE THIS TRAP, VERY UGLY, VERY BAD, I AM VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these. I read these were great, even better than flossing, but I still do both. I keep some in my purse to use away from home, teeth feel clean. I use them every night!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without one of these. These are great and they last and don&#x27;t fail after use on a couple of teeth.</li>
    <li> If you have dental implants or dental work that you need to keep clean and a tooth pick won&#x27;t work...these are for you!  I can&#x27;t keep enough of these in my pockets, in my purse, with me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the cost of a new car on my mouth with implants, etc. the DDS forgot to tell me there are gaps under the implants which need to be kept clean.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different oral care items out there and found these work great.  Small, easy to carry and no different than using a toothpick after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up on these if you like them, you can never have enough.</li>
    <li> Floss was invented by the devil so I don&#x27;t use it but my dentist THINKS I do because I religiously use Dentek Easy Brush Interdental Cleaners several times a day.</li>
    <li> Have been using these brushes faithfully for the last year. Since using the brushes I have had rave reviews from the dental hygienist!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these the first time during the winter. My thumbs were badly cracked from the dry winter air and it was nearly impossible to use dental floss. I only intended to use them until my thumbs healed. I can&#x27;t give them up now. Will use them forever. I also gave them to my 96 year old mother who isn&#x27;t quite strong enough to floss her teeth. I have them in my purse and in several drawers throughout the house. Never leave home without them. I pass them out to friends when we meet at the restaurant. I still use floss but these are great between bushings.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in your dental arsenal.</li>
    <li> Love these to be able to clean my teeth and my gums.</li>
    <li> Works great for my son to use because he has braces and it&#x27;s hard for him to clean with just his toothbrush</li>
    <li> A friend of mine&#x27;s gave me one of the cleaners while out for dinner.  I fell in love.  It was like the perfect toothpick and floss.  It get&#x27;s to the places in your mouth without the annoying floss angles you usually have to maneuver.  I bought the six pack and gave away 3 of them just because I loved them so much.  I have a few crowns which are hard to reach and this cleaner worked wonders.  I will be using these forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for several years and I feel that they are more thorough than flossing. My dentist is pleased with the results too</li>
    <li> My oral surgeon recommended there to remove food from a pocket between two teeth. The work great and now I us them all the time especially when I am traveling.</li>
    <li> I have radiation damage from a cancer treatment in my mouth and throat and these little brushes are great for cleaning my teeth!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These interdental cleaners really work well to get food out of the spaces between the teeth. There is another brand that is too thick to work. They clean very well. I&#x27;ve bought dozens of packs over the last few years and find them indispensable.</li>
    <li> Does nice job. Just wish wire was a little stronger and didn&#x27;t bend as easy. other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> Easy Brush Interdental Cleaners:&lt;br /&gt;Poorly made, soft and extremely pliable, Handle small and hard to work with. Does a poor job of cleaning between the teeth</li>
    <li> they are not as good as ones i buy at Walgreens.. less firm and less durable.. the wire pokes into gums</li>
    <li> Use these all the time.  Great for keeping food out from teeth.  Convenient to use throughout the day.</li>
    <li> You can sub for floss or use as an additional step after brushing and flossing. It fits between my teeth perfectly. I have tried other ones but I like the way these ones fit the best. I wish they would make these for home use also.</li>
    <li> These are the best. They get in there and clean the food out fast. I take them everywhere. Several of my friends that also have extensive dental work have started using them, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these. Dip them in toothpaste and you will think you just came from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Great for those tough spots. My wife loves them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be buying these for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> The brushes I received showed &amp;#34;GermShield Anti-Microbial Caps&amp;#34; on the packaging. The product pictured is the regular non GermShield version.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me about this item. He likes them better than dental floss. I use them all the time. They come with a cap that covers the brush so I&#x27;m able to carry them in my purse or in my pocket without them getting covered with junk. I can tell a difference between these brushes and dental floss.</li>
    <li> I do not used these too ofter, but when I do, they are fine and I love them. I love Dentek products!</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist recommended, and at a great value.  I&#x27;ll be buying these until &#x27;m in the bleachers or until I&#x27;m broke.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectation 100%</li>
    <li> These work, but aren&#x27;t as long or as strong as other brands. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> Good product for me; easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great price as i use them every day....</li>
    <li> These work very well.  Much handier than floss for a quick clean up when you eat out. I use them as part of my am and pm dental hygiene routine along with flossing. My dentist has complimented me on how clean my teeth are when I go in for a regular visit. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> these little brushes are too filmsy to be any good at cleaning difficult spots. I dislike them intensely.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brush teeth cleaners for several years.  I use them every day, after I brush my teeth.  They don&#x27;t completely replace flossing, but they are easier to use than dental floss.</li>
    <li> This is like a toothpick on steroids! Easy to carry around and non-obtrusive. Gets those hard to reach areas without a problem.</li>
    <li> I’ve had a lot of gum issues for many years.  The easy brushes cleans very well between teeth.  My gums have improved after using these for several months.</li>
    <li> The product is much smaller than it looks.  The bristles is tiny compared to others that I have used.  Will be returning it soon.</li>
    <li> These are very efficient at getting those nooks that a sponge, rag or q-tip cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;I use these for cleaning my personal items and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have a few teeth with large gaps at the gumline. These pockets hold onto anything and everything I eat. These interdental brushes are brilliant. They make it easy for me to keep those gaps clear and healthy. The DenTek brand has always been my favorite. They are more cost effective than other brands and the slightly soft/flexible handles make them much easier to grip than ones with a smooth plastic handle.</li>
    <li> Very good, easy to use tool for dental hygiene.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> These are such great little brushes. They are easy on the gums and can get into tiny, tight spaces between the teeth. I like that the brushes are small enough to carry along in my purse for when I feel the need to clean between my teeth outside the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> Just what the Dentist ordered!!</li>
    <li> Very good i recomande to my friend</li>
    <li> Good price. Good product.</li>
    <li> The brush breaks easy and get stuck between teeth. Careful when using.</li>
    <li> Wife use them everyday best deal on them</li>
    <li> I use these everyday, in addition to flossing, for extra cleaning of those hard-to-reach spaces between my teeth. At my last dental visit, they said there was virtually no (ZERO) plaque on my teeth and I credit that to the implementation of these brushes. If you&#x27;re gentle, you can make each brush last a couple weeks before the bristles wear out.</li>
    <li> Real bristles help in a thorough cleaning!</li>
    <li> I love these. Helps to keep your teeth clean. Kids love it too.</li>
    <li> nice savings, one pack @walmart was a bit pricey. just watch your size.</li>
    <li> These little brushes keep your gums in tip top shape.  Better than flossing.  Great product.  Highly recommend it.  Try them.</li>
    <li> After braces and a wire to secure my teeth it is a chore to get floss in between teeth. Bought a package of Dentek Easy Brush while away from home and after lunch.....what a treat to not have seeds in between teeth!  GREAT to have on hand. Wonder if this is a good way to keep more plaque from building?</li>
    <li> Amazing clean - my son has braces and doesn&#x27;t always brush carefully.  These really get in between the brackets for a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> Dentek Easy Brush Interdental Cleaners, 16 Count (Pack of 6) is excellent for my mom&#x27;s teeth. She has a little space between her teeth so the remain food stuck on it but with these cleaners she can remove easily</li>
    <li> Every time I clean my teeth after a meal, I go through at 1-2 of these things.  They break SO easily.  I am NOT hacking away at my teeth and bending the bristles, I&#x27;m just using them as they are meant to be used.  I used to buy these in bulk until I realized just how much money I was wasting.  Aside from breaking so easily, they are great because they&#x27;re gentle, won&#x27;t hurt your gums, and get way more food removed than flossing alone.</li>
    <li> great value for the quality. The drugstore chains charge a small fortune so this is a great deal. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> These brushes tend to do a more thorough job of scrubbing the gunk from below the gum line.  I like these in particular because the wire core of the brushes is thinner than some other brands, so they fit well even in tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I really like these proxy brushes. I highly recommend them. The quality is better than the generic brands that you can get at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> These are gentle on teeth and gum.  The brush are soft and smooth so they glide easily in and out.  Sturdier and harder brushes out there probably do a better job in cleaning but they could potentially damage your gum and enamel.  It is safer and easier to use these.  I do wish the wires are stronger and more durable.  Each brush lasts 1-2 uses only.  I find them too wide for some teeth so I  I use slimmer ones in addition.</li>
    <li> Great tool for spaces between your teeth. Someone else wrote that it is only good for one use. That&#x27;s completely incorrect. When I throw it awayit looks like it is new. Why would you want to use it for two week though you could. I&#x27;ve never had one break. It has a nice cover for it also.</li>
    <li> I WAS HOOKED ON PLA__ERS BUT SINCE I&#x27;VE TRIED THESE (DENTEK) I&#x27;M SOLD! THEY ARE AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER AND THEY ARE CHEAPER. I AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I GUESS YOU KNOW WHICH ONES I&#x27;LL BE USING IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Intelligently designed, do their job, and are much better quality than generic, whose brush wires are flimsy.  G.U.M. Brand has even stronger brush wires, so next time I&#x27;ll buy them, even though they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
    <li> I recently finished up having my teeth realigned with Invisaligns, and when I was done, my orthodontist cemented in permanent retainers (a thin wire inside the back of your teeth), which are *awesome*, but also mean that you can&#x27;t floss those teeth (4 uppers, 4 lowers).  He gave me this little device which looks like an interdental stimulator (the little rubber pick on the end of some toothbrushes), which attached to a handle with batteries that wiggles the pick when you turn it on.  (Honestly it looked like a marital aid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in a dental office, so I *get* the importance of flossing, and cleaning in between your teeth, so I used the wiggly thing diligently until I had to go overseas, and was worried that TSA would think it was some sort of ..well, who knows what they would think.  So I bought a package of these things - and wouldn&#x27;t you know it - they work *way* better than the wiggly thing, and without the fear of embarrassment (plus they are way more portable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t touched the wiggly thing in months, and I have these guys on subscribe and save. :~)</li>
    <li> Handy dandy, perfect tool for tiny crevices.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product and does a very good job. It is very easy to use and removes any piece of food without much effort. I use it on everyday basis and is very satisfied. The only issue with the product is that these brushes quickly break and cannot be used more than two-three times thus one may need at least one package per week.</li>
    <li> My dentist gives me good grades after using these daily for a prolonged time.</li>
    <li> I bought them as a Christmas gift for my husband who uses them frequently.  He loves them!</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer and can&#x27;t use floss. These work great. I have narrow gaps between my teeth. Many products like this are too big and do not fit between my teeth. The orange size works for my teeth, there are more cleaners than competitor&#x27;s package and are a great price.</li>
    <li> My visit to the hygienist used to be scraping and scraping and bleeding and bleeding and advice and recriminations. Now some scraping and much praise with an occasional comment on an area I seem to be missing. Thanks to these little cleaners one of which I haul out whenever I eat anything.  Tough little buggers, each lasting several muck outs. I buy them about fifty a time, carry them everywhere.</li>
    <li> These are much easier to use that dental floss, and easy to stick in your pocket or toilet kit when traveling.  I&#x27;ve also used them to clean other small cracks and crevices about the house.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay...And way overpriced.  The brushes are spindly and dont do a very good job.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I use with floss at night, and use these in the morning. They last at least a few days before you have to toss them or the break off, depending on use of course.</li>
    <li> Sorry it took so long.  I was new to Amazon and did not know how to leave the feedback. Love the product. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> The wires were too thin.  They bent easily.  It hard to use them to clean behind the teeth.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very effective at cleaning between teeth. And a great value compared to other products.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does extremely well what it is designed forl.  One can use it many times before having to discard.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time. I hate floss and these work very well for me with no problems.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these. I got two sizes for fit between teeth. They work great and leave you feeling and looking clean. Great for my purse also.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than some my favorite interdental brushes. Still, its just big enough to get the job done.</li>
