      <li>I never even liked the olay line.</li>

      <li>Even if the review was honest and informative.</li>
      <li>The roller it self is nice.</li>
      <li>I like this roller, seems to be good quality and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Like DTS roller, this roller has very fine needles, the process is not painless since the needles are longer but bearable.</li>
      <li>skin looked great after the first use!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>more can I say.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a derma roller before, so I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
      <li>I know it works way better than this, having tried both.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from reading the reviews of this.</li>
      <li>It has been about a month and want to use it longer before I can say it does or does not work for sure.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to do this treatment at night before you go to bed ...</li>
      <li>I love this Derma Roller.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who has suffered with acne will love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have so many products and am trying them al to use with my rollerl.</li>
      <li>It is said the micro needle helps the skin penetrate ingredients 100 times better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I roll more.  </li>
      <li>, it was more of a tickling sensation.  </li>
      <li>As a result of the many years of suffering, treatments, $$$, etc.  </li>
      <li>I am sure.</li>
      <li>I have nothing more to write about him</li>
      <li>have been heard more often.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a strong tingle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and have really good skin, but perhaps I am beyond the age where this product is effective.</li>
      <li>and wow did it burn which is kind of good.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off getting cocoa butter to smooth them.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure the needles were able to get full penetration.  </li>
      <li>it seems as though someone just wants to make the product look good.</li>
      <li>Again, I&#x27;m happy with the healthy appearance of my skin, but I&#x27;m not seeing any further improvement to my age/sun spots.  </li>
      <li>I also notice that it helps fine wrinkles disappear, too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You have to use it consistently to get results though, so don&#x27;t slack off! :)&lt;</li>
      <li>i had alot of scaring from acne and shaving - after using this product just 5 times i can see a Huge DIFFERENCE in my skins condition</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>still rolls smoothly.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I clean my face thoroughly, soak the roller in alcohol, and then use it on my face, I roller all over for about 5 min, concentrating on my problem areas.</li>
      <li>I clean my roller with 70% alcohol.  </li>
      <li>I clean my face, apply the oil, then derma-roll, then go to bed.</li>
      <li>I always clean my skin and the roller with alcohol before/during use.  </li>
      <li>Clean your skin well, apply what ever product you wish (</li>
      <li>, I use a very light pressure since the skin there is much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used it gently and it gave me nice flush of color at first.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for a good two months, and feel that my crows feet around my eyes, and especially the lines in between my eye brows have softened.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years with out much success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you wont notice a huge difference right away.</li>
      <li>GREAT QUALITY too will not tear your face up if you are using it the way your are supposed to / absolutely eliminated the need for a micro scrub - follow up with a glycolic peel and you will be 10 years younger !</li>
      <li>The roller is high quality and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>am pleased and surprised!</li>
      <li>So far, I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this to all my friends.  </li>
      <li>the vit c serum absorbed well with the rolling.</li>
      <li>This is my third roller, in my opinion, the best was my first roller - DTS roller, good quality and fine needles, so most comfortable to use, however, it only comes with 0.25 length and very expensive.</li>
      <li>and it seems to sink right</li>
      <li>(that is, to do it right).  </li>
      <li>So that right there told me its working and to keep it up.  </li>
      <li>First let me say I&#x27;m a 54 yr old women, with age spots and crows feet, and some prominent vertical creases in between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As long as you read up on how to use it, using proper sterilizing techniques before and after derma-rolling... you&#x27;re all good!</li>
      <li>Invest in higher quality NOT made in China.</li>
      <li>(I have no wrinkles) and that hurt a tiny bit, really more discomfort than pain.  </li>
      <li>This was my first roller purchase.  </li>
      <li>I went for months without touching this roller again before I finally decided to purchase a 240-needle variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just be sure to take time with proper cleaning/handling of this device.</li>
      <li>Just something to be aware of.</li>
      <li>I was able to roll longer with multiple passes.  </li>
      <li>I soak it in alcohol first and also after use, no problems with redness or bleeding-  </li>
      <li>My second roller was MT 1.5mm roller which I dislike, the needles or &#x27;blades&#x27; (to me, the triangular needles, visible to naked eyes look more like blades or knives) were too huge to penetrate well, so rolling my face was torturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic results with it, but so far its cool.</li>
      <li>I personally think it&#x27;s far more comfortable to do multiple, less painful/blood free passes than try to get more punctures per pass.  </li>
      <li>100% Pure 2 oz.(love this) (from Amazon see link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MJ7Z0O/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i00, on my wrinkles, and some 20% Vitamin C +</li>
      <li>This dermaroller is made really well, no problems in that department (so to speak), but do not use a product like this without a certain level of commitment.</li>
      <li>rolled my stomach very vigorously, my thighs and my breasts.  </li>
      <li>I use these to prep my skin before applying serums and it really feels like it helps the absorption.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Furthermore, there was a gross popping sound on my forehead where the needles were puncturing, and a LOT of blood.  </li>
      <li>My skin really does feel softer when I use these in combo with my products.</li>
      <li>It really does help product get into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely getting results now after almost 3 months.</li>
      <li>After two uses, I am pleased with the minimal pain and maintenance of device.</li>
      <li>I really lets the moisturizer soak up!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I have used it every morning for six weeks, but I don&#x27;t see much change in the lines around my mouth (plus, it does hurt).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s been great using this along with my .5mm! Absolutely getting results now after almost 3 months. Just be sure to take time with proper cleaning/handling of this device.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this product. I haven my used it for about three weeks so only time will tell.  So far, I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this to all my friends.  There are several areas (under the neck) that seem to be too sensitive to use this on.</li>
    <li> great item for promoting healing to the skin</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvements in my stretch marks, on my arms. Used it for about 10 months to a year. I wanted it to work, but instead I regretted spending my money on it. Just going to have to bite the bullet and get tattoos to cover it. I also didn&#x27;t like how this made me bleed through little holes. You have to apply pressure or else it&#x27;s ineffective but like I said I didn&#x27;t like it - my skin turned red and it made holes in my skin. Definitely would not recommend. You&#x27;d be better off getting cocoa butter to smooth them. I know it works way better than this, having tried both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: You know what is funny is that any person who gives the derma roller a negative review gets an unhelpful vote. Even if the review was honest and informative. I noticed a negative vote a few hours after I posted this review. I would beware of this product or the buyer b/c it seems as though someone just wants to make the product look good. Not everyone is going to like it.</li>
    <li> As long as you read up on how to use it, using proper sterilizing techniques before and after derma-rolling... you&#x27;re all good! I just wash it in rubbing alcohol. You don&#x27;t want bacteria growing on it and pushing THAT back into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it at night, as your skin turns red. The inflammation is gone by morning, and when you wake up in the morning, your skin is firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it consistently to get results though, so don&#x27;t slack off! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use jojoba oil when I derma-roll. I clean my face, apply the oil, then derma-roll, then go to bed. I&#x27;ve found that the jojoba oil combined with the derma-rolling as well as a weekly clay mask SERIOUSLY reduces the oiliness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t PUSH it into your skin; just apply light to moderate pressure, and alter the pressure depending on what area of your face you&#x27;re rolling; for example, when I derma-roll under my eyes (probably not recommendable, but I have small wrinkles there and it drives me nuts; if you do roll here, do it with CAUTION!), I use a very light pressure since the skin there is much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s painful. It&#x27;s just.. prickly. And very irritating. And when I roll it over the right side of my forehead, it makes me sneeze about 5 times (weird, I know). If you have a really low pain tolerance, you don&#x27;t want to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read, 1mm is just the right length to reach deep enough into the skin to create enough &#x27;micro-puncture-wounds&#x27; to promote collagen production, but not too deep as to enter the deep tissue (ouch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I use these to prep my skin before applying serums and it really feels like it helps the absorption.&lt;br /&gt;I have been told that these home rollers won&#x27;t do anything to really change my facial lines unless I draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I haven&#x27;t put enough pressure or rolled enough to do that. I roll with mild pressure in a few directions and this causes some mild burning/redness but it is gone the next day. My skin really does feel softer when I use these in combo with my products.</li>
    <li> Be sure to research the best technique of using this device. If you&#x27;re kinda squeamish, forget it. Look at video of trained people using it and you will soon find-out you have to go at it pretty hard (that is, to do it right).  This dermaroller is made really well, no problems in that department (so to speak), but do not use a product like this without a certain level of commitment. For experts, go for it, because the cost is commensurate with the quality. Good luck, you guys!</li>
    <li> started with the .5 mm. went to the 1mm.  still does not hurt. i think the longer one will work quicker. would recommend</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from reading the reviews of this. Some say It tickled and some say it hurt so bad that they had to stop. From my experience it was somewhere in between. It defiantly didn&#x27;t tickle! There was some pain and discomfort but it was something I could manage. I used it all over my body in sections. I was defiantly recall over after using it. Warning I worked out the next day and it burned where I had used it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tool and it seems to be working.  It is a little painful.  It has been about a month and want to use it longer before I can say it does or does not work for sure.  Just make sure to soak in alcohol after each use!</li>
    <li> I ran this thing up and down my forearm a few times just to see what it did.  Just made my arm red.  Lost interest.  Haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day, and I have seen a definite difference. My wrinkles and sagging under my eyes are beginning to disappear little bit by little. Im very pleased with it, I will be ordering a &amp;#34;2 one next.</li>
    <li> After seeing this item on The Doctors and Rachel Ray show (google the Rachel Ray show with it, the women has amazing results), I decided to buy one. First let me say I&#x27;m a 54 yr old women, with age spots and crows feet, and some prominent vertical creases in between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I read countless reviews of various rollers and finally decided on this one. The reasons I picked this one were 1)I wanted something sterile and sealed, 2)I wanted titanium needles, 3)I finally decided on 1.0 length needles, and 4) I decided that 540 needles would be the best.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased and surprised! I have been using this for a good two months, and feel that my crows feet around my eyes, and especially the lines in between my eye brows have softened. I also think that it has eliminated some of my age spots.&lt;br /&gt;I use this about twice a week. I clean my face thoroughly, soak the roller in alcohol, and then use it on my face, I roller all over for about 5 min, concentrating on my problem areas. It does have a slight uncomfortable feel, but I have never used any numbing cream etc. After I&#x27;m done I wipe my face with witch hazel (feels so good) and then apply some Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz.(love this) (from Amazon see link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MJ7Z0O/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i00, on my wrinkles, and some 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz from Amazon (see link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036BI56G/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o06_s00_i01 , after applying this, I sterilize the roller with alcohol that I put in a spray bottle and lay it in the tray until dry.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do this before bed, I apply the Hyaluronic acid (which is fab) and the Vit C and E Ferulic, quite heavy and it seems to sink right in.&lt;br /&gt;After drying I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning my skin looks and feels great, I have kept this routine up, and will continue to do so, I am wondering how long I should use this roller until I buy another, None of the needles look worn or bent, and look new.&lt;br /&gt;Will repeat buy from this seller,&lt;br /&gt;Thanksnew.&lt;br /&gt;Will repeat buy from this seller,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> didnt like want buy again</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  It seems to be of high quality.  I really lets the moisturizer soak up!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use &amp; hope to see results.</li>
    <li> On one hand, this doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I think perhaps the needles are not sharp enough to puncture my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a derma roller before, so I can&#x27;t be sure. But I am not sure these work. I&#x27;m giving it a chance, if I see improvement in six or eight months (The earliest I have heard of seeing results for stretch marks using dermal rollers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will continue to use. Just something to be aware of.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne since I realized I had acne in 4th grade.  As a result of the many years of suffering, treatments, $$$, etc.  I heard about the derma roller online.  I cannot believe that the scars are disappearing with each use.  I use my 1.5 dermaroller about every 3 weeks.  I use hyaluronic acid after I wash my face with a salicylic face wash, use my dermaroller, then rinse with warm water and reapply hyaluronic acid to help my skin heal.  By the next day, I can already see the scars disappearing.  It feels like a mosquito bite but with less sting.  I replace my roller when I notice that the needles will start to dull.  I clean my roller with 70% alcohol.  Anyone who has suffered with acne will love this product.  I also notice that it helps fine wrinkles disappear, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dark skin black guy and have strech marks on my arms, shoulder/chest, back/under-arm area, and love handle area. Most are due to lifting weights. I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years with out much success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this product appears to be working. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and they are starting to go away in some areas. I did not give the product 5 stars because they are not totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the product and improvement will be notice for up to 6 months. I&#x27;m looking forward to next summer.</li>
    <li> I have used this roller for two rounds (once a week for two weeks) on about a 2in. diameter patch of stretch marks from pregnancy and several spots of old acne spots on my chest. I will reserve judgement on long-term improvement for later.  After two uses, I am pleased with the minimal pain and maintenance of device. I wish there was more useful instruction on how to use a topical product with it  (i.e. strivectin) as I would really like to continue a home-based program rather than hiring a facialist as I have done in the past. I did three passes over areas, once vertically, horizontally and at an angle. Minimal pain, but red &amp;#34;scratches&amp;#34; did appear on my skin. This also happened when an enesthetician performed this therapy on me and I do have very sensitive skin. I think its normal and they do fade after a few hours and I never bled. The roller is high quality and easy to clean. I just soak in alcohol before and after every use. Allow to dry and replace cover. I will continue to experiment with what will work well for me.</li>
    <li> I like this roller, seems to be good quality and easy to use.  I always clean my skin and the roller with alcohol before/during use.  It seems to have enough depth to stimulate the skin but doesn&#x27;t cause any bleeding or lingering redness.  I suppose time will tell whether it makes a significant difference as I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
    <li> This was my first roller purchase.  Unfortunately, I feel I fell for the gimicky trick of \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; when buying a microroller.  I recently bought a NORMALLY spaced micro-roller, with half as many needles.  When you touch that one with your fingers, you can feel the sharpness of the individual needles, and sure enough, they effortlessly pierce your skin when you roll with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you touch this roller, the needles are so densely packed that you don&#x27;t hardly feel the sharpness.  The thought of trying to roll with it hard enough to get all of those needles to penetrate is cringe-inducing.  As the other reviewer said, it&#x27;s like lying on a bed of nails; however in this case you WANT the needles to go in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first (and only) time I rolled with this roller, it was painful and I wasn&#x27;t sure the needles were able to get full penetration.  Furthermore, there was a gross popping sound on my forehead where the needles were puncturing, and a LOT of blood.  I had to use considerably more pressure, and I was unable to determine if I really was getting full needle penetration elsewhere on my face because I was not willing to try to induce that icky \\&quot;pop\\&quot; elsewhere.  I went for months without touching this roller again before I finally decided to purchase a 240-needle variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just rolled last night with the other roller with fewer needles and it was entirely different.  I could see the needles penetrate my skin, I didn&#x27;t have to use much pressure, there wasn&#x27;t nearly as much pain, and there wasn&#x27;t the disgusting popping sound on my forehead (even though I went with a slightly longer 1.5mm needle length).  Not to mention that there was almost no blood.  I was able to roll longer with multiple passes.  I personally think it&#x27;s far more comfortable to do multiple, less painful/blood free passes than try to get more punctures per pass.  And here&#x27;s the big indicator -- I am not dreading picking it up and using it again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for results; obviously it&#x27;s too soon for me to tell, but I wanted to leave this review now because I DO know that if you don&#x27;t at least start with the right tool for the job, you&#x27;ll never stick with it long enough to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO know not to believe people who say, \\&quot;My skin looked great after the first use!\\&quot;  All they&#x27;re reacting to is the short term puffiness and \\&quot;glow\\&quot; caused by the needles.  You should only use this every 4-6 weeks in order to allow the skin to heal and collagen production to actually begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I will say is that most people probably start out on their forehead like I did.  Just be aware that the forehead IS the most painful area on your face because the skin is taught on bone.  Elsewhere on the face it&#x27;s more of a strong tingle.</li>
    <li> This is a poor quality product and I do not recommend it.  The &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; are not exactly so and puncture unevenly which is dangerous.  I tested this on my hand and arm before my face thank goodness because the uneven needles made my arm bleed in spots.  I hardly used any pressure,, created scratches.. awful. Invest in higher quality NOT made in China. This is a poor knockoff Derma Roller.  Research before buying!</li>
    <li> I love this Derma Roller.  I use it every night before bed. Then I apply my night cream.  I&#x27;m 54 and people have asked me what am I doing to look so young.  So that right there told me its working and to keep it up.  I even use it on my scalp.  I noticed my hair was starting to thin so I thought why not try it.  Since using the Derma Roller my hair stylist said she sees new growth.  This could also be do to changing my Thyroid meds, but I will keep using it on my scalp because feels good.  It&#x27;s good to do something now before its to late and then you say \\&quot;Now what?\\&quot;.  Product also arrived very quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> The product was as good as promised. Very sturdy and nicely packaged. Easy to use and clean. Very nice storage case. Just wish it had a little more instructions.</li>
    <li> No pain or bleeding like i have read other products similar to this have caused. I have even rolled roughly at times, I did my research prior to buying this and am extremely satisfied with this product. I am now looking for a bigger mm size to do my body for stretch marks. My face has never looked so beautiful. I have so many products and am trying them al to use with my rollerl. My resent research has brought me to the info that you can use several products at the same session, with a break in between applications in order for the product to dry. I have started using my retinol products and olay&#x27;s micro scupting cream after. Wow what a difference. I never even liked the olay line. The dark spots on my eyelids from my Latisse is gone in one application. Of course I have to keep microneedle rolling to prevent further dark eyelids from my continued use of Latisse.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this roller is the best investment I have made and I am past 50 years old. My wrinkles are even smoothing into lines now.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say. I am hooked. I love this product. JJ</li>
    <li> I used the roller and then applied my nighly salycilic acid and wow did it burn which is kind of good.  I sat in front of the fan for a minute to help with discomfort.  It really does help product get into the skin.  I did have a little break out but that is due to my type of skin I am sure.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I went with this product.  I felt little to no pain when rolling, it was more of a tickling sensation.  MUCH less painful than waxing and didn&#x27;t use a numbing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rolled my stomach very vigorously, my thighs and my breasts.  I have stretch marks and want to improve the appearance.  I rolled on my face just a tiny bit around my mouth (I have no wrinkles) and that hurt a tiny bit, really more discomfort than pain.  When I was done rolling my stretch marks I rubbed on a mixture or homemade lotion made with manuka honey, vit e oil and cocoa butter mixed with a collagen cream and castor oil.  THAT stung!!!  I didn&#x27;t realize that even though rolling didn&#x27;t hurt it was making micro wounds regardless.  I&#x27;m going to try different creams and see if that feels better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I roll more.  I read a 1.00 needle should be used once every 2 weeks but after no pain I&#x27;m going to try rolling twice a week and see what happens since I have such bad scarring.</li>
    <li> This is my third roller, in my opinion, the best was my first roller - DTS roller, good quality and fine needles, so most comfortable to use, however, it only comes with 0.25 length and very expensive. My second roller was MT 1.5mm roller which I dislike, the needles or &#x27;blades&#x27; (to me, the triangular needles, visible to naked eyes look more like blades or knives) were too huge to penetrate well, so rolling my face was torturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much reading of reviews on different rollers,  I decided to get this, I received it on 16th Apr, and was please. Like DTS roller, this roller has very fine needles, the process is not painless since the needles are longer but bearable. Skin was slightly red and the vit c serum absorbed well with the rolling.</li>
    <li> I used it gently and it gave me nice flush of color at first.  I felt a little itchy going to bed but woke up plump and shiny!  Great and inexpensive for home use. I&#x27;d like to use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m two months ispol′zus′. Zero effect. not understand why it has bought. Just threw the money. Very sorry.  I have nothing more to write about him</li>
    <li> only used it once, seemed wierd, guess it could work. Seems like a scam though, guess im desperate to get rid of my acne scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this derma roller for about 3 months now, once a week.  I haven&#x27;t had any bad side affects.  I&#x27;m mainly trying to get rid of some age spots on my cheeks, so I alternate between fade cream and vitamin C serum.  I saw immediate results as far as the appearance of my skin (less blemishes, glowing skin, even tone, no more dry flakey skin).  I&#x27;m just now noticing a lightening of my dark spots, but I still have a ways to go. I will continue to use it and report back in a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 3/27/13:  It&#x27;s been a little over two more months since I&#x27;ve been using this weekly.  Again, I&#x27;m happy with the healthy appearance of my skin, but I&#x27;m not seeing any further improvement to my age/sun spots.  Perhaps I need to try a different serum!  Be sure to do this treatment at night before you go to bed ... the redness will be gone by morning.  I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has tried this on their decollatage or if that area is too delicate.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been use this for close to a month on my face and some of the scars are starting to fade. Now, going into this you have to realize this process does take time you wont notice a huge difference right away. But it will come gradually. The roller it self is nice. Sturdy. still rolls smoothly. I&#x27;ll update my review after using it for a little while longer.</li>
    <li> In the eternal search for youthful skin, I bought this product based on the reviews. I have used it every morning for six weeks, but I don&#x27;t see much change in the lines around my mouth (plus, it does hurt). I&#x27;m 67 years old and have really good skin, but perhaps I am beyond the age where this product is effective.</li>
    <li> It is said the micro needle helps the skin penetrate ingredients 100 times better.  I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic results with it, but so far its cool.</li>
    <li> well I guess this is doing what it is suppose to do,I&#x27;m still learning the correct method to use it to benifit my skin.just don&#x27;t press to hard for you will put holes that bleed in your face and don&#x27;t roll over the same area twice in the same direction, the holes are meant to be only the size of the needles.</li>
    <li> Maybe just me but I could not get into the habit of using this product.  It was a little irritating to my skin and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;I think cleaning care instructions could be be better defined...had to hunt down in the micro print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say after 30 days the comments of you look so young for your age have been heard more often.</li>
    <li> i had alot of scaring from acne and shaving - after using this product just 5 times i can see a Huge DIFFERENCE in my skins condition my face is fuller and no more scars ! i would recomend this product to everyone who has any type of skin problem , wrinkles / acne / it even helps with dryness ! GREAT QUALITY too will not tear your face up if you are using it the way your are supposed to / absolutely eliminated the need for a micro scrub - follow up with a glycolic peel and you will be 10 years younger !</li>
    <li> I had actually ordered this to derma roll my legs, however it is only small enough to derma roll my face unless i wanted to spend well over an hour on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it has actually been completely stunning, 90% of my acne scars are GONE, and the one thing in my life i have hated it my uneven skin tone has actually started correcting itself without the need for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO HAPPY, with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Just beware if you&#x27;re ordering it for your body its pretty small.</li>
    <li> Clean your skin well, apply what ever product you wish (Hyaluronic Acid) roll skin across left to right then up and down. Don&#x27;t press to hard, you will get the hang of it. Helps with scares and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality roller.  The box says that the 1mm size is for professional use, but I have had no problems using it-  it does NOT hurt-  just a gentle pin prick sensation.  I soak it in alcohol first and also after use, no problems with redness or bleeding-  people who report that type of response must be pushing the darn thign REALLY hard!</li>
