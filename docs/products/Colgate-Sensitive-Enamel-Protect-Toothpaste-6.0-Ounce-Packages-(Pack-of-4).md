<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if your teeth aren&#x27;t that sensitive. But not really working for me.</li>
    <li> If this is what you need, the price is great and no more special orders that take weeks to fill at the grocery store.  But it comes far more often than I need because I am the only one that uses this brand at home.</li>
    <li> Works great have bought more 6 times. Dentist said its all good, main thing is use it, said its all flavored soap</li>
    <li> Not much difference in price from the local store. Prime shipping does save time having to go out especially for toothpaste. Works good with a good flavor</li>
    <li> After loosing dental coverage I am suffering.  Tried most sensitive toothpastes but this is the only on that really works for me.</li>
    <li> Big help for sensitive teeth. One of the very few toothpaste I can actually tolerate because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I find it to be just as effective as Sensodyne and  less expensive.</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Enamel Tooth Paste It Does Work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste for over 24 months. I am very pleased with the composition of the product. This includes the texture, the taste, and the lasting Sensitivity quality. I did try a tube of Sensodyne my dentist gave me after a check up. The Colgate was much better in the areas I listed. I am very concern about sensitivity because I am over 71 years old and have started to wear my teeth down which has cause hot spots. I am happy to say my teeth feel better and I have fewer problems with hot, cold, sweet or other products that effect the sensitive areas of my teeth which are still my own. After 71 years I have caused a lot of wear. This product, Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste has helped me and I am pleased with it&#x27;s results. I am now on my fourth purchase of a four pack of the toothpaste from Amazon and will be going back for more. Please allow me to say Amazon has a very good price with free shipping for Prime Members. I have not written any other reviews to date. Please excuse any spelling or grammar errors. I just want you to know how I feel about this product. It may be a big help if you are having sensitivity problems. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 February 2012 My up Date Report&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my up date. I am still using the Colgate Sensitive Enamel Tooth Paste. I did a local search of the stores in my area an AMAZON has the best price at $3.55 for a pack of four six oz tubes when you use the AMAZON Subscribe and Save Program and SHIPPING IS FREE. Since my wife Ann is now over the seventy year mark and I am reaching seventy-three years we both are using the Subscribe and Save Program when we can because savings are getting so much harder to find when we are out shopping. Prices just keep going up and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann has two dental check ups a year and I have one dental check up per year because of cost. Thank the power above we still have all our own teeth. I was in the military for twenty-eighty years and where they stationed my family dental care was not always available. So, this Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste has been a great, great help in keeping us ahead of the dental problem curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a big, big push to get me to write these comments. As I said,please forgive my errors. I want you to use the info provided. If you have any problems please let me know in a comment.Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Sr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Update 1 Jun 2012, Still Buying From Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I need to keep this report going a little longer. I just completed my once a year check up. Got a Double AA+++ report. There was very little cleaning that had to be done. I am happy with this Colgate Sensitive Enamel Toothpaste. Amazon continues to carry it at a very good price with excellent service. I worry quite a bit about this subject because as I said being in the military for twenty-eight years was not always good. I am having AO problems from Vietnam. This Colgate Sensitive Toothpaste has been excellent for me. I think it helps. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Sr.our own teeth.

    <li> With this toothpaste, my tooth feel great.</li>
    <li> This is THE only toothpaste I can use for my sensitive teeth that doesn&#x27;t cause oral skins.  All other sensitive formulas have whitening, this causes the reaction to produce these skins.  I know MANY people with the same problem, but have no choice but purchase products now that this specific product has been discontinued.  WHAT A SHAME!  Too many different choices with whitening and not one that people like myself can use.  PLEASE reconsider production of this formula.  It is my ultimate favorite of all the brands!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this For my sensitive teeth.. and it works!</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste a month ago for about a week and my gums became really sore and painful for the first time in my life. Couldn&#x27;t figure it out, but then I was traveling for a month and ended up using the toothpaste from my travel bag. Issue resolved. Still didn&#x27;t make the connection. The last week my tounge developed some cankers and my gums have been ultra sensative, to the point where I can barely eat and throughout the day my gums and tounge are constantly irritated and in pain. I finally mentioned something to my wife and she said she had the same issue the last few days. She then realized that she started using my toothpaste a couple nights ago when her toothpaste ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a google search and found a forum with dozens of people complaining of the same symptoms. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this toothpaste. I have no known allergy and have never had sore gums before. The fact my wife and I are both having the same issue shows this is not simply an isolated allergy issue.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  I don&#x27;t think it works as well as Crest, but the taste is better than Sensodyne and the price is pretty good.  It does help somewhat on sensitive teeth.  I like the cap because it just pops open and closed and I don&#x27;t have to unscrew anything, drop it on the floor and wash the dog fur off of it before I can put it away.  Works good with one of those toothpaste squeezy things.</li>
    <li> I have always liked and trusted the colgate brand.  When I received a sample from my dentist I found that after only about a week it reduced the sensitivity in my teeth and I like the idea of protecting the enamel surface at the same time.  When I could not find it in my local store it was Amazon to the rescue.  Great product!</li>
    <li> First, this toothpaste tastes like plastic. In a bad way. I forced myself to keep using it, and got used to it in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it made my gums bleed. My gums were fine when I saw this at the store and thought this might help with cold sensitivity. After I started using it, my gums started bleeding out of the blue. I stopped using it for a few weeks, and when I went back to using this toothpaste, my gums started bleeding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have most of a tube of this left, and I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about the toothpaste I use. I think Colgate is the best my far in the market of competitively priced toothpaste. The price for this toothpaste is at least 7 or 8 dollars in CVS and other stores. The pack of four price here at Amazon is a steal for a great product. This product will cut your dental visits and improve your smile.</li>
    <li> I most often use Sensodyne, but find this to be fine, too.  I switch between the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; formula pastes, as they come on sale.  So Fay I have no complaints with any of them.  I DO tend to buy Sensodyne if my teeth are particularly sensitive, though.  It WAS the first, and may be the best, but I haven&#x27;t seen any testing results.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums and if you do you know what I mean. This toothpase is the best for the price and recommended by my dentists. Love it.</li>
    <li> I used this type before...hopefully there is no surprise.</li>
    <li> Great for the family and we never run out of product ... good buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a toothpaste. It foams up your mouth. It tastes good (not as good as gummy bears though). But it works.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste worked right away to stop my sensitivity to extreme temperatures of hot or cold. I prefer the Colgate family of toothpastes. The taste is better and milder than some brands.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted. I could not find it in the store anymore, so this is a great place to get it. Also, it is the only toothpaste that protects my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER, VERY SORE GUMS.  SHE IS USING THIS AND WARM SEA SALT TO SAVE THE MONEY THAT IT COST FOR A DEEP CLEANING.</li>
    <li> I like the toothpaste but it is made in Mexico.  I switched to Sensodyne which is made in the good ole USA!!  Crest also is made in the USA, but I haven&#x27;t found the one for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.......&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I USE SENSODYNE IT WOULD LEAVE ME IN PAIN BUT WHEN I USE THIS I DONT FEEL THE HOT OR COLDNESS OF DRINKS.I HAVE BREN USING IT FOR ALMOST 6  YRS NOW</li>
    <li> Cheaper then Sensitive toothpaste and i think it works just the same for sensitive teeth. I will defiantly order it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice (several tubes each time), and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It supposedly has the same active ingredient and in the same percentage as other brands that do work on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of the toothpaste - not minty or any other strong flavor and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with tooth decay because of non-fluoride-treated water in my childhood. For me, Colgate used to be a toothpaste to avoid because it seemed to focus on whiteness by abrasion.  However, I recently found their Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect, which offers exceptionally high fluoride content, is non-abrasive, and is pleasant tasting. I judge itbetter than Sensodyne, which was my previous toothpaste of choice.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste and I really like it. It tastes good and does not burn my mouth or irritate my gums</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste does nothing to protect my sensitive teeth: certain foods still causes tooth pain due to to sensitivity, such as cold foods and acidic fruits.</li>
    <li> This clearly does the job for one with sensitive teeth as I do!  It has the maximum amount of the active ingredient required for all sensitive toothpaste. One of the other important aspects is the very reasonable price. You do not have to spend twice as much to get real protection. Thanks Colgate!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with a coupon and on subscribe and save which helped more save some $ but I really like this tooth paste. I have very sensitive teeth when I drink soda or eat sugar. Sometimes I feel like I have a pain shooting through the whole row of my teeth. I think this tooth paste really helps  with my teeth and keeps them from hitting after I get the sugar /carbonation off.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brand of toothpaste for my cold sensitive teeth. It has definitely made an improvement. Before using it I would go on power dog walks for exercise in mid 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s F temps, come home and  soon after my front teeth hit the warmth inside they would ache so badly I sometimes cringed from the pain. After about a week using this toothpaste as advised (brush twice a day for 2 minutes each time using a good inch of toothpaste) I noticed improvement. Its been a few months now and I still feel some discomfort sometimes when I come in from the cold but its not painful and its over quick.</li>
    <li> I prefer the feel and taste of other toothpastes, but my dentist recommended this or similar products. It performs the job, but is nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> This is the best sensitive enamel protection toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve found it to last longer than some.  Nice find.</li>
    <li> After months of sensitivity and tooth pain, my dentist said I was over-brushing. I switched to a sonic toothbrush and this toothpaste and I&#x27;ve been pain free ever since! Even when I&#x27;m away from home, with a manual toothbrush, I am still free of sensitivity. It also does the job and keeps my mouth fresh without the nasty side effects of &amp;#34;Crest Pro-Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield&amp;#34; toothpaste I unfortunately used (peeling mouth and pain!). Never again! I am a Colgate Sensitive user for life.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the dentist recommended sensitive enamel toothpaste. This had better price that the ones at the local stores and so far the same quality</li>
    <li> Great! Has a nice taste.  Works just as well as Sensodyne at half the cost</li>
    <li> I prefer the colgate sensitive to sensidyne.  It tastes better to me and works.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for overly sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> love the toothpaste, has a great taste and whitens also. Arrived on time like was promised.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too fresh. Almost smells like medicine. Great for sensitive teeth and gums. Switched to another toothpaste and husband happy to use this for his sensitive mouth.</li>
    <li> Same product with better price. I wish I would have brushed my teeth more often as a child and would have more teeth now!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is seriously my FAVORITE toothpaste I have ever used. It is a fraction of the costs as its competitors toothpaste, It is very refreshing and it does foam not a lot but just enough, and it really does help protect/build my enamel. I have been using it for a little over 2 months now and  before I started using it I couldn&#x27;t really chew anything on my back teeth, but now that I have been using it for awhile I can chew an apple on my molars!</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive teeth my whole life and never a cavity or any issues other than that...so I have always used sensitive toothpaste. I have used this a little over 3 months now and my teeth hurt so much drinking ice water is almost unbearable not to mention what it has done to my gums (they bleed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am a bit upset but I bought it on a whim when my store was out of my usual stuff. I am going back this weekend. It is officially to much to bear.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is nice to have it come automatically so that you never run out of essentials. Good size.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to Sensodyne, does just as good of a job for much less $$$</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I tried Sensodyne first, but even though it helped with my tooth sensitivity, I really hated the taste. But the Colgate version tastes great and helps reduce my sensitivity just as much as the other brand did.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect by my dentist last week as I have sensitive teeth due to receding gums.  For the past year I have been using various kinds of Sensodyne toothpastes and Act Total mouth wash to treat my sensitivity and both have served me very well, as there were no cavities and very little buildup during my last cleaning and--of course--the sensitivity is gone.  The Colgate has the same active ingredients as the Sensodyne so I figured it must work just as well but I was wrong.  Within a few days one of my teeth became so sensitive it would hurt to drink cold water.  Not only that but before the day was over my teeth were covered in plaque as though I hadn&#x27;t brushed in days.  I have went back to using the Sensodyne and all of these problems are gone.  I used to use Colgate up until about 7 years ago when I went to the dentist and had several cavities.  After switching to Crest and now Sensodyne I have not had any problems with my teeth.  I do not recommend anyone use any Colgate toothpaste as it simply does not deliver on its promises and does not protect your teeth as it should.  The only reason I can see dentists recommending Colgate so often is because it guarantees you will be back which, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t advertise on their label.</li>
    <li> My wife has sensitive teeth and gums, and she needs a toothpaste that contains a desensitizer and which is low in abrasiveness.  While there are many products out there which have the desensitizer, nearly all of them are highly abrasive, with silica typically #2 on the list of ingredients.  Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste is the only one we have found that my wife can tolerate - it both desensitizes and is low in abrasiveness, with silica down at the #4 spot on the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate has so many variations of toothpaste and it is often difficult to tell from the packaging what the differences are.  Our local stores are no longer carrying this particular Colgate line, choosing instead to fill the shelves with endless \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; alternatives.  I was glad to see that I could order this from Amazon at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;It came on time and was delivered as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;Pro:I think its doing its thing. It works work well for sensitive teeth. It taste pretty good too and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering mint flavor afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: appears a little runny? It gets messy when i try to get the paste out but that might be me, no one else at home says otherwise.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and costs MUCH less than Sensodyne. Tastes much better too.</li>
    <li> Havent used this yet, but am sure it will relieve my burning sensations</li>
    <li> My mom has had enamel issues/discomfort for the longest time. She is so sensitive that eating/drinking anything that is not room temperature will hurt her teeth. She tried many brands and options, even natural teeth cleaning powder.. whatever that is. And this toothpaste has been the best by far. It&#x27;s hard to find in our regular stores, so we always buy it thru Amazon</li>
    <li> This seems to work pretty well for sensitive teeth. My husband is extremely sensitive to cold, and this stops him from screaming like a five year old girl when he comes into contact with cold things. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, he still finds other things to scream about, but it isn&#x27;t his teeth as often.</li>
    <li> I use to buy sensodyne but not anymore. This is my number one go to tooth paste. This is the only place I can actually find this tooth paste too. It is a bit disappointing but I will buy it threw amazon anytime. My teeth don&#x27;t get a sharp pain from cold drinks or anything now. My teeth are starting to feel stronger. I don&#x27;t get migraines from my teeth being in pain anymore. I really do love this product!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Many brands that have whiting that irritates sensitive teeth.  This does not.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste out there for sensitive teeth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> have used for several years and it completely desensitizes my teeth.  no discomfort!</li>
    <li> this pack of four big great toothpaste at a great price,so happy..I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive does help  prevent pain from sensitive teeth. It&#x27;s better than other toothpaste brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I was reccomended this product by a friend who is a dental hygienist. I have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste has worked great. It has a nice minty flavor and freshens your breath quite well. I ordered it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local store so I can&#x27;t compare the prices but it seems like a decent deal to me. I would reccomend this product to others with sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste after I developed a mouth sore.  My dentist said I needed to avoid products with whitening and tartar control.  I was very pleased with this toothpaste.  I have sensitive teeth  and I am careful about using any products that might  irritate my teeth or gums.  It cleaned my mouth well and my teeth were not sensitive while I was using it. It taste&#x27;s great and left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I like the idea of protecting the enamel on my teeth. Colgate has always been one of my favorite brands.  I grew up using it.  Now that I am older and I have sensitive teeth I like using a toothpaste from a company I trust.  I used Colgate toothpaste while I was growing up and it kept my teeth pretty healthy.</li>
    <li> I think this works as well as Sensodyn. The mint flavor is on the weak side but it definitely works for my sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Some toothpaste is grainy, some has a weird taste, and this is neither. I always thought it was terrible that I had to try to avoid such gross characteristics of toothpaste. This toothpaste leaves you feeling clean and minty fresh!</li>
    <li> Received this the other day. I got it party because I didn&#x27;t find a good price for sensodine and I am glad I didn&#x27;t. I like this version much better.</li>
    <li> The items  were old , damage and not new at all I do not recommend it. I wish I could give them 0 star.</li>
    <li> Thus teetpaste wuz god fer my.  Iffn u bee neding pan releeef yo shood ooze that teetpast.  Vari goood stuf.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product as described, excellent price.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have one tooth that becomes sensitive once and awhile.  And when it does, it&#x27;s awful.  Hot, cold, sweet, acidic, and even just taking in air through my mouth sets it off.  I regularly use an all natural toothpaste, but when my tooth acts up, I switch to a sensitive formula until it&#x27;s better.  So this last time, I went out and bought this toothpaste from Colgate to try.  Before I&#x27;d been using a free sample of Sensodyne, but it ran out.  I purchased Colgate&#x27;s sensitive because it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Great minty flavor that isn&#x27;t too strong yet still freshens breath.&lt;br /&gt;- Helped calm my overly sensitive tooth in about 4-5 days (2x per day)&lt;br /&gt;- Nice foaming, just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;- Love the tube.  It stands upright, taking up less room.  Squeezes easily with no mess.  Flip-top cap/lid is sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Contains saccharin and sorbitol, which I don&#x27;t like.  I prefer xylitol in my toothpaste which this doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this toothpaste if you need help for tooth sensitivity.  Even though it&#x27;s only one tooth for me, it becomes very bothersome sometimes, so I&#x27;ll use this toothpaste during those times.</li>
    <li> Great choice and price!  Clean feeling after brushing and I can tell a difference in the level of sensitivity I experience.</li>
    <li> Works every bit as well as Sensodyne to reduce tooth sensitivity, but at a MUCH lower price.  My husband and I used Sensodyne for years, and although I really liked it, I cringed every time I had to buy a new tube.  I saw this at the store one day and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since the price was so much better.  It took a little while to adjust to the different taste - not because it was bad, just because it was quite a bit different than the Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Colgate Sensitive to anyone with sensitive teeth.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how it works, but I can tell you that it absolutely DOES reduce tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I tried Colgate sensitive tooth paste because it was cheaper then other brands.  Then my gums became inflamed and bleeding, I never thought it was the toothpaste until someone told me it was the Colgate toothpaste.  I have changed back to my original toothpaste and the bleeding and inflamed gums stopped.  I will never use a colgate product again.</li>
    <li> A couple of months ago, out of the blue, my teeth started hurting.  Not terribly but definitely enough to notice.&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to be stupid and to get to the dentist, post haste.  Thinking there was some major issue, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was neither an infection, nor gum disease, nor anything else really awful that would wind up costing me a lot of money to fix. My dentist said that the enamel was wearing causing sensitivity in my teeth.  He recommended a couple different types of toothpaste and gave me a scrip for an oral rinse. I bought several different toothpastes for sensitive teeth, and while they did seem to help,&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the taste of any of them AND they seemed to me to be really expensive, given how quickly the tube is finished. Just for the heck of it, I looked on Amazon and found this Colgate toothpaste. Well, not only is the texture nice, it&#x27;s foamy (which I personally like), it IS working because my teeth have totally stopped hurting and the taste is great. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> when you Subscribe &amp; Save. I recently got braces so I&#x27;m constantly brushing my teeth and I have sensitive teeth. So I decide to stock up on this. I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of toothpaste. Also, because I&#x27;m brushing so much more the enamel protect is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this a bit more than Sensodyne, which I&#x27;ve used for a long time. It just doesn&#x27;t taste as bad. My teeth have been sensitive for a while so I always get the sensitive toothpastes. Works great!</li>
    <li> Colgate works just fine. I used Sensodyne but it was getting pricey so I switched to Colgate. I liked it but saw it was made in Mexico. Nothing against Mexico but I try to by as much as I can MADE IN THE USA! I&#x27;ll pay a little extra and am now using a different brand Made in the USA</li>
    <li> Works great. Cheaper than other brands out there and does the job. Been using it for years and it keeps my sensitivity at bay.</li>
    <li> This helped my sensitive teeth better than the one recommended by my dentist - you know the more expensive one that starts with an S.</li>
    <li> After having some dental work done, I noticed a couple of my teeth were sensitive and one really gave me trouble, so much so that I needed a root canal.  After the endodontist gave me my post-procedure instructions, he said to start using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth but not to use anything with the whiteners or tartar control as those ingredients could cause more damage. He said ALL products for sensitive teeth have the same active ingredient and the same per centage of the ingredient--the only difference is your preference for the taste of the product.  I&#x27;ve tried others and like this so far and it works just like the others.  Oh, the endodontist said he started his two children on it so they&#x27;d be used to it and that&#x27;s ALL his family uses.</li>
    <li> I was using Sensodyne, but this had a better price so I decided to try it out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now.  I like the flavor better than the other two I tried by Sensodyne.  Also, it foams up better than Sensodyne did.  I never felt like my teeth were really clean before, but this doesn&#x27;t leave behind a weird film feeling like the other did.  More importantly, it&#x27;s working just as well for my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Whitening toothpaste is too strong for me and burns and dries out my mouth and lips. So many toothpaste on the market have whitening and while white teeth are great, sensitive teeth and burned dried out lips are not.  I love how my teeth and mouth feel after I use this. The taste is very mild so that is good too.</li>
    <li> I have found the Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste to give very good results and that&#x27;s why I gave it a 5 star rating.  I have used it for several years and have no sensitivity to my teeth at my 6 month check up. It has been years since I have had any sensitivity to cold or hot food or drinks.  I have found Amazon to have the best price on this toothpaste!  I recommend Colgate Sensitive Toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  As near as I can determine, it has the same active ingredient that&lt;br /&gt;Sensodyne has at probably half the cost of Sensodyne.  It is so convenient to&lt;br /&gt;have this delivered automatically by Amazon and the price is still less than what&lt;br /&gt;most drugstores want for it.  Bottom line is when I use this toothpaste, it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;hurt when I brush my sensitive teeth.  I ate too many lemons for too many years&lt;br /&gt;and the enamel on my teeth eroded and makes them VERY sensitive.  But&lt;br /&gt;this completely reduces the sensitivity when I brush.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist for my incredibly sensitive teeth. After repeated use, the extreme sensitivity (from wear and dental work) has diminished, but of course not all of it is gone (but I don&#x27;t expect to find that from any toothpaste). I searched everywhere for this toothpaste, but could only find it on Amazon, so I went ahead and bought several. I only trust my sensitive teeth to this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, especially for those of us with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Three Colgate products helped reduced sensitive tooth and gum problems my husband was having: Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Mousewash  + Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste + Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft.  He was very happy with the relief provided by using these three products together.  We highly recommend the combination.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works pretty well with my sensitive teeth and gums. Very light on abrasive side. Leaves very fresh sent and feeling in the mouth after brushing.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price. I am very satisfied. My thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome value and great toothpaste. I switched over from Sensodyne to this stuff and it works just as well and tastes much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely re-order this and use again. Cheaper and still gets the job done, if not better!</li>
    <li> cleans teeth.use it 2x a day and will continue to do so.Happy Buyer</li>
    <li> I have always used this brand because of my sensitive teeth.  This is the only place I was able to locate it for this price.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this after he filled my cavities, so I am guessing this has some dental benefits. The paste does taste good and my teeth do feel better (less sensitivity)</li>
    <li> My teeth are extremely sensitive. The dentist had me using Sensodyne.  However, I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Colgate customer. It was a happy day when Colgate came out with their Sensitive toothpaste.  It&#x27;s far more affordable than Sensodyne.  I&#x27;m not keen on all of the marketing hype on &amp;#34;whitening,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;enamel protect&amp;#34;, etc. as the ingredients listed are all exactly the same, but the sensitive part DOES work.  I&#x27;m a happy Colgate fan.</li>
    <li> I have always used this and couldn&#x27;t find in stores, so I bought it online and happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My family and I use this everyday and we all love it.. Great toothpaste would recommend</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great price on a much needed product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and this is the ONE toothpaste that does treat that plus it protects my enamel.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great - exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Colgate, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> My husband only uses sensitive toothpaste, so I ordered this for him on subscribe and save. He was disappointed at the results. He  had expected his teeth to be less sensitive after each brushing, like the toothpaste we buy at the discount stores for a buck. He has deep gum erosion, so needs a toothpaste that can help by keeping his teeth less sensitive, but this didn&#x27;t do it for him.  He  also didn&#x27;t care for the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, guess who&#x27;s using this toothpaste now?  :-)  Yep, that would be me (since it&#x27;s a 4-pack), even though I don&#x27;t really require sensitive toothpaste. I like that it&#x27;s a flip-top cap so the cap doesn&#x27;t get lost. I also think it tastes pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, one of us likes it; one of us doesn&#x27;t.  Guess that&#x27;s why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream (oops, probably shouldn&#x27;t mention that when I&#x27;m writing about a toothpaste; lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Contains SLS and I did not realize that from the description. I had to give it to my husband because I am sensitive to that ingredient.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and they stopped selling it at the grocery store!  I have sensitive teeth, but some toothpastes are too harsh and cause my mouth to peel.  This one does not cause that problem and helps with sensitivity as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having sensitive teeth on and off these last couple of years.  Occasionally, I used Sensodyne, but since I am not a fan of how it tastes like, and also felt like it was too expensive, I decided to give this one a try instead.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth are less sensitive to acidic and cold foods now.  Colgate Enamel Protect does have a more refreshing taste and is cheaper than Sensodyne.  Once enamel gets worn off it won&#x27;t grow back, so I&#x27;m doing whatever I can to protect it.</li>
    <li> The price is good, but the flavor is so so, not bad, but also not very pleasant. It&#x27;s okay, but the service is good, so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good sensitive tooth toothpaste.  I had tried the Sensodyne and found that to be not my favorite tastewise and a strange consistency.  This is like any other regular and has taken away most of my tooth sensitivity (I now only have sensations to extreme hot or cold but anyone might as well I suppose).</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Sensodyne with same ingredients.  Why spend for the brand</li>
    <li> I do like this toothpaste, it makes my teeth feel slick and clean after using my sonic brush.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh and nobody gags when they smell my breath.  The sensitivity doesn&#x27;t seem to be greatly affected; certainly not as well as Sensodyne or the other brans spedifically aimed at reducing pain.  If you want clean, fresh teeh, cavity protection and a modest reduction in pain, this will be a good choice.</li>
    <li> The only sensitive toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have whitening.</li>
    <li> This is the white paste product.  Not so minty as the gel.  Has some grittiness to help with the teeth stains.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Other brands taste awful to me, but this one is very mild tasting. I find my teeth are actually a lot less sensitive when I use it regularly, so I am planning on continuing with this toothpaste for as long as it remains available!</li>
    <li> I swear by this toothpaste. It really does eliminate tooth sensitivity while still getting them clean and fluoridated. If you have sensitive teeth, this is your toothpaste.</li>
</ol>
