      <li>I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>This works great for my fine 4b hair and my daughters thick 4a hair.</li>
      <li>Simply work through wet or damp hair and the results are perfect.</li>
      <li>good to apply while you have wet hair.</li>
      <li>Sure it doesn&#x27;t flake, but is bunching up into little jelly like clumps any better?</li>
      <li>i love it, i used other gels that cause dandruff, but this didn&#x27;t, really good gel, and i totally recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to last one week with a co-wash or two in between.</li>
      <li>I use it for my edges instead of my entire hair because I am looking for more curls.</li>
      <li>The reason why I like this gel so much (bought it by chance the first time).</li>
      <li>I use this on my hair (when dry) to calm any fly aways and to hold down my layered hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and natural and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Be detailed and specific.</li>
      <li>so it really helps defines my waves.</li>
      <li>I made sure my hair was damp, not dripping wet before adding this gel.  </li>
      <li>I only use it for the edges and sides of my hair to keep it smooth, flat and frizz free.</li>
      <li>I put it in my hair while wet and let it air dry--sometimes there are crunchy parts, but it is easy to finger</li>
      <li>Also I can rock a twist out for a few more days.  </li>
      <li>It does leave your hair hard like most gels, but it does keep my flyaways down and smooth.</li>
      <li>its not stiff or clumpy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural has no alcohol and it leaves your hair soft shiny and wavy.</li>
      <li>So far, I do not know if it is my technique</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s soft to the touch -</li>
      <li>I have natural 34/a-b hair</li>
      <li>I have been natural for about 5 months now</li>
      <li>I have natural 4a/4b hair.</li>
      <li>Can be found at your local drug stores though for a reasonable price.       </li>
      <li>With this mixture, I avoid the white film and crunchy feeling that is often caused by too much product.  </li>
      <li>I oil my scalp and lightly mist my hair with the spritz a few times during the 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>this makes my hair curly and soft and you just use a dab.</li>
      <li>keeps your hair in place but does not make it hard, keeps it nice and soft while giving a wet look appearance.</li>
      <li>and I promise you no other product that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling natural as it claims, but no gel that claims this actually does it.</li>
      <li>I am Japanese, and I have naturally wavy long hair cut in layers.  </li>

<li> The hold is softer that eco, but my wash and go&#x27;s last as long as I want them to.</li>
<li> What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;Not too short and not too long.</li>
<li> My hair stretched well with it as I have mixed 3c, 4a through 4c hair.  </li>
<li> I have 3c/4a/3b, low porosity, dry, medium/fine mixture.  </li>
<li> and it seems to not dry out my hair like other products even when i wash it out it feels conditioned</li>
<li> The style sticks all day long until I brush it out</li>
<li> The curls are defined, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and hair has bounce to it.</li>
<li> I co-wash my 4a/b hair then apply IC to my hair while it is wet.  </li>
<li> Absolutely no residue</li>
<li> It has been the only gel that keeps my hair under control without getting hard.  </li>
<li> After drying, my hair felt a little crunchy, so I will see if coconut oil will soften it.  </li>
<li> I have a heavy hand when I&#x27;m applying products because of this</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other gels in the past that leave the hair smelly and hard.</li>
<li> For twisted updos, I layer products in my hair: leave-in, Shea butter, water spritz (contains glycerin) and finally the gel.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all sticky or hard.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or straw-like either.  </li>
<li> I have used it a couple of times, and it makes my hair look dull.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what type of curl I have, but this product was ICKY.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re afraid of build up...use a clarifying shampoo (as I do)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best gel for natural kinky curly hair! It&#x27;s all natural has no alcohol and it leaves your hair soft shiny and wavy. I have 4a hair so it really helps defines my waves. It&#x27;s good for slicking back your hair too. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all sticky or hard. Nice smell also.</li>
    <li> I have natural 34/a-b hair and I prefer this gel to the eco-styler.  I used this as a multipurpose gel.  For twisted updos, I layer products in my hair: leave-in, Shea butter, water spritz (contains glycerin) and finally the gel.  My updo will last for about two weeks. I oil my scalp and lightly mist my hair with the spritz a few times during the 2 weeks.  I can unravel my twist and my hair is shiny and moisturized. Also I can rock a twist out for a few more days.  For wash-n-go&#x27;s and free flowing twist, I mix everything in a jar. I have a heavy hand when I&#x27;m applying products because of this I have yet to master the application of KCCC in my hair. So i used Fantasia IC gel as an alternative. In a jar, I mix a leave-in, cd&#x27;s hair milk and grapeseed oil and the gel.  I used the shingling method for application.  With this mixture, I avoid the white film and crunchy feeling that is often caused by too much product.  I&#x27;m able to last one week with a co-wash or two in between.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but love for this gel. I have natural 4a/4b hair. The best thing about this gel is it does not flake. After washing my hair, using a leave-in conditioner, shea butter, and the holding gel...my twist outs turn out defined and curly. They last through the week too..doesn&#x27;t not have to keep reusing the gel to get great results, and after it dries, it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave a residue. Just soft, nice hair. I&#x27;ve used other gels in the past that leave the hair smelly and hard. Not IC Fantasia, which has a pleasant scent.    If you&#x27;re afraid of build up...use a clarifying shampoo (as I do) every two weeks to a month. It lasts for 2 to 3 months at a time if used once a week. Can be found at your local drug stores though for a reasonable price.       Ingredients: Purified Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Carbomer. Troethanolamine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Dimethicone Copolyol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Polysorbate-20, Benzophenone04, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylchlorioisothiazolinone Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum).</li>
    <li> I am Japanese, and I have naturally wavy long hair cut in layers.  I use this product for the &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34; look, and it works perfectly giving my waves volume without being stiff.  My hair feels soft and natural and smooth.  By the way, I&amp;#34;m the wife (I&#x27;m not Jeffrey).  LOL.  We use the same Amazon account.</li>
    <li> I used EcoStyler Gel and it didn&#x27;t work for me. Fantasia IC  does a great job.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or straw-like either.  I have 3c/4a/3b, low porosity, dry, medium/fine mixture.  Fantasia gives me a medium-soft set that can be styled further if you like.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no residue and it makes the hair look permed (baby hairs) if they are frizzy by any means!</li>
    <li> Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this gel... it&#x27;s the only one he found that doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes, not even after sleeping... I&#x27;m not a big fan of gel in a jar, but they also have the tubes, which I prefer... but he likes the jar...</li>
    <li> This hair gel keeps my frizzy hair in check. I put it in my hair while wet and let it air dry--sometimes there are crunchy parts, but it is easy to finger comb it out.</li>
    <li> The reason why I like this gel so much (bought it by chance the first time). good to apply while you have wet hair. keeps your hair in place but does not make it hard, keeps it nice and soft while giving a wet look appearance. you can re-wet your hair later on and it will keep on looking good. also does not flake and make residue all over the place. in addition it is good for your hair. (I think it makes your nails grow for some reason as well).</li>
    <li> this makes my hair curly and soft and you just use a dab. its not stiff or clumpy and it seems to not dry out my hair like other products even when i wash it out it feels conditioned</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and intact, no product spillage or waste.  I am doing wash and go&#x27;s this summer. I washed my hair with As I Am cowash, followed up with As I Am leave in conditioner.  I made sure my hair was damp, not dripping wet before adding this gel.  I like it a lot.  My hair stretched well with it as I have mixed 3c, 4a through 4c hair.  My hands and neck did not have a sticky feeling. After drying, my hair felt a little crunchy, so I will see if coconut oil will soften it.  So far, I do not know if it is my technique has gotten better or the product, but I feel that this gel gave me the better wash and go.  I did not have the best wash and go results with Shea moisture, As I am, or Eco styler gels.</li>
    <li> i love it, i used other gels that cause dandruff, but this didn&#x27;t, really good gel, and i totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for about 5 months now and I have been through so many products for curl definition. My hair is considered to be 4b/c texture and I promise you no other product that I&#x27;ve tried has defined my curls like IC aloe vera gel. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This product fits the description. I use it for my edges instead of my entire hair because I am looking for more curls. It makes my hair shiny. Also, there are no residue.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most favorite gel. Every month it&#x27;s in my shopping cart at my local Walgreens. It does leave your hair hard like most gels, but it does keep my flyaways down and smooth. I only use it for the edges and sides of my hair to keep it smooth, flat and frizz free. It&#x27;s some great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have puerto rican hair (not curly or straight, just frizzy) and I love this product. I braid my hair with this product before I go to sleep and wake up and take my hair out... Beautiful! The curls are defined, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and hair has bounce to it. I never have to worry about white residue with this product. I never have to use another type of gel again.</li>
    <li> Sure it doesn&#x27;t flake, but is bunching up into little jelly like clumps any better? It does give your hair some extra shine. No idea what the sparkle lites are, but they seem to work. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling natural as it claims, but no gel that claims this actually does it. Like it, don&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and I am very pleased with it.  It has been the only gel that keeps my hair under control without getting hard.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Best Aloe gel you can find.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to pull my hair back into a neat pony tail or bun or at all really because I have thick full hair that is also layered. This product is seriously amazing. I use this on my hair (when dry) to calm any fly aways and to hold down my layered hair. The style sticks all day long until I brush it out and it&#x27;s soft to the touch - I love this!</li>
    <li> I love this gel!  I co-wash my 4a/b hair then apply IC to my hair while it is wet.  I then blot my hair with a towel and head out the door.  My hair dries in lovely kinky curly coils!  Love love love it.</li>
    <li> I love the IC Fantasia product line. This works great for my fine 4b hair and my daughters thick 4a hair. Excellent curl definition, no flaking, residue or sticky feeling. The hold is softer that eco, but my wash and go&#x27;s last as long as I want them to. Simply work through wet or damp hair and the results are perfect.</li>
    <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, [...]</li>
    <li> I did not like this gel at all.  Definitely not for my type of hair.  I don&#x27;t know what type of curl I have, but this product was ICKY.</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times, and it makes my hair look dull. I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> This gel got my edges on FLEEK! lol</li>
