      <li>The clip was broke and the piece might be great for Halloween but not for trying out bangs.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and was happy that I went with this one.</li>
      <li>and everybody loved it.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with this hair piece.</li>
      <li>so glad I did!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s at a fantastic price, too!!</li>
      <li>I liked this bang hair piece.</li>
      <li>so it blends nice to layers cuts, shorter hair, or longer like mine.</li>
      <li>I plan to ombré the ends of my own hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve washed it and tried to blow it on warm to give it some lift, volume, etc.</li>
      <li>I get complements on how nice my hair looks now</li>
      <li>It matched my hair color perfectly and looked natural</li>
      <li>head on top.</li>
      <li>BUT... it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; on the top.</li>
      <li>I like this piece, as it covers the top of my head</li>
      <li>love it would order with you again.</li>
      <li>This is a ok product, I am going to try and get my hair dresser to help me style this.</li>
      <li>This is super nice for the price..</li>
      <li>Another great thing for me is that this piece fits snug but not pulling, and looks natural.</li>
      <li>This piece is a perfect match to my caramel dark brown hair color.</li>
      <li>I wear it all the time to hide my fine thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I bought these bangs hair piece to change my look and it is super cute and the color match my hair.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d just get a cheap one to see if it was an option.</li>
      <li>I do not think this piece is heat resistant but while damp all synthetic non heat friendly wigs can be curled or straighter.</li>
      <li>I wear it daily and its holding up so good.</li>
      <li>Only it would be perfect if the back length is longer.</li>
      <li>Color is good attachment is great but very thin to stay in hair and it may work for some but just not for me.</li>
      <li>:) i don&#x27;t use it everyday but it&#x27;s really cute for an every so often typa deal :)</li>
      <li>clips were durable and strong and blended really well with my hair.</li>
      <li>They need to redesign that part, but one can easily keep it in place using bobby pins so its not a deal breaker and most of the products out there have this same comb/clip.</li>
      <li>Would be okay for a costume clip in piece, but not everyday wear.</li>
      <li>but this one looks more natural being thinner.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t impulsively cut my hair and it was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>gets tangled like any other wigs but just comb it with a comb and ur good to go...</li>
      <li>Did not look right and could not figure out how to clip this in so</li>
      <li>I bought it to wear because I have to color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks when the roots are white on the top of my head</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This hair piece matches my color pretty closely.  </li>
      <li>exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>I actually bought 3 more</li>
      <li>The entire top of my head is camouflaged with this piece.</li>
      <li>:) It did take a long time to come in, but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Very embarrassing.</li>
      <li>I have hair additions that are much thicker</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>This product was very inexpensive</li>
      <li>It was much lighter than pictured.</li>
      <li>Feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>and I wear them everyday and it sure match my real hair.</li>
      <li>it looks realistic...</li>
      <li>so I can finally have a natural looking fun hairstyle with this piece covering my bald spots.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural, no one ever questions it.</li>
      <li>I have the option of cute playful bangs and the ability to wear this down, pulled back on the sides, or my favorite look, a flirty layered looking pony tail, or a side messy bun.</li>
      <li>It make me feel like a different person ;)</li>
      <li>the bangs are way too short and the rest of it fits like an entire full wig.  </li>
      <li>try that one instead if you want something that will stay in your hair even in wind and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I read reviews that said it looked natural and there is no way this looks natural at all.  </li>
      <li>Natural- looking.</li>
      <li>The only problem is the hair looks really shinny</li>
      <li>Thank you for giving me a smile for such a low low price.</li>
      <li>It is thin enough to look like my own hair.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering a few more and looking for other colors.</li>
      <li>It was much nicer than I expected.</li>
      <li>a little bit more expensive but well worth it.</li>

<li> my naturally died dark brown hair.</li>
<li> Oh and I always wet my wigs and flat iron them on low low low while damp</li>
<li> Color is a dark redish brown not dark brown..</li>
<li> Poorly made - color different than expected - light brown in color was received and the cut of the hair piece was difficult to see a bang - all is shaggy.</li>
<li> Not too shiny like other hair/products.</li>
<li> I pinned it in as a half-wig since my hair is black.</li>
<li> I do think the mini combs inside the hairpiece designed to hold it in place are a waste of time.</li>
<li> Did not look like the picture,  was just round no fringe pieces</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve washed it 2x since owning it and have used my flat iron on it to tame the crazy hair after its washed and dried.</li>
<li> and I mean a lot of hair on the crown and fringe/bang area of my head.</li>
<li> I bought this to help with hiding my thinning hair, I previously used powder cover ups and was sick of the mess.</li>
<li> I am not happy with it.</li>
<li> not happy</li>
<li> and you can tell it is fake.</li>
<li> For the price you literally can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
<li> Too bad...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m kinda disappointed, but I will keep it for the price it is not too bad.</li>
<li> Looks terrible and REALLY fake....</li>

    <li> Color is a dark redish brown not dark brown..didnt match at all! Also the bangs were short so looked kinda geeky</li>
    <li> Natural- looking. Feels like real hair. Not too shiny like other hair/products. I do think the mini combs inside the hairpiece designed to hold it in place are a waste of time. Don&#x27;t really work. They need to redesign that part, but one can easily keep it in place using bobby pins so its not a deal breaker and most of the products out there have this same comb/clip. Also, this product is about 3x fuller than the Jennifer Simpson brand and cost 1/3 the price.  So it&#x27;s a really good deal as well.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  The clip was broke and the piece might be great for Halloween but not for trying out bangs. I could only rate this product by given it a star but actually if I could there would be no star at all.</li>
    <li> Looks terrible and REALLY fake.... I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> when you think you want to cut your hair.  Throw this baby on and it will save you a lot of heartbreak.  I didn&#x27;t buy this to wear in public.  I bought it so I wouldn&#x27;t impulsively cut my hair and it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> the bangs are way too short and the rest of it fits like an entire full wig.  if i hadnt tried to make it work, i would return it.</li>
    <li> Poorly made - color different than expected - light brown in color was received and the cut of the hair piece was difficult to see a bang - all is shaggy.</li>
    <li> I like this piece, as it covers the top of my head the the side hairs just blend in perfectly with my naturally died dark brown hair. BUT... it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; on the top. No poof, and I can&#x27;t find a way to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; it so I don&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;flat hair&amp;#34; head on top. Too bad... I&#x27;ve washed it and tried to blow it on warm to give it some lift, volume, etc. and can&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. You cannot tell that it is a hair piece and everybody loved it. It make me feel like a different person ;)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this hair piece. I wear it all the time to hide my fine thinning hair. Looks very natural, no one ever questions it. I get complements on how nice my hair looks now :) It did take a long time to come in, but worth the wait. And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Color is good attachment is great but very thin to stay in hair and it may work for some but just not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with hiding my thinning hair, I previously used powder cover ups and was sick of the mess. So I found this and gave it a try. Im so glad I did!

For the price you literally can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>

    <li> This is a ok product, I am going to try and get my hair dresser to help me style this.</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful. Only it would be perfect if the back length is longer.</li>
    <li> The piece was a great color but it has no BANGS</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Looks great.</li>
    <li> Too poofy and wiggy looking for me.  Would be okay for a costume clip in piece, but not everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never worn a hair piece so I thought I&#x27;d just get a cheap one to see if it was an option. I read the reviews and was happy that I went with this one. It matches my hair color and I thought it was good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair piece matches my color pretty closely.  I bought it to wear because I have to color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks when the roots are white on the top of my head and when I can&#x27;t just get to dye it, I will put this on.  This hair piece is perfect for those in between times.  My husband didn&#x27;t even notice that I had it on.  It isn&#x27;t bulky like wigs, it blends in with my hair color ( I will dye my hair closer to this hair color of the piece), it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; or itchy.The clips on the inside holds it in place.  It&#x27;s at a fantastic price, too!!</li>
    <li> I liked this bang hair piece. It was much nicer than I expected. It matched my hair color perfectly and looked natural</li>
    <li> Did not look right and could not figure out how to clip this in so it looks like bangs.</li>
    <li> This product was very inexpensive i gotwhat I paid for i guess.  I am not happy with it. I read reviews that said it looked natural and there is no way this looks natural at all.  not happy so i ended up ordering the Clip in Bang by Jessica S and that one is awesome!!  try that one instead if you want something that will stay in your hair even in wind and looks natural. a little bit more expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Did not look like the picture,  was just round no fringe pieces</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted. clips were durable and strong and blended really well with my hair. :) i don&#x27;t use it everyday but it&#x27;s really cute for an every so often typa deal :)</li>
    <li> love it would order with you again.</li>
    <li> So I have an ovary disease that has caused me to lose a lot and I mean a lot of hair on the crown and fringe/bang area of my head. Very embarrassing. I have several hair pieces, some cost well over $100. This piece is a perfect match to my caramel dark brown hair color. It covers all my thinning. The entire top of my head is camouflaged with this piece. I have the option of cute playful bangs and the ability to wear this down, pulled back on the sides, or my favorite look, a flirty layered looking pony tail, or a side messy bun. Another great thing for me is that this piece fits snug but not pulling, and looks natural. It is thin enough to look like my own hair. I have hair additions that are much thicker but this one looks more natural being thinner. I will be ordering a few more and looking for other colors. This piece comes just below the chin so it blends nice to layers cuts, shorter hair, or longer like mine. I plan to ombré the ends of my own hair so I can finally have a natural looking fun hairstyle with this piece covering my bald spots. Thank you for giving me a smile for such a low low price. Oh and I always wet my wigs and flat iron them on low low low while damp so I can bring them back to life after a few weeks of wear and to make the ends not curl in so much. I do not think this piece is heat resistant but while damp all synthetic non heat friendly wigs can be curled or straighter.</li>
    <li> it took forever to come i kept checking to see if they updated on where they sent it and for a whole month it was still in china then a few days before the arrival date it was in san fran then i finally got it like 3-4 days before the date...it looks realistic...when i got mine one of the clip fell off but i sewed it back on....gets tangled like any other wigs but just comb it with a comb and ur good to go...</li>
    <li> This is super nice for the price.. I actually bought 3 more and I wear them everyday and it sure match my real hair.</li>
    <li> It was much lighter than pictured. I pinned it in as a half-wig since my hair is black. The style looked two-tone (think Rihanna with one side shaved). I got compliments and it worked out well.</li>
