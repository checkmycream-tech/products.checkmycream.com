      <li>Love the smell, price is much better than in stores.</li>
      <li>Best deal I have ever found on the  number #1 rated men&#x27;s fragrance by men&#x27;s fitness magazine in an independent test taken by women for their favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>ONE of my favorite colognes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering this cologne for my husband for many years now.</li>
      <li>we love this one too-for our grandson.</li>
      <li>The only cologne my husband wears, he loves it smells great!</li>
      <li>That is to say, while most sellers claim this is a combination of &amp;#34;citrus, lavender, sandalwood, and spicy berries&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Online pricing is just better than going to department stores.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m ok with this cologne</li>
      <li>I get kind of a citrus and freshly showered vibe up front, followed by something that you could kind of describe as &amp;#34;spicy berries&amp;#34; I guess.</li>
      <li>i love that</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent from my husband, and whenever I smell it I think of him.</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this seller.</li>
      <li>but this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>fast delivery, good price.</li>
      <li>Perfect, exactly as expected!</li>
      <li>But if you go easy on the trigger</li>
      <li>Smells good and fast free shipping from amazon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like this as much as Cerruti 1881 (which is similar but better, more sophisticated, and more restrained imo), or Azzaro Pour Homme, but I do still like it a lot.</li>
      <li>and well it smelled cool popel3@columbus.rr.com</li>
      <li>Love this smell - it&#x27;s a timeless classic.</li>
      <li>Once I forgot this wasn&#x27;t Cerruti and applied as many sprays as I do for Cerruti and then instead of the &amp;#34;spicy berry&amp;#34; cacophony that eventually dries down into a nice pine, I smelled like burning tires all day.</li>
      <li>On the other hand its a pleasant cacophony.</li>
      <li>Only kind my husband wears.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind he ever asks for.</li>
      <li>Old Favorite.</li>
      <li>I live in a house full of women who think it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>The drydown is piney and makes me think of a slightly sweet smelling evergreen forest floor, which I actually really like.</li>
      <li>The price that I paid was very reasonable, shipping was on time, packaged well.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes it!</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>and I had to get more of the same.</li>
      <li>Pretty well packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t own a full sized bottle when I first reviewed this, but I do now because it can be applied after a swim in a chlorinated pool, which cannot be said of either of my regular daily wearers.</li>
      <li>Similar scent but not as strong as it was before.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost 10 years and it smells like the real deal.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This was  a gift for my father and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>Real product</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>The knockoffs of this product just don&#x27;t measure up to the real deal.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of high school dances.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend</li>
      <li>Clean smelling...lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Its a big, powerful 80&#x27;s fougere (</li>
      <li>Works well with my new chemistry (unlike before when I was smoking).</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than at local retailers.</li>
      <li>Quite a strong cologne and affordable,  last at least for the whole day.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the one cologne I never get bored of , very refreshing.</li>
      <li>got exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Smells the exact same as it always has, lasts all day long &amp; definately is not a knock off!!</li>
      <li>given the amount you should apply it should last a very long time at a reasonable price.</li>

MY GIRLFRIENDS LOVED THE AROMA THEN.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THE H HAPPENED TO THIS GREAT PRODUCT OF FIFTEEN YEARS AGO..?...&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY , VERY, TICKED OFF AND UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS . I AM THROWING THIS IN THE GARBAGE,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.D. PAZ</li>

    <li> Great product and price! About 40% cheaper then buying it local. Smells good and fast free shipping from amazon. Great as a gift. Don&#x27;t be fooled by those \\&quot;perfume shops\\&quot; that sell products that look and smell like what you want but on the box it says \\&quot;inspired by ...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great to have the original. The knockoffs of this product just don&#x27;t measure up to the real deal. The price is palatable also.</li>
    <li> we love this one too-for our grandson. he loves the fragrance also.</li>
    <li> Ummmmmmm, this scent drives me NUTS!!  In a good way that is!!  I LOVE a man wearing this!</li>
    <li> like the cologne and well it smelled cool popel3@columbus.rr.com</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from my husband, and whenever I smell it I think of him. It&#x27;s the best smell in the world</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent.  Great gift item.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works well with my new chemistry (unlike before when I was smoking). Pretty well packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> Makes me smell good. Chicks dig it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent especially when I&#x27;m wearing it but for what I received, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. May have been watered down too much or is not original product. Similar scent but not as strong as it was before.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s hard to describe cologne, it&#x27;s very personal and the smell is different from body to another but it&#x27;s the one cologne I never get bored of , very refreshing. The cheapest price was on Amazon $24 for 3.4oz (100ml ) and delivered in 3 days, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Best deal I have ever found on the  number #1 rated men&#x27;s fragrance by men&#x27;s fitness magazine in an independent test taken by women for their favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been wearing it for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> This might be the quintessential 80&#x27;s cologne. Since I was a little kid during the 80&#x27;s you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be nostalgic about this stuff, but actually I never smelled it until I was over 30. I have to say though, I like this a lot. Its a big, powerful 80&#x27;s fougere (That&#x27;s &amp;#34;fern&amp;#34; in  French, but the truth is ferns have no scent, so its the name the French gave perfumes base around a citrus-lavender-vanilla combination, which in modern men&#x27;s colognes often morphes into citrus-lavender-sandalwood/cedar). This is a big 80&#x27;s scent all the way, which is why some people love it and why others hate it. That is to say, while most sellers claim this is a combination of &amp;#34;citrus, lavender, sandalwood, and spicy berries&amp;#34; (whatever those are), Guy Larouche actually lists 15 (Yes 15!) different notes: Basil, Rosemary, Green Mint, Verbana, Lemon (top), Angelica, Wormwood, Juniper, Coriander (heart), and Oak Moss, Patchouli, Cedar, Pine Needle, and Balsam (base). So this stuff is kind of like a scent stew where the perfumer took every nice smelling thing he could think of and threw them all in because he couldn&#x27;t bear to leave anything out. On the one hand, I don&#x27;t know about you, but my nose simply isn&#x27;t up to the task of picking out 15 separate notes, so Drakkar Noir is something of an Olfactory cacophony to me. On the other hand its a pleasant cacophony. I get kind of a citrus and freshly showered vibe up front, followed by something that you could kind of describe as &amp;#34;spicy berries&amp;#34; I guess. The drydown is piney and makes me think of a slightly sweet smelling evergreen forest floor, which I actually really like. I didn&#x27;t own a full sized bottle when I first reviewed this, but I do now because it can be applied after a swim in a chlorinated pool, which cannot be said of either of my regular daily wearers. I don&#x27;t like this as much as Cerruti 1881 (which is similar but better, more sophisticated, and more restrained imo), or Azzaro Pour Homme, but I do still like it a lot. I also now see why some people hate this though it IS easier to over apply than anything I&#x27;ve used myself. Once I forgot this wasn&#x27;t Cerruti and applied as many sprays as I do for Cerruti and then instead of the &amp;#34;spicy berry&amp;#34; cacophony that eventually dries down into a nice pine, I smelled like burning tires all day. But if you go easy on the trigger I feel this is a nice scent, and given the amount you should apply it should last a very long time at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> not knocking this drakkar but i want the smell of the 80s this not it. i cant find it no where. but this is pretty good. came before bit was due..i love that</li>
    <li> The perfect scent for my 41 year old husband.  Reminds me of the halls of highschool.</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and it lasts all day. Great product and excellent price.</li>
    <li> it smells very very nice.</li>
    <li> Only kind my husband wears.  Again, your prices are great.</li>
    <li> One........ONE of my favorite colognes. Reminds me of high school dances. Good stuff</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> It loses it&#x27;s fragrance almost immediately</li>
    <li> Great product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderfully sexy</li>
    <li> Excellent condition, good deal!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Just what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite scents and for the price , its a real bargain ,great product,service, well packed, no damaged a 5 star for sure</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than at local retailers. I live in a house full of women who think it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I think it wears well on me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews - Those reviews were posted by idiots!!! The product is perfectly fine!! Smells the exact same as it always has, lasts all day long &amp; definately is not a knock off!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Now I smell like an international spy!</li>

    <li> Quite a strong cologne and affordable,  last at least for the whole day.</li>
