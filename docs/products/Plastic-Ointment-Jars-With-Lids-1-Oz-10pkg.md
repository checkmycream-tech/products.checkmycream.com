      <li>prefer these over gotubes...easier to clean out and store in the shower, especially when there are 3 of us, using several different products when showering.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is very thick and heavy, which I think it&#x27;s very good in the long run and for storage.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and exactly what I expected!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The jars look as pictured. They are 2 inches in diameter and 1 &amp; 3/4 inches in height. They are double-walled, sturdy but lightweight. Made of PP #5 plastic which is supposed to be better than other kinds of plastic but all plastic will leach chemicals. I had ordered 4 sets (10 per package) but one jar and lid were missing from one of the packages, otherwise I would have given it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 1/2/2014: The jars I had originally bought are NOT the jars shown here as of this date. The jars I bought were domed (lid and base), double-walled and the lids made a perfect seal with the bases (no space, no lid overlapping the base). They were nicer looking than these. Please see photo under \\&quot;customer images of product\\&quot; and my name \\&quot;jamie\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 3/25/2014: Why does amazon continue to use my review for a product image that does not match what I actually bought?</li>
    <li> These jars were exactly as expected, and seem very durable, especially for the price. They are perfect for small applications, such as a travel lotion jar.</li>
    <li> they are exactly what is presented and will work well for storing salves</li>
    <li> These containers are the perfect size for the salve that i like to make and give to friends and family.  I received them propmtly and in perfect condition. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> These little jars where exactly what I needed. Customer Service was great !!! they were prompt and courteous. I will continue to use M. Jacobs &amp; sons for my jars.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my homemade chamomile hand salve and sugar scrubs.  Works great, clean, easy to open.  Lightweight and exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Good and sturdy, good quality. No worries about breakage when dropped or filled with hot liquids. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The jars were the perfect size for making salves and lip balms for gifts. The containers are solid white and did not leak at all. They are a smooth plastic so it is very easy to print your own labels and apply without much fuss. These are made of a pretty high quality plastic that would be easy to clean out, sanitize and re-use for the ultimate eco- friendly products.</li>
    <li> Very useful for home made toothpaste.</li>
    <li> These are NOT as pictured and the company does not do returns.  These are tall and skinny - not suitable for ointment at all.  It was my second order from them, and both are different that what is pictured.</li>
    <li> These jars are very similar to the ones I use in pharmacy when making ointments or creams.  I would recommend them if you are looking for just a few.</li>
    <li> These do not look like the jars I received.  The ones I received were rounded jars with rounde lids.  Not a deal breaker, but they were also much larger than I had anticipated.  I originally wanted something large enough to carry body butter in my purse.  I wanted it to be larger than the really small lip balm containers, but not as big as what I received.  I wanted something that looks like the size of this jar on my screen.  I&#x27;d say, twice the size of an eye shadow jar (l&#x27;oreal hip eye shodow) http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Shocking-Shadow-Pigments-Unashamed/dp/B001H9408G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1391448655&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;l%27oreal+hip+eye+shadow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not return this item.  It&#x27;s twice the size that I wanted but I&#x27;ll make do.  They really are nice, just not what I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> good little containers.  about the size of a golf ball, maybe a little bigger, but that&#x27;s a good size reference.  the lids are solid.  i&#x27;m happy and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered these containers based on the photos and the measurements given by other customers.  I was surprised to receive jars of a different shape.  Instead of fairly short and wide, they are tall and narrow, i.e. 1 inch in diameter and 2 1/2 inches tall.

Not worth returning, so I&#x27;ll put them to use storing pins, nails, etc.</li>
    <li> I think depends what you do with the jar, you may find it good or not. The plastic is very thick and heavy, which I think it&#x27;s very good in the long run and for storage. However, I ordered these for travel, so I can use it for my lotion. It is overall too bulky and heavy for traveling purpose.</li>
    <li> I am starting to use essential oils. I am wanting to create creams and ointments. I was looking for ointment jars with lids. This vendor offered 1/2 oz, 1 oz and 2 oz sizes. They delivered as promised and I received exactly what I ordered. Product looks solid and will hopefully prove reliable.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the homemade balm I am making. Makes my product look very classy without paying a steep price.</li>
    <li> The jars I received looked different, rounder and more stout.</li>
    <li> these jars with lid are very good for whatever needs you may have. I used mine for salves of coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, beeswax, and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#34;d say high quality for being plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Pharis</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  I need them for filling with my completed healing cream after I get the recipe and process finished.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, fair price, quick delivery. These are not as tall as the jars shown, but were  fine for the use I intended them for.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and the label size is perfect. I like these because they are taller.</li>
    <li> Perfect for little storage containers and for a great price! Would recommend!! check the size that you want because they have several.</li>
    <li> My favorite jars because of the size for myself and a good quality.</li>
    <li> great stuff and great price. loved this. got me out of a bind.</li>
    <li> These work just like you hope they would with the bonus of being very well constructed; it&#x27;s so satisfying every time I screw the lid on. I haven&#x27;t tested any of them for leaking yet, but as containers that sit around on my counter, and were cheap, they cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Great Product and service would recommend to anyone. Thank U</li>
    <li> These containers are exactly what I&#x27;m looking for to put my raw Shea butter in.  Exactly what I needed. Great!</li>
    <li> Husband uses these to portion out his daily allotment of herbal medicine. They are inexpensive, easy to open yet seal well, hold up to storing in the freezer, and are discrete. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I recently delved into the world of DIY skin care products and these are perfect for storage.  The lids are completely secure so no leaking,  and the inside edges are rounded making it easy to get the last of the product out. They are also great travel containers for lotions. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Using these jars to make my own travel size products.  These are perfect for facial products in that require light blocking packaging, i.e., benzoyl peroxide.  I was surprised at how large 1-oz is...for a 5 day trip, probably only needed the .50 oz size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these over gotubes...easier to clean out and store in the shower, especially when there are 3 of us, using several different products when showering.  I use a sharpie to label the lids.</li>

    <li> Well constructed. They don&#x27;t feel cheap. They are smooth but with flat edge which makes labeling easier.</li>
    <li> The containers were perfect for my application, however six of the 1 ounce covers were missing&lt;br /&gt;Jim Johst&lt;br /&gt;jimjohst@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Same as the blue cobalt blue glass jar.  Useful for ointment, salve, and as container for you skin care product on travel.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose but not a good packaging for gifts or giveaways; i used this for some lipscrub. Good container size, larger than others.</li>
    <li> These jars were the perfect size for my homemade ointment. I will purchase them again</li>
