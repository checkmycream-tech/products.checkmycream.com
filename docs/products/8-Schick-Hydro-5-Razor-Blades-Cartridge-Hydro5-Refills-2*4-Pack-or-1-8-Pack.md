      <li>Great razor blades</li>
      <li>great product,</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love these razors!!</li>
      <li>Cheaper than all the others and just as good.  </li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Each blade lasts longer than I originally anticipated as well making them a great value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used my fair share of razors and these are just simply the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>great price, quick delivery</li>
      <li>Living in the boondocks makes Amazon a precious site for me...</li>
      <li>This is the best razor ever, i&#x27;ve tried the Dollar Shave Club and had to switch back to these because my face was getting cut every morning.</li>
      <li>are even more appealing when they are bought in</li>
      <li>so I try to not pay more than $1/razor, but this one was $2/razor blade.</li>
      <li>I have used these blades for a couple of years and love the close shave that they give me.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find these at such a great price, I will buy again very soon.</li>
      <li>Well I have to say I like it better.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness for these being available on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>smooth on the face and cuts well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them to anyone who is in need of durable and effective razors</li>
      <li>Happy to find these here and not have to wait in long lines.</li>
      <li>It gives a super smooth and close shave.  </li>
      <li>Thx Schick for proving that Gillette is not the only company that can make a good razor/blades</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Work better or at least as good as the Fusion blades.</li>
      <li>Provides a much closer  shave and surprisingly longer life than expected between blade change.</li>
      <li>Also, I love the flip down and precise razor for under the nose and lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every razor and blade combo and was always a Gillette guy.  </li>
      <li>will keep buying this product, really like the close shave that I get with this blade.</li>
      <li>for a much much bettter price, woild recommend theses over any disposable blade heads</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>I saved abour $5.00 compared to what I pay locally, that is the only kind I use for my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Price has steadily increased over time</li>
      <li>To make the blades last even longer make sure you dry it off completely after each shave.</li>
      <li>The only complaint is that the blade head is pretty large and even when you flip back the gel component of the blade for &amp;#34;detailed&amp;#34; shaving it&#x27;s still a little too large to get the upper lip shaved perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and arrived before expected.  </li>
      <li>I definitely think its  apretty decent shaver.</li>
      <li>These are the safest most clean cutting for my heavy beard stubble and they stay sharp longer than most blades that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Major savings over local retail outlets.</li>
      <li>They are super smooth and the blade guards make it almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>

    <li> Everything was as advertised. Would purchase from here again. A a a a a a a a a a a.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever, i&#x27;ve tried the Dollar Shave Club and had to switch back to these because my face was getting cut every morning. With these, no cuts. Also, I love the flip down and precise razor for under the nose and lips. Works great. Price has steadily increased over time so I try to not pay more than $1/razor, but this one was $2/razor blade.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than all the others and just as good.  I use this every day and I will continue.  It does a great job</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find these at such a great price, I will buy again very soon. What a great deal.</li>
    <li> smooth on the face and cuts well. Good price. I definitely think its  apretty decent shaver. I say get it, if you need a razor</li>
    <li> I use these blades for my armpits and legs. They are super smooth and the blade guards make it almost impossible to cut yourself. I would recommend them for anyone shaving anything.</li>
    <li> These are the safest most clean cutting for my heavy beard stubble and they stay sharp longer than most blades that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every razor and blade combo and was always a Gillette guy.  A friend challenged me to try the Hydro 5 and said if I didn&#x27;t like it he&#x27;d reimburse me what I spend for the handle and blades.  Well I have to say I like it better.  It gives a super smooth and close shave.  The only complaint is that the blade head is pretty large and even when you flip back the gel component of the blade for &amp;#34;detailed&amp;#34; shaving it&#x27;s still a little too large to get the upper lip shaved perfectly.  Might just be me however.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Work better or at least as good as the Fusion blades. for a much much bettter price, woild recommend theses over any disposable blade heads</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of razors and these are just simply the best I&#x27;ve used.  Shipped quickly and arrived before expected.  Product lives up to my expectations and will definitely be ordered again.</li>
    <li> will keep buying this product, really like the close shave that I get with this blade. will purchase Schick again.</li>
    <li> Use these everyday for regular shaving, long lasting sharp blades.</li>
    <li> Hydro 5 cartridges are comparatively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;They are well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;They are even more appealing when they are bought in&lt;br /&gt;relative bulk which seriously reduces their cost!</li>
