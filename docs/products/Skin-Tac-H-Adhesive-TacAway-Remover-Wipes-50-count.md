    <li> Does just was it says - removes the adhesive left behind from band aids.</li>
    <li> We were shown this product by a friend. Happy that it is available through Amazon. It works great! Removes adhesive from bandaids, patches, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great with Omnipod!</li>
    <li> This really helped with removing residue from the adhesive of skin tac.</li>
    <li> the seller did a mgreat  job I use these every other  day with my insulin pump</li>
    <li> these work very well at removing the adhesive portion of anything.  even worked on a window that had some stickers on it.  will definitely get again in the future if it&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> Does the job...,but so does  alcohol</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with my son&#x27;s infusion sets!! So glad I found these.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect complement to skin tax.  I use for insulin pump infusion sets and CGM sensors.  Awesome for the summer.  TacAway helps me not stick to the sheets and couch when I take a set off!</li>
    <li> Removes all the tape residue from my continuous glucose monitoring tape. It leaves it nice and clean in way less time than an alcohol swab.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy about the way they didnt work  I use them as directed and they don&#x27;t work for the price I paid they should work better</li>
    <li> Great product.  Supersonic delivery.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this because I thought it might be just another way to get money out of me.  But I was really surprised by this product.  I use the Skin-Tac on my CGM sensor and when I take the sensor off I have adhesive stuck on for days - despite scrubbing A LOT and using various things like rubbing alcohol.  Then I tried one of these and in 2 min EVERYTHING came off very easily.  No scrubbing or anything.  One wipe got rid of everything.  I can&#x27;t express enough how please I am with the TacAway!</li>
    <li> Use to remove Skin-Tac with my continuous glucose monitor sensor.  Works well.</li>
    <li> This product works and saves the skin from damage. If you need to regularly take tape off skin this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Torbot Group rocks! This product is incredible and leaves a deliciously silky residue on your fingertips that you don&#x27;t want to wash off. just rub it in and smell the goodness.</li>
    <li> Bought two boxes. First was great and cleaned adhesive residue from skin well. However, the second box contained wipes that were dry and had no cleaning solution.  What happened!?</li>
    <li> I have used this since 2005, for my diabetic children.  The sticky covers we use to cover their CGM leave quite a bit of residue once removed.  These remove it all quickly and painlessly.  If a sight is stuck well and we need to remove it, these are great for that too.</li>
    <li> I prefer UniSolve for removing Omnipod and Dexcom CGM adhesive. It&#x27;s less painful.</li>
    <li> Work out 4 days per week and skin tac saves pods best product out there!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all there right feedback!</li>
    <li> I have used TacAway for two years and for me it is the best product in the market for removing adhesive.  It is easy and painless.</li>
    <li> While the product is good I expected that it would do a better removing the adhesive.  It works, but could be better.</li>
    <li> Love these! I use them to wipe away the skin barrier I use when I put on the Omnipod insulin pod. I&#x27;m sure there are other brands out there, but I tried this one first and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. But hell, if you&#x27;re desperate, use Goo Gone.</li>
    <li> Works good, Just so darn pricey! In my opinion this box should be priced at 8 or $9</li>
    <li> This was purchased to aid in the removal of colostomy seals, as they need changing.  They do an admirable job, but it takes 3 to 4 to get this done.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Can&#x27;t imagine life without it!!!!!</li>
    <li> These do a great job of removing fthe adhesive from diabetic sensors and insulin pump infusion sets. I purchased these with the SkinTac wipes, and they both work great!</li>
    <li> I wear a Dexcom CGM and use tape by BSN called Cover-Roll Stretch over top of it to keep it in place for a week, but as a result I get all this really sticky residue when I remove it at the end of the week. I used to use about 5 alcohol wipes from Walgreens to try and get the residue off but they didn&#x27;t really work that well. The area would still stick to my shirts and there would be a visible dark outline from where the tape was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One TacAway wipe gets rid of all the residue really easily. The area doesn&#x27;t stick to my shirt and all the dark outlines wipe away really easily. I thought they were expensive at first, but since one wipe is effective enough then one of these boxes will last me a year. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a must in conjunction with the Skin Tac Adhesive. We use it on my son&#x27;s insulin pump catheter site. He never has to worry about his site coming off no matter if he swims or sweats with sporting activities. His site will not come off easily without this Tac-Away product. He has sensitive skin and this duo of product usage is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove adhesive residue from the ears of my female Doberman when I change her ear postings.  It is not nearly as effective as Uni-Solve.</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly as described.  thanks</li>
