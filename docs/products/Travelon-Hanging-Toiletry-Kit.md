      <li>#SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS BAG</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying one for my Mom for Christmas right now!!!</li>
      <li>The bright color inside is refreshing and makes it easy to find items.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery too!!</li>
      <li>If you travel very very light it might work for you.</li>
      <li>I can put my shampoo, conditioner, body scrub, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste and even more in this.</li>
      <li>There are so many pockets and compartments you can put some under garments in as well as all of your toiletries &amp; make up.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is cute and I like the amount of pockets and it seems durable.</li>
      <li>So, you should be able to hang it from a shower rod, towel bar, etc.     </li>
      <li>It comes in so many cute colors and has lots of compartments for all your things.</li>
      <li>Love this, bag</li>
      <li>This toiletry kit is cute, well made, and the perfect size for making quit trips back and forth to the shower.</li>
      <li>Love the accessibility of this bag.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!!     </li>
      <li>Not only is it cute, it&#x27;s the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>Able to hang it or set it upright on the counter.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and is exactly what I wanted, this is very nice quality item</li>
      <li>Fun print, nice texture, seems durable.</li>
      <li>It was easy to order and was received within the time.</li>
      <li>Fits easily in the suitcase.</li>
      <li>The hook needed to be more on top of the whole thing to keep it upright.</li>
      <li>I probably put too much in it - the zipper sometimes does not slide around the top corners easily.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a travel kit that I could stuff full and then hang from a robe hook in the bathroom when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
      <li>For one thing when it is full it doesn&#x27;t hang well.</li>
      <li>I sell jewelry and I bought this hoping I would be able to fit a few of my favorite items in to do a show while we were traveling.</li>
      <li>I idea that this bag would be the perfect size to hold all of my jewelry, plus business cards and other items such as pens, a ring sizer, etc.</li>
      <li>Love all the compartments and how it folds up to a smaller size even though I can cram a lot of stuff into it.  </li>
      <li>They used every bit of available space for pockets made of clear plastic, mesh, elastic etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than what I used to have and doesn&#x27;t fit all of the full size bottles I have.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for air travel and short trips, I suppose.  </li>
      <li>The item was exactly as the desciption read.</li>
      <li>and I am sure it will last for years.  </li>
      <li>After you unzip it for hanging the huge inside bucket is large enough for a full size curling iron and blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I have shopped and purchased sooooo many toilet bags.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cute though, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on it.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I also purchased the smaller one for my short trips which I use in my carryon bag.</li>
      <li>I like this case, but I use it to go to our second home in WV and use it mostly as a hanging toiletry case... and it does hang, but the main compartment tends to lean forward when it hangs and if you have things place incorrectly in it, some may fall out....</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it has lots of space, I just wish I were able to put more full sized products into it.</li>
      <li>Like the fun Zebra print with bold blue lining color inside!</li>
      <li>It tilted forward too much causing items to fall out</li>
      <li>, it works really well, would buy again</li>
      <li>I thought this bag would hang up straight while in the shower, but when i fill it with things it leans forward.  </li>
      <li>Of course, it really just depends on what YOU need to travel with.</li>
      <li>, I already have it packed and ready to go</li>
      <li>The material is very durable nylon.</li>
      <li>Stuff falls out of the main compartment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute, compact, and easy to keep closed with the little strap.</li>
      <li>Also, I expected a different material, as the description says it is a microfiber, and in my world that is kind of a soft \\&quot;suedy\\&quot; fabric.</li>
      <li>No worries though, it all fit in the other pockets.</li>
      <li>But when I hang it up, the main pocket tilts way too far forward.</li>
      <li>This is easy to pack up with shampoo bottles etc along with lost of little pockets to stuff all kinds of items.</li>
      <li>I used it on a trip today and I have the main compartment utilized, but most of the other pockets are empty.</li>
      <li>no big deal really, but if you need to ensure stuff stays in, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on one trip, and have it ready to go for my next journey.</li>
      <li>My only complain5 are the zippers on the bag, it makes a bit cumbersome when opening and closing, not super smooth.</li>
      <li>The only draw back is it leans forward when hanging but not so much that I&#x27;ve had anything fall out.  </li>
      <li>Which, I&#x27;ve just discovered, lower down on the product information (not in the main text)</li>

<li> but it was impossible to zip once I had put just some basic things in it.  </li>
<li> It tips forward in an awkward way.</li>
<li> Really am very disappointed in it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love all the compartments and how it folds up to a smaller size even though I can cram a lot of stuff into it.  Best one I&#x27;ve found, but wish they had more color options.</li>
    <li> I thought this bag would hang up straight while in the shower, but when i fill it with things it leans forward.  I am currently deployed, so i need a bag that i could take to the shower which would hold all my items, and this bag was not it.  I now use it to store my small things and that&#x27;s why I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> It is well made, functional and attractive.  Only drawback is it is a bit heavy, even when empty.</li>
    <li> I have been on two trips since purchasing this bag and it is awesome!  I&#x27;m buying one for my Mom for Christmas right now!!!</li>
    <li> Love the accessibility of this bag. Able to hang it or set it upright on the counter. Holds all the products I need. Wish it would have come with travel size containers to use with it</li>
    <li> This item was shipped as portrayed. The item was exactly as the desciption read. The fabric was stronger than I thought in a good way. I wish it had a hanging hook other than a looped one.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift...wanted my own!  Great quality!  Like the fun Zebra print with bold blue lining color inside!</li>
    <li> Toiletry bag is a lot bigger than I expected it to be. There are a couple different dimensions on the product page and I&#x27;m thinking the animal print one I got is closer to the 8x12x5 size.  Also, I expected a different material, as the description says it is a microfiber, and in my world that is kind of a soft \\&quot;suedy\\&quot; fabric. I was a bit worried about the microfiber, but decided it could be washed, so I decided to chance it. Turns out, the material is actually a nylon. Which, I&#x27;ve just discovered, lower down on the product information (not in the main text) it says that different models are made of different materials. So, some MAY actually be microfiber. The black and white animal print that I ordered is the nylon. The only real complaint I have is that after you put some things in the main compartment, there isn&#x27;t enough space to fill up the pockets and have it close. I&#x27;d read that issue on another review, but just kind of assumed they might be overstuffing it. I used it on a trip today and I have the main compartment utilized, but most of the other pockets are empty. Of course, it really just depends on what YOU need to travel with. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!!     Added note: Another reviewer mentioned that they wish it had the type of hook that would allow the item to be hung from a shower rod. The bag I purchased (zebra print) has the fabric loop style hook shown in the picture, but it also has a strap that is tucked inside one of the upper inside compartments. The strap is attached to the bag through that compartment and it allows you to connect it with the bag clasp to make your own hook. So, you should be able to hang it from a shower rod, towel bar, etc.     [[ASIN:B001CZMTWO Travelon Hanging Toiletry Kit]]</li>
    <li> There are lots of thing about this kit that just don&#x27;t work. For one thing when it is full it doesn&#x27;t hang well. It tips forward in an awkward way. It looked like it would hold a lot but it was impossible to zip once I had put just some basic things in it.  If you travel very very light it might work for you.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly and is exactly what I wanted, this is very nice quality item and I can&#x27;t wait to go on vacation with it, I already have it packed and ready to go it holds everything I need.</li>
    <li> If you need something for your toiletries- this is the bag! It comes in so many cute colors and has lots of compartments for all your things. The only thing I wish was different was if it were a tiny bit bigger. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it has lots of space, I just wish I were able to put more full sized products into it. Great bag for the money!</li>
    <li> awesome bag. I sell jewelry and I bought this hoping I would be able to fit a few of my favorite items in to do a show while we were traveling. I had no I idea that this bag would be the perfect size to hold all of my jewelry, plus business cards and other items such as pens, a ring sizer, etc. Fun print, nice texture, seems durable. Only weird thing I noticed is there&#x27;s a pocket on the part that wraps under the bag, I&#x27;m not sure how it would sit flat with stuff in there? No worries though, it all fit in the other pockets. Quick delivery too!!</li>
    <li> I like this case, but I use it to go to our second home in WV and use it mostly as a hanging toiletry case... and it does hang, but the main compartment tends to lean forward when it hangs and if you have things place incorrectly in it, some may fall out.... no big deal really, but if you need to ensure stuff stays in, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife to take to gym and she loved it, it works really well, would buy again</li>
    <li> I wanted a travel kit that I could stuff full and then hang from a robe hook in the bathroom when I&#x27;m traveling. This does hold everything I need, with several small pockets to keep everything organized. But when I hang it up, the main pocket tilts way too far forward. The hook needed to be more on top of the whole thing to keep it upright. Also, some of the zippers stick and only open and close jerkily. Otherwise, it is cute and I like the amount of pockets and it seems durable.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hang well on the door hooks like others I&#x27;ve used. Also starting to tear after only 2 trips with it</li>
    <li> lots of room and pockets</li>
    <li> Finally someone made a case that I can store all of my travel things in and not have to carry three or four things.  Not only is it cute, it&#x27;s the perfect size.  The only draw back is it leans forward when hanging but not so much that I&#x27;ve had anything fall out.  When I switch bags I just grab it and put it in my other bag.</li>
    <li> Love this, bag it is perfect for traveling.  The bag has plenty room and folds up nice and neat, plus it has a cute design !!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for air travel and short trips, I suppose.  It&#x27;s smaller than what I used to have and doesn&#x27;t fit all of the full size bottles I have.  But if you&#x27;re using the travel size stuff then you can cram a lot in.  It&#x27;s very cute though, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on it.</li>
    <li> It tilted forward too much causing items to fall out and it was not very big.</li>
    <li> I am on the road weekly and I needed something that I could put everything in and leave it there.  This bag is a wonderful organizer and has many compartments, which you cannot see well in the picture on the web.  It is made well also and I am sure it will last for years.  I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a bag junkie; especially travel bags. I have shopped and purchased sooooo many toilet bags. I can now STOP shopping because THIS fits all the needs I I will ever have. It is much larger than appears on the picture. The material is very durable nylon. They used every bit of available space for pockets made of clear plastic, mesh, elastic etc. After you unzip it for hanging the huge inside bucket is large enough for a full size curling iron and blow dryer. There are so many pockets and compartments you can put some under garments in as well as all of your toiletries &amp; make up. I use this in my checked luggage. I loved it so much I also purchased the smaller one for my short trips which I use in my carryon bag. I am trying to hold back on getting another color. #SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS BAG</li>
    <li> Well made and attractive, this bag keeps everything organized in neat waterproof sections. It&#x27;s perfect for travel or the gym.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the mindset of getting myself something that would hold my daily grooming items. I can put my shampoo, conditioner, body scrub, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste and even more in this. I love it! It&#x27;s cute, compact, and easy to keep closed with the little strap.</li>
    <li> I have used this bag many times since receiving it and it works great.  Plenty of room for all my stuff.  It was easy to order and was received within the time.</li>
    <li> This toiletry kit is cute, well made, and the perfect size for making quit trips back and forth to the shower. Where I am located the showers are a little walk away so this toiletry kit helps make the trip easier. Love it!</li>
    <li> I probably put too much in it - the zipper sometimes does not slide around the top corners easily.  It is convenient to carry and looks nice.  I&#x27;ve used it on one trip, and have it ready to go for my next journey.</li>
    <li> This is easy to pack up with shampoo bottles etc along with lost of little pockets to stuff all kinds of items. The bright color inside is refreshing and makes it easy to find items. My only complain5 are the zippers on the bag, it makes a bit cumbersome when opening and closing, not super smooth. Fits easily in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> It does not hang like you would expect. Stuff falls out of the main compartment. Really am very disappointed in it.</li>
