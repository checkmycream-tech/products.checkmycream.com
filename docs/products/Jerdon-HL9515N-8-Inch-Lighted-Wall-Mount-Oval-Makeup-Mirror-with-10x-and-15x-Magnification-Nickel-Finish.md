<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is just what I wanted and needed to apply makeup and pluck eye brows.  Easy to install. Attractive finish.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 83-yr old mother. I&#x27;ve had magnified mirrors for several years now and always look for the highest magnification, which varies greatly from product to product. I&#x27;ve used a small travel mirror that claimed to be 15x (which I love). This mirror is not even close to that -- I think it&#x27;s more like 5 or 10. So, it is a nice-looking, well-made mirror and the lighting is good, I just wish it was a stronger magnification, or at least represented more accurately in its product description.</li>
    <li> nice purchase  love it morris</li>
    <li> Best purchase that I have EVER made for myself.  Beautiful too!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice light.  I use it for putting on my makeup and my husband uses it for shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave - I need magnification to shave correctly. I wish the light was twice as bright.</li>
    <li> Just like what you find in nice Hotels!  Easy to mount - anti fog is great!  Wish I had one in every bathroom!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this mirror and I&#x27;m glad I choose this one. It works extremely well and I have it installed inside a cabinet so when I don&#x27;t need it for shaving, it&#x27;s easy swing and fold to go inside the cabinet so it doesn&#x27;t ruin the look of my bathroom. The product itself is beautiful but I wouldn&#x27;t like it always visible because the mirror looks more modern to me and I am going for a different look in the bathroom. The only complaint I have, is the light could be a little brighter, but even so, it still works great and allows me to shave without having to bend over the sink and get close to the wall mounted mirror (can&#x27;t see without my glasses on and shaving with them on is a pain!) I highly recommend this mirror for anyone that wants a close mirror for any use. I&#x27;m guessing for females it would be great for applying makeup. But for males it is perfect for shaving and I love all the different options for magnification. I have used all three depending on what i&#x27;m doing, shaving, getting hair our of my ears, etc!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror but a couple things to note.  As one reviewer mentioned its not as bright as I would have liked.  I mounted it in my bathroom next to my sick so I have the lighting over my vanity which helps when putting on makeup.  I made sure I mounted the mirror a little lower then face level so as to not block the light.  I have to tilt the mirror slightly to see, but that&#x27;s all I needed to do for nice illumination.  The 2 pack Jerdon replacement bulbs I purchase with the mirror from Amazon are not rated for this mirror.  They are 25W and this mirror is only rated for 15W... which is probably why its so dim.  When I purchased the mirror I couldn&#x27;t find any info on the wattage in the product description.  I took the chance that the Jerdon bulbs would fit the Jerdon mirror and they don&#x27;t.  Other then that, I really like the mirror.  My husband had no problem with the install and it seems very sturdy.  I would recommend this mirror if mounted near another light source.</li>
    <li> Great no real complaint.  if they offered just one mag stronger it would help.  Unit defogs quickly.  Light Great,  rarely use the super mag part, must 1 eye when using it.</li>
    <li> Great Item for the Price! Easy to install and got delivered quickly. Very Pleased, it arrived boxed nicely without any damage. Can&#x27;t live without one of these great mirrors in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> The mirror magnification is excellent. However, this has to be plugged into the wall for the lights to work. We were under the impression based on the description / reviews that the light was battery operated and did not have to be plugged in.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and had an electrician install them before I realized that the magnification is terrible.  The oval mirror also reduces the ease of use.  I have a pedestal magnifying mirror that has less magnification but it will remain until I have time to replace these. I a sure, however, that had they not been installed I could have exchanged them to Amazon.  My mistake in that regard.</li>
    <li> I fist saw this mirror in a hotel while traveling and liked it so much that I searched for it online and purchased one for my home.  It works great.  I agree with other reviewers that the light could be better but it is still superior to others that I have seen.  My vision has deteriorated with age so I had trouble applying eye makeup and I am happy to say this mirror has fixed the problem!</li>
    <li> use it every day!  it is larger than I thought but it works great</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a great product.  I can see everything so much easier, definitely get the 10\\&quot; oval, it really fits your face.  Also, the back lighting is awesome.  Can&#x27;t imagine being without it.</li>
    <li> Wish the 15 x were bigger</li>
    <li> Love my mirror.....exactly what I was looking for!  It was a great value as well!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lighted makeup mirror. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted a 10X mirror, but now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t settle for a lower magnification. I love that this is a wall mount mirror and that it folds away. My sister-in-law liked it so much, she ordered one for herself!</li>
    <li> At most this is a 4x mag.. I already have a 3x, 5x and 8x magnification. I have used magnification mirrors since 2000 for up-close sight. I feel this Jerdon HL9515N product should be pulled and relabeled.  This was a Christmas gift from my husband.. we are both disappointed and feel let down.     This is the ONLY REVIEW I have ever written and I just wanted to alert Amazon and its&#x27; customers.  We have purchased many items from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future.    Thanks for reading, Sharyn</li>
    <li> We were able to mount it high enough for my husband to insert his contacts daily, shave, and groom without his glasses or contacts.  Nice addition to the bath.  We opted to plug it in rather than hard mount it because of the site desired.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for valentines day.  Installed in about 10 minutes.  She has used it three times so far and loves it.  Can&#x27;t see any reason not to give it 5 stars.  Quality construction, nice and ample lighting, magnification in three different ranges.  I don&#x27;t see what the other people are complaining about.  Very nice mirror and highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wall mounted mirror like this one to replace an old polished brass mirror.  I wanted a &amp;#34;hard wire&amp;#34; unit.  This one is great, but it did not mention the cord coming out of the bottom to plug into a nearby outlet.  I had to cut the cord to hard wire it, but of course there is now a hole in the bottom of the unit where the cord was.  Still, the product was very good for the price.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon HL9515Nlighted mirror is priced right,is easily mounted.The finish seems to be a good quality and matches my other fixtures very well.My purchase from Amazon.com.wasvery accomodating.</li>
    <li> not too sure I really needed to see everything as clearly as I do now.  But I asked for it.   Good product</li>
    <li> I have the smallest (only) bathroom in my house known to American mankind.  Little did I realize my serious need for a lighting, mirror with magnification would become a space issue.  without even thinking about it, i decided on this Jerdon oval shaped mirror because it looks good and it doesn.  It also became a spacesaver because when I went to install it in the 1&#x27; wide space I have to use, I realized that a big, round mirror would never have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the soft lighting of this mirror, the 15x magnification is too much, but the 10x is great.  The swivelling arm works well, and once it was installed, I wasn&#x27;t worried it was going to breakdown or anything like so much cheap junk on the market.  This Jerdon is made of real metal, so it will hold up for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Ms. Ali</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife for her birthday and she has been very pleased with it. It was easy to install and the quality seems to be good. We&#x27;ve had it in the bathroom for roughly 3 months and it is everything she wanted in a vanity mirror. The 3 different magnifications serve our needs well. Although the light isn&#x27;t super bright, it seems completely adequate. In fact we have used it for a night light to guide people to the bathroom when we have guests over and it works well for that purpose too. I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with the purchase of this mirror for my birthday. We bought a house and were in the process of upgrading all the fixtures in the house. I let him know that I needed a lighted magnifying mirror for applying my make-up. He was able to locate this mirror which matched the brushed nickel we needed. Because the mirror matches all other fixture colors in the house, it looks like it is supposed to be there.    The mirror and light are both of great quality. I actually use it every day. It not only helps me to see the make-up application/removal, it saves my back from having to lean over the bathroom sink to get close to that mirror. I really miss it when I am away from home!    Randa</li>
    <li> The mirror has a 1x side and a 10x with a small 15x mirror. The mirror mounts to the wall and plugs in. It is an excellent mirror, my wife loves it. Some other reviews had a problem with the brightness of the light but we find that it is enough for us to see what we are doing.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this mirror, since my eyesight is really poor.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn&#x27;t bother purchasing the mirror with the Halo Light.  The light actually causes glare and makes it harder for me to see, so I don&#x27;t bother to turn it on.  The wall mount is nice and it looks good in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Yay, I don&#x27;t need glasses to apply makeup any more!</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this mirror. We both wear glasses and these mirrors allow you to see without your glasses.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace one that broke.  I purposely bought a higher magnification this time, since my vision is not what it used to be.  I can understand with the other reviewers regarding the light not being bright enough.  I am fortunate to have decent lighting in my room.  The mounting was easy, and was simple enough to install.  I find that the smaller 15X magnification is useful, but also in the way.  I would prefer it to be on the other regular side of the mirror.  Overall, for the price this does what I need it for.  Kind of scary at first when you realize how much you weren&#x27;t seeing by not using the mirror!</li>
    <li> Mounted easy, and is perfect for us old folks who need greater magnification to get rid of hair growing where it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Mounting instructions include a template for easy installations. Very sturdy. It came with an extra bulb.</li>
    <li> returned it wasn&#x27;t what she wanted</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a Christmas gift. When It came in I mounted it to the wall and installed it only to find the on off switch didn&#x27;t work at all. It is stuck in the on position so we can plug it in for now. I contacted the company&#x27;s customer service department and told them I really didn&#x27;t want to send it back because I had already installed it and asked if they could send me a new switch and I would install it. Customer service representive sent me an email saying they would send a replacement switch. The mirror light could be brighter and quality control should of never shipped this unit before testing it.</li>
    <li> Light could be a little brighter. Easy install. Nicely constructed.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my bathroom that has a poor light and could not put my makeup. I bought  for the light. The mirror is very nice, very large and easy to install but the light is really insufficient if you need more light ! Is a very expensive mirror. I still need a better light in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had used this type of lighted wall mirror in hotels on vacation and am so excited to have my very own at home now!  I love how well I&#x27;m able to do my make-up and to pluck eyebrows. I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror.  However, the minimal amount of light output for the weight, and size is not worth it; especially considering it is a plug in unit.  I have battery operated lights with much brighter output.  Sending this item back.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very good quality.  Was easy to install.  However, the anchors provided are worthless - do not use them.  Unless you anchor into a stud go to Home Depot and purchase two quality toggle bolts.</li>
    <li> The mirror is nice, however the bulb that came with it is totally inadequate.  I replaced it with a 60  watt bulb which give much more light.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see all the hair that was growing about my face, ears, noise, eyebrows. I used one of these at a hotel on a vacation and just thought this would be real nice for an old guy to have. After a remodel of our master bathroom we installed this mirror. Wow!  That&#x27;s all that I can say. About once a week I can see whats growing! I know that this happens but I don&#x27;t have to ignore the hair anymore. I don&#x27;t primp just take care of unwanted growth of unwanted hair. It has one side with a 10 X magnificaion and the other side ia a 5 X Mag. It is real handy.  It looks great too.  It is build well, and the price was reasonable.  We bought the Nickel finish, corded.  We bought an extra light bulb.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific, handsome looking mirror. Easy to install, with great magnification. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with those that expressed issue with the light.  15W is not nearly bright enough (though I don&#x27;t have perfect vision either) and there is a warning that using a higher wattage bulb is not recommended.  As another reviewer mentioned, I didn&#x27;t see that noted anywhere prior to reading the insert that was included in the box - and the lighting was the primary feature that I was willing to pay more for.  Since I&#x27;ve already mounted it on the wall, I&#x27;m not planning to return it - but I&#x27;m very disappointed with it as a result - it&#x27;s no different than one I purchased for $35. . .    Additionally, while the hardware that comes with the mirror seemed ample to support it on the wall, I had a terrible time getting the anchors to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; so they would hold.  Due to all of the fussing, I ended up with holes that were too large, so I had to buy different wall anchors.  Once I solved that issue, it was simple to hang on my own.</li>
    <li> great quality mirror. too bad they decided to skimp on the light. waaaaay too dim. you buy a magnifying mirror to see better. this product would be perfect IF it had a light that was bright enough. unless you like getting return authorizations and wasting your time and money on sending it back don&#x27;t buy this mirror.</li>
    <li> Mirror was not a 10X anywhere.  The shape was good, but totally not use able with the naked eye.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I can see to put eye make up on.  I would recommend it to anyone who can&#x27;t see close up.</li>
    <li> This mirror was not packaged well enough to withstand normal UPS delivery. It arrived cracked. I plugged it in to see if reviews of the light being underpowered were correct. I agree, the light is not strong enough to get the job done.    I ordered the Brookstone mirror and am very happy. I should have sprung for the better one the first time around and avoided the hassle.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted except arrived cracked. Refund promptly received and a second one ordered that arrived quickly. The new one was also cracked.</li>
    <li> Does not fog and external power source with three different magnification. Easy installation with clear lines and it has its own lighting.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. Mounts pretty easily. If the cord is too long its pretty easy to shorten with minimal electrical skills.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror and others that use it in my house like it too!</li>
    <li> Really love this mirror. Don&#x27;t know how I got along without it!It arrived promptly and was exactly has described in the ad.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this mirror a year ago.  I loved the mirror and found that the soft light was perfect for applying makeup.  I accidentally hit the mirror with the end of a  hair brush and the glass broke.  It wasn&#x27;t much of a hit, so the glass is fragile.  The original mirror was round, and in the photo the mirror looks round, so I was surprised when I opened the packaging and discovered that this mirror is actually oval.  I installed the mirror and then found that the light switch was not working.  I had to turn it about 10 times to get the light on, and then couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off.  The switch does not engage, it just spins round and round. I immediately ordered a replacement.  When it arrived, I plugged it in before installing and found that it had the same non-working light switch. I&#x27;ve also on occasion had issues with the switch on the original mirror - so 3 mirrors, bad switch.  I love this mirror and hope that they can resolve the issue with the switch, but who wants a lighted mirror that does not light?</li>
    <li> My wife loves her new mirror and can now stand up straight while poking and prodding her face.  Thanks Jerdon!</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Quality product.  First saw this mirror in our hotel room at the Ritz Carlton, Toronto and the wife said I have to have one of these.  Saw that it was made in Texas and when we got back home to our part of Texas, I ordered one.  Wife very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror after have eye surgery and loosing my close vision.  I love it, and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. The lighting is great. It is very simple to hang up. I would recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Deos not give out enough light but the Magnificaton is great</li>
    <li> got this for my mom, she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Some shading in the border.  Very hard to see in the small magnifier.</li>
    <li> The mirror is corded, so you must install it near an outlet. Installation was quick and easy. The mirror is a good size and it is quite sturdy. The magnified side is sufficient but the lighting could be a bit brighter.  Overall I am satisfied with it as it looks great in the space.</li>
    <li> I like the oval shape. I also like having the 10 and 15 magnifying glass for the smallest details and the light is also good</li>
    <li> This mirror appears to be of good quality with good swing arms with no play.  I cut the plug off the 120VAC power cord provided and pulled it back through the hole in the base to wire it directly to a wall box on which it was mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice mirror and the light is bright.</li>
    <li> Was a birthday gift for our mother.  The oval size is great.  The magnification was almost too much for her.  The on/off knob was not working properly.  If my father wasn&#x27;t an electrician we would have returned it.  He replaced it with a toggle switch.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY what I wanted! Works GREAT and takes up very little space. I had a small lit magnifying mirror that was taking up space on the counter in the bathroom; so, this was perfect. If you&#x27;re debating this, stop and purchase it now and you&#x27;ll be so happy you did!</li>
    <li> Love the mirrow But it did&#x27;nt make it clear that it was&#x27;nt hard wired,witch I was expecting not pluging it in</li>
    <li> This mirror works well, mounted at standing height by my sink.  Makes make-up application much easier.  The light doesn&#x27;t add a lot of illumination, but the magnification lenses are great.  Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Have to tighten where it swivels every week.  Looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> wife loves the mirror, goes great with our remodeled master bath</li>
    <li> We love the mirror but, it seems like the 10X mirror isn&#x27;t actually 10X.  Our portable 10X mirror is much stronger than the wall mount.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it she only wish it would have a bit more light, but the finish on it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> OK.  Does it make sense that the best magnification mirror on this mirror is the 2&amp;#34; mirror?  Why go to all the effort of making a device with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mirror on one side, a semi-magnification mirror on the other side and then the highest magnification going to the 2&amp;#34; mirror???  You can&#x27;t use a 2&amp;#34; mirror.  I don&#x27;t care how small your face is.  You can&#x27;t see into a 2&amp;#34; mirror effectively.  Further, when you light up your face from the front the light shines in your eyes!  Plus the light is not good.  Doesn&#x27;t do a d&amp;ng thing to light up your face.  The best lighting is always from the back not the front.  They would have done better to send a miner&#x27;s light enclosed in the packaging.  Terrible design.  The only thing I like about this is the extension arm so the mirror is close to my face so I don&#x27;t have to lean over the sink.  But here&#x27;s my fix for the poor magnification and size of the mirror.  Go to Walmart and get yourself a 5X magnification mirror with suction cups on the back.  They&#x27;re like $7.99 or something.  Place this awesome 7&amp;#34; mirror on your Jerdon mirror and there you go with a proper magnification in a usable size.  Jerdon, it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for you.</li>
    <li> I really like the oval shape.  The small 15x circle is great.  I tried to find a mirror with 15x on the whole thing but couldn&#x27;t.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the smaller circle would be helpful - but it works well.  Good quality overall</li>
    <li> By the time this item arrived it was broken.  I submitted a claim on this and never heard a word back - very disappointed.  I would not recommend shopping from this seller as they did not care to get back with me and make the shipment right for me.  I eventually glued the glass pieces on and decided to use it anyway since I could not get a return.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. They have made it easy to put on natural looking makeup, pluck those hard to see hairs, find the deep clogged pores. The lighting is great and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to be hard wired is a huge bonus. I love this mirror and it was worth the price. Bought a smaller one previously and it didn&#x27;t even last 1 year! The ones at the store, if you can find them are about as big as a compact mirror-useless.</li>
    <li> Round nut at the installation plate has so less threads, that my nut threads slipped and I had to throw the nuts away and get butterfly nuts so that I could tight the plate to the mirror............. POOOOOR design as the bolts are very small hardly one or two threads to rest the entire heavy mirror, so the top one nut slips.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hardwired mirror. 5 star hotel quality!</li>
    <li> Just wish it was thinner.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace hardwired mirror.  The pictures don&#x27;t show a cord, but there is one.  No directions for direct wiring.  I will be returning this mirror.</li>
    <li> Purchased this light for my wife for Christmas.  I like the style.  However, I installed it only to find:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Switch does not work.  Within minutes of installation, the switch failed.  The light can only be turned off by unplugging.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The light is so dim as to be inconsequential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I twice called Jerdon customer \\&quot;service\\&quot; (866-759-4650) regarding the problem, the phone rang several times and was finally answered by a recording that said simply \\&quot;Thank you.  Goodbye.\\&quot; before disconnecting.  I have now e-mailed Jerdon customer service regarding my issues.  \\&quot;The Jerdon Guarantee\\&quot; states that \\&quot;Jerdon products are guaranteed to be of the finest quality.  If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Jerdon product, Jerdon and/or its retail partner will exchange, credit, or refund your purchase.\\&quot;  We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up:  Jerdon acknowledged the faulty switch and says they can send me a part to fix it myself.  They said they could not refund my money because I bought it at Amazon instead of directly from Jerdon.  Amazon&#x27;s 30-day policy was up by the time I got the mirror installed, contacted Jerdon, heard back, and got to Amazon to process the return.  So I am stuck with an overpriced plug-in mirror until I can get the part from Jerdon and repair it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some hassle and avoid this product and company.</li>
    <li> After researching many magnification mirrors, I hoped this would be the best wall mounted mirror.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the strength of lighting; it was not bright enough.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It has great lighting, so you can really see those fine hairs when you are doing your eyebrows. A couple of reviews said there didn&#x27;t think the magnification was right, but I think it&#x27;s perfect. I use reading glasses for up close and I don&#x27;t even need them with this mirror. Great product at a Great price.</li>
    <li> Works ok, the lighting needs to be made stronger.</li>
    <li> the mirror is ok but the switch for turning on the light is not well made had to send first mirror back thought I was going to send second one back but called the manufactuer told me to take plires and smash chrome cover to tighten it up working for now wife loves it other wise</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife. I bought it some time ago and she uses it daily. I mounted it on the wall and it comes with a coil plug in cord. So installation was a breeze. The quality is excellent. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Easy to install  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great mirror but the light is not bright enough. Too dim to see well enough to pluck eyebrows for example. Needs brighter bulb. Not sure if I can do that. Will have to read about changing the bulb.</li>
    <li> see ever chin hair on my neck  ouch</li>
    <li> Light switch broke the first day. Unit is heavy and thick, very bulky looking. Backlight not bright enough, does not aluminate face. The only reason I kept it because I was too busy to sand it back.</li>
    <li> Use this daily for the last 7 years and still holding strong!</li>
    <li> I can see my eyeliner</li>
    <li> Sent it back.  Way too big and clumsy looking.  Stuck out like a sore thumb and just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  You need lots of room for this thing.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine with the mirror, except the dim lighting.  I don&#x27;t want the gentle light of the magnification mirror to make me look better by softening each errant lash, upstart whisker and blemish---I need it to light&#x27;em up like a pair of Nazi search lights so I can deal with it before anyone else sees it!  After a call to customer service, I switched out the light bulb to see if that would make a difference but it didn&#x27;t help so I had to send it back.  I think this needs to be an &amp;#34;in-person&amp;#34; product purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she complained the magnified section is too small to do any good.  She would rather have two sides, one being 3X and the other 10X</li>
    <li> It came with a giant crack in the middle of it.  Said &#x27;minor cosmetic damage&#x27;.  We were fortunately, able to return it.</li>
    <li> After only a few uses, maybe 10, the light swtich is not working :(</li>
    <li> The magnified side of the mirror is no where near 10x or 15x.  It might be 2x but the small magnification works for me when putting my make-up on.  Also, the light is awful and if I didn&#x27;t have overheard lights there is no way I could see what I was doing.  I only suggest buying this mirror if you don&#x27;t care about the magnification or the light.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my sister who has impaired vision and she loves it! She no longer has to lean over her bath counter to have her face next to the mirror in order to see while applying her makup or tweezing her brows. Would highly recommend this mirror to anyone who needs extra magnification, there are few to choose from and this one fits several needs in one mirror.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I thought the light was too dim at first, but once i got used to it, I think the lighting is just right.  It looks expensive and was easy to install.  The mirror swivels well, so it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the three size choices (regular + 2 magnification sizes).&lt;br /&gt;The brushed metal finish promises to be enduring.&lt;br /&gt;Also was extremely happy to be able to purchase it at half the price&lt;br /&gt;What a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these and I bought this one for my daughter. She has used mine alot when she comes to visit me. So I bought her one. She was excited.</li>
    <li> This is a PERFECT addition to my beauty routine. Awesome super sturdy mirror. I got a steal on it too!! Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have had mine about 6 months and it worked fine till today it suddenly tightened up and when we tried to move it, it broke!</li>
    <li> The wife likes it, I like it. Happy Happy Happy!</li>
    <li> Solid,, Very nice looking,, Was worried that light would be to &#x27;&#x27;bright&#x27;&#x27; but no, Perfect. Eesay installaiton..</li>
    <li> We got the wall mirror mounded with no problems.  I love the looks of the mirror.  Very well made.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is:  I don&#x27;t think it is a 10x, not as strong as my 8x hand mirror and the light could be better.  I use the little 15x mirror often and husband uses the 10x to shave. The price was very good.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Large oval shape to make sure all of face is seen without having to move your head&lt;br /&gt;2. 10X magnification was much appreciated as well as the small 15X mirror&lt;br /&gt;3. The light source was just bright enough to shed extra light on face&lt;br /&gt;4. Came with replacement bulb&lt;br /&gt;5. Corded power cord made installation easy without having to install a junction box and hard-wire&lt;br /&gt;6. Great Price and fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Easy to install</li>
    <li> Works great, installed easy. Wife loves it. For whatever reason 13 more (now 7) words are required. The item is great.</li>
    <li> Returning the item. No way the magnification is what they claim. Going to Bed Bath and Beyond instead.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and appreciated the prompt response to the replacement. As the first mirror was broken.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I hv been searching for a magnifying makeup mirror for sometime now. Since I feel I am in a constant rush,  this mirror works beautifully with my hectic schedule. The wall mount allows me to adjust the mirror at any angle and finally I can see exactly where my makeup is going, not where I thought it was going;) Thanks for a GREAT product.</li>
    <li> She used one in a condo rental and nothing doing til she had one. She loves it...It makes her make up application and removal 100 times easier...</li>
    <li> You need a big enough wall in the bathroom for this mirror to work correctly.  We did not have the room for it.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not magnify as much as I thought it would. Plus it takes up a lot of space on the wall. I found that by using the arm of the mirror as a towel rack, it covers the plate and makes the mirror appear to be not as big. I have gotten used to the mirror but wish I would have gotten something smaller. The light does not really do anything as it is not bright enought.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a 15x magnification mirror and this is as good as I could find. I like that it hangs on the wall and is lighted.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror....the light for the background is great and it&#x27;s very easy to install and keep clean. That&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> The light is entirely too weak to see anything by.  The magnifications were not what I expected.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> The photo on amazon.com shows a light without a cord and plug, thus depicting a light to be hard-wired into the wall. The product arrived with a cord and plug. Other than that it appears to be a quality fixture.</li>
    <li> Very nice but light could be brighter and the knuckles at each section could be much tighter.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Wife loves it..</li>
    <li> I am happy because my wife is happy about the mirror.  I recommend this product for its intended and applied use.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great......  This smaller mirror is a bonus...... Swivel works great.....  If you are looking for a mirror to put your make-up on in the morning this one is it...</li>
    <li> We had used a mirror similar to this in a motel in Missouri and my husband loved it.  With this in mind I bought it for him as a Christmas present and he was thrilled!  He hasn&#x27;t had a chance to install it yet, but I know he is anxious to get it done.</li>
    <li> The 2 extra levels of magnification work great. The light could be a little brighter, but it is just OK. It was easy to install</li>
    <li> The halo lighting causes the mirror itself to cast a shadow across your face.  I don&#x27;t use the built in light for this reason.  The mirror is okay and is without distortion.</li>
    <li> The size of a Buick.  Thick as a loaf of bread.</li>
    <li> This follows our previous review, or lack thereof because we had not received the product as expected. Got it and although the inside packaging was a little beat up, the unit was fine, installed in a few minutes and working as expected. The magnification is pretty awesome and will make you discover things you never thought existed before... The merchant was very good at following up to make sure that we had received the product and liked it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the bomb!  Got it, had it installed in my bathroom &amp; now my bathroom feels like one of those luxury hotel bathrooms! Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this mirror. I wanted a mirror like I saw in a hotel. I knew the brand was Jerdon but didn&#x27;t know the model #. This is not 10X, might be 3X. Light is not bright enough. Luckily returned for free as well as replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> This is the third mirror I&#x27;ve purchase from this company and they are all excellent products.  This last purchase is a Christmas present.  I use mine everyday to put on my makeup.  Once you have  owned one, it&#x27;s hard to do without it.</li>
    <li> HUGE but nice mirror.  Heavy; installed easily.</li>
    <li> just like in a fancy hotel you can have a wall mounted high magnification makeup mirror. This mirror was easy to install and looks good in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late sixties and really have poor eyesight. Now I feel confident when I walk out my door, to go to work, that nothing is out of place.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this mirror with the exception of the amount of light that is produced.  Unless you have other lighting to&lt;br /&gt;assist you as you are performing various tasks,it just isn&#x27;t bright enough.Otherwise the finish, size, magnification and manuverability&lt;br /&gt;are great!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  My Dad, who has failing eyesight, loves it!</li>
    <li> Really like the wall mounted mirror.  I had a stand up mirror and was a pain, it was always in the way.  Easy to mount, good quality mirror.  The 15X spot mirror is great for up close work.</li>
    <li> If you have ever wondered whether higher magnification and lighting really help, this mirror will convince you. An overnight stay with a friend who had a lighted 10x mirror made it clear i needed a magnifying mirror at home. After installing an unlit 5x mirror and traveling with small size 10x lighted mirror, I decided to pay the money for the real deal. This model is superb! The main 10x mirror is a good size with adjustable angle for a good full face view. The optics are really clear, even on the small inset 15x mirror. Definitely, worth the money.</li>
    <li> One of the many purchases Ive made I didnt know I needed until I used it.  Love this product.  Great Purchase.</li>
    <li> This is very sturdy, (thicker than it might appear in the picture).  Easy to mount.  Good quality glass on the 1X and 10X mirror, (only OK slightly distorted glass on the X15 small insert mirror).  The light isn&#x27;t too bright,  but any brighter would blind me with the light (a tough compromise, between wanting to have the face lit, but not wanting to squint into a light);  the light is a bit orange in color (15W Incandescent bulb, comes with a spare, easy to replace).  The arms and swivels allow me to place this at any position and angle I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish, would be for it to be offered in more finishes (shinny Chrome or Brass....).  It is darker than any other fixture in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is a nice coiled (like old phone cords) with clear plastic covering, that blends well with any color wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  With this you will see wrinkles and imperfections in your face, that you never knew you had,  Don&#x27;t worry about these, no one will ever get that close to your face to see what this mirror shows.  The magnification is powerful.</li>
    <li> The closest mirror reflection, I have ever experienced! Nice for tweezing accurately, makeup application or appling your contacts. The size is large and ease of moving it out of the way is great!</li>
    <li> When I search for a hard wired, lighted wall magnifying mirror I expect that the one I choose from the results - which certainly appears to be hard wired - to show up without a plug for the outlet!  The mirror is fine, but it is not what I was led to believe I was ordering.  I feel this was false advertising.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and elegant look!  I like the optional zoom in (x10 &amp; x15) and regular mirror.  Received it on time. Easy to mount but I just had to provide my own screws since I had to mount it on the wood behind my sheetrock wall.  I would have rated this 5stars if it comes with optional screws.</li>
    <li> Looks and works great. That brush finish is great in our bathroom. Would recomend you to anyone and at a good price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this unit. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because several people complained that the light was not bright enough. The Users Guide calls for a 15 watt bulb and warns not to use a larger one. Amazon sells the Jerdon 25 watt replacement bulbs. I took a chance and ordered the unit and the replacement bulbs. When I took the unit apart I saw a decal in side next to the bulb socket that says you can use up to a 25 watt bulb.&lt;br /&gt;The unit was easy to install and looks great once we put it up.&lt;br /&gt;If you would like extra light order the 25 watt bulbs (they are made by the manufacturer of the mirror and that&#x27;s why I took a chance on them). I&#x27;m including a picture of the UL Listed decal showing the 25 watt max rating. I hope they add the picture to the product description.</li>
    <li> Really good quality and would recommend it to anyone.  I researched a lot and read reviews and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Exceptional that it mounted so easily. Use it every day exactly as I needed.  Only wish the 15 was larger.</li>
    <li> Very handy. Doesn&#x27;t take up space on counter or vanity. Easy to install near natural light source). I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The light isn&#x27;t quite bright enough but the magnifying in the mirrors is great and the mirror area is perfect.</li>
    <li> First mirror with light would not light. Replacement also did not &amp;#34;switch on&amp;#34;. Wife called the company and was informed that they had experienced switch problems. Vendor sent a new switch cover (not the switch, just the knob cover), this fixed the problem. Mirror looks well made and the mirrors work as advertised.</li>
    <li> we received the 1st on only to have the on/off knob to stop working, received a replacement and the knob doesn&#x27;t even work.  seems like a bad batch of switches?  will return both and change products.</li>
    <li> I like the shape and the different magnification choices this mirror offers.  I also like that the hinge arm allows me to fold it to the far right or the far left of the mounting plate instead of only one direction like other mirrors I have had.  My only complaint is that the light could be brighter.  It&#x27;s a soft yellow lighting, not the bright white fluorescent lighting I expected.  Will look for a different bulb, but happy otherwise.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it we only love people and animals</li>
    <li> I shopped all local stores for a wall mounted mirror. I was disappointed with the lack of quality. The displays were damaged and falling apart in respectable stores like BB&amp;B so I decided to shop Amazon. I went with the higher end price point and I&#x27;m glad I did. Unfortunately, UPS had damaged the package and cracked the mirror but a new one is being shipped. The quality of the swing arm is superior. If I had seen anything like this in a brick and mortar store, I would have bought it on the spot.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit for my wife and for the most part she loves it. Only issue is the bulb that comes with the unit isn&#x27;t bright and it doesn&#x27;t recommend a higher wattage bulb.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say my hubby is an electrical engineer.  With that being said, let me state that this is the SECOND one I have ordered, and neither would power up.  He wanted me to say this:&lt;br /&gt;A) Switches are BAD.  (poor quality control)&lt;br /&gt;B) Splices are BAD. (poor quality control AND workmanship)&lt;br /&gt;C) Wires are broken; potential electrocution hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add a D) I&#x27;m BUMMED.&lt;br /&gt;Would not order if given a chance.  Returns were made easy by Amazon, thank goodness.  I ordered another brand.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, but would prefer LED lighting.&lt;br /&gt;With LED the depth could be more shallow and the unit more light weight.</li>
    <li> It was Christmas present for my wife and she is very happy with it.  It is a quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Mirror is good but the light is not very bright.  Bought this for my mom because she liked the one I have, which is round and has a much brighter light.  She has good lighting in her bathroom so the light is okay for her but wouldn&#x27;t have been acceptable for me.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> Setup was a slight issue as heavy piece and unable locate  stud to secure both horizontal screws. (Worked with a single one)&lt;br /&gt;Mirror itself is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this mirror twice now.  The first time it arrived with a crack on the 1x mag side.  Today I took out the mirror to install it and the joint is completely wobbly so the mirror flails all over the place.  For this price, I would expect better quality.</li>
    <li> We looked at these mirrors on line and this one struck our fancy. The price was way less than the others and my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Overall High Quality Mirror - Agree with previous comments that the lighting is not sufficient for the mirror. .  Needs to be securely anchored to wall.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with the two-sided mirror.  Being nearsighted, the magnification mirror allows me to see while I put on makeup.  Also, the standard mirror makes it possible to see the back of my hair in the bathroom mirror.  It helps me to look the best that I can.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  Love the extra X15 mag small mirror.  We have strip lighting above our bathroom sinks so I have ended up not using the lighting much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally convinced yet, I can see how one person said that no way it was 10x magnification.  I&#x27;m not totally convinced either but I think it&#x27;s got to do with the fact that the mirror is oval and not round, it might alter the image somewhat.  Overall the construction of it is good, stylish and the mounting hardware is very sturdy.  I have not compared the magnification yet, but will in near future.  For the price, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is excellent quality and does exactly what I needed it to do.  Looks great and goes with other bathroom fixtures.</li>
    <li> Small magnifier gets in the way</li>
    <li> Really looks nice,  This is a plug not a hard wire I wasn&#x27;t aware my husband was able to hard wire it without a problem.</li>
    <li> A little bit dim but all in all it met our expectations. Delivery was delayed 10 days later than I paid for, but this was resolved by a refund of the difference.</li>
    <li> Magnifying 10x too small a circle</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this mirror, but was so disappointed!  First of all the magnification is as others have said, not as strong as stated.  I was replacing a 7x magnification mirror I got at Lowes.  My current mirror gives a much larger and better quality reflection.  This mirror warped my face and made it appear very elongated.  And the lighting was very dim.  No thanks!</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine as far from magnification, but the lighting feature, which is why I bought it, is worthless.  It does not illuminate the mirror at all and actually makes it harder to use the mirror.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> would have liked the arm to be a bit longer</li>
    <li> The Oval Halo Lighted Wall Mount Mirror has a cord--which was NOT shown in any of the pictures and was not included in the description.  I like the light and mirror very much--they are perfect for our new master bath.  The cord, however, is an eyesore and drapes over our hand towel holder which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> i like the product&lt;br /&gt;i like it comes with the mounted hardware&lt;br /&gt;i like it comes with the replacement light bulb</li>
    <li> I have buy for me because i don&#x27;t see perfectly and i like so much and since I bought my husband, who is very clear, used too and he love it.</li>
    <li> This is the third Jerdon mirror product we have installed in our house (wife &amp; four girls). I also used their products in the hotel industry. The products seem well made and well designed for their function. We will likely purchase more and would recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a wall mounted lighted make up mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and our new home. In the past she used a standard store bought deal without great magnification and no light. This is worth the extra cash we spent, she will use this for the rest of her long wonderful life. Get this product if you are on the fence, it is a good move.</li>
    <li> While this is a really nice looking mirror, sad to say that it broke after only 9 months use.  The way it is designed, the main \\&quot;swivel joint\\&quot; has a bolt with a very strong spring on it, bud sadly they designed it so that only a very small portion of the bolt threads go into the top fitting.  When the bolt falls out, you can take the mirror down and put the bolt back in, but just the amount of pressure it takes to move the mirror (it is pretty large and fairly heavy), pops the bolt out and the mirror wants to hang from fitting that has just come apart.  I should have checked the warranty.  I guess it was only for 1 month.  Guess I&#x27;ll look for another brand, after I research this manufacturer to make sure they don&#x27;t sell under other names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong about the 1-month warranty.  The mirror comes with a 1-year product defect warranty, so I&#x27;m getting a new mirror in a few days!  I&#x27;m a happy camper again! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror. Installed  easily.  Would recommend this item. Looks nice on the wall, and tucks away nicely against the wall when not in use.</li>
    <li> This mirror was ok but a little too thick for where I wanted to hang it so I had to send it back...sorry</li>
    <li> I just returned this item.  It is advertised as a 10 magnification but it is not.  There were a few reviews that stated this, but since this mirror had so many great reviews, I figured the other people were mistaken.  They were not.  I currently own a mirror with 8 magnification, and bought this 10 magnification to keep at my cottage.  When I looked at myself in it, I knew instantly there was a problem.  I set it next to my 8X, and the new 10X magnification was not even equal to my 8X!!  I would guess it is either 5 or 6X.  There is a small 15X on the Jerdon, and that was definitely more magnification than my 8X - maybe the small round area is 10X.  All I know is that someone is greatly mistaken to advertise this Jerdon as 10 magnification.  If you don&#x27;t have a mirror to compare it to as I do, you probably wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This mirror completely fulfilled my wife&#x27;s expectations.  It looks and feels like a quality product.  Most others that we have seen seem cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed because the product details say the magnification of the mirror is 10x.  It&#x27;s not!  I already have a mirror that is 10x so there is an obvious difference.  For anyone with challenged eyes, do not bother with this product.  The tiny mirror is supposed to be 15x, but seems more like 10x.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it everyday to put on makeup.  My husband  also uses it to shave by!</li>
    <li> My eyesight is not what it used to be.  I was so tired of squinting with a small magnifying mirror, trying to hold it and apply makeup at the same time just was not working anymore.  I had a tabletop lighted mirror, but I didn&#x27;t like it because I had to bend over to use it.  When I saw this one, I knew right away it was the one I wanted, and it is everything I need.  The way it swivels and turns, I can easily find the magnification I need and the light is terrific!  I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror. Very affordable compared to other models and functions just the same as the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This oval shape takes up less room on the wall and really like the small extra close magnifier!!!</li>
    <li> The picture makes this look like a Circle but its actually an OVAL mirror, not circle.. and I personally didn&#x27;t easily read anything about it being an oval.  I would have rather had a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is ridiculously useless.  Might as well not even have a light because it is so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MAY return this, but honestly returning items is not something I get around to do very often.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great bargain! It came with everything you need to install it quickly and easily. My wife just loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for a friend.  The birthday was some weeks away and so the packaging was not opened until way past any warranty.  Unfortunately the mirror was broken.  I explained the situation to Amazon and accepted that a warranty claim was not justified but I wondered if they could offer a discount on the replacement.  To my delight they sent a completely free replacement..... Amazon you are truly Amazing.....So all in all a  5 star purchase.</li>
    <li> Found the type of mirror my wife wanted and ordered it on Amazon. The mirror arrived today along with about six other items (one other was glass also). The box was in good shape as well as the box the mirror itself was in however when I opened the box I found a large crack in the mirror itself but no other damage. As I write this I have called the company that made it \\&quot;Jerdon\\&quot; and was told since I bought it on Amazon I would need to get them to replace it under the 30 day return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done with looking at the Amazon return policy which states that since it was sold by \\&quot;Trend Marketing\\&quot; I would have to return it to Amazon&#x27;s warehouse and after checking it the refund would be issued two days later (this item is not able to be exchanged, refund only). So I then went looking for information on Trend Marketing and can not find any contact information for them. There is a link for contact information on Amazon for them but it comes up with an error message when hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I would like to see in a resolution is for a new mirror (unbroken) to be shipped to me and a return label sent for the broken merchandise (sorry but this seems fair as most retailers and companies would do the same) I don&#x27;t think its appropriate to either pay for another mirror and ship this one back, while Amazon holds my money or for me to wait for the mirror to be shipped back and the credit is issued before I can reorder something that should have been sent unbroken to begin with.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews where the buyer claimed the magnification was not that good. That is just not the case. A standard mirror on one side, 10x and 15x on the other, both sides lit.&lt;br /&gt;If this mirror magnified any more you could paint your pores. Girls, this is an excellent makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> Mirror just arrived and it&#x27;s gorgeous. The mirror and mountings are perfect. I did plug it in to make sure it worked before installation. The light is not powerful but in my bathroom this is not a problem. The mirror is definately 10x so I don&#x27;t understand the previous reviews that indicate it is 5x or less. I compared it to my small 10x and there&#x27;s no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly wait to use it. If any problems arise I&#x27;ll writean update. All posted reviews are greatly appreciated. Amazon is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; source for reviews.</li>
    <li> The light is very dull.  You can&#x27;t see your face in the mirror properly.  Otherwise it is very good item.  Thanks.</li>
