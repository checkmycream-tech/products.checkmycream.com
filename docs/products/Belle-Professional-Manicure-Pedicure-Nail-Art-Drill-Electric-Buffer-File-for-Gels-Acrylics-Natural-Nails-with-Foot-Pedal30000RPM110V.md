      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times and it has worked great.</li>
      <li>Very powerful.</li>
      <li>and it has really saved me money because now I can do my own full sets and acrylics.</li>
      <li>Much like most salons use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; fill my own nails, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 on a professional drill to use on myself.</li>
      <li>Yes that quick.</li>
      <li>so far i LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Right when the product arrive i can&#x27;t wait any longer</li>
      <li>with the best handle,it will have the same problem after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would have rather spent $300 on a nice tool.</li>
      <li>, i did not have that problem at all although I was using it for nails whereas they did not specify what they were using it for during the time of it getting hot.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love</li>
      <li>needs a DETAILED manual to reassemble handle rather than paying just as much to fix it as getting a new one</li>
      <li>really appreciate all effort nice drill but its not really what I was looking for the it work out</li>
      <li>I pretty much prefer using the hand control over the foot control.</li>
      <li>I bought a generic one and its not as strong but it still works and it hasn&#x27;t popped off yet...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain this unit was purchased and opened, then returned by another customer.</li>
      <li>Was shipped fast and on time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this much, as I&#x27;m not working in a salon.  </li>
      <li>fast arrival.</li>
      <li>Thanks to YouTube</li>
      <li>The drill itself spins very slowly or not at all.</li>
      <li>I purchase this drill and have been very happy with it, it has a lot of power,doesn&#x27;t slow down when using pressure and does the job well, also standard bits fit it</li>
      <li>I would have a new one!</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>but I can live with that.  </li>
      <li>had to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Very professional style nail drill.</li>
      <li>and my nails look professionally done.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered on time and packed professionally.</li>
      <li>Being a professional  </li>
      <li>very quiet and fast.</li>
      <li>This product may ok for the everyday joe but is not recommended for use on daily or even weekly use.</li>
      <li>and I probably used it no more than 3 sets of gel nails and the top of the hand piece just popped off like its nothing, couldn&#x27;t put it back together!</li>
      <li>And yes, a new one was ordered, not an open box.</li>
      <li>the only problem that i&#x27;ve had with it was when I tried to move the lever for the speed the plastic lever piece fell off, it did that a few times but was easy to put back on and that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 star.</li>
      <li>The motor area gets a  little hot during a nail fill</li>
      <li>a few people said that it got hot during use</li>
      <li>I tried to use it, and it released the drill bit, but then when I tried to place a new one in, it closed to the point I would have had to force the bit in, which I don&#x27;t want to do.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dead out of the box. It will not turn on. It was a gift that my daughter did not try out until it was too late to return it. Would not buy Bellehome products again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a prof nail tech but I&#x27;ve been doing my own acrylics and this one is by far the best of the 3 I&#x27;ve had. Has a lot of power.</li>
    <li> I would not give this a star!! I would give it -10 if I could. this machine is horrible! it worked great in the beginning and I probably used it no more than 3 sets of gel nails and the top of the hand piece just popped off like its nothing, couldn&#x27;t put it back together! had to buy a new one. I thought by the time I pay shipping and repair I would have a new one! I bought a generic one and its not as strong but it still works and it hasn&#x27;t popped off yet... waste of time and money! don&#x27;t get this! the generic one I found was for 40$ and does a good job! don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It works great just as advertised. Was shipped fast and on time.Has everything you will need to do nails. It come with the bits you will need to get started.</li>
    <li> This is incredible. Perfect machine. The supplies it comes with and the quality are great. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Love the option of foot or hand controls.  If your looking for similar products buy this one!!!</li>
    <li> This product may ok for the everyday joe but is not recommended for use on daily or even weekly use. As i took a chance as a professional on this product because the customer support said that they would stand behind there product. My problem was with the handle after so may times unlocking and locking the chuck nut to replace bits, the handle threads became stripped, it is very cheaply done and will keep stripping. However when emailed them my problem this is what they wrote back..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Valued Customer,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your contact.&lt;br /&gt;All products from our shop are guaranteed for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;So the warranty has expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our engineer said the Handle is consumable item.When you polish,nail dust and water will stick or suck the handle, after a long time, it can not turn.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the best handle,it will have the same problem after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now my problem wasn&#x27;t the turning it was the threads being stripped so they was no conversation at all about the issue just a shut down. So order at your own risk. Proof is in the customer service.. i would rate lower but this is as low as i can. :(</li>
    <li> Great quality! Timely shipping! Works great! Diamond bits aren&#x27;t great but the sanding ones are!</li>
    <li> Well I bought this Dec 30 2014 and it died today  I was using it and I guess it said I am done  Yes that quick. It was working very nicely no problems at all I got up went to the ladies room came back to continue work on my client and NOTHING totally dead  Of course the guarantee is for 6mos. I miss it by 1 month.  I would think about it very hard if you would like to buy this machine.  I was glad I had a back-up</li>
    <li> Right when the product arrive i can&#x27;t wait any longer so i gave it a try i fell in love with the product</li>
    <li> I made this purchase Feb 8th 2014 and I received it by the 10th or the 11th. I was a bit nervous because I wanted something of what I like to call &amp;#34;Nail Shop&amp;#34; quality and I had been told I wasn&#x27;t going to find that without spending hundreds of dollars...This PRODUCT does everything plus more. I was completely shocked that it has the same if not more power than the drills at the nail shops and it has really saved me money because now I can do my own full sets and acrylics. My nails for Valentine&#x27;s Day was beautiful thanks to this drill. I am so happy I made this investment. ITS A MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and packed professionally. The drill has been working great, no kinks; it has been a great addition to this Nail Tech&#x27;s life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; fill my own nails, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300 on a professional drill to use on myself. I purchase this drill and have been very happy with it, it has a lot of power,doesn&#x27;t slow down when using pressure and does the job well, also standard bits fit it so it&#x27;s easy to get replacements! Would recommend to anyone wanting a quality drill for less.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me for my birthday. Imagine my disappointment when a shabby box was withdrawn from the shipping box. I&#x27;m fairly certain this unit was purchased and opened, then returned by another customer. The foot pedal is missing, as are one of the drill tips, the package containing them had already been opened and the twenty sanding bands are missing. The so called instruction manual was a single sheet with not very useful info. The drill itself spins very slowly or not at all. Yes, I did insert the bit correctly. My mom is embarrassed and angry that her gift was a flop. I&#x27;m just kinda sad. My mom is going to give it another chance by requesting a replacement because the unit itself feels well made, just used. And yes, a new one was ordered, not an open box. If the replacement makes me happy I&#x27;ll submit another review.</li>
    <li> thank for you patience with me really appreciate all effort nice drill but its not really what I was looking for the it work out I had big problem with the bits going in</li>
    <li> Being a professional  I was praying to find a nail drill machine that I can take with me clients home this machine works really good and I am extremely happy with the choice I made good machine.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this device.  I thought long and hard because there were no reviews.  But I am glad I made the choice.  The people have excellent CS.  They were sending me emails about how to use and contact them before I even received the product.  The drill works great!  I have yet to use the foot pedal, but I don&#x27;t need it.  I use it for my gel nails and as I said, it works great and my nails look professionally done.</li>
    <li> I love this. It arrived on time and it was easy to figure out how to insert and remove the nail bits that camebwith it. It is very easy to handle and use. I pretty much prefer using the hand control over the foot control. Does a great job and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So upset.  I don&#x27;t use this much, as I&#x27;m not working in a salon.  I use it on my daughter every other week, and after about 10 uses, it will no longer open to accept the driblet.  It&#x27;s stored properly and used properly.  I tried to use it, and it released the drill bit, but then when I tried to place a new one in, it closed to the point I would have had to force the bit in, which I don&#x27;t want to do.  I&#x27;m stuck with a product I got maybe 10 uses out of.  Never, ever again.</li>
    <li> Works great on my huband&#x27;s piggy feet toe nails. now he doesn&#x27;t had to go to doctor to do them.&lt;br /&gt;Am going to try them on my dogs also. Millie</li>
    <li> Very professional style nail drill. Much like most salons use. Easy bit change. Very powerful.</li>
    <li> poorly made. the oower to it is a lot weaker than whats said or compared to other drills with the same rpm. it does however get the job done..  The handle was never dropped and messed up so tried opening it... and the spring flung it everywhere.. needs a DETAILED manual to reassemble handle rather than paying just as much to fix it as getting a new one</li>
    <li> Shipped on time. I used it as soon as I got it. the only problem that i&#x27;ve had with it was when I tried to move the lever for the speed the plastic lever piece fell off, it did that a few times but was easy to put back on and that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 star. i do feel as though that shouldn&#x27;t have happened but I can live with that.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews before I purchased this product and a few people said that it got hot during use, i did not have that problem at all although I was using it for nails whereas they did not specify what they were using it for during the time of it getting hot. so far i LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times and it has worked great.</li>
    <li> The bit sanders don&#x27;t fit correctly. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Cheap cheap cheap. Would have rather spent $300 on a nice tool. Totally disappointed. It&#x27;s now sitting in a closet at work.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love helps me a lot to use that I&#x27;m giving it. I recommend this product is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> This machine works great! I&#x27;ve used for hours with no problems. Very easy to set up and use. The only thing I was bummed about is the color. The item said it was blue but what I received was purple.  That&#x27;s why I rated it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. The motor area gets a  little hot during a nail fill but it seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first but than i gave it a try anyway because i&#x27;m in need of a nail tech machine.&lt;br /&gt;Right when the product arrive i can&#x27;t wait any longer so i gave it a try i fell in love with the product. i would recommended&lt;br /&gt;this product to any one that in need of the nail tech machine.</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to add the drill bits and properly screw the drill it self. Thanks to YouTube it works wonderful very  low noise great product!</li>
    <li> fast arrival. works great. for an at home use its amazing. did not overheat while in use for more than 30 min. i have this drill for like a week now and it works amazing. very quiet and fast. happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great item, works well.  The handle is a little heavy compared to what I was accustomed to but after a few uses I&#x27;ve adjusted.</li>
