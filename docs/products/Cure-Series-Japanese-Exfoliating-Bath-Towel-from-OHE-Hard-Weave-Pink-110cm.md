      <li>Japanese exfoliating wash cloths are the best!  </li>
      <li>I love these towels.</li>
      <li>I love exfoliating</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a bit rougher, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>More like the equivalent to the scrubby gloves that you can buy.</li>
      <li>Love this cloth.</li>
      <li>liked the reach on the back and good to touch.</li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>The sizing is brilliant, it can be squished up into a poof or stretched out to its 40\\&quot; length.</li>
      <li>like i said, its ok - its just not what i was expecting and really only good for a light scrub rather than a good whole body exfoliation that i desire.</li>
      <li>Great product and enjoy using daily.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes a great gift and works well with sea salt scrub, its like showering in your personal spa every day.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully for removing dead skin cells without using a lot of elbow grease.</li>
      <li>After spending a number of years trying to find an alternative to the fantastic Shisheido scrub towels I used to buy when flying through Japan, I&#x27;ve settled on these.  </li>
      <li>They are light weight and quick drying.</li>
      <li>These exfoliating towels are very handy and are large enough to do the job easily.</li>
      <li>It feels slightly scratchy but doesn&#x27;t hurt, it feels good!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best exfoliating scrub for hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>This is a true scrub, not like using salt or sugar.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
      <li>It makes a good lather of any soap (just a tiny dab of soap on this cloth is more than ample for cleansing the entire body).</li>
      <li>Most importantly, they are long  </li>
      <li>This cloth works way better than the loofah balls and much gentler than the natural woven ones.</li>
      <li>The soap lathers well, and the towel is easy to keep clean.... just rinse after shower and throw into the washer machine with your regular laundry (no fabric softener though).</li>
      <li>I bought two of these, and I find them so soft and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My skin is naturally oily all over and this thing gives me that clean feeling and softens the skin as it exfoliates.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order the blue one next time for a good scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I also use this for my face either with soap (mostly black soap which is natural and does an amazing job of giving you that squeaky clean feeling)</li>
      <li>It really makes it easy to scrub my back too.</li>
      <li>I love that it exfoliates better than anything else I have tried without being harsh on the skin or leaving me red and splotchy from irritation.</li>
      <li>This thing really works.</li>
      <li>or I use it with St Ives walnut scrub which really exfoliates.</li>
      <li>and once you use it the wash cloth seems absolutely primitive.  </li>
      <li>Also lathers up with soap really well as.</li>
      <li>I gave it 5 stars, an &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;, for a rating because this product left my skin feel extremely soft.</li>
      <li>This might be too harsh for newbies at exfoliating, so make sure and get the right courseness</li>
      <li>While they are not quite as hard as the Japanese originals, they are pretty good, and definitely better than the Salux product that has almost no structural integrity and frays within a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>The soap foams up nicely and the lather seems to last a very long time when using in the shower.</li>
      <li>It is better than your typical washcloth because it doesn&#x27;t hold dirt and what not.</li>
      <li>So many of these nylon towels are too short for me to flip over and reach my back...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these since I was a young pup!</li>
      <li>Used with a body scrub lotion it gives a harsh but pleasant scrub and dead skin is gone.  </li>
      <li>I like this one because it is not too harsh (won&#x27;t cause abrasions), and not too smooth ( like those at Bath &amp; Body Works, Sephora, etc..)  </li>
      <li>This little (not so little actually) cloth is amazing!</li>
      <li>It is great for the back and is long enough for you to use both arms to &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34; across the back/those hard areas of the back to get.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even large enough to scrub your back when fully extended.</li>
      <li>Maybe i should have tried the cure super hard weave but instead of wasting my money trying a new brand i am just going to stick with what i know and stock up on the body shop towels the next time they go on sale.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and really gets rid of dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>When it wears out I might get the super hard weave.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, but be careful with how hard you scrub.</li>

<li> I wish Amazon carried the extra hard at time of purchase, but this one is a decent substitute.</li>
<li> You can tell you are getting rid of dead skin cells when you use this, as your skin is soft and silky when finished.</li>
<li> I was looking for a replacement since mine wasn&#x27;t giving me the same hard scrub as i was used to when it was new</li>
<li> They are really long... not too rough</li>
<li> I have only used it for a couple months but my usual wash cloths or loofah are even in the same family !  </li>
<li> i am still using my old body shop towel because it still gives a harder scrub than the cure hard weave.</li>
<li> Maybe I like it too rough.</li>
<li> but it was such a waste of money.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mean to be sarcastic, but I didn&#x27;t see any result from using the bath towel.  </li>
<li> I assumed that when i bought the hard weave that i would actually get a hard weave...</li>
<li> I got this a few days ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
<li> I cut it in half and its like having two!</li>
<li> but you don&#x27;t need to press hard while using.</li>
<li> sadly it performs about as well as my worn out exfoliating skin towel from the body shop.</li>

    <li> Love this cloth. It takes away the dryness and feels yummy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews I read about it. It feels so nice to scrub my skin with it. It really makes it easy to scrub my back too. It feels slightly scratchy but doesn&#x27;t hurt, it feels good! When it wears out I might get the super hard weave. I totally recommend this exfoliating bath towel.</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago and have been using it ever since. I cut it in half and its like having two! They are really long... not too rough but you don&#x27;t need to press hard while using. It leaves your skin feeling soft and really gets rid of dead skin cells. Wish I had this sooner! Excellent item for the price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be sarcastic, but I didn&#x27;t see any result from using the bath towel.  I feel like all that I am doing is just running over my skin with a simple cloth, which is something I can do with any wash cloth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I assumed that when i bought the hard weave that i would actually get a hard weave... sadly it performs about as well as my worn out exfoliating skin towel from the body shop. I was looking for a replacement since mine wasn&#x27;t giving me the same hard scrub as i was used to when it was new so i found the cure series here but it was such a waste of money. i am still using my old body shop towel because it still gives a harder scrub than the cure hard weave.

    <li> I thought it would be a bit rougher, but it&#x27;s ok. It serves it&#x27;s purpose. I&#x27;ll order the blue one next time for a good scrubbing.</li>
    <li> This thing really works. It does a great job of exfoliating. My skin is naturally oily all over and this thing gives me that clean feeling and softens the skin as it exfoliates. I have had it for I believe two years now and it is still going strong. It is great for the back and is long enough for you to use both arms to &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34; across the back/those hard areas of the back to get. I also use this for my face either with soap (mostly black soap which is natural and does an amazing job of giving you that squeaky clean feeling) or I use it with St Ives walnut scrub which really exfoliates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years. It&#x27;s the best exfoliating scrub for hard to reach places. This is a true scrub, not like using salt or sugar. More like the equivalent to the scrubby gloves that you can buy. Problem is I can&#x27;t get my back with scrubby gloves. This is a must have. I love exfoliating and I have for years. This might be too harsh for newbies at exfoliating, so make sure and get the right courseness</li>
    <li> it felt great after using this. liked the reach on the back and good to touch. Holds the suds nicely.</li>

    <li> Love this!! Makes my skin so smooth. Use it all over and my face too. Giving them as gifts to friends</li>
    <li> These exfoliating towels are very handy and are large enough to do the job easily. The soap foams up nicely and the lather seems to last a very long time when using in the shower. You can tell you are getting rid of dead skin cells when you use this, as your skin is soft and silky when finished. It&#x27;s even large enough to scrub your back when fully extended. I recommend for use prior to self-tanning or spray tanning. Nice product!</li>
    <li> Product does wonders on my skin! Easy to use, but be careful with how hard you scrub. Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, and I find them so soft and easy to use.  Most importantly, they are long  So many of these nylon towels are too short for me to flip over and reach my back...The length on this one was perfect!  And the material has held up well.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this itteli towel! It&#x27;s HUGE, nice and scrubby, and good quality. I definitely will order this one again.</li>
    <li> I  was expecting a course weave</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars, an &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;, for a rating because this product left my skin feel extremely soft. It is better than your typical washcloth because it doesn&#x27;t hold dirt and what not.</li>
    <li> Japanese exfoliating wash cloths are the best!  This Cure series brand does not disappoint.  The texture was rough enough to feel like it was doing some work on my dead skin cells, but soft enough to even scrub the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
    <li> This little (not so little actually) cloth is amazing! It makes a good lather of any soap (just a tiny dab of soap on this cloth is more than ample for cleansing the entire body).

    <li> I love these towels. They have my skin looking and feeling younger. I use them when I go to my aqua classes. They are light weight and quick drying.</li>
    <li> Out son-in-law gave us some of the towels that he brought back from overseas.  It was time to replace and found these on line.  Great product and enjoy using daily.</li>
