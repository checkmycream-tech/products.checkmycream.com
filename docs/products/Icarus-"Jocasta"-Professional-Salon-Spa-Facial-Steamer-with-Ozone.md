      <li>Very light weight, easy to roll around and maneuver, heats up fast, dense blast of steam, plastic cup</li>
      <li>Only used it once so far, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I finally after reading reviews made this purchase and have been very happy with this facial steamer.</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived on time.  </li>
      <li>That is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, easy to assemble, and works fabulous so far.  </li>
      <li>Great products still working after a few months.</li>
      <li>Right now it is all duck taped so it will stand up and for the clients safety.</li>
      <li>The jar is not glass but rather a sturdy plastic which makes me happy because I have seen glass break if over filled or left running dry</li>
      <li>shipping very fast</li>
      <li>Tons of steam and far better than my old one, for which I paid far more.</li>
      <li>it works fine, not as high quality as the more expensive ones, but a good value for the money.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>(but not mine, of course ;-) )  </li>
      <li>I wish there was a place to put essential oil in it, but nevertheless, I&#x27;m still satisfied.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks fantastic, I am in my sixties have been seeing a skin care professional for years...</li>
      <li>I noticed when I first started using the steamer, I could see the steamer stream..</li>
      <li>The first one I purchased it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The bottom is extremely flimsy, the adjustment valve fell apart immediately the whole bottom is made of plastic and aluminum and completely fell apart immediately, the steamer is great</li>
      <li>My issue is always how long thiey last, but so far, so good!  </li>
      <li>Good for small spaces.</li>
      <li>Assembly was simple, easy.  </li>
      <li>Heated up in under ten minutes and was easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>so your not messing around with glass, simple and easy functions.</li>
      <li>A rather large, rectangular picture frame.</li>
      <li>I am really like this.</li>
      <li>and this stand makes it so much easier.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I just lounge back and enjoy the steam.  </li>
      <li>Was delivered VERY promptly.</li>
      <li>I have been an aesthetician for nearly 20 years and have used many different steamers.</li>
      <li>Strong steam but height adjustment is limited</li>
      <li>I highly reccomed.</li>
      <li>Works well with no issues so far.</li>
      <li>They bottom is completely wobbly.</li>
      <li>Warms up in less than 5 minutes and has a powerful stream of steam.</li>
      <li>will see what happens further, but so far no less than 5 stars.</li>
      <li>After u few times of using the steamer it does not work it turns on but it won&#x27;t get hot trying g to see if I can contact manufacturer to either get a new one or my money back</li>
      <li>Only a few minutes to start steaming, and delivers the steam powerfully with no spurting or dripping.  </li>
      <li>I do see the moisture appearing on the client&#x27;s face, however, pointing the steamer in the right direction proves to be difficult as I can see the steam any longer.  </li>

    <li> I just use it two times.My face look better than before. I am really like this.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Thank you</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy.  Look for better quality</li>
    <li> They bottom is completely wobbly. For this price I would expect better quality.</li>
    <li> The legs seem a little low quality, but otherwise performs the function well. May repurchase.</li>

    <li> Works great and very reasonably priced. Warms up in less than 5 minutes and has a powerful stream of steam. Had to run water through it a few times to get the plastic smell gone, but that is to be expected when it has a plastic water resevoir. Construction feels a bit cheap, but you get what you pay for, and it does not affect the performance. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> In the last year I have purchased 3 other steamers from other suppliers and have had problems I finally after reading reviews made this purchase and have been very happy with this facial steamer. Works well with no issues so far.</li>
    <li> Instead of the product pictured above, I received a picture frame. A rather large, rectangular picture frame. Buyers, beware. Perhaps my case is exceptional.</li>
    <li> The Steamer was deliverd on time. Easy to assemble. It works very well. I am pleasently surpised that it is as good as I hoped</li>
    <li> works great, very affordable.</li>
    <li> Great steamer. Been using it for only a month.  Only a few minutes to start steaming, and delivers the steam powerfully with no spurting or dripping.  I wish there was a place to put essential oil in it, but nevertheless, I&#x27;m still satisfied.  Was delivered VERY promptly.</li>
    <li> My ozone just stopped working.  I&#x27;ve reached out -- to no avail nobody around to help me trouble shoot it.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this steamer, the price too.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Heats well. Good for small spaces.</li>
    <li> The bottom is extremely flimsy, the adjustment valve fell apart immediately the whole bottom is made of plastic and aluminum and completely fell apart immediately, the steamer is great but if your and esthetician and you  have to move the adjust, forget it. Right now it is all duck taped so it will stand up and for the clients safety. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> so far so good! better than the $229 one I bought and broke on me.</li>
    <li> Best I ever used. Tons of steam and far better than my old one, for which I paid far more.</li>

    <li> Defective. Steam turns off every 20 seconds you have to keep watching it and turn it back on. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Great products still working after a few months. Strong steam but height adjustment is limited</li>
    <li> After u few times of using the steamer it does not work it turns on but it won&#x27;t get hot trying g to see if I can contact manufacturer to either get a new one or my money back</li>
    <li> I have been an aesthetician for nearly 20 years and have used many different steamers. This one is, hands down, the best I have ever used !! Powerful steamer, superb ozone with a gorgeous subtle violet color, lightweight and so very easy to put together and maneuver. Outstanding !</li>
    <li> The first one I purchased it didn&#x27;t work. I had to exchange it for another one. I tested it, haven&#x27;t used it. Seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought in 5 years. My wife uses it twice or three times a week, the life expectancy is about two years. But for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, easy to roll around and maneuver, heats up fast, dense blast of steam, plastic cup so your not messing around with glass, simple and easy functions. I highly reccomed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This steamer was better than I expeccted.  It is lightweight, easy to assemble, and works fabulous so far.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> The steamer works beautifully it makes me realize how old and crappy my other one was! It heats up very quickly which is also fantastic!</li>
    <li> so far very good, everylightand comfortable and smooth. good</li>
    <li> 32 days after ordering, it no longer works</li>
    <li> Look s like it&#x27;s used and it does not stay up</li>
    <li> got this for my wife a few months ago. works like a charm. surprise. i think it&#x27;s better than many $200 models out there. will see what happens further, but so far no less than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using yet&lt;br /&gt;Just use first time to see how is working look really good . shipping very fast</li>
    <li> I went back and forth between a few options and I&#x27;m glad I chose this steamer. Heated up in under ten minutes and was easy to assemble. Would be easy to de assemble for storage.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Steamer...I use it twice a week after cleansing my face throughly and follow with a toner then steam for 10 minutes with ozone turned on.  It heats up quickly, no dripping and this stand makes it so much easier.  I just lounge back and enjoy the steam.  It is so great on my sinuses so using this gives me double the benefits.  It was shipped quickly and arrived on time.  My skin looks fantastic, I am in my sixties have been seeing a skin care professional for years...she recommended me doing this glad she did, I see her once a month and this keeps my skin radiant between sessions.  I may not need her anymore because it works GREAT!</li>
    <li> works great, has even steam and NO clicking timer</li>
    <li> This is a review after only a couple weeks of use, but it works great!  My issue is always how long thiey last, but so far, so good!  It was easy to put together.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Esthetician.  I wanted a steamer to use at home for friends and family.  This is PERFECT!  Heated up in 6 min (from max line) and ran for almost 20 min before automatically shutting off when the water got to low.  It had a nice even flow of steam with no drips.  The jar is not glass but rather a sturdy plastic which makes me happy because I have seen glass break if over filled or left running dry (but not mine, of course ;-) )  Assembly was simple, easy.  I would recommend buying this steamer and buying it from SalonGuys.  Their price was unbeatable and I had it on my door step in 3 days (California to PA!!) - LOVE Amazon Prime</li>
    <li> Worked great twice, then stopped working.  The guy who fixes my machines said it would cost more to fix than I paid for it.  I should have heeded the other warning reviews.</li>
    <li> Works fine i think the extended arm should be flexible.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a spa, and it works great so far.</li>
    <li> this is the worst thing that I ever buy, don&#x27;t please Don&#x27;t buy anything from jocasta, after you buy it yiu can returned but you have to pay for that and nobody&#x27;s give you yhe money so, in the end you are loosing 50.00 dls sending the product, when the cost it was 100.00 dlsor wherever price the put in offer, IF YOU WANT TO LOOSE YOUR MONEY, BUY IN &amp;#34; JOCASTA&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to post a review to see how well it really works.  It works great, you can adjust height and angle of the arm where the steam comes out.  Great seller!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Seems sufficient for the price</li>
    <li> I recently purchased, a few weeks ago.  I noticed when I first started using the steamer, I could see the steamer stream.. I however, can no longer see it, not sure why.  I do see the moisture appearing on the client&#x27;s face, however, pointing the steamer in the right direction proves to be difficult as I can see the steam any longer.  Not sure why this is, but I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly,&lt;br /&gt;Esthetician, Seattle, wA</li>
