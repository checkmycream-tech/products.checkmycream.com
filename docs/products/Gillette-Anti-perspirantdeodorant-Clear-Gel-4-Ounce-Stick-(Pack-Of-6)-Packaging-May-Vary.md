      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>This brand of gel is the best out of everything I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I thought the price was very good per unit.</li>
      <li>I got the 6 pack for $20, great deal.  </li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>Great Product and provides all the support I need.</li>
      <li>Great smell as well.</li>
      <li>Smells great too.</li>
      <li>I am happy and will not deviate again.  </li>
      <li>And therefore, when Gillette says that it&#x27;s the best a man can get, I strongly disagree....</li>
      <li>This is good because it doesn&#x27;t leave a stain on my clothes when I put them on after applying the deodorant.</li>
      <li>Both are good.</li>
      <li>and it smells good.</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>Good manly smell.</li>
      <li>This is good because it means that I don&#x27;t have to lug deodorant in my purse and reapply during the day because it has stopped working.</li>
      <li>and I used it for years thinking it was as good as anything else.</li>
      <li>I perspire quite a bit and this Gillette works exceptionally well at keeping my sweat to a minimum.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant smell that I find to be refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It smells reasonably nice for deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll smell fresh and feel great all day.</li>
      <li>I will be looking for a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This smells great and gets me through the day really well.</li>
      <li>For just a bit more than Walgreen&#x27;s, I can get it through the mail, and it is just what it says it is.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Mitchum product better.  </li>
      <li>Bought it online because I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the store - isn&#x27;t living in the future great?!?</li>
      <li>Once the product is on it is just ok.  </li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s actually the best that a man and a WOMAN can get.</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; works much better than stick deodorants for my hairy armpits.</li>
      <li>and then spray my favorite body spray or cologne for scent.  </li>
      <li>and I love the smell until one day my wife asked me if I changed something</li>
      <li>Most deodorants I&#x27;ve tried either work well but cause an allergic reaction, or don&#x27;t cause a reaction but also don&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>but it is also more expansive.</li>
      <li>I like the Axes Phoenix better</li>
      <li>Love having products arrive on door step rather than going out and messing with the crowds.</li>
      <li>Most of them didn&#x27;t work well</li>
      <li>The cool wave scent I think is the best fragrance Gillette has developed.</li>
      <li>I love the smell (not too strong, but nice and clean) and the price is better than at walmart/target.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about this deodorant is that it works all day and evening long.</li>
      <li>We love this product as it does not leave stains on garments, light fragrant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years just as a change but always kept with the Gillette Cool Wave.</li>
      <li>It had a nice clean, fresh smell without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>In fact, they feel just fine.</li>
      <li>As an anti-perspirant it works fine -</li>
      <li>As a deodorant, this stuff works fine.  </li>
      <li>The price was very affordable and I took advantage of a coupon that was offered making the price even more affordable!  </li>
      <li>and/or weren&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>Is that not what is important.  </li>
      <li>And please don&#x27;t let the nice people of Gillette tell you that I put too much of it</li>
      <li>If you want something that works and smells great look no further!</li>
      <li>In terms of antiperspirant &amp; deodorizing power, this is probably the most powerful I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With Gillette I just feel secure knowing that it will keep working for me all day</li>
      <li>I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly</li>
      <li>I WAS HAPPY WITH THE GILLETTE INVISIBLE SOLID COOL WAVE FORMULA AND FRAGRANCE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Clear Gel for many years in many scents because is smells great all day long.</li>
      <li>I can easily get a dry deodorant that smells just as good</li>
      <li>Have been using this deodorant for years, but recently it has not been as good.</li>
      <li>but maybe does not feel as &#x27;cool&#x27; as a gel one.</li>
      <li>cause she&#x27;s been finding more and more clothes with light blue stains under arms that she couldn&#x27;t treat or remove with any detergent known to her.</li>
      <li>The scents themselves smell fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t smell like gag inducing cologne like Axe deodorant, it smells fresh.</li>
      <li>You have got to love the nice cool gel in the morning to get you not high gear for the day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the box it arrived in was large enough for a dishwasher, but aside from that i was happy with the experience.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I come out of the shower and my armpits are super sticky.</li>
      <li>I thing that I will go with something more classic or nothing at all.</li>
      <li>I just found I liked other deodorants better.</li>
      <li>If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time.</li>
      <li>Not just the first time!.  </li>
      <li>I used to use an antiperspirant before then I changed for this deodorant, I used it everyday, everything went great</li>
      <li>I gave it two stars only because it is still effective.</li>
      <li>Worth it for the convenience to me, since I rarely go to drugstores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful without smelling powerful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Cool Wave gel deodorant since it first came out.</li>
      <li>Once you apply, if you put a shirt on right after, chances are it&#x27;s going to get on the shirt.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is something off about these, it dries differently, there are huge air pockets in the stick that cause it to shoot out when you twist the bottom, and it does not dry my sweat nearly as good as the store bought one.</li>
      <li>I find this deodorant cool in odour and very effective and long lasting ,&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t sweat so much.</li>
      <li>Old Spice is an antiquated technology and it amazes me how they are still even in business when there is something so amazing as Gillette Clear Gel out on the market.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.</li>
      <li>first day I somehow got it on my hands after putting my shirt on and went to eat breakfast.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t melt when I keep it in my gym bag in my car on a hot day.</li>
      <li>Sometime over the last year or so they must have changed their formula because now it smells different and to me, not in a pleasant way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t leave a messy residue, it&#x27;s clear gel.</li>
      <li>or so sticking out the top for each arm pit, this way still lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
      <li>The bleaching is not worth the nice feel and smell.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this anti-perspirant / deodorant on my first ever trip to America, and am actually still uncertain whether it&#x27;s available in Australia...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It never leaves a residue and it absorbs completely into the skin quite quickly.</li>
      <li>When i first used it it felt great but 30 minutes later i was sweating heavily</li>
      <li>Products like this should be tested more carefully.</li>
      <li>As an anti-persperant, well, not so much.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t taste very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy that I can buy products such as this in a bulk option.</li>
      <li>At least I have good smelling sweat coming from my arm pits.</li>
      <li>I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, and you actually get ALL the product out - to the very end, making it long lasting, and cost effective.</li>
      <li>I love all other Gillette products but this.  </li>
      <li>Gillette Clear Gel deodorant not only keeps my dry and smelling good, but it also doesn&#x27;t cause my armpits to become like the inflamed, itchy, burning fires of hell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Most deodorants I&#x27;ve tried either work well but cause an allergic reaction, or don&#x27;t cause a reaction but also don&#x27;t work well. Gillette Clear Gel deodorant not only keeps my dry and smelling good, but it also doesn&#x27;t cause my armpits to become like the inflamed, itchy, burning fires of hell. In fact, they feel just fine. As an added bonus, the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; works much better than stick deodorants for my hairy armpits.</li>
    <li> Bad engineering on applicator.  It&#x27;s like winding a clock every time you apply.  Not just the first time!.  It also gets messy.  I prefer the Mitchum product better.  Once the product is on it is just ok.  I love all other Gillette products but this.  I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum [[ASIN:B001EWEP86 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Power Gel, Unscented, 3.4-Ounce Stick (Pack of 4)]]unscented and then spray my favorite body spray or cologne for scent.  The mitchum applicator is instant.</li>
    <li> Start with the basics.  As a deodorant, this stuff works fine.  As an anti-persperant, well, not so much.  At least I have good smelling sweat coming from my arm pits.</li>
    <li> Have been using this deodorant for years, but recently it has not been as good. I imagine the formula has changed, as it stains any kind of shirt--white and colored (even after wearing it only a few times). Shame, as it actually works really well as an antiperspirant! The mechanism of the stick is a bit weird, as sometimes the gel comes out easily and other times it takes several twists, or squirts out. Find an alternative.</li>
    <li> My first deodorant ever was Old Spice and I used it for years thinking it was as good as anything else. It&#x27;s not. Old Spice is an antiquated technology and it amazes me how they are still even in business when there is something so amazing as Gillette Clear Gel out on the market. You put it on and it stays on, it&#x27;s completely invisible. With other deodorants you will begin to smell your body odor permeate through the inferior deodorant after a few hours. With Gillette Clear Gel, there is no body odor, ever. If I wanted to, I could go days without showering and it would keep working strong the whole time. The scents themselves smell fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t smell like gag inducing cologne like Axe deodorant, it smells fresh. After a few hours the smell dies, but the protection is still there. I&#x27;ve never had to re-apply no matter what I did.</li>
    <li> For just a bit more than Walgreen&#x27;s, I can get it through the mail, and it is just what it says it is.  Worth it for the convenience to me, since I rarely go to drugstores.</li>
    <li> In terms of antiperspirant &amp; deodorizing power, this is probably the most powerful I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell fresh and feel great all day. However, there were a few issues I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s a bit messy. You twist the bottom and sometimes it comes out, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just have to keep twisting. Once you apply, if you put a shirt on right after, chances are it&#x27;s going to get on the shirt.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I somehow got it on my hands after putting my shirt on and went to eat breakfast. Didn&#x27;t taste very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, when showering the next day it leaves an odd waxy residue that literally has to be rubbed off (it catches your finger).&lt;br /&gt;But I suppose that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a powerful antiperspirant and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are fairly non-issues, but are important to consider if looking at all of your options.&lt;br /&gt;If you can live with it being a bit messy, it&#x27;s definitely a very powerful deodorant and antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the current discounted price it&#x27;s around 4 bucks each in the pack of 6, which is a bit expensive-- but it&#x27;ll definitely keep you fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought the edge shaving gel. Both are good. I have used them for tears and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I tried several other products and then returned to this brand.  I am happy and will not deviate again.  My wife says it works!  Is that not what is important.  LOL</li>
    <li> this stuff keeps me from smelling like my neighbor looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the box it arrived in was large enough for a dishwasher, but aside from that i was happy with the experience.</li>
    <li> This product have disappointed me to the point of throwing the entire pack to the trash after I bought it in Sam&#x27;s Club. When i first used it it felt great but 30 minutes later i was sweating heavily and my deodorant didn&#x27;t help, at ALL! IT just left a giant stain in my shirt. That same thing happened to my brothers and my neighbor who I foolishly told him to buy it because of it&#x27;s price. In conclusion,  is a cheap product merchandised as a quality product, like other gillete products. BTW, Amazon&#x27;s price is WAY overpriced.</li>
    <li> I stick with amazon because of the price and the convenience. We love this product as it does not leave stains on garments, light fragrant.  Goes a long way.  I always suggest you buy a single stick to try before buying any multi-pack.  Thisnbrand is a stable for us.</li>
    <li> Not sure where the one reviewer gets his information but I can get a 4 pack at Sams Club for $10.88 so the price at Amazon is way over priced. In essence it is a rip off.</li>
    <li> It is too weak. Luckily I don&#x27;t sweat so much. The scent is not that &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. I like the Axes Phoenix better but it is also more expansive.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this batch is different than store bought ones, but it is definitely not the same. There is something off about these, it dries differently, there are huge air pockets in the stick that cause it to shoot out when you twist the bottom, and it does not dry my sweat nearly as good as the store bought one. The consistency seems thinner than normal, and it also left a stain on my shirt which it normally does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this deodorant all the time and decided to buy it in bulk online since I was already ordering something else. I give it a 2/5 because while it does offer some protection, it is not something you will want to use outside of lounging around the house or cutting the grass. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to go back to the store bought ones.</li>
    <li> CONTAINES INGREDIENTS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO MENTAL  WELL BEING.  IT CONTAINS ALUMINUM PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MENTAL UNSTABLENESS DUE TO BEING ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM.</li>
    <li> They seem to last a long tome I the closet. I thought the price was very good per unit. You have got to love the nice cool gel in the morning to get you not high gear for the day.</li>
    <li> Works well... its my choice for antiperspirant. The stuff is however, impossible to wipe off. Sometimes I come out of the shower and my armpits are super sticky. Not the end of the world, but quite irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff forever and have never had any issues with it. It doesn&#x27;t melt when I keep it in my gym bag in my car on a hot day. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. It smells reasonably nice for deodorant.</li>
    <li> I used to use an antiperspirant before then I changed for this deodorant, I used it everyday, everything went great and I love the smell until one day my wife asked me if I changed something cause she&#x27;s been finding more and more clothes with light blue stains under arms that she couldn&#x27;t treat or remove with any detergent known to her. I told her that I&#x27;ve started using a new Gillette Clear Gel Deodorant about 4 months ago. Since then I stopped using it, it&#x27;s not worth ruining your clothes, with all the chemicals they put in those things I thing that I will go with something more classic or nothing at all. And please don&#x27;t let the nice people of Gillette tell you that I put too much of it or I don&#x27;t let it dry completely before putting clothes on or even that my wife should take washing lessons. Products like this should be tested more carefully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette 3X clear gel for over 10 years and after experimenting with other brands, its now the only I&#x27;ll use for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It really is &#x27;clear&#x27; gel; many other brands say they are clear but in fact as they dry they turn whitish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s powerful without smelling powerful. I don&#x27;t want to smell like my deodorant, and the Cool Wave fragrance is very subtle. Also, my wife likes the smell, so that is an obvious plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It seems to last longer than other brands including other gels. I tried AXE but found their clear gel to take more layers of application to work with the same effectiveness as Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t degrade or melt when taken around in a gym bag. Over time some of the other gels I&#x27;ve bought lose their texture or melt if they&#x27;re not kept cool enough. I don&#x27;t have that problem with Gillette. I can take it to the gym, leave it in my gym bag in a hot car all day long, and it still works perfectly later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells these for a very reasonable price compared even with a place like SAMS, so if you like this deodorant, stock up and save some money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The price was very affordable and I took advantage of a coupon that was offered making the price even more affordable!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> THIS GEL FORMULA \\&quot;IRRITATES MY SKIN\\&quot; I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL. I WAS HAPPY WITH THE GILLETTE INVISIBLE SOLID COOL WAVE FORMULA AND FRAGRANCE BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY DID AWAY WITH IT, BAD MOVE GILLETTE</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and the dispenser doesn&#x27;t function...Gillette is an old brand name and should be well passed this simple problem...I resent being taken over a few bucks. I won&#x27;t use their products for a long time now.</li>
    <li> I got the 6 pack for $20, great deal.  I love the smell (not too strong, but nice and clean) and the price is better than at walmart/target.  The only thing I do not like about this is that it sometimes bleaches my clothes (at the armpit of course).  Usually these are clothes that are somewhat cheaply made, but still, a deodorant should not bleach the dye in your clothes!  Anyone else have this issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I downgraded this to two stars since I no longer even use this! The bleaching is not worth the nice feel and smell.  I can easily get a dry deodorant that smells just as good but maybe does not feel as &#x27;cool&#x27; as a gel one.</li>
    <li> As an anti-perspirant it works fine - BUT - it will bleach any fabric it contacts before it dries completely. Use sparingly and don&#x27;t put that shirt on too soon after applying.</li>
    <li> I have been using different kinds of deodorant for years since I was little. Ive used roll ons, wet, dry, you name it. Most of them didn&#x27;t work well and/or weren&#x27;t comfortable. This smells great and gets me through the day really well. I sweat a lot and tend to smell as I work outside all summer long in construction. This stuff really works and a little goes a long way and I mean little I just turn the bottom until I can see just 1/16th of an inch or so sticking out the top for each arm pit, this way still lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. If you want something that works and smells great look no further! I&#x27;ll never use a different deodorant again!</li>
    <li> This is my brand of deodorant and i have used gillette for as long as I can remember. Great Product and provides all the support I need. Great smell as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and used a lot of anti-perspirants/deodorants and this is the only one that actually lasts throughout the day. The cool wave scent I think is the best fragrance Gillette has developed. Good manly smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried solid deodorant, gel, and &amp;#34;solid gel&amp;#34; as well.  This brand of gel is the best out of everything I have tried.  It works very well, but the only thing is, it stains cloths white.  Obviously not permanently, but sometimes it dries white visible from the outside of the shirt, and it looks bad.  The only completely reliable solution I found to be positive this does not happen, is to not put on a shirt for half an hour, or put on my shirt very carefully about 45 minutes before I go anywhere. Thats all.  Works well, I like it.</li>
    <li> I used this as an &amp;#34;inbetween&amp;#34; deodorant. Going from mitchum to this wasnt a big jump but the problem with this is the twist dial. When you twist it, there sometimes is air pockets and when they finally fill the space the product sometimes shoots out of the holes. I know theres not much that can be done but it is a design flaw but it&#x27;s been the design of the applicator for a long time so maybe I&#x27;m just picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it&#x27;s an anti persperant and it smells good. I just found I liked other deodorants better. No fault of Gilette</li>
    <li> This product bought in bulk like this is a life saver, because it is expensive individually in the Brick and Mortar stores.</li>
    <li> The scent has changed and I do not care for it. I will be looking for a suitable replacement. I gave it two stars only because it is still effective. I can&#x27;t stand the new scent!</li>
    <li> Enjoy that I can buy products such as this in a bulk option. Love having products arrive on door step rather than going out and messing with the crowds.</li>
    <li> I perspire quite a bit and this Gillette works exceptionally well at keeping my sweat to a minimum.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that I will use...and I am a woman. I have used this for years and it&#x27;s perfect. Every time I have changed brands to try different men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s deodorant I am always disappointed and wind up going back to buying Gillette gel deodorant. So, yes, my husband and I use the same brand of deodorant. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and evenly. It never leaves a residue and it absorbs completely into the skin quite quickly. This is good because it doesn&#x27;t leave a stain on my clothes when I put them on after applying the deodorant. It also has a pleasant smell that I find to be refreshing and not overpowering. Some of the women&#x27;s deodorants that I have tried smell like rotten gardenias or other off smelling attempts at &#x27;flowery.&#x27;  The best thing about this deodorant is that it works all day and evening long. I never worry that it will stop working and leave me with a not fresh feeling. This is good because it means that I don&#x27;t have to lug deodorant in my purse and reapply during the day because it has stopped working. With Gillette I just feel secure knowing that it will keep working for me all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I would prefer to use a woman&#x27;s deodorant just because I sometimes feel weird as a woman using men&#x27;s deodorant. But after years of success with Gillette I have found that no other deodorant brand has come close to providing the coverage that Gillette does. So, I continue to use Gillette gel deodorant because it works so well and is so reliable. And therefore, when Gillette says that it&#x27;s the best a man can get, I strongly disagree....because it&#x27;s actually the best that a man and a WOMAN can get.</li>
    <li> Got enough deodorant for the year. Win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well and lasts all day. Not a strong scent at all. Very pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Cool Wave gel deodorant since it first came out. It had a nice clean, fresh smell without being overpowering. I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years just as a change but always kept with the Gillette Cool Wave. Sometime over the last year or so they must have changed their formula because now it smells different and to me, not in a pleasant way. It now has a subtle musk odor to it that tends to haunt me throughout the day when I&#x27;m wearing it. I bought others at different stores in case it was a bad batch but they all had the same smell. I tried the Gillette Power Rush gel just to compare and sure enough, it also has that same musk smell. I&#x27;m hoping Gillette will re-release the Classic Original Formula Cool Wave Gel Deocorant, but in the mean time I&#x27;ll have to switch brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Clear Gel for many years in many scents because is smells great all day long. Usually don&#x27;t even need any cologne with this. Bought it online because I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the store - isn&#x27;t living in the future great?!?</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant.  Its the only deodorant that doesnt break him out. With other deodorants he would get a red rash.</li>
    <li> This is my fav deodorant. It&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t leave a messy residue, it&#x27;s clear gel. It takes a few minutes to dry and then you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I find this deodorant cool in odour and very effective and long lasting ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;est évident pour utilise cette déodorant .&lt;br /&gt;Merci</li>
    <li> I discovered this anti-perspirant / deodorant on my first ever trip to America, and am actually still uncertain whether it&#x27;s available in Australia...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, and you actually get ALL the product out - to the very end, making it long lasting, and cost effective.</li>
