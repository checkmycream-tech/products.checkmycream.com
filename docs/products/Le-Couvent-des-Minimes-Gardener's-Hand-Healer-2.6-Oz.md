    <li> Love this product!  I have psoriasis on my hands and am constantly putting something on my hands to moisturize.  This is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> If you really want to take care of your hands (and feet) in cold, dry weather, this is the product for you. A little goes a long way, and it has a nice fragrance, not too strong, very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for years.  It does cure dry and cracked skin.  I highly Reccommend this for hands that get dry and irritated from repeated hand washing.</li>
    <li> Has some smell. Not like other hand creams. Arrived on time, in good condition and as advertised.</li>
    <li> best I&#x27;ve found for helping my dry skin</li>
    <li> very good.  I mean - very. excellent. it provides a nice feeling, and I am - umm - a man.  when the hands are chaffed (my job is prob 200 hand washings a day) &#x3D;  need for a really good hand massage especially at night when going to bed.  I have use this product on and off for the past three years and found it always to be redeeming and a good experience.  It smells nice.  My hands feel nice.  Especially haggling and retiring to sleep.  It&#x27;s a good end of the day treat.&lt;br /&gt;pros: protects the hands in the fingers, the cuticles, provides rehydration.  Therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it is expensive.  Worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: yes, I can recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this hand lotion years ago at a Bath &amp; Body Works and could never find it again.  Thank you Amazon!  I work in a greenhouse and my hands get dried out and cracked.  This lotion is awesome at soothing and healing!  So glad to have it again.</li>
    <li> This sample was a gift at the recent Accueil New York celebration; the Accueil is sort of a Welcome Wagon for French ex-pats assigned to foreign duty for French government and business families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the very best hand creams I&#x27;ve ever used. A light rosemary and lemon aroma, but as a committed DIYer, in the garden and everywhere else, my hands get a beating. It seems to absorb completely in five minutes or less, and never feels greasy or leaves a film after that period of time. Also, it seems like it be too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, as one reviewer feared, but neither she, my closest friend nor I find it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so good that it is worth buying three at a time; Amazon Prime will then pay shipping. At the smaller size (0.8 ounces), shipping adds almost $6.00 to the price. See [[ASIN:B00A8O9D7Y Le Couvent des Minimes - Gardener&#x27;s Hand Healer (0.8 oz.) ]] and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go big; it lasts a long time and will keep a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;May 2015</li>
    <li> This heals hands from the first application. My husband works in a library and books are hard on your hands -- the dust or something really takes a toll.  He loves this stuff and uses it every day, especially in the winter.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> My hubby isn&#x27;t big on moisturizer, but sometimes his hands get a little cracked and this stuff works really well to heal him up.  Smells nice and fresh too, and not girly.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of work with my hands in water and this cream softens my hand and keeps the skin by my nails from splitting in the dry weather.  I can&#x27;t buy this at a local store anymore so I bought it online and it is the same product that I would by in person. A little bit of the cream goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I live in Montreal Quebec and don&#x27;t understand why this does not ship here.  I ordered through a friend in&lt;br /&gt;the USA.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this company&#x27;s products. I love everything I have tried. This cream is thick and rubs in easily like it melts into the skin. It feels wonderful on chapped tired hands after a day working outside or even in the winter when hands can get really chapped. It has a great light scent that is refreshing. I always keep it around for when my hands feel really beat up.</li>
    <li> The lotion is amazing.  I had received a sample of it a while ago and loved it. Therefore when I found it on Amazon I had to order it.  I love the way it makes my hands so soft, and it smells wonderful.  The downside is that it&#x27;s hard to find and it&#x27;s quite expensive.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion EVAR!!</li>
    <li> smells great and works nicely.</li>
    <li> Great item ,fast delivery just very expensive it was a special request for a good friend and I didn&#x27;t want to disappoint .needs to be more bang for the buck .</li>

    <li> I received some samples of this hand cream and liked it so much I bought a tube. Nice fragrance and does wonders for your hands. I use it day and before bed.</li>
    <li> Yes, from a self proclaimed hand lotion/cream expert, this is good stuff!  I use Crabtree and Evelyn gardeners,  keihls hand salve and heavy duty hand cream. This is among the best!</li>
    <li> I did not get this cream that I ordered. I received a cologne instead.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> ...and it is the BEST handcream I&#x27;ve ever used and I have used a lot of different creams! But this one does not leave my hands feeling greasy. It soaks right in. It&#x27;s nice and thick and creamy with my favorite lemon smell. I just put some on a minute ago...I do garden, but I find it works best at my work desk. I go to the ladies room at least 6 times during an 8-hour day and wash my hands even more than the 6 times so I put this cream on every time I get back to my desk and I&#x27;ve washed my hands. Really a nice cream...must be the Shea butter.</li>
