<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for a birthday present for my dad, it came quickly and looks to be good quality as PS usually is, we will find out for sure Friday when it gets opened</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 10 years. I was surprised to purchase this product for less than half the price I normally pay.</li>
    <li> light and powdery aroma makes them want to know just what you are wearing because it smells so darn good....keep it a secret!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, this shipment met my expectations.</li>
    <li> The product arrived exactly as advertised and very quickly.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my shopping experience with the seller!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Paul Sebastian I have purchased from Amazon.  At the end of the day, I can still smell it on me.  It sort of has like an Old Spice smell to it.  This is the best way I can describe it.  Smell it at a local store before you buy it on here is my best recommendation.</li>
    <li> Great! Ladies love it.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;he loves it.</li>
    <li> So I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite simple, this is a great Cologne. It smells crisp and clean and stays with you throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find PS by Paul Sebastian on Amazon.  This is the favorite fragrance of the men in my family but is so very hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This product was just perfect. It arrived on time and was exactly as advertised with a price you just can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> The bottle did not say that this was cologne.  Scent was weaker than past purchases of this product I have made.</li>
    <li> When I received the cologne the cap was broken and the cologne leaked thru the packaging. The cologne smell is way to strong. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like what the description was telling me. It has a very strong alcohol smell.  The package doesn&#x27;t look right either.  I think it is a fake or water down product.</li>
    <li> Quick ship great price very pleased</li>
    <li> Perfect Christmas gift for my son. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Dad. His favorite. Loves it. Delivered on time. All good.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful men&#x27;s cologne which is very hard to find, as it seems as if all of the department stores no longer carry it, and on occasion a drug store like CVS might carry it.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, and always have ladies complimenting me on this, after they ask what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> great scent, good price</li>
    <li> The cologne is a nice, manly scent.  Not too strong of a smell.  You can wear it in the daytime and in the evening.  People will compliment you when you wear this.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Paul Sebastian For Men.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it smells awesome.  It&#x27;s not overpowering like some colognes.  I will definitely keep a stock of this to keep my honey smelling good.</li>
    <li> Its a great fragrance so I bought this as a gift for my father. It came it a great package with no damage to the product and I received it in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and it is the sent he likes.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift without being able to test this personally, plus it was not for me. Other customers had rated this 5 stars and I looked at more expensive colognes with lower ratings. My brother loved it! He had friends who complimented him on the fragrance. He said it was very masculine and could wear it either at the office or at a night out. I would purchase this for him again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking it was Paul Sebastian. After trying it,  it was obvious that the only thing Paul about it was the mailman who delivered it. It smells like rubbing alcohol. Can you say RIPOFF!!!</li>
    <li> Comparable to Lauder Pleasures for men&lt;br /&gt;Quality was as good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Evening wear produces many compliments&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase more when these run out</li>
    <li> BACK TO MEN SMELLING LIKE MEN SO GOOD FOR HUBBY</li>
    <li> Simply, the only one I have ever liked an used.</li>
    <li> On a scale from 1-10 I consider this one an 11!  This cologne is hard to find and the price offered by Amazon is outstanding.  This fragrance is not overpowering or offensive. The sweet aroma is quite pleasing.  I have used Paul Sebastian for many years and I have enjoyed every minute of it.  Try it,you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> My Dad said it seemed strong.  Better than the discount stores.</li>
    <li> Any cologne that can elicit comments from nearby women is an excellent one!  I have used this for about 10 years now and it seems to do the job!</li>
    <li> I expected.  Great product!  I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for many years and enjoy this subtle and pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> the product was rancid and long past it&#x27;s prime.  Having 25 years fragrance industry experience , I&#x27;m certain the product I received was most likely counterfeit</li>
    <li> Nothing better for the money.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s work cologne.  A little goes a long way.  Nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> I love it...but the price went up 3 bucks  in less than a year ago.....</li>
    <li> Great smell from the past really great</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product they are charging $60. and more at department stores.  It&#x27;s the only kind my husband will wear and it never goes on sale, plus I already have three tote bags that are the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Been wearing this since the 80&#x27;s, the smell was off as was the packaging.  Returned it</li>
    <li> I do not use any other cologne.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years nice balanced scent,matures nicely,item arrived quickly,good price</li>
    <li> I remember when my dad used to wear this cologne when I was younger and I thought it smelled awful and very offensive.  Like when he used to hug and kiss me the frangrance would be on my skin and I hated it.  This cologne just smells bad.  It is definately very masculine and strong but it isn&#x27;t that pleasant.  It definately smells like something an older man might wear.  (Maybe someone in their 70s and beyond.  I can&#x27;t believe my dad still wears this ugh.</li>
    <li> love this and girls love it to.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my father. This is the right type of scent if you are going to give it to an older man; father, uncle, grandfather, etc. What I like about it is, the scent lingers. I can smell it on my father&#x27;s suit and a few of his shirts when I hugged him or if he walks by.  Nice cologne for the pricing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and my wife loves it.  The one i received is not at all the same as previous bottles.  I was still finishing my previously bottle, so by the time I started using this one it was too late to return.  Too bad because now I&#x27;m reluctant to order this cologne online again.</li>
    <li> Great buy, has been husbands favorite for a long time. Shipping time was fast.</li>
    <li> I receive a lot of compliments from Paul Sebastian</li>
    <li> Subtle manly scent. Many compliments from men and women.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my father and he always gets complements on it</li>
    <li> Great fragrance I have been wearing for years.  Unbelievable price.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this for years.  It&#x27;s still my favorite &amp; makes me melt!!  ;-)</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product is nice. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very nice-delivery took a while</li>
    <li> Once you&#x27;ve tried this product you will fall in love with it. My wife loves it on me and I enjoyed applying it.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this cologne.  This is all he has been wearing for over 18 years.</li>
    <li> It works for me and everyone tells me how nice i smell. They say it not too strong. it is just nice.</li>
    <li> An old sent that was my favorite years ago</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive cologne that smells very expensive.  I get positive comments when I wear it in public.</li>

    <li> Great buy, women love this smell.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it and I love him when he smell sooooooo good!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE RECEIVED  AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR PAUL SEBASTISN.  TO ME IT IS A FANTAQSTIC  SCENT.  IT SEEMS TO INVARIABLY  INVITE  QUESTIONS FROM THE LADIES AS TO &amp;#34;WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?&amp;#34;  I TELL THEM &amp;#34;BRIEFS AND A T SHIRT.&amp;#34; THEN I REALIZE THEY  MEAN THE LOTION. I PROUDLY TELL THEM IT&#x27;S &#x27;PAUL SEBASTIAN&#x27;  THEY THEN RESPOND &amp;#34;RAUL  WHO? &amp;#34; TO WHICH I REPLY, &amp;#34;PAUL, PAUL!&amp;#34;.  THEY THEN , BrEATHING HEaVILY GASP, &amp;#34;PAUL, RAUL, SAUL. WHO CARES, YOU FOOL JUST KISS ME!!&amp;#34;  BEING A GENTLEMAN, I ACOMMODATE THEM.  ..THANK YOU, PAUL.</li>

    <li> Bought it and nobody liked it, including myself. Very strong and outdated smell. Perhaps if youve used it before you maybe like it, but if youre looking for a head-turning cologne this isnt the right one for you.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Paul Sebastian for years, nice fresh clean smell, great price, It cost double the money at&lt;br /&gt;a mall shop.  Linda from Boston</li>
    <li> I love it so do the girls</li>
    <li> Great Product! Promptly shipped!</li>
    <li> ordered Monday morning at about 1 AM others would say Sunday night. but got it Thursday morning, so shipping was great. i have like thirty bottles of cologne. but this being by far the cheapest, smells great and after a week i wash my clothes and can still smell it. not strong smelling but strong enough to stay around.</li>
    <li> I got this cologne for my dad as one of his birthday gifts. As a guy, I know you can never have enough cologne. I had never smelled this cologne, but the reviews were all pretty good and the price for the size of the bottle seemed very reasonable, so I took a shot. When we opened the cologne to smell it, I was a bit indifferent. At first, it has sort of a funky smell to it, but after a bit of settling into your skin/clothes, the smell seems to get better. I feel I have a pretty good taste in cologne seeing as I have a ton of different brands myself, but can&#x27;t say I would purchase this for myself or anyone else again. However, I wouldn&#x27;t classify this cologne as terrible, just nothing special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, the price was great and it was delivered promptly. That said, Cologne is very subjective and what appeals to me may not to someone else so it&#x27;s kind of up to you whether to purchase it or not.</li>
    <li> I have been using PS for many years and only purchased at department stores. Never again! This is the REAL DEAL, absolutely no difference in quality and a whole lot of savings. Thanks. I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered PS every year for my hubby. Love this on him...and he loves it too. NEVER have had a problem with Amazon order.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience each time. Go for it!! :)</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this product. This is a great gift giver. We would recommend this to everyone. Also the delivery was great.</li>
    <li> My lady really loves this fragrance!!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best cologne sprays I have ever found. It is a true like by the ladies and the guys want to no what it is to.</li>
    <li> makes me smell soon good</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love the way he smells wearing this cologne.  He has been using this for years now and I still love it!</li>
    <li> this is a clean and refreshing smell that I have been using for years -a long and after effect smell that&#x27;s clean yet masucline</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite colonge and my daughter bought it for him for Christmas.</li>
    <li> my husband is in love with this cologne, as am I. the cost is sooo good caompared to $65.00 in the malls.</li>
    <li> I have used this aftershave for several years and was glad to find  it at such a good price.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This was bought at an awesome price. It is a very popular cologne for men and I was very happy!</li>
    <li> Love it! Started using this when I was in my mid to late twenties, I&#x27;m 51  now so and in 30 yrs the complements keep on coming. For me there is no other. PS is my life sentence.</li>
    <li> Im not going to lie. I spent 26 dollars on this cologne and it personally just sucks. Alot of these reviews state how this is great for women and how its not to overpowering. That is not true at all. This cologne i reccomend for like age 57 and above. Below that it just makes you smell alot older and even 1 spray stayes on for 8, 9 hours. Its extremely strong. I do not reccomend this cologne. Please dont make the same mistake i did. Hope this was useful to you, if you dont believe me, then buy it and waste your money your self. The bottle and box are nice ill give them that but do not let the appearance make you think this will smell good. This is the worst. I cannot stress this enough. Its overbearing, one spray lasts for like 9 hours and most people think thats good but no! It has a discusting smell. the worst part is............. once you spray it it does not. i repeat. does not come off. Terrible Terrible Terrible !! People will wanna smell younger. this makes you smell older</li>
    <li> my favorite cologne at a decent price</li>
    <li> It has my vote. It is in my line-up. Grown Folks stuff !!!</li>
    <li> Another that I use to wear years ago-----very refreshing---will take notice</li>
    <li> My favorite!  Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Had the thought that it might be a little better than it is</li>
    <li> This is not the real Paul Sebastian - that was advertised. It is fake. It smells like cheap old ladies perfume - it is nauseating. This is counterfeit. Do not purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting this cologne for over twenty years - first time I have purchased from Amazon - I cannot even use it.</li>
    <li> IT WAS JUST WHAT WE WANTED.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to receive my cologne order so quickly in with such great packaging.  So pleased with this ordering experience and it makes my Christmas shopping easier!</li>
    <li> This came in a timely fashion and was just what I expected. My husband was excited to get it! I really like this cologne.</li>
    <li> smells good but strong.  I would buy the after shave if I had to do it all over again.</li>
    <li> I have been using PS by Paul Sebastian for years and it is getting harder to find all the time so I decided to go on line to buy it and what a disappointment. I do not know what was in the bottle but it sure was not PS. First of all let me say the bottle did not look the same, some of the writing on the front was not there and the cap had a tinny feel to it, just plain cheep. I figured the were just cutting cost on the packaging until I used the Cologne and let me tell you it was not PS. I don&#x27;t know what they put in the bottle but it was fruity and light and had no resemblance to PS. There was none of that deep musk smell that I am used to and all fragrance just dissipated after a while. It did leave a hint of the deep rich fragrance on my clothing but nothing like I am accustomed to. To Amazon&#x27;s credit they did credit me for my purchace but I am not at all satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing PS for decades.  This bottle I bought from Amazon is horrible.  It smells similar, but requires you to use 5 times more and does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous version of PS would continue give off fragrance long after I sprayed.  As a matter of fact, my clothes would continue to smell of the cologne days after I wore the shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff I just bought doesn&#x27;t last a few hours into my work schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON AS YOU CANNOT RETURN IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle from Wal-Mart, of all places, and it&#x27;s the stuff I&#x27;ve been buying for years.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but the real deal.</li>
    <li> attracts the women, but you need to know how to make use of the attraction!!</li>
    <li> This product  is fake  . When I spray it on me the scent  didn&#x27;t last on me the smell different. Then the real deal</li>
    <li> I normally wear Jovan Musk for men.  This is a nice alternative with similar sweet yet clean/crisp qualities.</li>
    <li> This is such an intriguing scent--very masculine--makes you want to get close!  Too bad it is so hard to find these days.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite fragrance on  my husband, and I was glad to be able to get it at a good price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nobody knows this cologne but me.  A female friend of mine recommended it a long time ago.  It&#x27;s the only cologne that I wear and I wear it everyday.  I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> A favorite that keeps on giving.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and wear it every day ... a little bit goes a long way!  I&#x27;ve received plenty of compliments on how good it smells!</li>
    <li> Great cologne, glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> I do not think this was new.  It wasn&#x27;t in a sealed container so it made me a bit cautious/nervous about using it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, It&#x27;s water. I&#x27;ve been using PS for at least 20 years. I only bought this stuff out of curiosity, I normally pay anywhere from 35 to 65 bucks for PS at the Mall or at FragranceX online depending on the packaging for a lot less which competes with amazon&#x27;s pricing, however it&#x27;s the real stuff. How do I know that? I&#x27;m glad you asked. If you look closely at the bottom-most small black lettering on the face of the &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; on this web site, the lettering states &amp;#34;Fine Cologne&amp;#34; which it should on the genuine product bottle, not only that, the black lettering on the genuine product bottle has raised etched-print lettering. That said, I&#x27;ll bet all the 5 Star ratings of the this product received a fake product without any black-etched lettering on the bottle that states &amp;#34; Fine Cologne&amp;#34; at all, just as well as I did. Which without a doubt indicates a fake knockoff, not alone the faint scent that barely resembles the real product. BTW, the genuine PS cologne retains for hours and the scent is best only with certain body chemistries. It&#x27;s really not for every man. This stuff on amazon does not work at all. It&#x27;s a cheap water/alcohol downed knockoff. I&#x27;m really surprised amazon is selling this junk. Trust me, It&#x27;s Junk. However, it&#x27;s a liquid and it&#x27;s OK if you want a two second after shower/shave splash!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used in the past and thought I would try it again.  It has a subtle, gentle scent and pleasing.</li>
