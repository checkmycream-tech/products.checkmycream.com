<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Strivectin products really do work on tightening skin all over.  I have used it on my face for years and swear by it.</li>
    <li> I did use this religiously per the instructions. No effect whatever. Don&#x27;t bother. As they say, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li> Did not get any expected results like advertised,it smells good and is easy to apply but no results so far.</li>
    <li> a good product and for an old lady, my skin looks pretty good...will continue to use product,a good buy. lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Way over priced and did not do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  The claim was that it was a wonderful tightening cream.  I did not find that to be the case.</li>
    <li> Title sort of gives my review away but here are a few details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the kit because I&#x27;m annoyed greatly by loose neck skin. I figured I may as well try the wider use kit to see if any of the three items did anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there is anything unusual about my neck but my face has some deep wrinkles. I lived aboard small boats for over 7 years. In that time, I never, and I mean never, used either sunblock or moisturizer or other treatments so you can imagine the results. I have some very deep wrinkles around the delicate eye area. One wrinkle is much worse because I had the bad or good luck to crash my bicycle breaking my eyeglasses in just such a way that one shard dug into my face all the way to the bone but right on the line of a previous wrinkle. So I have one super wrinkle in addition to the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really gave me a good deal of razzing when the kit arrived but I decided to weather her ridicule and give it a go anyway. She can razz. She doesn&#x27;t need this stuff at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are clear. There are three parts to the kit: &#x27;instant&#x27; wrinkle fixer, 8 week wrinkle fixer and 8 week neck cream. I first figured to allow 8 weeks to evaluate the kit but to my surprise after 4 weeks my wife, one morning, looked at me and said, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe it but that stuff is really working.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And working it is. There is a definite improvement in all areas I&#x27;ve used this stuff.  OK, I do not look 14 again nor is all the sun and salt damage gone, but the improvement here at 6 weeks is easily visible. I even feel better not having the start of a wattle on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this, let me give some advice you can take or leave. The instructions say two things I think are important. First, use on a washed area only. Do not put on over makeup or on oily skin. Wash. Also give it a full 8 week trial. I expected results from the instant stuff to be instant but it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d rate the 8 week elements as an easy 5 star but the instant didn&#x27;t seem to do much or maybe it&#x27;s working in conjunction with the 8 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this five stars because I didn&#x27;t expect any results from my impulse buy yet I&#x27;m pretty tickled at my new look.or maybe it&#x27;s working in conjunction with the 8 week.   I give this five stars because I didn&#x27;t expect any results from my impulse buy yet I&#x27;m pretty tickled at my new look.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using this for 10 years, I think it is great. I you could see me face you could be the judge of that.</li>
    <li> Being an older woman with mature skin, I have tried several skin care products........this is the only one I have reordered.  My skin appears brighter, firmer and with less visible lines.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Strivectin Tightening Kit and have used it for about 1 month. I am not seeing results, so far. I&#x27;m gonna give it a fighting chance, as the ad says 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love the products. Especially when applied at night, I can see and feel a difference in the morning. Probably a good idea to sleep on your back. I wouldn&#x27;t say they \\&quot;tighten\\&quot; my skin, but make my skin look and feel soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ll be using these products for many, many years. Also, why would anyone pay retail prices in dept stores! I love a bargain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve broken out in little bumps all over my jaw and chin. I am 40 years old and have never had this happen before. Also skin is dull nad red. Def will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love the neck tightening cream but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle it.  I didn&#x27;t seem to break out until I started perspiring and then my neck broke out in itchy red bumps.  I have photo dermatitis and the break outs usually happen when I wear sunblock or certain chemicals on my skin and then get exposed to sun/heat.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other two products, as I am afraid of having the same problem on my face.  Oh well, back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> This came before the date given . I gave this as a gift and they later told me it was nice</li>
    <li> I actually tried the sample pack with all three products. It included the stretch mark cream, neck cream and face cream. I purchased it for the neck cream. I used it twice a day for a little over a month and a half and did not see enough of a change to buy it again. If there was change, it was minimal and I cannot see it in my before and after pictures. I did get a few pimples but, I expected that with the heavy cream. I could live with that. The stretch mark cream did not work either but I really did not expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to my Neutrogena products and try something they have for the neck. I have used their makeup for about 15 years now and I am 51 and most people think I am 40. It is the only thing I used on my face until recently purchasing the Rapid Wrinkle Repair for around my eyes. i will just start using it on my neck and face too.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Soaks right in.  Haven&#x27;t used all these products long enough to truly say they work.  Have used the SD eye cream and it does seem to work well.  Hope these other ones do as well.</li>
    <li> The verdit is still out on this product. I have been using all of them for over a month but I see no improvement so far. I will not purchase it again unless I see some improvement.</li>
    <li> Just started to use the product...so far so good.  Wrinkles are suppose to go away...only time will tell.  I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom.  She loved it.  I hope it works for you.  She hasn&#x27;t said anything about the products since.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and feel of strivectin, but it broke my face out into small pimples.  They were gone within two days but ...I am 49.  Too old for small pimples.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me but I received it packaged well and on time.  So, I give it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, today is the 4th of February and I kept using it because the small pimples vanished and never came back - so, it could&#x27;ve been hormonal AND I didn&#x27;t want to waste the money.  I AM SO GLAD I CONTINUED.  I am 49 as I stated, and wrinkles (believe it or not) are NOT my problem - acne scars are.  But I began noticing a difference in the tightness of my skin which made the scars seem diminished.  I never said anything to my friends though, until the other night when my friend asked me if I had had some chemical peels or something.  WOW!  Then I knew it wasn&#x27;t just me - my scars are \\&quot;flattening out\\&quot; so they don&#x27;t appear so horrid nor deep to me (and obviously to others).  If I could get my face just a little tighter - they&#x27;d be gone.  I will continue this product.  It&#x27;s fab! I changed the original three stars to five.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m 53 years old, take very good care of my skin, but have a number of fine lines. This kit really works. I follow the directions and use it twice a day. I CAN see a difference. I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, it definitely has a scent, but nothing to freak about. My face and neck looks much smoother and the fine lines have receded. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Three products to apply are a bit much and I don&#x27;t see much of a change.  I may go back to regular Strivectin.</li>
    <li> Hi, I bought the Strivectin kit hoping it would be as good as Retin-A for wrinkles, as its advertising promised miracles. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for women. I have been using this product for over 5 years with great results</li>
</ol>
