      <li>This product keeps pumping my curl to make it look like my curl is perfect everyday.  </li>
      <li>It was fabulous.</li>
      <li>PUMPING CURLS IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE IN STORES IN MY AREA.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for this product for quite some time and was happy to find finally.</li>
      <li>but it is NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>After washing my hair - which is very fine and now thinning, thanks to age</li>
      <li>Why in the world would they discontinue such a good product?</li>
      <li>Works very well is light yet with a couple of scruntches - viola curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair and use a suring iron or hot curlers.</li>
      <li>, it does not work right</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not smell right</li>
      <li>love this product, make my natural curls so much springier</li>
      <li>My hair looks great the second day and even the third day.  </li>
      <li>Pumping Curls gave me soft strong curls.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what is described... brings out the curl, controls the frizz.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and leaves my hair soft and never stiff.  </li>
      <li>I have a perm and am very picky on what i use in my hair.  </li>
      <li>So back to the drawing board to find an equally fantastic hair product for curls (wish me luck)</li>
      <li>Service was fast.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, IT IS A SCAM!!!</li>
      <li>I have not found any other product better the L&#x27;Oreal</li>

      <li>It is not sticky or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and leaves my hair natural looking.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and this product works.  </li>

      <li>Anyone who wants change from straight to curly - especially if your hair is fine or thin - should try this product.  </li>
      <li>Pumping Curls has just the right amount of stickiness without being too sticky like other stuff are.  </li>
      <li>that helps to boost my curls as well as keeping the frizz away with the high amount of constant humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just spray and comb it through then blow dry and spray my very damaging hair styling spray.</li>
      <li>I get compliments all the time, but people think it&#x27;s natural because it produces such a soft curl.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so sorry to say that L&#x27;Oreal will no longer be making this product - it has been discontinued, which seems to frequently be my luck when I find a product that I love.  </li>
      <li>When I roll, I spray a second time with Pumping Curls with the rollers in and let it dry naturally.  </li>

<li> I get maximum curl with just a few sprays in my damp hair after a shower, and although my hair is prone to frizz, when I use this stuff the frizz just doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
<li> Spray a small section of hair 2 times, roll curl between fingers, pin it.</li>
<li> I have used it for years and when it was discontinued, I was heart broken.  </li>
<li> Now the product is discontinued and it is a sad day for me.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Spray a small section of hair 2 times, roll curl between fingers, pin it. I remove pins in 30 mins and voila, perfect spiral curls. I can do my entire head in 20 mins, compared to a curling iron and the stiff curls they produce. Plus pin curls are far less damaging. I get compliments all the time, but people think it&#x27;s natural because it produces such a soft curl. Love this product. Curl lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This is THE best product for my fine curly hair.  I get maximum curl with just a few sprays in my damp hair after a shower, and although my hair is prone to frizz, when I use this stuff the frizz just doesn&#x27;t happen.  My hair looks great the second day and even the third day.  I just spray with water and scrunch to reactivate the Pumping Curls.  Depending on the weather, I sometimes add a bit more. Why in the world would they discontinue such a good product?</li>
    <li> This deserves nothing but the five stars I gave it.  After washing my hair - which is very fine and now thinning, thanks to age - I spray and then set.  I still use rollers to get a permmed look, but I also use it when I let it air dry and blow dry.  It gives my hair a shiny and healthy look.  If I roll, it gives it a permmed look.  (Note:  When I roll, I spray a second time with Pumping Curls with the rollers in and let it dry naturally.  I only leave my hair in rollers about 2-3 hours and then remove to sleep.  It still it looks permmed the next and the day after that.)  Anyone who wants change from straight to curly - especially if your hair is fine or thin - should try this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and nothing else on the market even comes close.</li>
    <li> great product.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
    <li> I am so saddened they stopped making this product. It was perfect for my hair. I was thrilled when I found this product on this site.  I don&#x27;t know what I am going to do when this product is completely gone.</li>
    <li> I have a perm and am very picky on what i use in my hair.  Pumping Curls has just the right amount of stickiness without being too sticky like other stuff are.  I wash my hair twice a week and on the mornings I don&#x27;t wash my hair, all I have to do is spray a little bit of water on my hair and then a little bit of Pumping Curls to refreshen my curls...then I am on my way!</li>
    <li> I used this Pumping Curls Spray years ago and was very happy to find it again. I have very fine hair and I also use other products with it, but this one saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;I hope Loreal will keep producing this.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product.  I have used it for years and when it was discontinued, I was heart broken.  I have long, thick hair and I had a perm about 5 years ago.  This product keeps pumping my curl to make it look like my curl is perfect everyday.  No bad hair days with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere else! It&#x27;s soo important for curly hair! The price was also fantastic! Thanks amazon!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic curling spray!  Many customers wish L&#x27;Oreal had not removed it from their product line, myself included.  It does exactly what is described... brings out the curl, controls the frizz.</li>
    <li> helps keep my curly hair under control.</li>
    <li> Have bought this product for years but can no longer find it on store shelves. Was glad to find a place where I can get it. Works very well is light yet with a couple of scruntches - viola curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  It is very good for natural curly hair.  Service was fast.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> not as good as it use to be, but will work holding your haih in place</li>
    <li> love this product, make my natural curls so much springier</li>
    <li> I do not know what is in the bottle but it is NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell right, it does not work right, it does not look right.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, IT IS A SCAM!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have natural curly hair and this product works.  I cannot find it in the stores by me anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for over 20 years that has been taken off the market.  I was just trying to find any product left out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and years. It protects my hair from the spray I use to style it. I just spray and comb it through then blow dry and spray my very damaging hair styling spray.</li>
    <li> This product it truly the best when you need to boost your curls it works on wet and dry hair...... I have not found any other product better the L&#x27;Oreal and I have tried just about everything their is on the market today</li>
    <li> I loved the product. I have straight fine hair and use a suring iron or hot curlers. I used this product when curing my dry hair. It was fabulous. I gave me curls that did not just flop.  They were bouncy and held up. Now the product is discontinued and it is a sad day for me. I have tried other products but they just do not compete with pumping curls. All others are sticky and leave hardened hair. Pumping Curls gave me soft strong curls.</li>
    <li> PUMPING CURLS IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE IN STORES IN MY AREA. I WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND IT ONLINE AND EVEN MORE DELIGHTED TO FIND OUT IT IS THE VERY SAME PRODUCT THAT I USED TO USE YEARS AGO.  GREAT, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I have used many hair products throughout my lifetime.  I have wavy hair and this product has been the best I have found (especially living in Florida) that helps to boost my curls as well as keeping the frizz away with the high amount of constant humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so sorry to say that L&#x27;Oreal will no longer be making this product - it has been discontinued, which seems to frequently be my luck when I find a product that I love.  So back to the drawing board to find an equally fantastic hair product for curls (wish me luck) that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and isn&#x27;t sticky when you spray it, when it dries or when it rains or drizzles and your hair gets damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will truly miss my Pumpin Curls!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and leaves my hair soft and never stiff.  I would recommend it to anyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the product, so this was the only way to purchase it.  My wife has never found another suitable substitute</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Way overpriced</li>
    <li> I used Pumping Curls until it was dicontinued. When I could no onger find it in the local stores, I spent a fortune on other products trying to find one that worked as well on my hair. I am so glad to be able to get it again. it works as well as I remembered. It is not sticky or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and leaves my hair natural looking. It defines my waves while taming the frizz. I am so glad I found this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product did anything to my hair.  Mousse works much better for me.  I will trash the rest.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product for quite some time and was happy to find finally. I have curly hair and this just helps to give my curls and more springy look to them. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I have natural wave to my hair and this product just perks it to smashing!! I wish it was still available in the store!!</li>
