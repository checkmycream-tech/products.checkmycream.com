      <li>This product arrived very quickly, which I was impressed with.  </li>
      <li>This is a good sampler.  </li>
      <li>Good way to get a variety of  blades.</li>

      <li>Good to make an opinion about what blades work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with Gillete 8&#x27;oclock and Feather.</li>
      <li>good variety and good price thank you</li>
      <li>A couple others were good, but I can&#x27;t remember which.  </li>
      <li>It is good blend to start from</li>
      <li>(there are some good ones in the pack) and what you prefer in a blade.</li>
      <li>Good mix of blades to try, plenty of each</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite through my multi-pack yet, but I am learning which brands are good, which brands I want to continue using, and which brands I should just avoid if I can.</li>
      <li>Good buy for the price and variety.</li>
      <li>The blades are good</li>
      <li>Who thinks this is a good idea?)</li>
      <li>There is a lot of variety, and having two of each is good because there is variability between shaves.  </li>
      <li>This variety pack includes some good companies, along with some not-so-impressive ones.    </li>
      <li>GOOD:</li>
      <li>I use a blade for a week, so those sample blades will supply me for a good while.  </li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>A good set of blades to try.</li>
      <li>Good selection.</li>
      <li>All razors delivered were in good condition</li>
      <li>Shark was just as good and Feather acceptable.</li>
      <li>Good sampler pack.</li>
      <li>Good for beginners.</li>
      <li>Great set, excellent variety of brands/models, many of which you can easily replenish from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love being able to have options and it gives me the ability to pick and choose which I like best.</li>
      <li>Great way to find a favorite blade.</li>
      <li>However I have found that so many of them are great that buying another set of samples may be the way to go.</li>
      <li>The hardest thing about shaving with a safety razor is finding the right blade for your skin, but once you do it is the best shave you can get.</li>
      <li>My original thought was to find the ideal blade and just buy 1000 &#x27;s of that type.  </li>
      <li>DE shaving will save you a ton of money and give you better shaves!</li>
      <li>Love the Astras!</li>
      <li>I found the best for me and will order more of the specific blades that work best</li>
      <li>but most you won&#x27;t even be able to find for sale, so one would be best off going with a strong, popular brand that sells in bulk here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really liked some of the blades but will just adapt to the one I am using.</li>
      <li>however I found some that I really liked</li>
      <li>A nice selection of blades to determine what brand works for you</li>
      <li>I tried each kind of blade and classified them in a simpleminded three-bin system:</li>
      <li>But this is a nice selection</li>
      <li>(A-F)on that wrapper, indicating how well I liked that blade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has dulled nicely and never gave that toothy \\&quot;razor</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep track of which blades I liked, and which I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, many of the brands you might recognize are not as good as some that you have never heard of before.</li>
      <li>although not quite so nice as the Feather.  </li>
      <li>Buy this before buying a 50 or 100 pack of any particular blade so that you can choose the best one for your face.</li>
      <li>It is very wise to experiment first before buying in bulk.</li>
      <li>Very good variety and shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Feather is nice, but my skin prefers bluebird most.</li>
      <li>But it gets you a good overview of what&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>This selection covers all of the major brands and lets you try what&#x27;s out there to figure out what blades work best for your face.  </li>
      <li>so I am happy I got this sample pack first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got all 50 not much more to say.</li>
    <li> Nice variety!!!  So many blades, this is the way to go if you are new to safety razors, each one cuts so differently on my coarse beard.</li>
    <li> My husband is still going through the blades and we are making a list of the ones he really likes.  He likes his close shave.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve made it up to the Bluebirds.  They are the only blades so far that I don&#x27;t care for.  All of the others so far have produced a very close, smooth and comfortable shave.  I actually developed a small chart to record: closeness, comfort, sharpness and number of comfortable uses.  The only problem is that I&#x27;ve switched up the razor I was using them with so I have to make sure to try the ones that don&#x27;t work as well with the other razors to see how they work with them.  Love the Astras!</li>
    <li> This kit is fantastic because it allows you to try many different razor brands if you are new to DE Safety razors, like myself. I definitely recommend this kit over others which have a limited variety.</li>
    <li> I received 50 blades, but they weren&#x27;t all as described.  Whoever is packing these things needs to pay better attention to what they&#x27;re doing.  It would also be helpful if they could label the ones that aren&#x27;t clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were 4 Gillette Nacet Stainless and no Platinum (should have been two of each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 8 Lord blades as I should have, however 4 of them were Super Chrome; 2 of them had (different) green labels, but there was no description on them so I don&#x27;t know what they are.  There were 2 more Lord blades but I have no idea what they are because there was no description on either of them--one had light blue lettering and the other had a slightly darker blue print (for all I know they are the same and the printing press was just using a different dye lot for the printing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 4 Shark blades but they were all the same and none had descriptions so I don&#x27;t know what they are (stainless or chrome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received only two Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock instead of four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was in order and the blades were clearly marked by the manufacturer with the correct names.  The blades came all in one plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this selection of blades highly enough! My husband decided to start shaving with a safety razor and wanted to try out different blades before settling on the one he liked. This assortment was the perfect way for him to do just that. Seven months later, and he still hasn&#x27;t used all of the blades. Definitely a great value!</li>
    <li> Wow, that&#x27;s a lot of blades; random numbers, but all sorts to try out. Already found some I prefer over what I started with, but I&#x27;ve still barely made a dent in this pack.</li>
    <li> Two blades per make is an excellent amount.  You can determine which work without finding yourself stuck with a lot of extra blades that don&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Buying and using a Razor Blade Sampler is the only way to fly! I should have heeded the advice I&#x27;m giving out today a long time ago. I was able to discover some fine blades (Lord, etc.) by buying a sampler that I would likely never have found otherwise. Now, I buy on amazon only the blades that work well for me. Saved me money and time - no-brainer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to Safety Razor shaving (about 6 months). Sample packs are the only way to go to find the perfect blade for your face. Please do not believe that all razors are the same. I&#x27;ve used dozens of different brands and have found a few that work great for my sensitive face while others have been terrible. Surprisingly some of the more expensive ones have been the worst. Sample packs give you a wide assortment to try before buying a large supply. It is very wise to experiment first before buying in bulk. Unfortunately for me I made the mistake of buying some more well known brands in bulk without knowing they did not agree with my face. I highly recommend you try a sample pack for yourself.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, this is a very nice sampler pack assortment. It has most of the highly regarded and, just as important, widely available blades. And, getting 2 of each means you won&#x27;t have whole packs of the blades you don&#x27;t like going to waste. But this is a nice selection so you won&#x27;t find too many blades that don&#x27;t work for you. Once you find your favorite, Wish4star will have it in larger quantities at a good price. If you have never tried DE shaving, buy this assortment and a Weishi razor as a starter from Wish4star. DE shaving will save you a ton of money and give you better shaves!</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly, which I was impressed with.  The packaging was very economical and easy to store; there wasn&#x27;t much extra plastic to throw away.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just bought a Merkur razor not too long ago, and I read a suggestion about trying multiple razors. This is a great way to do it. It definitely beats buying a 100 razors of one type, only to find out you don&#x27;t like them. I&#x27;ve only tried a few at this point, but I have to admit, some work better for me than others. My favorite thus far are the Shark blades. I had done a little research though before I actually received these, so I kind of knew which razors I wanted to start with. I&#x27;m going for Feather&#x27;s next, but I wanted to try a few others before I stepped up to the \\&quot;big leagues\\&quot; so to speak with something that sharp. Truth is, you probably don&#x27;t need to try 22 different blades. There are some in this set that I don&#x27;t really care to try, and probably won&#x27;t. I guess the only thing I may have done differently in retrospect was purchased a set with fewer options as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll take 22 to get what I need. Of course, maybe number 22 will be just the right fit for you. It&#x27;s cheap enough though, and one of the more thorough sets I found, so I don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong. Worst case, you throw out a few blades. Not a big deal IMO. One last thought... 2 blades seems to be plenty to find out if they work for me.</li>
    <li> Good to make an opinion about what blades work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with Gillete 8&#x27;oclock and Feather. The rest were interesting to try but not for me.</li>
    <li> thanks this is a great sample pack for me to try some out I appreciate it great seller and product</li>
    <li> looks incredible posted as a collection in my bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> Package came in today. I am new to safety razor shaving and the one I bought only came with one blade. I found myself in need of more blades quickly, but I have heard by many that the most prudent thing to do is check out all types to see what is a good fit. So I found this item. All different types and from all over the place. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all out. Good buy for the price and variety.</li>
    <li> Ordered on a Sunday, I got them the following Saturday, the day I&#x27;m writing this.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer stated he didn&#x27;t get 50 blades, so I counted mine. I recommend you do so, too. I got 49, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is a counting error on my part.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna get my DE(double edge) Razor till about Wednesday. I&#x27;m actually getting a few older Gillette models.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;As I began to write this, I realized that this is the oddest review I&#x27;ve ever written. If I don&#x27;t like some of the blades, am I gonna get up here and downgrade my review? Probably not, because the whole purpose of a sampler pack is... pretty obvious.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;So, unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve missed, I almost certainly won&#x27;t change my rating over time. Of course, its possible, just very unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;There are other shaving sites you can order sampler sets from, along with the well known auction site. I can&#x27;t really think of a reason why one source would be better than any other. With this item, you get to try 24 brands, that seems pretty diverse to me.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;These come to you in a bunch of tiny re-sealable ziplock baggies, all tucked into a bigger baggie, which you can open, but won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t reseal. I could put it all into a slightly bigger baggie, just so at some point, I don&#x27;t grab the bag, and the little baggies come tumbling out. Or maybe seal up the outer bag with a rubber band or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor blades are nasty sharp objects, which can hurt people, mini-people, and pets. Can&#x27;t be too careful.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna keep a notebook sized piece of paper in with these blades. I&#x27;ll keep track of which blades I liked, and which I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I could save the little blade wrappers, then, with a marker, put a \\&quot;grade\\&quot; (A-F)on that wrapper, indicating how well I liked that blade.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This is all new to me. I&#x27;ve read that a blade that works poorly in one razor, might be just right for another model. So, that&#x27;s something to keep in mind, if, like me, you decided to get several old Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;-&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: If you wanna know who makes new DE Razors, its Merkur, Jagger and Feather, all available on this site. I chose to go with several models of older Gillettes, which are no longer made. But you have these other options as well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to the world of DE Shaving or just looking for a change of pace this is a great pack.  This pack would be worth 5 stars if there were some feathers included, but there are some really quality blades in here with a nice variety.</li>
    <li> A year&#x27;s worth of razors that will shame those cruddy blades the local grocer tries to pawn off on the unsuspecting.  You may be asking yourself, &amp;#34;just how different can any one razor be from any other?&amp;#34;  The answer is ALL THE DIFFERENCE.  Seriously.  If you&#x27;ve only used plain jane Gillette or whatever knockoff you can find, there is a whole new world out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, shaving still sucks.  But a decent blade makes it suck just a bit less.  And that&#x27;s all you need to get through the morning routine sometimes.</li>
    <li> All of the pakistani blades in the kit are garbage. They tug and pull.&lt;br /&gt;The indian blades are acceptable and there is a pleasant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will soon come to realize the feather blades are the best in the pack,&lt;br /&gt;but for some people they are unusable on an uneven face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for a smaller pack, this bundle is chock full of junk you won&#x27;t miss and&lt;br /&gt;like me will just throw away.</li>
    <li> A good set of blades to try. Of course not all blades will be good for you, a lot of that is personal. But it gets you a good overview of what&#x27;s available. Good for someone just starting out with a safety razor. Definitely also try Merkur blades. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This was on my son&#x27;s Christmas list. He wanted to find the one he liked best before investing in a singlebrand.  He loves the razor that we purchased with the blades.</li>
    <li> Definitely suggest getting a variety pack of blades to find the one you like most. I have found some blades work great for up to 6 weeks and others only a week. Next time I need more I will get the specific ones that I like.</li>
    <li> I love being able to have options and it gives me the ability to pick and choose which I like best. I love my double-edged razor.</li>
    <li> I am new to double edge razors, and I thought this would be a great way to figure out what brand of blade I prefer.  It has worked well so far, I have already found a couple I like.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to the ds razor experience I figured a sample pack would benefit me. All razors delivered were in good condition and I had fun comparing the performance of each type. Good for beginners.</li>
    <li> Great Blade Sampler! Contains at least two of each popular blade brand! Can&#x27;t wait to try them all! Highly recommended to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried different blades.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy into this &amp;#34;different blades for different faces&amp;#34; nonsense - there are within this pack good blades, and flawed blades... From what I have gathered so far (and I have not tried all of them), the good blades are from the &amp;#34;Lord&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brands. I tried those three first because they seem popular on Amazon. Some of the other blades offered are very cheap and gimmicky like the &amp;#34;Gillette GOAL&amp;#34; blade which has a cartoon of a soccer player giving me the thumbs up... For my money, the Lord Superior platinum gave me a good enough shave that I can just throw the rest out. Shark was just as good and Feather acceptable. Crown wasn&#x27;t bad either. As I said, good blades and bad - but most you won&#x27;t even be able to find for sale, so one would be best off going with a strong, popular brand that sells in bulk here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband used the pack to find the one that worked best for him.  He wound up throwing a lot away, but it let him sample tons of different manufacturers to find the right one.</li>
    <li> This is totally the best bang for the buck. If you&#x27;re not sure which razor is best for you this giant sampler is great. It&#x27;ll help you figure out which one is the best for your sensitive skin or for your less than sensitive skin. Totally awesome!</li>
    <li> Mighty fine shave, indeed good sir&lt;br /&gt;Never felt more as a man than in the moment of a great shave such as this.</li>
    <li> This selection covers all of the major brands and lets you try what&#x27;s out there to figure out what blades work best for your face.  Everyone&#x27;s different, so be sure you try quite a few before deciding that one is the best.  Most (all?) of the models come with 2 blades, so you can try one initially and then come back a second time once you&#x27;ve narrowed down your choices.</li>
    <li> Everyone is different.  I gave the blades I did not like to a friend and he loves them. My original thought was to find the ideal blade and just buy 1000 &#x27;s of that type.  I really liked some of the blades but will just adapt to the one I am using. To many to chose from to find the exact one</li>
    <li> A great selection of razors, helped me find the one I like the best!  Definitely recommended to anyone out there!</li>
    <li> In this pack I was able to cheaply find out which blades were for me and which ones were against me :)</li>
    <li> Bought this sampler pack to test out which blades work best for me while shaving.  It is a nice assortment of blades with a lot of the popular brands and you get 2 of every brand to try and a few of them you get 4 blades.  I just wish they could include some Personna&#x27;s and maybe some of the Russian made blades to sample too.  It is still a great way to test blades and see what works for you.</li>
    <li> This is a good sampler.  There is a lot of variety, and having two of each is good because there is variability between shaves.  Personally, I would like to see more blades toward the expensive end of the spectrum, even if it made the sampler cost more.  My favorite blades in here were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Astra SP&lt;br /&gt;2. Gillette Silver Blue&lt;br /&gt;3. Treet Platinum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst:&lt;br /&gt;1. Vidyut stainless&lt;br /&gt;2. Vidyut platinum&lt;br /&gt;3. BIC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a box of Astra SP after this, and they are great.  I also got some 7 O&#x27;CLock SP (black) because I liked the lower end Gillettes from this sampler, and they are my new favorites.</li>
    <li> Being a newbie to de shaving I wasn&#x27;t sure which blade to pick. This is an awesome way to find just that perfect blade!</li>
    <li> Bought this sample pack bc I purchased a DE razor for him and wanted him to be able to find the right razor with out buying one brand in bulk And find that he didn&#x27;t like it. Very good variety and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Try doing anything with a dull tool, then pick up a sharp tool.  You will never again believe it&#x27;s better to have a duller edge for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not using lots of these.  Feathers are just awesome.  A couple others were good, but I can&#x27;t remember which.  I ended up getting a Feather 50-pack.  Still shaving with Feathers.</li>
    <li> Only a few of the razors worked well for my beard so I am happy I got this sample pack first. They come in a little ziploc bag with the individual razors in the paper wrappers with the logo as pictured. I think all the wrappers were wax sealed but I still sterilized them with some alcohol just incase.</li>
    <li> good variety and good price thank you</li>
    <li> The Shark and Vidyut blades were the only two that were garbage on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather and Lord Platinum were smooth as if I were shaving with a vagina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mediterranean, oily skin, thick, coarse hair, huge Adams apple, two annoying cowlicks on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather wins.</li>
    <li> This is a fine presentation of well-known razor blades from half a dozen countries.  It&#x27;s well-packaged, and was shipped quickly and well.  Finally, it&#x27;s simply a fun product.  (Imagine, that daily chore of shaving has become fun; I never expected that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would have been even better if it had included a couple of Merkur blades; they are spoken of widely, and so I ordered them independently.  (I wonder if Merkur forbids the redistribution of its blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery that I received varied very slightly from the advertisement.  That&#x27;s fine with me: I wanted a wide variety of interesting blades, and that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the effectiveness of the blade sometimes depended on the razor used, so I would try a blade in an old Gillette, a cheap Feather, and in the Merkur Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to the seller, who helped me learn and made it fun.</li>
    <li> Of course everyone&#x27;s face is different. But most of these blades are no name&#x27;s made in India and Pakistan. I&#x27;m sorry but the first stroke shouldn&#x27;t involve tearing hair out. This should have been called the international sampler pack. The Big ben&#x27;s, 7 O&#x27;clocks, and sharks are best. Some of the worst might have been resharpened for all I know.</li>
    <li> Great all around selection of blades.  Right on target.</li>
    <li> First, the blades came quickly and were packaged in two plastic bags. The mailer was a bubble wrap envelope sent via USPS. Each blade is individually wrapped as shown in the product photo. Safe disposal will be the only problem with this method. I kept my Wilkinson blade box, so I can get a few in there.    I am still on my first blade and will try to keep an active review going.    To begin with, I have an adjustable razor(1-9), my face gets soaped 3 times before I lather. Shampoo, bath soap, hand soap. Lather is Williams brush lather. Your results will vary depending on technique and equipment used.    The first blade out was the Lord Super Stainless in the green wrapper. This blade seems undersized compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I had to start at 5 whereas I usually start at 3 or 4 depending on the blade. I have now pushed it up to 10 shaves and am at 7 on my razor, which seems to be the practical closeness adjustment limit for this blade. It has given me smooth shaves all along, much better than the Wilkinson and CVS brands I found locally. I never worried that I couldn&#x27;t use some pressure if I needed to, in fear of it \\&quot;digging in\\&quot; or peeling my skin off. It has dulled nicely and never gave that toothy \\&quot;razor wire\\&quot; dragging across your face feeling. I would buy this blade. The other Lord products were also as good.    Next up was the red wrapper stainless steel ASCO. It was very much like the blade above, including seeming to be undersized. By the end of the first shave I was at 6 and by shave number 6 I was at 8. This blade also made it two weeks. Another blade I would consider purchasing.    The Shark Stainless and the Vidyut Super Max blades belong in the top tier, the Shark being a bit better than the Vidyut lasting 2 weeks as compared to one for the latter.    Gillette \\&quot;Goal\\&quot; blade. Green wrapper with a soccer ball on it. Terrible blade. Couldn&#x27;t find any adjustment that this blade would work with. Gone in three. If you like the screaming burn of aftershave and your face looking like an active volcano field, then this blade is for you, otherwise, don&#x27;t bother. Gillette should be ashamed to put out such a bad product - but I guess they really want to sell their multi-blade products. The Big Ben was in this class. After one shave, I knew it was time for something different.    Next is the Astra premium platinum blade. It seems to be \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized. Much better than the Gillette, but not quite as good as the first two. Won&#x27;t last as long, either. Plain white wrapper. The Nacet Platinum was much the same. Both wanted to nick as they aged. The Gillette Nacet was better, but not by a lot.    The BIC in the yellow wrapper lasted only one shave. Terrible. Nicks and razor burn galore. Feather goes in this category, too. Crown wasn&#x27;t a whole lot better. Had to use it at 3 or 4, but it just didn&#x27;t want to get all the way down tot he skin without a lot of work and eventual nicks. More in this category, the Gillette 7 Oclock and Siler Blue. Both these would cut to a point and then it was a lot of work to get the rest - and that&#x27;s when the nicks and scrapes started. The blue Bird was pretty bad its first two shaves, but seems to have settled down. All of the last three have the same problem in that the length of the blade and the loose tolerance on the center punch out can allow the edges to become a cutting hazard. The Gillette Silver Blue was the worst about this.    Treet Platinum. First shave was so-so. Will try one more shave. Not sure if it was re-nicking over the BIC damage or not....well, after the 2nd shave, I decided the only treat from Treet was nicks and scrapes.    Derby, took a bit to figure out the right setting. Not too bad, but only got a week out of it. Same thing for Trig.</li>
    <li> There was a decent variety of blades included in the group. It is a good way to try out different blades if your not sure what kind you will like or if your just curious.</li>
    <li> So far my boyfriend has found more blades he dislikes than ones that work well for him. Still, this gave a great variety of razors to try. Each blade that he likes in his razor last a couple weeks. Its been four months now, and he is still testing!</li>
    <li> Good way to get a variety of  blades. I would have liked to see a smaller amount of each blade but more variety. For example,there are 4 Shark, 4 Astra (awsome blade by the way)  and 6 Lord blades. Since this is a sampler pack it would make more send to include only two of each blade but more more brands or subtypes of each brand.  Perhaps add additional types such as Persona blue and Persona reds, Kia and a few types of Russian blades that I have been hearing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of sample pack after all is to try as many types of blade and see what feels good for your skin and beard type, then when you narrow it down, order a larger amounts of the type or types of blades that you like.</li>
    <li> A tad pricey, I think, for not as much variety, but I was able to try out a few new companies that I liked.     The hardest thing about shaving with a safety razor is finding the right blade for your skin, but once you do it is the best shave you can get. This variety pack includes some good companies, along with some not-so-impressive ones.    I personally don&#x27;t like the 7AM at all, I&#x27;m not overly fond of the Astra, but there are three varieties of Lord blades which were very nice.  The platinum one the most, of course.    If you are new to using a safety razor, definitely get a variety pack so you can find the right blade for you.  In fact, buy two of the same, and keep a list so you can rate each blade, then use the second pack for the final show down. Once you get the right blade, and razor (loving Merkur, disloving Parker) your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> Great Variety, this is a great way of trying the variety of blades out there. I already found a few I like and dislike without having to purchase separetly</li>
    <li> As a beginner to wet shaving, I did not know which blades to purchase for my safety razor. I bought this assortment because it has all of the blades you see people talking about in the shaving forums, as well as some others. Since everyone has different faces and different facial hair,  no one blade works the same for everyone. Buying an assortment life this allows you to try out a wide variety of blades to see which ones work best on your face.</li>
    <li> perfect for someone trying to see what blade works the best</li>
    <li> This is really nice to figure out what blade works best for you. So far I&#x27;ve found several brands in here that I might be purchasing in the future. There are a lot of very inexpensive blades, but several of those have been surprisingly good.</li>
    <li> New wet shavers should try a pack like this to find out which blades work best with your face and razor. Most of them will not work well which is the beauty of this product. You can find out with a couple of blades rather than a whole pack.</li>
    <li> Company is very nice and was prompt in solving problems I had. Super recommended.</li>
    <li> After many years of electric shaving followed by more (years and many dollars) of using Gillette multiple blade technology, I returned to the economy of wet shaving with a  safety razor.  I purchased these blades based on a review suggesting a sampler to determine the blade that works best for you personal needs.  It is superb for that purpose.  The five stars I&#x27;ve given aren&#x27;t because every blade in the sampler is wonderful, because they all aren&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s the variety  that allows me to choose which blade(s) I like best.  I&#x27;m not finished yet, but have found a few blades that work better than others.  When I&#x27;ve finished the sampler I will know which blades I like for future use and will order those blades.  Highly recommended if you are looking for the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for your skin!</li>
    <li> Here is my test of all the blades:&lt;br /&gt;Blade  Closeness  Shave  UsePerBlade  Cuts&lt;br /&gt;Shark  8.5  6  1  0&lt;br /&gt;Derby Ext  8  8  3  1&lt;br /&gt;Crown  8  7  3  1&lt;br /&gt;Lord Sup  5  4  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Astra Sup  8.5  7.5  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Lord  6  6  3  1&lt;br /&gt;Gillette7  7  7  3  1&lt;br /&gt;Gillette G  7.5  8  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Gillette N  3  5  1  0&lt;br /&gt;Trig  7  7  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Astra  7.5  7.5  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Bic  0  0  1  0&lt;br /&gt;Super Max  7.5  7.5  2  0&lt;br /&gt;Treet Plat  8.5  8.5  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird  8  9  3  0&lt;br /&gt;Asco  7  6  3  0</li>
    <li> An ok mix pack.. seems short on the better blades and is mostly the cheaper blades.  It is good blend to start from and I still haven&#x27;t touched the second set of 25 in this, so cost seems good.</li>
    <li> Tons of blades to try, no issues.</li>
    <li> Great way for me to try out a sample of blades to test the waters of using a safety blade.  There&#x27;s a lot of foreign blades that cut me up pretty good, but the high end Gillette blades have been my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I only recieved 25 blades, not 50.  The vast majority of the different kinds only had one, not two, and looking at the picture, I&#x27;m missing several different kinds as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty dissapointed, and now I see the product is out. :P not even a note about being out of stock or shipping the rest later.</li>
    <li> Although many razors in the sampler did not work for me, its really about personal preference. My go to razors are Astra Superior Platinum (great quality/price point), BIC, and sometimes KIAs.</li>
    <li> Love the value. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get through them all!</li>
    <li> I recommend getting a variety pack, even though most of the blades in this pack were sub-par. It really helps you learn the difference between good and bad blades (there are some good ones in the pack) and what you prefer in a blade.</li>
    <li> Having just got into double-edge razor shaving recently, I had literally no idea what blade would work well for me. This convenient pack includes at least two of every blade and contains several varieties from all of the world. The bag they come in conveniently lists which countries each brand was made in. I am only partially though and I am already finding some great blades.</li>
    <li> This was helpful for me to choose the blade I like most to go with my safety razor, and it was fun having the variety.</li>
    <li> Not necessarily a bad thing, but for a first time wet shaver this variety pack is overkill.  I tried all of the popular brands first and quickly found a few that I liked and didn&#x27;t bother with the rest.  Look for a pack with just the popular razors (7 o&#x27;clock stainless, astra platinum, derby, feather) and maybe a few others.  It did help me find my go to blade, but I had a lot left over.</li>
    <li> Like many others I bought this in search of finding the perfect blade(s) for me. I was shocked at the great differences in the cutting ability, even among the higher end ones. I have sensative skin, but a coarse beard. I found that the high end Feathers, Sharks, and Bluebirds shred my neck to pieces (again, sensative skin). The lower end blades took too many strokes to get close, thus irritation (I actually threw out the Big Ben and ASCO blades before trying them, having seen no real good reviews on those particular brands). Turns out the Gillette 7PM Super Platinum, the Derby Extra, and Lord Platinum gave me the closest shave with little or no irritation. The Astra Platinum did well to, but only in my Parker 91R, and not so much in my Merkur Long Handle. I&#x27;ll use the leftovers for household stuff I guess.&lt;br /&gt;As has been said in other reviews - this is a good package from which to review many great blades and find the one for you. Tachnique comes first, but blade choice makes all the difference in the final product.</li>
    <li> It was nice to get a variety to see which blades I like best!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no packaging with these razors -- you get two plastic baggies, each one filled with 22 razor blades individually wrapped in paper (as shown).    A piece of paper to mark down which blades you like and don&#x27;t like would be good -- because some of these blades are horrible.  I&#x27;m glad I tried them out here instead of buying a 100-pack on discount.    A safe method of throwing out the razor blades would be appreciated, but whatever.  This is a good introduction to the different kinds of DE blades.    Wait... no Merkur? Fail.</li>
    <li> Good mix of blades to try, plenty of each so you can get a few good shaves to really see what you like. I haven&#x27;t even tried about half of them! Worth it IMO for any newbie!!</li>
    <li> Recieved my first de handle. Didnt know which blade to use. Love having the chance to try an assortment. Glad I bought this. This way I&#x27;m not stuck with a bunch of blades I dont want. I will purchase another assortment. There are so many different blades out there. Keep trying till I find the one I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite through my multi-pack yet, but I am learning which brands are good, which brands I want to continue using, and which brands I should just avoid if I can. Not all brands are the same. Feather is nice, but my skin prefers bluebird most.</li>
    <li> Almost half way through this sample of blades and the experience has been great. Crazy as it sounds I have made notes on each blade so I can choose what to buy when I need more. However I have found that so many of them are great that buying another set of samples may be the way to go.</li>
    <li> Lots of different blades to explore. All of them were new with lots of different bands and styles.  No issues!</li>
    <li> Great way to try different blades without having to buy boxes of each blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard of feathers being &amp;#34;Ninja blades&amp;#34;.  Because of the illusion of danger from those reviews, I decided to start with them.  I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t tried the other blades quite yet, but it&#x27;s a quality sample size.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again simply because it&#x27;s served its purpose.  I&#x27;ll use the other blades, but I believe I&#x27;ve found the right blade for me.  Feathers.</li>
    <li> Wanted to buy different razors to see what (if any) differences there may be between the different brands and honestly did not expect something this well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 50 blades as described in this listing and you get about 2 of most blade types. Looking forward to trying them all out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This a very nice selection of different blades. I just wish that there were four or five of each blade instead of just two to get a better feel for how it shaves.</li>
    <li> You get what you see here.  I like the 2 samples of each brand, helps with reevaluating after getting your technique down with the razor.  It seemed to be the most variety for the cheapest price- best sampler pack value!</li>
    <li> This is a highly-useful trial assortment, but I can tell you my results and possibly save you some time.  I tried each kind of blade and classified them in a simpleminded three-bin system: Good, Okay, and No Good, according to how sharp I found them to be.  (I assumed that initial sharpness is what causes one blade to go through a day&#x27;s worth of beard smoothly and easily, while another gives a rough feeling, almost as if the individual whiskers are being pulled out instead of cut off.)  As a service to my fellow man, I present my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD: Feather, Gillette Silver Blue Stainless, Gillette Seven O&#x27;Clock, Shark, Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY: Gillette Goal, Blue Bird, Derby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO GOOD: Treet, Lord, Astra, Gillette Nacet, Trig, ASCO, Big Ben, Vidyur Super-Max Platinum, Vidyur Super-Max Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is only seventeen different varieties.  My understanding was that the trial assortment was supposed to have two blades each for 25 different kinds.  I probably got 50 total blades, but there were definitely more than two copies of some kinds of blades.  I gave the package five stars anyway, because it still served my purpose: figuring out what sort of blades to buy here as my life goes on.  (For me, by the way, the choice is the Japanese-made Feather, which does truly seem like a \\&quot;sweet nectar\\&quot; sort of safety-razor blade.)  And, between the \\&quot;good\\&quot; and \\&quot;okay\\&quot; categories, I ended up with eleven still-new blades when my trial project was complete.  I use a blade for a week, so those sample blades will supply me for a good while.  Then I&#x27;ll be stocking up on Feather, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general principle I found is that blades made in southern Asia, bearing that Arabic-looking writing, tend to be destined for the \\&quot;no good\\&quot; category.  I think the blade-makers in Pakistan and India need to get better control of their processes.  Even though the Gillette Nacet blades bear what seems to be an American name, the packaging still indicated aPakistani manufacture, and they were no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I had been happy for years using the Wilkinson Sword brand that I was able to pick up at Walmart, a buck eighty-something for ten blades in a plastic \\&quot;block\\&quot; package that gave you a handy and safe way to dispose of your used blades.  Less than twenty cents a week for blades that I would have rated \\&quot;good,\\&quot; although not quite so nice as the Feather.  But then Walmart quit selling them.  Well, screw Walmart.  Good thing Amazon&#x27;s here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sample kit of blades when I was new to DE shaving. I have face and head and was worried about finding a blade that stayed sharp but was predictable. This kit really lets you explore the art of shaving, from some of the ones I consider having a \\&quot;working edge\\&quot; to other that are so sharp they could cut the devils tail!&lt;br /&gt;I personally settled on feather brand blades, very sharp and an edge that lasts for almost two weeks before pulling and could stretch to 3 pretty easily. Every beard is different so this kit is recommended in my book to find out what you like.</li>
    <li> I love this variety pack.  You may think that razor blades are relatively simple and they should therefore be the same, but nothing could be further from the truth.  You can consider my opinion subjective because all blades are going to shave differently to different people and faces.  When I recommend specific blades, they are what works for my face.  So to give you an idea of mine:  I have a very coarse beard with moderate growth.  The hair on my face grows about 3/8\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; in a week&#x27;s time.  I shave everyday with a \\&quot;T\\&quot; handle type razor.  I also use the same razor to shave my head about once a week.  From this pack I absolutely love the Bluebird and Feather blades.  Some of them such as the Treet and some of the Bic&#x27;s are harsh and cut me up pretty badly.  Still, I would not have know that without trying this product.  Having a variety pack with 2 blades or so of each type made a huge difference.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, but only because it allowed me to find the perfect blades for me.  Buy this before buying a 50 or 100 pack of any particular blade so that you can choose the best one for your face.</li>
    <li> I only got 46 blades, I didn&#x27;t get feathers nor astra super plat. But other than that all of the blades other than those are here. I&#x27;ll be testing them out soon.</li>
    <li> Great set, excellent variety of brands/models, many of which you can easily replenish from Amazon. Clean packaging, I felt safe and comfortable getting right in and using these. I won&#x27;t make suggestions to which are better or worse, that is very much up to your face, hair,shave style, and preference. I will say this is a quality &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; and inspires confidence in deciding what blade(s) work best for you. At least 2 of most blades some versions had 3 or 4. The set is a very good mix. I recommend to anyone who needs some variety to choose from to make a confident decision on a larger quantity of a particular blade. Great value, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This costs more than purchasing one kind in bulk however it was worth it. Some of these just ate up my face however I found some that I really liked (BIC chrome platinum is what I ended up purchasing). This saved me money in the long run as I was able to purchase 100 razors of what I knew I would like for about 17 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have only used about 10 different razors since I bought this set, but it has been a great way to try different ones to find out what I like.  I had no idea how different each razor really can be.  It&#x27;s going to take me the rest of the year to go through all of the razors; I&#x27;ve been keeping a log for myself how each one feels to help me narrow it down.  Some of these have only lasted 3-5 shaves whereas others have lasted 5-7 shaves.  The sharpness between the different razors surprised me - they really do feel different.  This is great for anyone who is new to traditional shaving and wants to see what works for them.</li>
    <li> Great way to find a favorite blade.</li>
    <li> Good sampler pack. This has all of the blades I wanted to try. This is a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Good selection. I would recommend this to someone trying to choose the best blade for their skin.</li>
    <li> i only received 49. Most of the blades this pack comes with are trash. The feather and astras are my favorite by far. I would only purchase this pack if I wanted to learn how much quality can vary between blades.</li>
    <li> A minor quibble, SELLER please take NOTE. I didn&#x27;t receive 25 brands or even 50 razor blades. I got 48 blades, divided among 20 brands...in a number of cases I got four blades of the same type...Sharks, Astras, Nacets and Bluebirds. That&#x27;s not serious...I can&#x27;t sample every blade on Earth, but I do slightly resent being shortchanged to the tune of two blades. Otherwise the selection looks just as advertised...there were four different kinds of Lords; Feathers; Treets; Gillette Nacets, Super Blues, 7 O&#x27;clocks; Big Bens; two kinds of Super-Maxs, etc. I look forward to giving them all a thorough try over the next few months. Let&#x27;s see...even if I shaved every day, which I don&#x27;t, and used each blade four days, it would take me six months to get through them all! I&#x27;ll report back on my progress, the condition of my face, etc.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a lot of different blades, this assortment is a good deal. The vendor&#x27;s communication and customer service were excellent.</li>
    <li> this pack works great for trying a variety of razors. i would recommend it if you are not sure on the razor for you</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this.  Most local drug stores only carry a less known brand, and I wanted to find what would work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like everyone has a traditional razor brand or number of blades they prefer, when changing to a safety razor, one must find the brand of blades that works best for their face.  Someone with a more sensitive face or shaves daily will most likely want a different blade, than someone that only has to shave a few times a week, or has tougher skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not gone through all of these blades yet, so I can not comment on all of them.  I have already found some that I like, and some that I won&#x27;t use again.  This package contains two bags of 25 blades, so you at least have two blades of each version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am not a fan of some of the Lord blades, the shaving motion does not feel as smooth on my face.  I&#x27;ve only tried two of the Lord blades, but I won&#x27;t use those specific ones again, I&#x27;ll give them all a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of Astra and the Gillette Nacet, and Derby Extra.  All of these feel great to me, and keep their sharpness for a few shaves.  I have to shave every day during the work week, and I don&#x27;t want to risk getting cut by the blade dulling.  I only use these 3 shaves, and I have what I would consider corse facial hair.  I tend to use each side once and then both sides for the third shave.  I&#x27;m sure some get more shaves, and maybe with some I could get a week.  But at the cheaper cost compared to a Fusion blade, I can throw these out a little early.</li>
    <li> Love the variety. I test out each blade then review it myself and see what works best for my face.  I definitely recommend for anyone taking their beginner step into the safety razor world.</li>
    <li> I got this sampler because I have found a startling difference in the quality of double-edge, safety blades. The best I had before were a store-generic brand that I could not repeat. I have now identified a number of brands that work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from the blades with toothy animals. (Sharks? Crocodiles? Who thinks this is a good idea?) Also, many of the brands you might recognize are not as good as some that you have never heard of before.</li>
    <li> Great selection of razor blades. It was exactly what I wanted to experiment with different brands.</li>
    <li> Razor blades/cartridges was on my grocery shopping list. I was comparing the different sized packs of those multiple-super duper coated, non-face irritating cartridges; the best value for my money was the 8 pack at $31.66 (if one changes the the cartridge weekly that comes out to $3.96 per cartridge or .57 per day/shave). I decided to go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and buy the old double-edged safety razor but could not find them.... anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short...I found these on line. Using the same weekly change out schedule the cost of using these comes to .08 per/shave. This purchase (at $21.64) will last me for nearly a full year of shaving every day...with the cartridges the cost is nearly $190.00 for a full year of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost aside...I have found these to be sharp blades that get the job done. So far, I don&#x27;t know/can&#x27;t tell the differences between the different brands in this sampler.  Maybe as the year progresses one of them will become a stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said....I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Good way to determine which blade works best for your face.  Of course the bad ones leave your face worse for wear.  I found the best for me and will order more of the specific blades that work best</li>
    <li> Great way to figure out which blades work best for you. My favorites have been the Trig&#x27;s and the Lord&#x27;s, but YMMV.</li>
    <li> A must for anyone starting out with DE shaving or anyone just wanting some variety in life.  With this pack you can try different brands without purchasing whole packs of them.  I found four new blades that I have since purchased in bulk (two I had never even heard of previously!).</li>
    <li> Has every blade you&#x27;ve ever heard of and wanted to try, plus about three times as many you&#x27;ve never heard of and will try anyway. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The blades are good so I could rate it 5 but I am rating it a 3.  half the blades cut me up.  I finished almost all the blades and was not sure how I felt.  people would ask me why my face was cute up and red.  I even had a barber try these on me and he could not get a close clean shave without tearing my face up.  I wanted to make this work but I am going back to the disposable blades.  they give me just as good or bad a shave and don&#x27;t cut me up.. good product but just not happy that over half the blades were terrible</li>
    <li> couple of the blades are decent, but you get a lot of cheaper blades that you&#x27;ll end up not using as soon as you find the one that works for you.  Still worth it if you are searching for the right blade, but just go into it knowing you&#x27;ll get rid of half of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most blades come packed loose in a small ziploc bag.  dont expect too much on presentation...definitely not a &#x27;gift&#x27; item.</li>
    <li> I bought this sampler pack for my dad with the double edge safety razor for Christmas.  He loves trying out all the blades.  So far he likes the Japanese blades (he said they are the sharpest), but he hasn&#x27;t gone through the whole pack yet.</li>
    <li> Great way to get familiar with new brands.</li>
    <li> Goid variety that last a while!</li>
    <li> a few good blades, but mostly cheap lower quality blades.</li>
    <li> A nice selection of blades to determine what brand works for you</li>
    <li> Good to have a choice. I think I found my new favorite blade while using these.</li>
    <li> Very good selection of razors. My favorite so far is shark. I plan to use them all before purchasing any new ones qhich may be a while.</li>
    <li> I was new to single blade shaving and needed to find out which blade was right for me. I shaved with every blade before deciding what blade to use. If you are going to join the world of old school shaving this is the way to do it.</li>
    <li> As someone just getting (re)acquainted with safety razors and blades, this was a good way to see what is available on the current market. Already have found some I love (Derby Extra) and some I don&#x27;t (Gillette Goal). Looking forward to working my way through the rest of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the old school shaver scene. This is way to find the blade that will work best for yourself. I&#x27;ve already ruled out some blades and found some that I will purchase. Seemed a little pricey but whatever.</li>
