<li> They stay put with a little bit of super glue.  </li>
<li> They are very hard with no curve to them, a bit too big for nail art, so unless you can super glue it close to the cuticle they may be too cumbersome to apply...</li>
<li> The only down fall.</li>
<li> and i cant waite yo paint my nails pink and white with these black bows!</li>
<li> But other then that.</li>
<li> and i use black bows on lots of my clients.  </li>
<li> these bows go with every nail polish because they are black .</li>
<li> However they are LITTLE.</li>
<li> what I was looking for they are plain and hard to attach.</li>
<li> there were 40 pieces like advertised, unfortunately one had a broken tip, but it&#x27;s really not super noticeable.</li>
<li> I tried to apply these with nail tweasers and it proved to be a difficult task.</li>

    <li> took forever to get here!!!&lt;br /&gt;But when it did arrive.... I loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;there where exactly 40 bows! all neat!</li>
    <li> The first photo I attached is how they were packaged and the second photo is when I counted them out...there were 40 pieces like advertised, unfortunately one had a broken tip, but it&#x27;s really not super noticeable. They are very hard with no curve to them, a bit too big for nail art, so unless you can super glue it close to the cuticle they may be too cumbersome to apply...but that&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention to the measurements. I am sure I will find a use for them, so overall I am happy.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my nail bed!  Great quality and item received earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> these bows go with every nail polish because they are black . everyone loves these. my sister always wants me to do her nails using bows. they are the right size for your nails. I recommend these for nail art and for decorating your phone case or maybe anything you can think of.</li>

    <li> Very cute little 3d gems. However they are LITTLE. I tried to apply these with nail tweasers and it proved to be a difficult task.</li>
    <li> These are way too big for nail art. I was upset at first because they aren&#x27;t as flat as they should be so that they can stick and you HAVE to have long nails in order to make this fit. It&#x27;s too big otherwise. I&#x27;m going to use them for a phone case instead..</li>
