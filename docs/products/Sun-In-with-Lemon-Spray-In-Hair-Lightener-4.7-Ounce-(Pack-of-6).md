      <li>Funny thing is I like to recommend to my friends and co-workers, but I don&#x27;t want to all my surround beautiful color like me.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I love this product it works grate my child uses it</li>

      <li>This easy to apply lightener allows for variegated color and a winter perk-up.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and the smell is really strong.  </li>

      <li>totally recommend it for using it in summer, it gives a great glow to your hair.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m one hot BLOND mama!!</li>
      <li>I love this products so much!</li>
      <li>used the product many years ago when my hair was lighter and it lightened up to a nice blonde color.  </li>
      <li>Super quick and easy.</li>
      <li>This is an easy way to keep my otherwise mousy hair bright with highlights all year long.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However Amazon was great in quickly replacing them and they arrived dry.</li>
      <li>Even Hair Salon people always ask me very nice color, not so light and not so dark.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild</li>
      <li>I went through a phase where I lightened my roots every day and my hair in that area is super damaged, but using it once a week doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm.</li>
      <li>The only difference now is that it is more moisturizing with a better scent.</li>
      <li>Maybe not the best move ... portions of my hair, especially in the back, got frizzled and crinkly.</li>
      <li>and I just love the new bottle</li>
      <li>I guess I never noticed it at the lake with all the tan lotion smells and fresh breeze.</li>
      <li>Leaves nice highlights for my daughters red hair.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless... it&#x27;s probably not the healthiest stuff to apply to your hair, but if you want to be as handsom as me and my golden locks, give it a shot.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
      <li>Results after first use</li>
      <li>and i love that it doesnt leave roots like you would have from simply coloring your hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair also did not dry out or frizz—it still feels smooth and healthy and I manage it the same way</li>
      <li>Look like a natural high light.</li>
      <li>I have black hair and it works nicely to lighten my hair to a brown color.</li>
      <li>definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try out or even maintain a lighter color without paying a huge amount for salon services</li>
      <li>Any this is highly recommend products ever!</li>
      <li>I really believe it depends on the texture of your hair as to whether or not this product will work well for you.</li>
      <li>and it is so much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Got REALLY blond.</li>
      <li>In this summer and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In three times over six weeks or so (hair dryer method), and this past week, someone who had not seen my hair&#x27;s original color described my hair as strawberry blonde, by which I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>No more hassle to go around many drag stores any more.</li>
      <li>Moral of the story: I&#x27;m STILL one hot BLOND mama!</li>
      <li>Sure some hairdressers say it&#x27;s harsh on your hair</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for quick results for a couple shades lighter or long term results that will lighten over time, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural without any brassiness.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Use a little or use a lot to control how light your hair will turn out&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>its so easy and just takes as long as it takes to dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>Everyone loves it and thinks its my natural hair color.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is quite strawberry blonde now, but it&#x27;s definitely a much lighter brown than before, and after she said that, I can see the reddish tones.</li>
      <li>My hair is now more of a brown color and it started to lighten, but after daily use for a few weeks, it began to turn a reddish-orange color.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for quick results from dark brown to light blonde, this is not the product for you and you will end up with red colored hair instead of the blonde you are looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it makes it dry and damages it real bad.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend, a hair masks and coniditioner when you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
      <li>Amazing so nostalgic it reminded me of my childhood when I use to put it all the time</li>
      <li>Apparently my use of it while at the lake somehow made them fade.  </li>
      <li>first shipment arrived &#x27;wet&#x27; with several of the bottles leaking.  </li>
      <li>I did ultimately get the results I wanted, but to avoid the reddish color, I needed to use the product only about once a week to let my hair recover and naturally lighten.  </li>
      <li>No residue, no long lasting odor.  </li>

<li> No residue, no long lasting odor.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a true brunette with fairly thick and wavy hair—not really dark like Anne Hathaway or anything, but my hair is a pretty dark medium brown.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t even realize it could be used for grey hairs until I came back from my lake trip and realized they were almost all gone.  </li>
<li> At least it does in south Texas where the sun is quite intense anyway.&lt;br</li>
<li> I know some people&#x27;s hair actually turns orange if it&#x27;s a dark enough color to start, but this didn&#x27;t happen to me at all.</li>
<li> As long as you don&#x27;t overuse it, you can&#x27;t beat truly lightened hair for the price.</li>
<li> this is a much less expensive way to go.  : )</li>
<li> Other people have noticed the lightening too, and personally I think it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it doesnt damage or dry out my hair...</li>
<li> If you use it on dark hair, it will become red.  </li>
<li> The only hard part is getting the highlights to be even on the back part of my head.</li>
<li> Before I always straggle to find this item at drag store.</li>
<li> Just be careful not to inadvertently spray it on clothing or bath towels.</li>
<li> I like the fact that its subtle and not harsh like some of highlights they do in salons.</li>
<li> I had used this in the past and could no longer find it locally, but thankfully Amazon came through again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;ll lighten dirty blond hair really like if you use enough.  </li>
<li> On the bottle they don&#x27;t mention changes on black hair, so they can&#x27;t be liable for any promises to black haired people.</li>
<li> dont use it every day if you have a dark hair it will turn orange</li>
<li> Dark brown or black hair will turn a reddish-orange color after prolonged use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it on my jet black hair and it worked, lightening it slightly.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for a slightly lighter look, this is the product for you.  </li>
<li> so you can&#x27;t really mess it up.</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t imagine their chemicals are any less harsh.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product it works grate my child uses it and she loves to swim every one in the class loves her hair</li>
    <li> When my hair needs a little sparkle I just spray&lt;br /&gt;on some Sun-In, use my hair dryer to activate it,&lt;br /&gt;wash and style my hair as usual and voila, highlights!&lt;br /&gt;When I had this done at a salon it cost about $40&lt;br /&gt;so this is a much less expensive way to go.  : )</li>
    <li> Great way to keep my hair light in the winter when I&#x27;m not in the sun as much. Very natural looking. Smells great. Super quick and easy. Immediate results!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a slightly lighter look, this is the product for you.  I had used this in the past and could no longer find it locally, but thankfully Amazon came through again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Results after first use&lt;br /&gt;- Use a little or use a lot to control how light your hair will turn out&lt;br /&gt;- Simple application just like using hair spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Dark brown or black hair will turn a reddish-orange color after prolonged use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product many years ago when my hair was lighter and it lightened up to a nice blonde color.  My hair is now more of a brown color and it started to lighten, but after daily use for a few weeks, it began to turn a reddish-orange color.  Granted the warning is on the bottle so I knew this would happen, but I didn&#x27;t know how red it would turn.  I did ultimately get the results I wanted, but to avoid the reddish color, I needed to use the product only about once a week to let my hair recover and naturally lighten.  The product simply sped up the process as if I was out in the sun a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for quick results for a couple shades lighter or long term results that will lighten over time, this is the product for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for quick results from dark brown to light blonde, this is not the product for you and you will end up with red colored hair instead of the blonde you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Use to make the hair blonde.  If you use it on dark hair, it will become red.  Stays until your hair is cut.</li>
    <li> Great for gradually lightening darker winter hair that has not been out in the sun. Leaves nice highlights for my daughters red hair.</li>
    <li> perfect i highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but dont use it every day if you have a dark hair it will turn orange</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my jet black hair and it worked, lightening it slightly. I&#x27;ve used it since my teens and it has maintained the same results. The only difference now is that it is more moisturizing with a better scent. I would recommend it to anyone, but keep the patience because it could take more time for darker hair. On the bottle they don&#x27;t mention changes on black hair, so they can&#x27;t be liable for any promises to black haired people.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard for me to find. You can find the regular but not the lemon one.  My best friend uses it too so I buy the 6 pack and we split it and we are good for the summer..</li>
    <li> great product .&lt;br /&gt;surprisingly, it works for my hair because even hair dyes dont work .&lt;br /&gt;but however, it damages my hair .&lt;br /&gt;it makes it dry and damages it real bad.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend, a hair masks and coniditioner when you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;overall : SATISIFIED ENOUGH TO BUY AGAIN! (:</li>
    <li> As a product, this does work over time to lighten hair if you spray in at the beginning of the day before you go outside.  At least it does in south Texas where the sun is quite intense anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shipment arrived &#x27;wet&#x27; with several of the bottles leaking.  I suspect the prime two-day air shipping did not agree with it and they leaked when the plane depressurized at altitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Amazon was great in quickly replacing them and they arrived dry.</li>
    <li> ive used this since the 70s (im 52) and i love that it doesnt leave roots like you would have from simply coloring your hair.  its so easy and just takes as long as it takes to dry my hair.  it doesnt damage or dry out my hair...i love it!!  : )</li>
    <li> I have black hair and it works nicely to lighten my hair to a brown color. Everyone loves it and thinks its my natural hair color. I like the fact that its subtle and not harsh like some of highlights they do in salons. My salon said they would charge 45 dollars for a highlighting job. This is so affordable. You can use it indoors too with a blowdryer if you don&#x27;t get enough sun. The only hard part is getting the highlights to be even on the back part of my head. Sure some hairdressers say it&#x27;s harsh on your hair but I can&#x27;t imagine their chemicals are any less harsh. If you want to highlight hair, you&#x27;re going to have to expose it to some chemical either way. Sun-In is not that abrasive. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I reccommend product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll lighten dirty blond hair really like if you use enough.  It also works well on thin hair rather than the carpets some people have on their noggin.  Nonetheless... it&#x27;s probably not the healthiest stuff to apply to your hair, but if you want to be as handsom as me and my golden locks, give it a shot.</li>
    <li> This is an easy way to keep my otherwise mousy hair bright with highlights all year long.  It&#x27;s mild so you can&#x27;t really mess it up.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for a great product. Sun-in is a great way to light you hair without damage you you would get from bleach.</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair with a lot of variation in color. I use Sun In occasionally to even out the color of the darker areas. I went through a phase where I lightened my roots every day and my hair in that area is super damaged, but using it once a week doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm. As long as you don&#x27;t overuse it, you can&#x27;t beat truly lightened hair for the price.</li>
    <li> Best hair lightener out there.</li>
    <li> I tried this product last summer. I really believe it depends on the texture of your hair as to whether or not this product will work well for you. I have a lot of hair but fine hair. This product eventually dried out the sections I used it on and eventually thinned those hair strands, making the ends look like they were burnt. It was almost as if acid was eating away at my hair. Fortunately, it will grow out. Unfortunately I have to continue to deep condition my hair to keep from being so brittle until it is all grown out. Use Caution with this product. Salon says it is healthier to just use lemon juice. Congrats to the ones that can use this product without damage, as it is an easy way to highlight hair.</li>
    <li> good and fast fulfiled</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair really nice and it gives a great blond color. I am so pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it for using it in summer, it gives a great glow to your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing so nostalgic it reminded me of my childhood when I use to put it all the time and I just love the new bottle and I&#x27;m happy that it came quick</li>
    <li> I use this to save a trip to the salon. It works well will covering up my regrowth and it is so much cheaper. It looks very natural without any brassiness.</li>
    <li> Got a convertible to help with the midlife crisis. Not enough. Got the Sun In. Now I&#x27;m one hot BLOND mama!! Bought 6 more bottles of it. Got REALLY blond. Starting pouring it on my hair after shampooing and leaving it in. Maybe not the best move ... portions of my hair, especially in the back, got frizzled and crinkly. So I got it cut off and started using it according to the directions. Moral of the story: I&#x27;m STILL one hot BLOND mama!</li>
    <li> Use every morning.  I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, so my hair lightens by the sun and it is a great change.  I am blonde again!  No residue, no long lasting odor.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
    <li> This easy to apply lightener allows for variegated color and a winter perk-up. Just be careful not to inadvertently spray it on clothing or bath towels.</li>
    <li> I love this products so much! I have been using more than 10 years. This is a secret weapon for me not do hair color at Hair Salon. Even Hair Salon people always ask me very nice color, not so light and not so dark. Look like a natural high light. Before I always straggle to find this item at drag store. Now here it is amazon.com even has 6 packs! No more hassle to go around many drag stores any more. Funny thing is I like to recommend to my friends and co-workers, but I don&#x27;t want to all my surround beautiful color like me. Isn&#x27;t it so selfish? Any this is highly recommend products ever!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize it could be used for grey hairs until I came back from my lake trip and realized they were almost all gone.  Apparently my use of it while at the lake somehow made them fade.  I have started to use it at home with my blow drier.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and the smell is really strong.  I guess I never noticed it at the lake with all the tan lotion smells and fresh breeze.</li>
    <li> Very great product, people who bought it to me say it&#x27;s really great and works perfect. The packaging is very good too.</li>
    <li> I just started using Sun-In this summer and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a true brunette with fairly thick and wavy hair—not really dark like Anne Hathaway or anything, but my hair is a pretty dark medium brown. I used Sun-In three times over six weeks or so (hair dryer method), and this past week, someone who had not seen my hair&#x27;s original color described my hair as strawberry blonde, by which I was very pleased. Other people have noticed the lightening too, and personally I think it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is quite strawberry blonde now, but it&#x27;s definitely a much lighter brown than before, and after she said that, I can see the reddish tones. Just to note: nothing scary happened to my hair—I know some people&#x27;s hair actually turns orange if it&#x27;s a dark enough color to start, but this didn&#x27;t happen to me at all. My hair also did not dry out or frizz—it still feels smooth and healthy and I manage it the same way as I always have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try out or even maintain a lighter color without paying a huge amount for salon services</li>
