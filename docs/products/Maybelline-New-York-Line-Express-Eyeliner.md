      <li>quest for more affordable eyeliner continues.</li>
      <li>and it draws a nice, clean line.</li>
      <li>This liner is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Pencil sharpens easily, tip doesn&#x27;t crumble and applies smoothly!</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and I have not had a problem with it, even put it on in the car with out any problems :)</li>
      <li>THE BEST EYELINER IN THE WORLD, goes on nice and thick, lasts and lasts, couldnt ask for more</li>

      <li>Mediocre— quite waxy and not too smooth on the waterline.</li>
      <li>Helps create a crisp line or more of a smoky look.</li>
      <li>So excited that I have this product in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>It is a good product, I would suggest it if people asked should I use it, but I would not be the one that I suggest in general.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is nice if you run out of the other stuff that my wife usually buys. The only complaint would be that it has a tendency to run, but that is only probably due to what kind of activity people do through out the day. My wife is usually pretty active.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice eyeliner, but it does come on a little strong, I had to get used to how much goes on my eye and control it.</li>
    <li> Goes on very easy last for hours I even use it and the sponge to make a smoky eye!</li>
    <li> its ok dark as u put it on but needs to be re aplplied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I been using for a while now. I usually get it at a drugstore but the price was much lower here so I bought it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice Eyeliner pencil. Its easy to sharpen and it draws a nice, clean line.</li>
    <li> Makes smudges under my eyes. I was going to throw it away but I like the smudge.</li>
    <li> Nice eyeline by Maybelline.  I love that it can be sharpened too.  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> works fine but still doesnt stay on place as long as i expected, i used it and i really liked the way it looks, but few hrs later was a little raccoon like</li>
    <li> I tried this eyeliner because I liked the fact that it had the sponge on the other side to smudge the liner.  I think that it smudges a little too much.  I used it this morning and it turned into a total mess.  It started smearing down my face and mixed with my concealer.  It looks like I have raccoon eyes.  It smudged as soon as I left the house this morning.  I used the sponge side to make it a little softer but it just turned into a a streaky mess.</li>
    <li> I personally do not like this eyeliner.  Too soft to apply. But I can see the use for smudging will be good!</li>
    <li> I have never had a worse eyeliner pencil, to be honest. The cheap 10 cent ones were better than this. Literally, I used this pencil once and it was alright, but as soon as I tried to sharpen it it began breaking apart and would not make a smooth tip. The ONE time I tried to sharpen it I went from a long pencil to a short nub just trying to get a decent tip-- it was trashed after one use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Believe me, it simply doesn&#x27;t work-- it&#x27;s not the pencil sharpeners fault either. The pencil sharpener works great on all my other eyeliner pencils-- this is just cheap material.</li>
    <li> I love this eye-liner. It glides on smooth and is very black.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using many different types of eyeliners, from drugstore brands to luxury brands, and this is one of the worst. To come to this conclusion, I experimented with products I had on hand and compared it with this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rimmel SpecialEyes (from drugstore)&lt;br /&gt;2. Rimmel Soft Kohl (also drugstore)&lt;br /&gt;3. Ardency Inn&#x27;s Modster (fancy $19 eyeliner from Sephora)&lt;br /&gt;4. Makeup Forever Aqua Eyes (another fancy $19 liner from Sephora)&lt;br /&gt;5. Maybelline NY Express Line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tested Conditions:&lt;br /&gt;Northern California weather, which is fairly cool and non-humid at the moment: 60-70 degrees. I wore Urban Decay&#x27;s Shadow Primer and also their Naked 2 palette on top. For each day of the week for two weeks, I wore a different eyeliner and gauged how I looked by the end of my day, from 6 AM - 9 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purpose:&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I splurge on a lot of make up items, especially for products that come into my skin&#x27;s contact first (primer and shadow). Because of this, I want to save and see if there are affordable eyeliners out there with decent staying power compared to the expensive luxury brands out there... especially since paying $20+ for a pencil breaks the soul :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;1. Rimmel Special Eyes - Hard pencil, a bit difficult to apply, decent pigments&lt;br /&gt;2. Rimmel Soft Kohl - Soft pencil, but not too creamy that it melts away at the slightest pressure, deep pigments, looks great&lt;br /&gt;3. Ardency Inn&#x27;s Modster - the softest pencil of the 5, melts like nothing so application is a bit difficult, pigments are the darkest of the bunch, looks the best if you can apply it correctly&lt;br /&gt;4. Makeup Forever Aqua Eyes - Medium pencil, the hardness is like a hybrid between Rimmel&#x27;s Special Eyes and Soft Kohl, very easy to apply; dark pigments&lt;br /&gt;5. Maybelline NY Express Line - soft pencil, similar to Rimmel&#x27;s soft kohl, dark pigments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the finishing product after applying looks great. If I had to rank the finishing product (which one looked the best after immediate application, it would be: 3 &amp;#62; 2 &amp;#62; 5 &amp;#62; 4 &amp;#62; 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modster wins because of its amazing dark pigments. Maybelline and Rimmel Kohl were surprisingly great after application, followed by Makeup Forever and Rimmel Special Eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity / Staying Power (from 6AM-9PM):&lt;br /&gt;1. Rimmel Special Eyes - slight smudging around 4PM but still looks OK. Some cleaning and reapplication would help. Melty by the time I am home around 6-7PM.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rimmel Soft Kohl - smudging around 2PM; some cleaning and reapplication can help; melty around 5-6PM&lt;br /&gt;3. Ardency Inn&#x27;s Modster - incredible staying power throughout workday, slight smudging around 7-8 (if any)&lt;br /&gt;4. Makeup Forever Aqua Eye - also great staying power throughout the day, slight smudging around 5-6&lt;br /&gt;5. Maybelline NY Express Line - smudging begins at 10AM, eyeline melts 4-5mm below my waterline around 3PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rankings: 5 &#x3D; 4 &amp;#62; 1 &amp;#62; 2 &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed with Maybelline&#x27;s staying power. Our office temperature is at a constant 68 degrees F. Other eyeliners faired decently during the mornings and required some touch up after ~8-12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, that explains the 2 stars for the amazing look for the first 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always wary of eyeliner reviews since I don&#x27;t know what other individuals have used with it. Primers should prolong the staying power. However, under the same conditions (expensive UD&#x27;s primer and shadow!), Maybelline&#x27;s eyeliner fared the worst of the bunch. While I know its unfair to compare it to the luxury brands, it failed terribly in comparison to Rimmel, which, in my opinion are best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest for more affordable eyeliner continues. But to those who are doing the same, I would pass over this one.ng product (which one looked the best after immediate application, it would be: 3 &amp;#62; 2 &amp;#62; 5 &amp;#62; 4 &amp;#62; 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modster wins because of its amazing dark pigments.

    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner! I tend to have problem with eyeliners running, but I haven&#x27;t really had an issue with this one. It goes on very smooth too!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and I have not had a problem with it, even put it on in the car with out any problems :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Goes on smooth, stays on throughout the day. Easy to sharpen. I&#x27;ve been complimented on my looks recently and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed! The price can&#x27;t be beat either. I can&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d need eyeliner that would cost more.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. I tried sharpening it a number of times and the tip breaks every time. I used the product literally 3 times so far.</li>
    <li> Love the smudging edge as well as the pencil. Helps create a crisp line or more of a smoky look. Pencil sharpens easily, tip doesn&#x27;t crumble and applies smoothly!</li>
    <li> I did not like this eyeliner. It bleeds really bad onto my upper lid, and is super messy all around.</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to apply and how soft. It doesn&#x27;t stay all day though, I&#x27;d say it stays for around 5 hours.</li>
    <li> its an ok product. it has a tendency to smear. keep sharpened at all times.</li>
    <li> Great, black eyeliner just what I need and waht i want. i would Definitely buy it again. I completely recomended.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge makeup person but I am trying. I ordered this because it was a good deal and I wanted a good deal. I am still learning how to smudge correctly but I feel like this is a really good product. It is easy to apply and stays on my face like I want it to!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years. It is the only kind I will buy! I absolutely love it!! A must have !</li>
    <li> easy to apply and has a handy smudger on it</li>
    <li> Great for me to just throw in my purse in case i need a quick touch up during the day.</li>
    <li> Looking for an eyeliner that does not smudge. This seriously falls short. Will not purchase again only for that reason.</li>
    <li> Very black and goes on smooth purchased for my daughter but I use it often</li>
    <li> A good product. If I need to go out with friends, I use it twice a day, once in the morning and another quick retouch. Overall, I use this once a day and it it does not smudge. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good eyeliner for the price. Goes on smooth and I like the color. It does seem to smudge under the eyes after wearing it a while though.</li>
    <li> ... my problem was that I can&#x27;t sharpen the darn thing without the tip breaking off before it gets sharp again! It&#x27;s too soft I think. Soft it fine, but perhaps not this much!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner for beginner makeup junkies. I came across this from using a gel liner with an angled brush and thought this would be much easier. As I am a sucker for drugstore makeup , this was appealing to me. It is very easy to apply and the color is as expected , not as dark as I would like it to be but definitely to my expectations. The rounded edge &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; at the bottom was definitely a highlight for the product and I found it extremely helpful to smudge out harsh lines. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite eyeliners. It goes on smooth and last all day.</li>
    <li> It smears all the time</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap. Never expected such quality from Maybelline, cannot sharp the pencil. It&#x27;s a use and throw stuff. I wish there was an option to give 0 stars to this item.</li>
    <li> Has to be perfectly sharp to get the right line.  Smudges if you are not too careful later in the day.  Nice dark color and the smudging end does the trick. Will probably look for something less soft next time.</li>
    <li> I used this to fill in my brows and it looked great. I always liked Maybelline products for my skin type.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. The eyeliner goes on nice and smooth, one both pencil and liquid ends, however I am not a fan of pencil eyeliner. It does need sharpened more often then I would like. It is a good product, I would suggest it if people asked should I use it, but I would not be the one that I suggest in general.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different eyeliners but I always come back to this one. It is very easy to sharpen, the black is very saturated, I love the attached smudger, and the price is very affordable!</li>
    <li> Love this! It is dark and glides on smoothly, and I have had it for awhile, and with daily use, I am sure I still have a good month of using it left.</li>
    <li> I really liked this eyeliner, it went on smoothly and looked like I was wearing liquid eyeliner. The only problem I had with it is every time I went to sharpen it the tip broke off or it was uneven and couldn&#x27;t apply. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the sharpener or the eyeliner that made this problem happen. I only got a couple of uses out of it before I sharpened it to much and had to throw it out because it was to small to use. I would have given it a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this eyeliner since I was a teenager. I used to do the whole line your eyes like a raccoon look until I learned how to do my makeup. This eyeliner is smooth and dark. A little bit goes a long way and I enjoy the smudge tip too.</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s an eye liner, it&#x27;s black, it does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment &amp; Outstanding product ;) thank you ! Highly recommend this Seller !</li>
    <li> THE BEST EYELINER IN THE WORLD, goes on nice and thick, lasts and lasts, couldnt ask for more</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t visited your site &amp;#62;2 months and did not make a purchase. It&#x27;s FRAUD.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t make previous purchase too. Last time I didn&#x27;t say anything but now it&#x27;s too much.&lt;br /&gt;Cancel this purchase.</li>
    <li> Disappointed because it said it would last long and its great an all but for me it smears on its own quite fast but it does glide on easy.</li>
    <li> Mediocre— quite waxy and not too smooth on the waterline. It&#x27;s fine for smudging on the lid though</li>
    <li> Really amazing! But you need to carry a sharpener!</li>
    <li> This eye liner will smear and come of within an hour of wearing it giving your eyes a racoon look.  When you sharpen it the tip will break every time! I went Through this pencil in one week! It was a waste of money. It could be that I got a bad batch one but I really don&#x27;t know. I went back to MAC &#x27;s</li>
    <li> Well recieved and liked</li>
    <li> Good coverage but when try sharpening it is too soft and breaks off😔</li>
    <li> Really nice eyeliner for the money. I use it on my waterline and lid. It lasts longer on my lid than water line.</li>
    <li> This liner is pretty good. It goes on smooth and is good for the price. What I don&#x27;t like about this is the smudge part. It doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as it rubs it off completely. I thought I was using it wrong but how many ways are there to do that lol? Doesn&#x27;t give me the smoky look I want. The liner on its own is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am really picky about my eyeliner because it is hit-or-miss with me when it comes to drugstore brands.  This eyeliner surprised me, it went on very smooth and it didn&#x27;t smudge or run even on the waterline.  I loved the smudger tip, it really helped me create a polished look.  Overall this is a good eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It goes on so easy and stays on. I have used this kind for years and years.</li>
    <li> I am an eye liner junkie and this is one of the mainstays in my make up bag; will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I like this pencil a lot.  It goes on smooth, and once dry, stays put very well.</li>
    <li> Love this pencil. It goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love this liner. It goes on smooth and looks great</li>
    <li> Its work great.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> As far as pencil eyeliners go for women like me who like to rim their eyes serious biker chick/Indian girl style. Love it!</li>
    <li> My mother enjoyed receiving this for Christmas (along with her make up kit). She has been using it everyday and carries it with her everyday.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is so much easier to apply than the other pencils I&#x27;ve tried, and the smudger is nice for creating a softer look. My only complaint is that this is one of the harder pencils to sharpen since the tip breaks off easily. Because of this, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as most of my others. However, the low price, the ease of use, and the look it gives definitely outweigh this issue.</li>
    <li> Makes a really dark and dramatic look. Gives perfect precision also. The smudge part on the back gave me freedom to do the smokey eye effect!</li>
    <li> love this eyeliner for the bottom part of my eye.. do a real thin line then smudge it out..looks too sexy.. obviously with make up in order to know if a product really works good u have to know how to use it properly.. so play with it a couple times... even with foundation</li>
    <li> It glides on great and lasts all day. I really love this eyeliner. I would def buy it again. A+</li>
    <li> The smugger on the back doesnt really work well kind of wipes all the eyeliner off but I did find this eyeliner was nice and dark black without having to burn the tip like I have to do for my other eyeliners.  The pencil must be soft because I need to sharpen it after every use to get a nice point to use the next time.  But over all its a good liner</li>
    <li> I liked the eyeliner. It&#x27;s not super waterproof, but I kind of preffer it like that. Really good product for the price!</li>
    <li> The most fabulous eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Wonderful to use on the waterline! Love the smudging sponge tip on the other end. So excited that I have this product in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> It works really good, the only problem is that it gets a lil messed up when you sharpened it, sucks.</li>
    <li> this is the best eyeliner I have ever used.  I could do both my under eyes and over eyes with it. Just love it!</li>
    <li> This is my go to black pencil eyeliner.  The addition of the smugger is great--it helps to create a good smokey eye.  The eyeliner pencil is soft so it creates a good line without tugging too much or scratching.  I don&#x27;t really have too many problems with in fading, except in the summer and I wear it almost every day.  It is even stays when you tight line or line your water line.  But do not expect it to be waterproof--it is not.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you have to sharpen the pencil frequently because it wears down the point fairly quickly compared to some other pencil eyeliners.  Make sure you have a good pencil sharpener, if you decide to buy this.  Thankfully, it is not an expensive liner since you will go through it fairly quickly with having to sharpen it once or twice a week, depending on how you are doing your makeup.</li>
    <li> Great price for a black eyeliner.  I like the way the eyeliner goes one.  Simple and smooth, and the crayon look is what I looked for.  Some eyeliners are hard to apply, but this one was easy to apply to eye.  I didn&#x27;t give this eyeliner 5 stars because it can be difficult to sharpen, but most &amp;#34;pencils&amp;#34; can be a challenge to sharpen.  I would recommend this eyeliner.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Really creamy goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to jab it to get the color definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> This is a really nice eyeliner, but it does come on a little strong, I had to get used to how much goes on my eye and control it.</li>
    <li> recently i lost this pencil, i&#x27;ll die! i love it, i will buy it again</li>
