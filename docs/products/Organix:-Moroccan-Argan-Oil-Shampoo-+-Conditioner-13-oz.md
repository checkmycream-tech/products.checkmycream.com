      <li>I LOVE LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>I love the Organix products but these are my top fave!</li>

      <li>My favorite of the line  is the Keratin Shampoo in the brown bottle.  </li>
      <li>I like the rejuvanating cherry blossom duo much better than the Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shampoo or conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is healthy??</li>
      <li>It promotes itself as an organic blend of healthy shampoo, made from quality ingredients.</li>

      <li>and I have never been able to see scalp through my fringe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also ordered a hair mask from this brand and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love how the seller packaged the items for shipping.</li>
      <li>and I love the way my hair came out.  </li>
      <li>It was healthy, and now it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>All I can say is go for the shampoo alone and use your own conditioner that your comfortable with.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this line of shampoo, but the keratin oil shampoo and conditioner for me is better than this one.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would do some good and to be honest I&#x27;m not satisfied with the results, both the shampoo and conditioner do not lather very good</li>
      <li>Best for healthy looking long hair.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good combination of products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of positive reviews of this shampoo and since I have curly, frizzy, thin damaged hair (from coloring and straightening) I decided to try it.  BIG mistake.  I&#x27;ve washed my hair with this shampoo TWICE and both times my hair has felt dry and tangled when I&#x27;m rinsing it out before putting the conditioner in.  My hair honestly felt like your hair feels when you&#x27;re washing dye out of it in the shower, it was awful.  I&#x27;m definitely going to be returning this product.  The conditioner was alright, but I could barely get my fingers through my hair in the shower.  I&#x27;m definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pretty good combination of products. Helps tame the frizzes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner set for a while and loved the way it makes feel and look. I loved the fact it had natural ingredients including argan oil, cocoa butter extract, coconut oil, avocado oil, aloe extract. Now they have gotten rid of all of the natural ingredients and have replaced them with chemicals! Don&#x27;t believe it? Compare your old bottle to a new one. The new chemicals even include dimethicone! I feel ripped off big time. I&#x27;m posting this same review on several websites to spread the word. I&#x27;m sick of companies thinking their customers are too ignorant to even notice. SPREAD THE WORD!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use sodium laureth sulfate, which is an ingredient in many liquid soaps and shampoos. These products work fine.</li>
    <li> Works wonder on my dry and frizzy hair. Totally love this product !! Nice fragrance to it too! Always use these as set!! :)</li>
    <li> All of their products are great especially if you are looking for moisture.  I was not disappointed.  I am a believer.</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently because I have such dry and damaged hair I thought it would do some good and to be honest I&#x27;m not satisfied with the results, both the shampoo and conditioner do not lather very good and it seems like you need a lot of it to cover your hair (my hair is pretty long though). The smell is nice overall but it just made my hair more dry it seems and still frizzy. If your looking for a cheaper alternative I just purchased the pantene repair and protect shampoo and conditoner I woke up this morning and my hair felt and looked so healthy and nice, I would give that a try!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many people say bad things about these products! They are amazing for my curly hair! The shampoo is super creamy and makes a really soft lather, giving my hair so much shine and moisture. The conditioner is very thick and leaves my feeling super silky, and makes my hair look and smell beautiful! The only thing i dont like so much is, yet the packaging is very cute, it is akward trying to squeeze the product out &amp; when you have a small amount left, it is difficult to turn it upside down in the shower. But the amazing product makes up for it:)</li>
    <li> I used the keratin version of this brand and it was aweful. Watered down shampoo and conditioner. Could not even brush my hair it was so knotted. The smell was good but that was about it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible! I normally use professional lines but bought this out of convenience. It made my hair fall out like crazy. I tried 3 different types of the Organix brands and got the same results. As soon as I switched my hair stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> okay but not noticing a huge difference in my hair yet</li>
    <li> Thanks my item came quickly and I love it .&lt;br /&gt;It works fine for me my hair is down to my hips and with a slight curl.thick.&lt;br /&gt;I do dye my hair and change it often so I appreciate the product it leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful without having to use argan oil in the bottle.that for some reason leaves my hair greasy but I love this stuff light sleek and soft and smells good. Love it :)</li>
    <li> No-poo,.. Co-washing. (NO shamPOO and I use COnditioner only, to WASH.) I prefer the Organix Coconut and Macadamia Oil conditioners. This one is so thick that I have to lay the bottle on its side and press down to push the product out. Too thick.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, for all of the world out there with drier hair than we&#x27;d like, toss the shampoo and wash using only the conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy at all, but only nourishes. I even use coconut oil (organic, extra virgin) as a leave in, before I use either a sulfate-fee, paraffin-free, silicone-free mousse, cream or other styling product.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve got wavy/curly hair and I want to work with my curls, nourish my hair, instead of fighting it, after years of trying to straighten it. The hair-iron fad was my last straw at how awful that looked and how ridiculous it actually is.)</li>
    <li> My hair is thick. this stuff is so awful!! I could not comb through it after I got out of the shower. I ended up buying  garnier Fructis hydro recharge to fix it. Do not buy this stuff! Save your money. I wish I could get my money back!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this product because I love natural oils. I really wanted this to work. I am 26, have jet black non-treated hair, and South Asian. I shampoo every other day and take care of my hair very well-- it&#x27;s thick, I enrich it in herbal oil mask once a week, and take my vitamins and irons religiously. However, after using it now for 3 weeks, I have to say the reason my hair feels limp than my usual is because of this shampoo. May have to switch back to my previous drugstore brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it does smell good and has a nice lather but it does not give you full volume, nice hair. Limp is not the way to go!</li>
    <li> Smelled great but dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I love how the seller packaged the items for shipping. I always worry about liquid items. The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so very soft!! Almost like silk. It is expensive (to me) so I only use it on special days. It is my favorite shampoo/conditioner ever and I wish I could afford to use it every day!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have tried numerous shampoos and conditioner and none have compared to this brand. With the first application, I could feel the difference in the manageability of my hair. I am so happy with this product, that I have told all of my friends and family about it and have thrown my other shampoos and conditioners away.</li>
    <li> I have bine using this for years i loved it untill i realized my hair was getting thinner humm i wonder what was cousing it to fall out . The organix shampoo( i tryed every one of them) made my hair fall out before useing it i had such thick long hair. So i swiched shampoos to the loriel thickning shampoo my hair is SOOOO MUCH THICKER!! I will never use the organix ahampoo agien</li>
    <li> One of the best products for a reasonable price. Ill be buying more im sure. Im too sexy for my hair!lol</li>
    <li> The only thing I like is that it leaves my hair soft. But other than that it doesn&#x27;t feel as if I was washing my hair. Mind you it does make a lot of bubbles just that I don&#x27;t feel my hair is being washed thoroughly. No idea why that happens...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner I think is pretty good however it washes out to fast. Kind of like when you go to the Caribbean and the salt water cuts the soap right away. That&#x27;s the feel i get from this product in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thats my opinion, maybe ya&#x27;ll like that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- [...]</li>
    <li> Wife very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this shampoo, but after a month of use, I have so much breakage that I may have to get a few inches cut off, which is definitely *not* what I wanted. Switched to another brand, but will never use another Organix product because this one is awful.</li>
    <li> Great! Makes hair so soft!! Smells great!! Sold at Target for $5 and Walmart. I will stick with this product!! Buy the shampoo as well. It&#x27;s hard to find the bigger bottles but they do make them bigger than this!</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> 0 stars for this shampoo....This product is HORRIBLE!!!!!! I was using this shampoo for about a month and I noticed that my hair seemed to be thinning....Then I noticed all over my scalp patches of something ....had my husband look and found clumps of this shampoo clinging to the hair near my scalp......ALL OVER MY HEAD!!!!!! looks like yellow strands of egg yolk....I even had my husband take pictures of this mess. I had to go out and buy a clarifying shampoo to try to remove this crap from my scalp! I hope it eventually washes out. Not recommended for anyone!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After three tries on this product, I gotta say the shampoo is wonderful! It gives my hair the bounce it needs, keeps in the moisture and gives it a great sheen! However, the conditioner is just awful. I have wavy curls that became all greasy and tiny when used! I even tried to use a really tiny dime sized amount and rinsed my hair out really good but it made it look like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair at all. All I can say is go for the shampoo alone and use your own conditioner that your comfortable with. Don&#x27;t buy  this combo pack deal of 13.00, go to your local CVS and pick it up for $5.</li>
    <li> When I saw my teenage granddaughters using this, I bought a set for myself. Now I use it exclusively. Terrific for fine hair</li>
    <li> I used to use argon oil in my hair (it&#x27;s a pricey habit) and I&#x27;ve heard great things about this brand but have never used it. I likes it at first but after a few days I noticed the hair on the back of my head felt weird and super dry. Then I started getting huge mattes in my hair, I mean huge. I have literally broken into tears from the pain of getting through these tangles. I am pretty convinced this stems from the shampoo.( If I find out otherwise I&#x27;ll take this down.)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase these from Amazon but I liked the results so well, I felt moved to give a review.  I&#x27;m an African American and I love the way my hair came out.  It felt so good and light!  I didn&#x27;t try detangling until the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair 3 times a week and take excellent care - very limited heat, oil treatments, and natural products. I wanted something with Argan Oil, so I gave this a try. It is NOT natural by any means. I used this about once a week and I noticed my hand would be covered with hair when rinsing. Didn&#x27;t think much of it at first since I shed in the warm months, but after 3-4 uses I have significant hair thinning! Seriously, my overall thickness is reduced by about 1/4 and I can see my scalp at my hairline - my hair was so thick that I could only wrap a hair tie twice and I have never been able to see scalp through my fringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using for two weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any extra fall in the shower drain. I 100% blame this shampoo/conditioner as it was the only new addition to my regime and this was not a normal &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; for me. Plus the loss did not continue once I stopped using it. I am very concerned that the thinning will not correct itself.</li>
    <li> not for thick wavy hair at all!!! don&#x27;t believe the hype!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of both of these things and I think it really helps my hair to feel soft and shiny and bouncy. it cleans my hair well and I don&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s rough on it.</li>
    <li> My hair is frizzy and dry. I got this after reviewing the ratings. This did nothing to smooth my hair. I wasted money</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for over a year, while looking for a less expensive alternative. I also use the Moroccan Oil and the Moroccan Cream with the same colors on their containers as this product after using the Wen in the shower. This product was highly recommended by a hair-stylist I know. I have really thick, curly hair that she said would do well with this, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the alcohol and all of the other ingredients that I cannot pronounce, my hair was like straw and extremely frizzy. I guess this cheap product would be ok if you&#x27;ve never treated your hair to Wen products. If you have used Wen, do yourself and your hair a favor-do NOT think this will be an acceptable alternative</li>
    <li> Shampoo was great. Conditioner was heavy and weighed down my hair!</li>
    <li> Like the smell and it is supposed to be really good for you hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner wouldn&#x27;t come out of the container.  Tried several things but it wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
    <li> Contacted company, they only sent the shampoo. No conditioner. This should have been a set. No response. Wish they would have acknowledged my issue.</li>
    <li> i thought this would make my hair silky and flat it stood out about 3 in not good for thick hair i look like a clown</li>
    <li> One day while shopping for the expensive brand of Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, my usual place of purchase had run out of stock of this product.  I was in desperate need of shampoo so decided to try the less expensive brand and was very surprised that the Organix brand was just as good for half the price.  I love it when I find a good deal and this is definitely a good deal without sacrificing any of the benefits.  It is fragrant but not overpowering, cleans my hair and conditions just as well as the more expensive brand.  I have already recommended it to my daughter and two sisters.</li>
    <li> I have fine but thick hair that tends to be pretty dry, so I was really looking forward to using this set. Unfortunately, it made my hair feel brittle and even drier. I also felt like I had to use a lot of product to saturate my hair, so I went through this really quickly. The only redeeming factor is that it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she seems to like it very much.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! Perfect for those seeking a moisturized scalp, smooth, &amp; healthy hair. I have wavy hair that can get very frizzy and this really prevents that.</li>
    <li> I have used this for some time. I love the Moroccan Oil brand but I can&#x27;t get it locally. I have very long, fine hair and lots of it.  I have to get my hair thinned out from the hair dresser if that gives you an idea.  I live in Florida so the weather is hot and humid.  I always brush my hair with condition in it.  If I don&#x27;t I will be brushing for hours after a shower.  The salty air and my hair are a bad combination.  I haven&#x27;t changed my routine and my hair is breaking right and left trying to brush through it with this conditioner.  I noticed this a few month ago and I have now determined it HAS to be the formula.  Something has changed.  I refuse to use this anymore.  My hair is less shiny, its not as straight, and it is tangled.  When you have hair down to your butt and tons of it you cannot afford to have companies making changes like this one did.  What a s**** thing to do.  Goodbye Organix.</li>
    <li> Very good product, but I did not realize it is sold at the local department stores.</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo and conditioner keave my hair feeling like pure silk, soft and managable.  My hair has always been COARSE, this stuff make it feel so GOOD!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I wasn&#x27;t impressed but you get what you pay for. Smells great but leaves my hair feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I love them!! Best shampoo and conditioner i ever used, definitely i recomend it, argan is the best product :-)</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife. She has very dry hair that requires a little additional maintenance. Traditional over the counter shampoo products don&#x27;t help a lot and cause significant hair-fall. The Organix: Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo + Conditioner is just perfect for her as it doesn&#x27;t cause her hair to fall and gives it a nice rich texture. The nice aroma after usage is a plus, although not necessarily a major factor in purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This set has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my hair.  I&#x27;ve recently had a surgery which was pulling the nutrients out of my hair making it dry and dull.  The shampoo and conditioner has def made an improvement!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner Set - makes my hair feel silky. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I naturally have really long and silky hair. I like to change up my shampoo and conditioner sometimes and I decided to try this stuff. It is so bad! My hair is so TANGLY! I have never had this problem with any other shampoo I have ever used. Don&#x27;t buy it. It will damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I thought it would make my hair shiny and soft like it claimed, but it did the opposite. Very DRY and helped ruin my hair. Would NEVER USE this ever again. It started making me question OGX brand after this one...</li>
    <li> My routine is to grow my hair to waist length, cut it, donate it to charity, and grow it out again, So I want to use the best shampoo I can to keep it clean. My aim is to keep the scalp healthy and the hair sturdy so it can grow to its full length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at first quite pleased with the Organix Argan Oil of Morocco. I admit that while I wear sweats, rarely go on vacation, and try to save money, I do invest time and energy in my hair care. I want to make sure, if I&#x27;m donating it to cancer patients, that my hair is as strong and healthy as possible. That means a lot to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Organix Argan Oil seems like it would be ideal for this purpose. It promotes itself as an organic blend of healthy shampoo, made from quality ingredients. Even its container seems to ooze &amp;#34;good for you&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as many others have pointed out, it now has Dimethicone and other chemicals in its ingredients list. This is organic?? This is healthy?? Dimethicone is non-biodegradeable and is known to cause all sorts of skin irritations. And this is being put on our head? It&#x27;s a coating agent, meaning your skin can&#x27;t do its natural, necessary activities to keep you healthy and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only a tiny side note that the bottle is bizarrely shaped so you can&#x27;t lay it cap-down. Meaning it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get all the shampoo out of the bottle. You have to balance it in a corner to get the rest out. It&#x27;s like they expect you to waste a quarter of the bottle because you have money to burn (along with your scalp to irritate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hope, if we all speak out, that they could go back to healthy ingredients. Until then, I&#x27;m just not willing to put this on my head.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shampoo or conditioner. Works awesome, smells great and my hair is so much nicer looking. Frizz is under control!</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo and conditioner set - this is my favorite scent. It keeps my hair very soft and shiny.. and I have really thick, wavy hair. It works so great!</li>
    <li> I switched to this shampoo and conditioner about 8 months ago. Since then, my hair has been absolutely ruined. It went from full, thick, and strong to dry, frizzy, staticy, thin, and tangly. My hair is falling out left and right, and it tangles in one day into the sort of rat&#x27;s nest that used to only appear after days without combing. I used to trust OGX :( I switched shampoo and conditioner a week ago to another brand&#x27;s strengthening and repairing conditioner, and I can already feel the difference - - it&#x27;s incredible. I&#x27;m not even saving this stuff as backup for if I run out of other shampoo/conditioner... It&#x27;s going straight into the trash.    Edit: Don&#x27;t know why someone said my review is unhelpful. Could be the seller or an OGX rep. Regardless, the ONLY THING that changed in my routine in prior to my hair deteriorating was switching to this conditioner/shampoo combo. I don&#x27;t blow dry, I don&#x27;t use hot water, I don&#x27;t style or use damaging chemical products. It was healthy, and now it&#x27;s not. Please, think twice before buying.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  So glad I found it on amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5 star because of dying my hair has become very thin and I now have half the hair I had before. But with this product my hair looks so much thicker and shinier even when I work out. I think this is a good product even if you sit down and read the ingredient labels. Try it and ull see it works, if you want fast results try using the alfaparf oil treatment. They come in packs of 12.</li>
    <li> A house guest left a partly used bottle of this behind.  I decided to try it and loved how it made my straight, fine hair look so much more full.  I&#x27;ll definitely be looking out for it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. My hair was a dry frizzy mess until I stopped using Pantene and tried this great replacement.</li>
    <li> I like the rejuvanating cherry blossom duo much better than the Argan Oil. My hair does not do too well with oil.</li>
    <li> i bought the trial versions of the shampoo and conditioner to try this product out instead of spending 6.00 for each bottle and end up not liking it . My hair was very hard to comb through took me like 20 minutes to comb though my long thick wavy hair. Once it dried it made my hair shinier but very oily and frizzy it made my hair so much frizzier than other cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the full bottles would of been a huge waste of money. I&#x27;m going to stick to herbal essence they work soooo much better than any expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product, and when my mom brought it home I was so excited to use it. However, this product was NOT good for my hair. I have long, naturally curly hair that has damaged ends. This left my hair feeling brittle. The texture was exactly like the feeling of putting a cheap soap on your body- kind of sticky, oily, and just gross. After applying the shampoo, I hoped the conditioner would make it softer, but that was not the case. It just left it feeling worse than the shampoo! Maybe a little softer, but that&#x27;s about it. After letting my hair dry naturally, the way I usually let it dry, my hair looked and felt brittle and dry. I do not plan on using this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the way my fair and thin hair reacts to this shampoo and conditioner.I love the Organix products but these are my top fave! I had tried so many shampoos and conditioners on my hair and nothing seemed to work.I ran across this and bought it.Along with the oil.I love the softness and feel and shine my hair has with all these products.Not sticky,oily or greasy.Beautiful hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I do leave my conditioner in for the duration of my bath then wash it out.I have hair that is turning grey and it seems my regular hair and my grey hair want to do two different things! This stuff helps both! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel sooooooo soft</li>
    <li> Best for healthy looking long hair.  Good price from Amazom</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. It smelled great and I love it but I will try the other products</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo hated the price when I went to my local target and found I paid almost double!  $5.74 a piece instead of the $19 I paid!</li>
    <li> So overpriced on this site, but I got both from target for five bucks each :) I have really dry hair so this made it super silky and yay they don&#x27;t test on animals, thats important to me at least.</li>
    <li> i juts going to start using it!! i hope it helps to my damage hair. they shippend very fast and i was just i want it!</li>
    <li> Definitely its the best shampoo in the world</li>
    <li> Love these products...</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best if you want soft shiny hair.  I have sensitive skin, but this whole line of products from Organx takes care of my sensitive scalp with beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Recently had in brazilian hair extentions and this product made the hair silky nice and soft. Its works well on my natural hair too. i use it  as a cowash (washing hair wit conditioner).</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderfull and cleans very well. Has a lot of lather. So you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to wash your hair. It&#x27;s wonderfull. I personally love it!</li>
    <li> Left my hair heavy!  I had to shampoo it out at least 3 times but my hair still feels yucky.  And a lot of my hair came out!,</li>
    <li> and this was all i could use to wash my hair for the rest of eternity, i would cry of happiness, the smell is incomparable, and it does wonders to my hair! i&#x27;ve done everything you can do to damage your hair and this brought it back to life.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with these products. I adore how my hair feels after each use and how they smell. My hair has gone through some damaging phases and its bouncing back. I also ordered a hair mask from this brand and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love this line of shampoo, but the keratin oil shampoo and conditioner for me is better than this one.  Smells great though</li>
    <li> Smells great. Left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my hair feels silky, shiny, smells good,  only downside it its hard to rince all the conditioner out, have to watch that</li>
    <li> So easy to send a surprise gift to granddaughter</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff- doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leave it clean and soft. I&#x27;ve also gotten multiple complements on the scent. One thing I will say though is if you need a good moisturizing conditioner this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you. It&#x27;s good, but I would recommend getting something specifically for moisturizing. Overall a great product and I will buy again. Keep an eye on drug store sales- they do a buy one get one half off from time to time.</li>
    <li> This product is great, especially for dry scalp which can be brought on by cold weather. It moisterizes , conditions, and leaves hair looking clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is easy, but it&#x27;s difficult to get the conditioner out. Didn&#x27;t really work for me, that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I have curly, medium thickness hair that was drying out quickly. I first purchased the moroccan argan oil curling perfection cream and it started to rejuvenate my hair so I thought I&#x27;d buy the matching shampoo and conditioner and they work wonders! My hair has never been so soft and my two day old hair is much, much less greasy than I have ever experienced, which is a plus. I am not sure why some people have opposite feelings on this shampoo and conditioner- maybe it&#x27;s just certain hair types. Would recommend giving it a try and seeing if it works for your hair!</li>
    <li> The smell alone is worth every penny.  I have super long thick dyed hair and go through shampoo and conditioner really fast.  I use this stuff only for special occasions because the smell is just intoxicating.</li>
    <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t take the tangles out of my hair.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and cheap shampoo.  The conditioner is worse.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair very soft and I color my hair often.  Also makes my kids hair soft too.</li>
    <li> This product was featured within the Moroccan Oil products, so I thought it could be as good. However, I do not like the results on my hair and will stick with the Moroccan Oil products</li>
    <li> I have really dry and frizzy hair and thought this would work. Even other cheap conditioners will at least make my hair feel silky while in the shower, but this stuff barely works through my hair at all. I have to use a wide tooth comb to get it worked through, when usually I can just massage conditioner through with just my fingers. I feel like my hair has actually become drier since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are also really difficult to squeeze. I am down to about 1/4 of the bottle left and I find it next to impossible to squeeze it out. The shape of the containers are hard to hold on to when your hands are wet in the shower. They are large and awkward to hold and you can&#x27;t turn them upside down as they won&#x27;t stay put because of the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Did your hair ever feel so good that you kept touching it? This is it! Silk in your fingers, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst shampoo I have ever used for an extended period of time.  My hair became brittle, dry and started breaking after a few weeks of using it.  I switched back to Biolage and my hair returned immediately to shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by this shampoo and conditioner.  She has long, full bodied hair with a slight wave...and these products have what it takes, making her hair shiny and much easier to style!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner together at walmart. the first 3 times i used it i didnt like it,my hair was hard to comb thru and didnt feel smooth. after drying i loved the way my hair looked and felt, shiny, and silky to touch. i used it again for the 4th time today and my comb went thru  soooo much easier and my hair is super shiny and so soft to touch. It&#x27;s clean and not reasy looking. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft &amp; full-bodied!</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling awful, gritty, dry, and tangled, was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of both the shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;d never used it before....yuck.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the full size.  Like another reviewer, this shampoo left my hair feeling brittle and dry and the conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for it.  I have fine hair and not a lot of it, but I had to use twice the amount of my regular shampoo to feel like I had any in my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.  Unless I&#x27;m missing something about this shampoo and conditioner....it&#x27;s terrible, in my opinion.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not the best.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good products and quick delivery, I like them both&lt;br /&gt;Les</li>
    <li> I was really excited to buy this because I normally love Organix products. However, this Argan oil set did nothing good for my hair. I have naturally curly and medium thickness hair and after using this set, my hair wasn&#x27;t any softer and it was also really hard to untangled afterwards--it just felt so dry. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great for any hair type, re-hydration was excellent after a trip to drier areas.</li>
    <li> I love the Organix line!  I live in Connecticut and the winters here are so shivering cold that I have to turn up the heat, which causes static.  I can&#x27;t even bush my hair without it frizzing and flying away but this shampoo eliminated the static and left it feeling soft and silky, yet still with body.  I used  pure Moroccan Oil once and my hair was totally limp, but this shampoo has just the right amount.  My favorite of the line  is the Keratin Shampoo in the brown bottle.  I used that shampoo exclusively for one year and I had no breakage, no split ends, just silky, shiny, bouncy hair.  Then I had buildup and had to switch to another shampoo.  I used other brands but my hair never felt silky or full like it does with Organix.  I have long, straight, thick hair which is colored blonde.  Other moisturizring or oil shampoos only make it limp.  I have not had that problem with the Organix line.  I&#x27;m going to try their Macadamia oil shampoo next.  If anyone from Organix is reading this, I have a suggestion: How about a clarifying shampoo?</li>
    <li> Great stuff and it came in today and i used it already! It made my hair soft and shiney. I used this before and always loved it. It&#x27;s also better and cheaper the Wen products. I would recommend this over Wen. This Doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like Wen did or flatten, weigh my air down or give me a ichy scalp like Wen does. I love this stuff and when I run out i will order some more again from u thank u so much.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  I love the way they smell, I love the way they make my hair feel:  soft and silky.  But what I don&#x27;t like, at all, are the containers they are packaged in.  They are not \\&quot;user friendly\\&quot;, meaning they are very hard to grip (especially if there is a little bit of shampoo on my hands)!  Why the manufacturers used this sort of bottle is beyond my realm of comprehension.  Just use a plain, old, straight up and down bottle.  I would give it 5 stars, if not for this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought these shampoo and conditioner at a CVS. My hair ended up with a lot of frizz and looking just awful !! I just used it once.... definetely not for long, thick and wavy hair.... I will not buy it ever again.</li>
