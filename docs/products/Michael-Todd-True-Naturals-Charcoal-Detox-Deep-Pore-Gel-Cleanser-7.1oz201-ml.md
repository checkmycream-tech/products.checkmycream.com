<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does clean the face very well from make up etc. and doesnt irritate the skin. Unfortunately my skin hasnt cleared up by using the product.</li>
    <li> its not cleaning as good as my other cleanser. will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! product didn&#x27;t work for me but it has for a friend of mine.  I guess it depends on skin type but I wasn&#x27;t happy with results. after several weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this detox cleanser as it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve tried so far, out of many, that effectively removes any trace of makeup, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, nor cause any issues with my sensitive, acne-prone, rosacea face. The only thing I was disappointed with which prompted me not to give a full 5 stars, was that it didn&#x27;t come in pump form as shown on their product page.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I have ever used that that 100% removed all face impurities. I&#x27;ll never uses another face wash!</li>
    <li> Absolutely adore Michael Todd products! This cleaner works very efficiently to remove any makeup and excess oils. It lathers well on the face yet is very gentle. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling like it has no oil left either! It also has a very nice scent to it too! LOVE THIS CLEANER!!</li>
    <li> I really like Michael Todd&#x27;s products.  I have oily skin and sometimes get breakouts, and the charcoal cleanser works great with my skin type.  The consistency is thick, and the color is dark purple.  I don&#x27;t know why charcoal is so good at cleansing, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my face thoroughly without leaving it feeling sensitive or really dried out. (Quick tip: if you have oily skin, use blotting papers before washing your face.  This prevents that tight, dry feeling you get after washing.)  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed.  I really love that it is vegan and doesn&#x27;t test on animals, too.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how this works because I received the wrong item, I got a skin defender creme cleanser which is not the same thing &amp; it broke me out like crazy. I very annoyed &amp; upset</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter.  She has had some acne problems.  This product is great and has helped her so much.</li>
    <li> It is ok cleanser. I love the Honey Oat one way way way more than this one. Even though this cleanser is meant for oily skin consumers.</li>
    <li> I have really dry sensitive asian skin and this products doesn&#x27;t strip my skin completely but cleans everything (including face makeup) thoroughly. I have been using this for 2 years now and will continue to repurchase. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love using this product in the mornings and evenings. It smells like lavender. The pump makes it very easy to use, and it pumps out just enough for your whole face.</li>
    <li> I bought this desperate to find something that would work for my skin &amp; just happened to come upon it after searching online.  I didn&#x27;t really think it would work and at first wasn&#x27;t sure, but after using it for a while my skin is so much better.  I have had the same bottle for a long long time now &amp; still hasn&#x27;t run out, I&#x27;d say almost a year!  I sometimes only use it once a day in the evening &amp; just use water &amp;/or witch hazel in the AM.  This is the first summer I don&#x27;t have little bumps all over my forehead, I would always break out when it got warm no matter what I did.  I also can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a pimple on my face. I used to regularly get a big pimple that I would feel the need to pick &amp; cover up that would leave a scar. I don&#x27;t know if it is the face cleanser, something hormonal or what, but I will continue to use it as long as I&#x27;m having good results &amp; no adverse effects.  The only other thing I can think that I&#x27;ve changed lately is using magnesium lotion (not on my face).  If you try it give it at least several months.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! My skin looks amazing since I&#x27;ve started using it. So glad I stumbled across this line.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. People were raving about it on YouTube, so I decided to try it. BEST DECISION EVER!! I have extremely oily skin and this is the perfect cleanser to help control it through the day. I will definitely be buying more Michael Todd products.</li>
    <li> I found out about Michael Todd products from a Youtube makeup vlogger. I was intrigued by the concept of charcoal cleaning my pores. I used to use Cetaphil with my Clarisonic, and while it cleaned my skin fine, it didn&#x27;t make my pores feel any different. This doesn&#x27;t make my pores looks or feel any different either but it does exfoliate a lot better than the Cetaphil did. I like the smell and I like the texture of this soap when it foams up. I will continue to purchase it as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
    <li> amazing product! deep cleans and i can even rub it around my eyes as a makeup remover and it does not sting them at.all.  getting really good results after using for one month. at first my skin began detoxing (breaking out) but it didn&#x27;t last long and now my face is smoother and softer and clearer than it has ever been.</li>
    <li> I love this. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but around three times a week. It&#x27;s great for deep pore cleansing.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. It cleans deep without drying out your skin. Only downside is the smell, but you can&#x27;t expect charcoal to smell heavenly. Perfect product!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! I wish I would have found this product sooner in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and my skin looks better in my opinion. My pores are a little smaller (no dramatic results) and it seems to dry up my breakouts in a more quick manner. I plan on purchasing again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI. I alternate this cleanser with a Murad 24/7 anti-aging/anti-wrinkle cleanser. I use one in the morning and the MT in the evening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing great for sensitive acne prone skin I have struggled with acne all my life !!!! I&#x27;m 28 and still young was sick of it now I found something that works and Is most importantly natural :)) gotta get it I love love it</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin, I will recommend the product to everyone.  Cleans the skin very good closes the pours.</li>
    <li> Cleanses very thoroughly. Reaches deep inside pores and leaves face feeling refreshed and declogged. However, the only downside is that it leaves my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser I use now, cleans without stripping, helps clear breakouts and takes makeup off very well!! A winner all the way!</li>
    <li> i love this product!! i use it everyday and it works great with clarisonic.  it has really helped my skin and clear my acne completely! all michael todd products are wonderful especially for acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Seemed to help clear up breakouts. I like how gentle it is and that it&#x27;s all natural. Pleased so far!</li>
    <li> Recommended by a beauty guru on youtube, decided to give it a try, and I am really impressed by it. If you have oily to combination skin, this would work for you. Gentle and effectively clean!</li>
    <li> The product had a sour odor. I contacted Michael Todd and they informed me that Pure Essence Health is not an authorized distributor of Michael Todd products and that the products I received were outdated.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have very oily but sensitive skin thats prone to large pores and pimples, plus i live in a very hot climate in the caribbean. Firstly, one pump thoroughly and I mean thorougly cleans your face and neck, which I love because it means that this bottle will go a long way! It really does clean your face deeply without overdrying your skin and it leaves no residue at all. I used to have a complicated facial cleansing routine to cater to the needs of my sensitive but oily acne prone skin which involved different wipes to remove my makeup then a harsher soap then a gentle cleanser, which was so much work! Now I simply wash it all away with this and I think this one-step routine using This product actually cleanses my skin better than my complicated one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the product I notice my skin is very smooth which I love and I notice my pores are definitely smaller. Michael Todd scored big time with this one. Im definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> This cleared up many of my blemishes and blackheads.</li>
    <li> Love this gel cleanser I heard about it all over you tube and I had to try it out for myself.  It really gets all of my make up off my face I did the white paper towel challenge.  After you wash your face you take a bounty paper towel and wipe all over see if there is any make up on the towel and Michael Todd pass there was nothing!  It does as it says on the bottle I will be purchasing this product again.  The smell of charcoal is very refreshing and not over powering great gel cleanser.</li>
    <li> Michael Todd can do not wrong and this stuff just goes to show that again. I just really love this stuff after I take off my make up.</li>
    <li> Awesome cleanser!  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have little hard white heads that I get so fed up with that I pick at with tweezers because try do not come out! I&#x27;ve used this face wash for a good month now and the white heads are gone!  It of course was rough the first week as it was cleaning out my pores but they are gone!!! I actually got two of my sisters hooked on his products now!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup well and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser and I like that it smells like lavender, but I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. The product doesn&#x27;t break me out and I like that it has natural ingredients, but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s pulling out skin impurities. Will I repurchase? Maybe. I use this as a second cleanse (first to remove makeup, second to cleanse the skin) and it seems to do the job, but for me it&#x27;s not an end all be all product.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; dry skin- ok, let&#x27;s face it- I am getting old with dry skin (smile) and this cleanser works wonders. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all and it does not make my face feel tight after using it.  I use cetaphil majority of the time to wash my face and use the Michael Todd cleanser maybe once or twice a week.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell of this product and for that reason I don&#x27;t use it enough to see if it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have oily to combination skin so many cleanser products I&#x27;ve used always would make me break out, this product has helped my skin by far! Love this product would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product.  I am a new fan of the Michael Todd products. This cleanser has made my skin super soft, smooth and it just feels great after I wash my face.  I have combination oily, acne prone skin and this product has changed my skin in over a week of trying it.  Thank you Michael Todd makers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 5 months now. I took a break in between and switched to another cleanser for a month but ended up and breaking out, and switched back to this cleanser. It gets rid of my break outs, I noticed my face is less oily through out the day as well compared to if I use any other cleanser!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I very much love! It has a soft creamy feel when applied and smells amazing! It washes off all your dirt makeup and my face feels so soft not drying. Also I feel like I just had a very expensive facial spa treatment! Love this product! Will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a difference on my face</li>
    <li> Terrific face wash - I love the &#x27;charcoal&#x27; smell - reminds me of a spa facial. Creates a lovely lather, and washes off clean and fresh. Esp love that this is not tested on animals. Great brand, great product! And, a great price, too!</li>
    <li> This product sounded like it would do the trick for problem skin, but it made me breakout even worse and clogged my pores terribly. After the first use, I woke up and my face was loaded with blackheads and I had several new blemishes.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have very sensitive combination skin and react to most chemical products. This clears my oily skin without over-drying or triggering my eczema. I am switching entirely to this product line because the results have been amazing. I have not broken out since using this (which is incredible with all of the sunscreen I have to use in the Texas summer sun). I only wish I could subscribe to this product so I never have to run out of it!</li>
