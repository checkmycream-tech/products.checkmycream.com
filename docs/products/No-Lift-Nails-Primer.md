    <li> i like this no lift nails primer. its the only one i use to do my nails. thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> My nails still come off!  But they do stay on longer then before!</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s so much better than my previous IBD bonder/primer.  Dries quickly and NO LIFTING with my hard gel nais.  AWESOME product!</li>
    <li> Good product, five stars indeed</li>
    <li> I expected it to be stickier to adhere to my UV gel I use at home. I have the sensationail system and do them myself. The smell is pretty nasty but I think it&#x27;s worked pretty good. I&#x27;ve only tried it once and my gel is lasting.</li>
    <li> This product did not prevent lifting for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I used this product each time I did my nails.  I now have found that my nails take much longer to lift if they do at all, without using this product.  Also, the odor is really offensive.  I tried storing it in plastic and I could still smell it.  It was very difficult to work with because of the strong odor.</li>
    <li> Great product really works! I will order it again and again! It lifts a bit but after 2 weeks! Brenda</li>
    <li> Nail stayed on much longer. Impressed with the product.</li>
