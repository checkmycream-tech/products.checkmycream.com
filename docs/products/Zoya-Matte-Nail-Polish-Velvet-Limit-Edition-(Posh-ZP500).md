<li> Long lasting and not a lot of chipping.</li>
<li> I typically polish my nails at night and by the time I went through my morning routine the next day, it started to chip around the edges and tips of my nails.</li>
<li> I applied this to my toes, and after several weeks, it is STILL holding tight.</li>
<li> Love the color..but definitely needs a base coat..</li>
<li> You should def get this and any other polishes from Zoya 😎😍</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t use a top coat or base coat.</li>
<li> I will be ordering the Black Matte Polish.</li>
<li> Although it was a little pricey...</li>
