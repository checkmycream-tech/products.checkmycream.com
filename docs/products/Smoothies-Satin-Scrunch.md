### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I thought this would work out great.  </li>
      <li>so this scrunchie is great for not pulling out any strands, and I like that</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>These are okay....</li>
      <li>Do not use my most costly purchase here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really glad I got this scrunchy because it keep my hair in place</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Well it works fine</li>
      <li>I wear it to secure my hair at night.</li>
      <li>Good material, soft, and well made.  </li>
      <li>It looks sophisticated &amp; classy, suitable for any time of day</li>
      <li>Will probably purchase again once my current set fall apart for good.</li>
      <li>They make it even more costly to the consumer by tagging on an outrageously high shipping fee because they send a hair accessory by priority mail!  </li>
      <li>I was watching a youtube video on how to keep second day curly styles looking good</li>
      <li>Even the non metal ouchless elastics snag on hair (not badly, but still, they do).</li>
      <li>This is a perfectly adequate satin scrunchie...</li>
      <li>It surprisingly doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hair, unless loosely wrapped.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just make my own next time I need one.  </li>
      <li>This is an item worth maybe $2.00 after giving them a 150% markup.  </li>
      <li>Great for natural ( or any) hair...but definitely overpriced.</li>
      <li>The satin is more protective than a regular elastic</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find satin srunchies locally for some reason, so I&#x27;m glad that I found these online even if they are a bit pricey for a scrunchie.</li>
      <li>This is a great product especially for active women</li>
      <li>It was a pretty decent price</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t even used it for a whole week yet and the stitchings are coming apart.</li>
      <li>The material is not durable and very flimsy.</li>
      <li>and this product does not stretch very well for my liking.  </li>
      <li>Lady&#x27;s if you are natural or not you should always sleep with a satin or silk bonnet or a satin or silk pillow case, and the same things for your hair as we&#x27;ll, too keep up with healthy hair living</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other satin hair ties that hold up A LOT better than these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with these scrunchies, other than they stretch out after time -- but that&#x27;s to be expected after using something like this for over a year.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this mainly because it was satin, to use for wearing my hair at night.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not worth 4.00 if it comes apart that easily.</li>
      <li>Very classy item.</li>
      <li>That being said, I like the product so far.</li>
      <li>but it also looks adult &amp; classy in the evening for a sleek ponytail.</li>
      <li>Reviewed by my wife: These are soft and don&#x27;t pull out my hair.</li>
      <li>and it ripped some, but all in all it holds my natural hair well.</li>
      <li>Also, the satin is too soft</li>
      <li>and I saw that the young lady used a silk scrunchy to put her curls in a ponytail before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps it would work better for someone with hair that isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
      <li>This scrunchy is gentle on your hair, does not bind too tightly.</li>

<li> This scrunchy is gentle on your hair, does not bind too tightly.</li>
<li> so it has no body, falls flat.</li>
<li> I recommend for anyone with long hair.</li>
<li> I have long, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> /girls with long hair.  </li>
<li> this point, all the scrunchies are stretched beyond repair on the inside.</li>
<li> I used it after washing my hair before I went to sleep, and the next morning I realized there were black stains all over my white satin pillowcase</li>
<li> Definitely wash them a few times before using them as the stain is likely to ruin other fabrics.</li>
<li> especially when you can get 5 in Walmart for a little over 2 bucks.</li>
<li> however, if you happen to be loaded with melanin and likely to add oil to your hair, you should place these into the wash (several times...on delicate or just handwash them) before wearing them.</li>
<li> I believe I&#x27;ve only had for a few weeks</li>
<li> However, I have very thick natural 4b/4c hair</li>
<li> If you have a lot of hair this thing breaks down under stress.</li>
<li> The downside is that the black color bleeds onto fabric and skin (if you wear it around your wrist during styling).</li>
<li> it makes my buns and styles a bit fuller looking because I have black hair and order the black scrunchie.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to try this to keep less stress off my hair from twisting every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I got one in black, silver gray, and brown</li>
<li> and it took my a few minutes to realize that the color was coming from the scrunchie!</li>
<li> Not recommended for my thick haired sisters and brothers.</li>
<li> I understand its satin and all but doesn&#x27;t mean you get to rip people off.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s a ridiculous price for one scrunchie.</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> I would have given 4 stars, but one has already broken apart.</li>
<li> It stays in place while running without the uncomfortable pulling feeling.  </li>
<li> Could be the knock-off satin which is not even that expensive.</li>
<li> Just poor quality, threw it out immediately!</li>
<li> I have to say that I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
<li> This scrunchie is horrible!</li>

    <li> Very classy item. This scrunchy is gentle on your hair, does not bind too tightly. the material is silky  &amp; will not grab your hair. It looks sophisticated &amp; classy, suitable for any time of day but it also looks adult &amp; classy in the evening for a sleek ponytail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with these scrunchies, other than they stretch out after time -- but that&#x27;s to be expected after using something like this for over a year.  Will probably purchase again once my current set fall apart for good.</li>

Also, the satin is too soft so it has no body, falls flat.</li>
    <li> The material is not durable and very flimsy. The scrunchie came apart onky after a week or so of using it. It tore in the middle.</li>
    <li> Lady&#x27;s if you are natural or not you should always sleep with a satin or silk bonnet or a satin or silk pillow case, and the same things for your hair as we&#x27;ll, too keep up with healthy hair living I change out my hair tie too satin or silk  scrunchie or satin hair ties. You will see a change in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would have given 4 stars, but one has already broken apart.</li>

    <li> This scrunch is fab!  Good material, soft, and well made.  I got one in black, silver gray, and brown - hope I don&#x27;t lose one.</li>

After multiple uses the scrunchy will stretch as my hair grows and have yet to break. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Does not tear rip or pull my hair! I would buy this product again. I wear it to secure my hair at night.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly adequate satin scrunchie... Great for natural ( or any) hair...but definitely overpriced. That being said, I like the product so far.</li>
    <li> These are okay....however, if you happen to be loaded with melanin and likely to add oil to your hair, you should place these into the wash (several times...on delicate or just handwash them) before wearing them. Learn from me. Do not ruin your red blazer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: Feb 20th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, all the scrunchies are stretched beyond repair on the inside. I&#x27;ve never had this happen, and for the price (and the dye) I have to say that I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. Try somewhere else guys, especially if you wrap the scrunchy twice on the regular.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly because it was satin, to use for wearing my hair at night.  The satin is more protective than a regular elastic and I thought this would work out great.  However, I have very thick natural 4b/4c hair and this product does not stretch very well for my liking.  It was a pretty decent price so, I guess I got what I paid for.  Perhaps it would work better for someone with hair that isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
    <li> Be forewarned that the dye for these scrunchies is not colorfast. I had it in my hair and the dye transferred to my beige leather couch. I can not get the stains out of my $1500 couch. The dye has also gotten onto my pillow cases and sheets from sleeping with it. Do not use my most costly purchase here on Amazon. Wish I had never brought.</li>
    <li> Well it works fine I believe I&#x27;ve only had for a few weeks and it ripped some, but all in all it holds my natural hair well.</li>
    <li> Can in about 2 days. Does what I wanted it to do, pull my hair up without damage. It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly, frizzy hair. I can wrap this hair tie 4 times without struggle. It surprisingly doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hair, unless loosely wrapped. But that&#x27;s obvious with any hair tie and it arrived on time, HOWEVER, I haven&#x27;t even used it for a whole week yet and the stitchings are coming apart. It&#x27;s not worth 4.00 if it comes apart that easily. I&#x27;ve had other satin hair ties that hold up A LOT better than these.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s a ridiculous price for one scrunchie. especially when you can get 5 in Walmart for a little over 2 bucks. I understand its satin and all but doesn&#x27;t mean you get to rip people off. Could be the knock-off satin which is not even that expensive. Anyways on to the next one.</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of hair this thing breaks down under stress. Not recommended for my thick haired sisters and brothers.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find satin srunchies locally for some reason, so I&#x27;m glad that I found these online even if they are a bit pricey for a scrunchie. I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t snag on my hair. Even the non metal ouchless elastics snag on hair (not badly, but still, they do). I have thin hair so this scrunchie is great for not pulling out any strands, and I like that it makes my buns and styles a bit fuller looking because I have black hair and order the black scrunchie. These are one of my hair staples!</li>
    <li> This scrunchie is horrible! I used it after washing my hair before I went to sleep, and the next morning I realized there were black stains all over my white satin pillowcase and it took my a few minutes to realize that the color was coming from the scrunchie! Just poor quality, threw it out immediately!</li>
