      <li>Love these cloths!</li>
      <li>Love them!  </li>
      <li>and they really do a great job of getting the oil off and lightly exfoliating.</li>

      <li>The cloths are perfect for gentle and effective face exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>Great and light and easy for packing when I travel.</li>
      <li>The good thing about these inexpensive cloths is that they travel super easy!</li>
      <li>I am paying more than 6 dollars.</li>
      <li>However, if I had more money sitting around I would buy eve lom.</li>
      <li>and I have enjoyed using them as an alternative to face scrubs</li>
      <li>I does the job very well and washes great.</li>
      <li>After ordering, I saw that its going to come from overseas and going to take more than a month to reach me</li>
      <li>I LOVE taking my makeup off with these for exfoliation as well.</li>
      <li>These clothes may have been cheap, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as nice.</li>
      <li>I was sure that it would take a while to get these</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Excellent product at a fraction of the price for similar sold as luxury beauty.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the purchase!!</li>
      <li>This item was never received x2 tries - might be good, but don&#x27;t buy from \\&quot;epower mall\\&quot;!!</li>
      <li>but they came very quickly</li>
      <li>Better than I thought great price love the pink stitched edges</li>
      <li>I feel that they clean just as good as my Clarisonic and Foreo - and I can tell when I test a new cleansing product by using Clinique&#x27;s toner with a cotton pad.</li>
      <li>, they felt cheap and looked cheap after 1 wash.</li>
      <li>did not pay attention to the measurements in the description but for the cheap price of these...</li>
      <li>These Cotton Facial Cleansing Muslin Cloth are great for removing all your makeup.</li>
      <li>Wash them first!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using them to remove makeup at the end of the day and they are incredibly soft, do the job well, and wash up nicely.</li>
      <li>They are not as soft as many muslin clothes</li>
      <li>Just the right weight and feel  </li>
      <li>but the price certainly reflects that!</li>
      <li>They are not as fine and soft as the Liz Earle</li>
      <li>They do a good job of getting all the gunk off while simultaneously providing a little exfoliation.</li>
      <li>The shipping took some time, but as they were coming from overseas, I was aware of that fact before buying them.</li>
      <li>I then take the wet and warm cloth and rinse my face.</li>
      <li>Love these facial clothes.</li>
      <li>I really like these cloths!</li>
      <li>I wonder how many neg comments have not been posted because they were removed, like my initial attempt was.</li>
      <li>I use another one for my  body which does a better job of exfoliating than my lofah leaving my skin smooth and isnt harsh like my scrub brush</li>
      <li>They are very soft but, clean your face very well.</li>
      <li>Smelled a little funky upon receipt, but they washed nicely and work beautifully- much gentler on my face than a washcloth!</li>
      <li>and they hold up very well after washing.</li>
      <li>Also comes out very wrinkled</li>
      <li>Massage, wait a minute, then soak one of these cloths in warm/hot water, then use it to gently wipe away all the makeup, dirt, and grime of the day.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really like these</li>
      <li>Gentle, efficient, and wash well.</li>
      <li>I like these so much</li>
      <li>They come from China but shipping was fast and without problems.</li>
      <li>The cute packaging they came in suggest to me they were meant to be reuseable baby wipes, and they would definitely be soft enough to use on an infant if your purpose was cloth diapering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always wipe clean with the 3 aforementioned cleaning tools.</li>
      <li>One thing I like is that that dry very quickly.</li>
      <li>I would suggest not to waste your money on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Going to joaan will be better.</li>
      <li>These muslin cloths I can use longer because they dry to quickly</li>
      <li>I really love these little cloths!</li>
      <li>While they do work just fine, I will likely be replacing these with a higher-quality muslin facial cloth in the future.</li>
      <li>So I assumed that they must be gentle enough on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It took 6 weeks to get them, but I knew that ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft which makes sense as the package shows a babies smiling face!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are gentle enough for your eye area.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these if you have sensitive skin that also needs a little scrub now and then.</li>
      <li>These gently exfoliate my face which I have notice I have less breakouts and</li>
      <li>Even though they get pretty dirty from mascara and other deeply pigmented products, they have washed very well for me and the stains come off easily, without the need for anything other than regular detergent.</li>

    <li> A little smaller than expected, but my wife said that she could use them.</li>
    <li> I found these looking for Liz Earle muslin cloths. They are not as fine and soft as the Liz Earle but the price certainly reflects that! They actually do the very same job equally as well. My skin can&#x27;t tell the difference, only my hands. And these are larger, making them easier to use. The do soften with use as well. Will be buying more. They come from China but shipping was fast and without problems.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small and flimsy these are.</li>

I like these so much I use another one for my  body which does a better job of exfoliating than my lofah leaving my skin smooth and isnt harsh like my scrub brush &#x3D;o)</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like these, they felt cheap and looked cheap after 1 wash.</li>
    <li> works well and nonirritating</li>
    <li> Great and light and easy for packing when I travel.</li>
    <li> I got them for washing my face to exfoliate without scratching and damaging my skin. I does the job very well and washes great. I&#x27;ve had them for over a year now and they hold up very well after washing.</li>
    <li> I use these for the sole purpose of removing facial masks. They do a good job of getting all the gunk off while simultaneously providing a little exfoliation. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I was sure that it would take a while to get these but they came very quickly and I have enjoyed using them as an alternative to face scrubs (did you know they use PLASTIC microbeads in face wash?) and bathcloths. I just use it with my Liz Earle cleanser, rinse well and hang it up for the next use. After a week I throw it in the washer with the towels. I would highly recommend these if you have sensitive skin that also needs a little scrub now and then.</li>
    <li> The cloths are perfect for gentle and effective face exfoliating.  Love them!  One thing I like is that that dry very quickly. With face wash cloths I am always washing them because they take too long to dry and can get mildewy.  These muslin cloths I can use longer because they dry to quickly and so no worry of mildew.</li>
    <li> They got to me sooner than I expected, about a week after I ordered. I&#x27;ve been using them when I oil cleanse and they really do a great job of getting the oil off and lightly exfoliating. They wash up great. Love them.</li>
    <li> I bought these when a family member mistakenly threw out my Elizabeth Arden muslin cloth that I had received in a Birchbox. In this case, you definitely get what you pay for. While these aren&#x27;t horrible, and definitely are suitable for face washing and other needs, the lesser quality is definitely apparent. While they do work just fine, I will likely be replacing these with a higher-quality muslin facial cloth in the future.</li>

    <li> Ive brought these facial cloths before, i like using these to cleanse my face.  They are the size of wash cloths.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought great price love the pink stitched edges</li>
    <li> These muslin cloths are great for the price.  They are not as soft as many muslin clothes but they do a good job of removing makeup when used with a cleaning oil.  I soak them in warm water while I wash my face with the cleaning oil.  I then take the wet and warm cloth and rinse my face.</li>
    <li> Smelled like the were soaked in petroleum.  Was seriously afraid to use them end up putting them in the trash.</li>
    <li> These Cotton Facial Cleansing Muslin Cloth are great for removing all your makeup. They are very soft but, clean your face very well.</li>
    <li> This item was never received x2 tries - might be good, but don&#x27;t buy from \\&quot;epower mall\\&quot;!! I wonder how many neg comments have not been posted because they were removed, like my initial attempt was.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a fraction of the price for similar sold as luxury beauty.  Gentle, efficient, and wash well.</li>
    <li> I do not know how to describe the product. After ordering, I saw that its going to come from overseas and going to take more than a month to reach me I went ahead and tried to cancel the item. I wrote an email to the seller explaining the issue. the seller was understanding and he refunded me my money back. But he said that the product was already shipped.&lt;br /&gt;well after receiving the product, I still thought of giving it a try. I went ahead and open the packaging. Everything was written in Japanese. Because I know Japanese I could read everything. These small muslin cloths are actually cotton cloths that are used for wiping baby&#x27;s nose. So I assumed that they must be gentle enough on my sensitive skin. They are just okey. There it costs 250 yen to buy these here in united states I am paying more than 6 dollars. So basically, I am just paying for the shipping. I would suggest not to waste your money on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Going to joaan will be better.</li>
    <li> These are very thin and small. They shrank after washing.  They are still usable, but would prefer something thicker and bigger.</li>
    <li> It took 6 weeks to get them, but I knew that ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft which makes sense as the package shows a babies smiling face!&lt;br /&gt;I did not pay attention to the measurements in the description but for the cheap price of these...it doesn&#x27;t matter!&lt;br /&gt;I can hand-wash and re-use these for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> I want to buy a cheaper muslin cloth instead of the EVE LOM, I have too say this is not  what I expect. I feel it is not only made by cotton. I do not recommend to buy it for face.</li>
    <li> Love these facial clothes. Just the right weight and feel  They ship via slow boat from china (literally) so be patient</li>
    <li> Smelled a little funky upon receipt, but they washed nicely and work beautifully- much gentler on my face than a washcloth!</li>
    <li> Great for washing your face and probably babies also. Wash them first!!</li>
    <li> Too thin and shrunk in the wash to an irregular shape. Also comes out very wrinkled and I don&#x27;t intend on ironing washcloths.</li>
    <li> I bought these muslin clothes after using eve lom and wanted to see if there was a cheaper alternative. These clothes may have been cheap, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as nice. The material is extremely thin, I actually have to use 2 cloths layered together to wash my face. It still gets the job done however, I would buy these again because I&#x27;m on a budget. However, if I had more money sitting around I would buy eve lom.</li>
    <li> The cloths were too small &amp; too thin! Will return them!</li>
    <li> I was beyond happy to find Muslin Cloths for this price. I LOVE taking my makeup off with these for exfoliation as well. I am even happier with the quality of these cloths once received. Absolutely worth the purchase!!</li>
