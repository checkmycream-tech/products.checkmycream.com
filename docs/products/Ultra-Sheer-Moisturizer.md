      <li>Safe to use after spa facials or if you use Retin A.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Loves this product, light weight and works great with the TNS serum.  Good purchase and cheaper here than at the Dr. office.</li>
    <li> Light yet penetrative!  It won&#x27;t clog pores!! Sheer but makes your skin feel well hydrated. Just right for humid days and summer.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I tend to breakout when using other products, but not with this one. It is non-greasy, great for acne-prone individuals. You can also mix it in with a non-greasy sun block and you will find the perfect balance for mornings. At night I wear it after using a face wash and my skin feels smooth and soft. Highly recommended. I will continue buying despite the price for as long as manufactured.</li>
    <li> Great, non pore clogging moisturizer. But, for the money.....Cetaphil moisturizer works and looks even better/thinner when you put it on, and it is about 1/100th of the price.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is the only one I have found that doesn&#x27;t feel thick, greasy or break my skin out. I have combination skin that is often very oily but also sensitive and breaks out easily. I will never try another face moisturizer now that I&#x27;ve found this one. It&#x27;s lightweight, has no scent and provides the perfect amount of moisture.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.who wants a shiney face? Not me! Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t take much so that means it last longer. We all know  that means your dollar last longer.WIN-WIN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years. Oil free and I don&#x27;t breakout from it and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My face feels soft and like I was a youngster again.&lt;br /&gt;My husband always tells me that my skin is so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this in the past and will always stick with it!</li>
    <li> Use it for my oily skin and works perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this as a moisturizer in the spring, summer &amp; fall, because it&#x27;s just right for my skin.  Now that it&#x27;s winter in Minnesota, the air in my home and work place is much more drying and this isn&#x27;t quite doing the trick -  so perfect for summer, not enough for winter in my opinion.  What I love is that I never break out from this and most moisturizers make my skin react with rash or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have shied away from facial moisturizers all my life because one way or another they would make me break out, make my face feel like a grease pit, or both.  I am 44 years old and have finally found the perfect moisturizer.  It is simply the best and cannot imagine finding anything like this from any other company.</li>
    <li> I love this gentle day moisturizer because it is one of the few that don&#x27;t make my sensitive skin red. Safe to use after spa facials or if you use Retin A. Also makes a great nighttime moisturizer in summer or to alternate with a heavier moisturizer during winter months.</li>
    <li> I have a blemish-prone skin so it gives me peace of mind knowing that it won&#x27;t clog my pores. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I can layer it on as much as I please and it still doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product is an oil-free moisturizer for the face and neck that I can&#x27;t live without!  The Skin Medica line is sold in my spa/salon and I am so happy with all of their products.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand that this is for oily skin.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you have dry skin because that&#x27;s what I did, and it seems to actually dry my skin out more than not using it.  I have not been very pleased with any of the skin medica items I bought.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I suppose this would be ideal during summer months, but I didn&#x27;t love it. It felt very, very light on my skin - to the point where it didn&#x27;t feel like I had just put moisturizer on. I think for the price there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> Perfect for oil-sensible skin. The texture is great and I feel my face clean.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than other most expensive creams that I tried.</li>
    <li> It is one of the many products I buy from skin medica and I am always satisfied with their excellent products.</li>
    <li> fast shipping.  doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
    <li> if you have combination skin, I think Cereve is better and a lot cheaper! I do not use this anymore because it does not moisturize enough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of skinmedica.  I&#x27;ve used their products for over a year now, and find that this is my favorite moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not too greasy, and I can use it under makeup or alone.  I get chemical peels and microderms every now and then, and I need a moisturizer that I know won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, works great on my combination dry/oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s worth every penny. The lotion on my face feel s great and never breaks me out. I use it every day under my make-up. I totally recommend this product line!</li>
