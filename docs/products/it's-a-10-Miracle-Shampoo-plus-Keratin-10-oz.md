<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the only problem it did not bring the receipt</li>
    <li> It was okay. It was rather hard to lather up though. Hair dresser recommended it.</li>
    <li> Drys my hair out...not impressed....</li>
    <li> Love Love Love Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I love the whole It&#x27;s a 10 line. This shampoo is gentle, has a great fresh smell, and leaves my hair soft. It also helps with the flyaways. I am really glad that I tried this. Also try their leave-in sprays and serums. My hair is very fine, and I normally have trouble with product making my hair greasy. This product has never done that. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but instead of buying six different types of products to find the right one, I can just spend the money on this one.</li>
    <li> Smelled great and did awesome things for my hair, like made it smoother and softer. Really liked this shampoo and when I get the money, I&#x27;ll order some more!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I had tried everything and was at my wits end because I had not chemically treated my hair, blown dry, or used a flat iron on it, yet it was dry and had no body. Because my hair is so fine all conditioners would weight it down and that caused it to look flat but this shampoo makes my hair look good. So I thank you,</li>
    <li> This is fantastic used with rinse out conditioner!! Big diff in hair!</li>
    <li> A good shampoo for fine hair and great scent.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair :( thinking about buying the conditioner and maybe the two will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
    <li> Very expensive, not a lot of results but I still used it for 1 1/2 years before accidentally finding Tresemme Platinum Strength shampoo and conditioner.  The results are day and night! I love my hair! Save your money, go to Walmart. Look better. Feel better.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for literally super dry hair like mine. I wish I was advised strongly to buy earlier. Thank you my hairdresser. This shampoo is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t increase the price. Thank you for making this product!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that&#x27;s been damaged by coloring over the years, this shampoo gives my hair the health and life it needs. I am in love with this line. Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 Shampoo Plus Keratin. I usually can go 2-3 days without washing my hair, which is great because the shampoo lasts longer! I also use It&#x27;s a 10 Conditioner and I absolutely love them. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use another Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I color my hair and it doesn&#x27;t fade at all. I highly recommend this shampoo. It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo  foams up so your hair feels clean but not stripped. For a sulfate free shampoo this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t afford this stuff but I buy it anyway and just get less groceries because it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> Just received my It&#x27;s a 10. I love the product used this a.m. and my hair is so soft and shining.  Woukd totally recommended this to all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. won&#x27;t use anyrhing else on my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and I absolutely love it!!! I have thick, long hair. Using this made it much smoother and softer than before. It really does what it says. My hair feels so clean and I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This really is &amp;#34;miracle shampoo&amp;#34;! I have very dry coarse bleach damaged frizzy hair.  Tried so many different brands, some of them very expensive and none of them made a difference.  and then a friend who has gorgeous hair (and flat irons hers every single day) recommended this - I can&#x27;t stress how much I LOVE this product.  the difference is night and day since first use!!! my hair is silky, beautiful and shiny and smells sooo good! I use this with the miracle conditioner and the leave-in conditioner.  If I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair, it airdries into beautiful curls and doesn&#x27;t frizz at all which used to be a huge problem for me.  Most days I flat iron my hair and it looks absolutely beautiful.  I recommend this 100%. so glad I found this product.  You will need to use the conditioners for best results though.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of It&#x27;s A 10 products loudly enough.  I&#x27;m madly in love with them.  They smell amazing, they give fantastic results, and they cost is very reasonable in my book.  I doubly love them because my very fair and fragile skinned, red headed daughter is very sensitive to shampoos and other suds producing products and will often have a horrendous eczema episode with new products, but she has had not a single issue with anything from It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive  salon brands and I always go back to it&#x27;s a 10. I have keratin treated hair and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out the keratin. My hair is much smoother/less frizzy when I use this shampoo than other more expensive brands. My shampoo was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> BEST Shampoo EVER. It&#x27;s that simple. I have straight, fine hair - like straw - which means that after a day it gets greasy and heavy, so I need to shampoo daily. When you shampoo daily, you need to style daily. When you&#x27;ve been  shampooing your hair daily and bleaching it for 15 years like I have, it&#x27;s accumulated some damage. Since it&#x27;s so limp and straight - and dry - I have blow dried it every morning to liven it up. To them calm it down and smooth it out, I flat iron it...every...morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 years of bleaching, plus shampooing, blow drying, and flat ironing. Every. Morning. I thought I would be stuck in this cycle for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after JUST ONE USE of this shampoo? I miraculously don&#x27;t have to blow dry or flat iron my hair anymore! I wash and condition (I even just use  the blue Herbal Essences conditioner, nothing fancy), brush my hair, then let it air dry, and voila! It&#x27;s magic in a bottle. I don&#x27;t even care if it&#x27;s sulfate free or if it&#x27;s full of chemicals, because anything that can make my hair do this is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Smells delish!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for the first time. A friend of mine recommended it and I know it has Keratine so that is a good thing. So far so good</li>
    <li> Works as described. Great product for hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims,smells great,requires little amount of product to give a nice lather and wash. I love it</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  recommend it</li>
    <li> smells a bit funny..seems to work on keeping the hair less frizzy</li>
    <li> I was excited to try It&#x27;s a 10 after it was recommended to me by my hair stylist but was left extremely dissapointed in the end. I used to have beautiful healthy hair,but after continuous box dyes and trying ombre hair (bleach doesnt do so well with box dye treated hair),my hair was left dry and flat,the volume I used to have was no longer present and strands of hair continuously fell out whenever I&#x27;d comb my hair or shower. I&#x27;d heard of this brand before and after reading a few positive reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I bought the Miracle Conditioner along this and although it was pricy I went along with it because my hair was just so damaged I needed help ASAP. Anywho,after my first wash I noticed it had a very strong,cheap perfume-like smell. It was so strong I had a headache for a while and my nose never quite got adjusted to it. Fair enough,for almost $40 I thought I&#x27;d just deal with it as long as it helped my hair. I didnt notice it any softer than usual at first,but after a few washes I noticed my hair getting much more shiny and less of it was falling out. The smell also faded away so I was pretty content,though my hair never really had that silky smooth feel unless I used a cream from another brand. Fast forward 2 weeks and I notice that my hair is looking a bit healthier,but not healthy enough for what I paid. My ends where my ombre is were getting dryer rather than healthier and my hair was still flat,the only nice thing was the shine. If anything my roots were the ones in glory,feeling like a silky blanket lol. Fast forward another week,my hair starts losing its shine,my hair is falling out more and more,theres no elasticity and now more of my hair is feeling dry,not just the bleached ends. To top it off I also started getting an itchy scalp. By this point Im upset,I waisted a good amount of money on this and the conditioner was nearly used up while the shampoo is still halfway full. I shouldve stopped at this point,but I wasnt just gonna throw my money away like that. I sucked it up and used up all of it. Bad choice. By the time I finished it,I had EXTREMELY bad dandruff,my hair was dry,lifeless and brittle. I couldnt even comb my hair without flakes showing and everytime I wore a hat,beanie or even my hood my hair would get messy and flakes were everywhere. Thank the heavens for Head &amp; Shoulders,that thing works miracles and left my hair feeling and looking better than this product ever did. I have never tried a product as awful as this one and I dont recommend it to anybody unless youre looking to waste your money on something that has a 50/50 chance of working. If you&#x27;re really willing to pay big bucks for a good shampoo,conditioner or even hair products then I&#x27;d reccoment CHI. Their products smell great,make your hair not only shine and make your hair soft as a babies bottom but also help repair your hair without the dandruff. Moral of this review: dont buy this product unless you wanna have a bad time.y away like that. I sucked it up and used up all of it. Bad choice.

    <li> I heard about this from a friend who has very light blonde hair and I can&#x27;t be any happier with it!! I&#x27;ve had problems with other shampoos sucking the life out of my hair. This one makes my hair feel healthy, soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does great job for my hair. I have well water and it seems to work well with it. My hair seems to have more shine and not as much split ends, ( I blow dry and iron/straighten). I also enjoy the smell which lasts a over a day.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly in good condition. Great for color treated hair. Best shampoo I have ever tried. No allergic reaction which is a true plus</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I was skeptical to purchase hair products online, but I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only did this product arrive on time and in great condition, but it&#x27;s also much cheaper than purchasing it in a store or salon. This product does wonders for my hair, I just wish they sold the conditioner in the same size bottle. It makes me hair very smooth and soft, and very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo.. my hair feels like silk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most top brand salon shampoos and this one, especially the brand &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;, ranks right up there as one of the best.  The shine and manageability is awesome!</li>
    <li> Actually, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> It definitely worth it. Leaves hair shiny, soft and stronger. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks and I loved it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo! It exceeded my expectations by a long shot. My hair is usually pretty flat and I can&#x27;t get a lot of volume, I usually have to use shampoo AND conditioner because just using shampoo makes my hair look oily. Well, I tried just shampoo in this case and it really is a miracle! My hair was full, non oily, and super soft for 2 days! I can never usually pull off wearing my hair down for 2 days straight after washing the day before...but with this I was able to! I love it! I will definitely be checking out other \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; products!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels after I wash it. I am also seeing new hair growth since I started using It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
    <li> No matter how much I tried to rinse it out, this always left a weird residue in my hair, and my hair (which is slightly prone to greasiness, as it is fine and mostly straight) would be coated in grease within 12 hours of washing.</li>
    <li> Not really a miracle.  Also nothing wrong with it.  I didn&#x27;t see anything magical happen to my hair (long, wavy, dry), but it didn&#x27;t mess it up either. I am sticking with the shampoos that make me see magic.</li>
    <li> My scalp itches like crazy every time I use this shampoo. At first I thought I just had to get use to it, but nope. After 3 wks I still was itchy and had the worst dandruf ever.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that tangles very easily.  With It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo, I hardly have to use conditioner.  It is not too heavy, and makes my hair shiny without being greasy.  Love it, I will order more when it runs out!</li>
    <li> i have been wanting that salon feel and i have it now. i am very very picky with shampoo. i end up using the stuff i hate for bubble bath or giving it to friends with dogs so that they can use it on their next dog wash. i have long red hair and live in an arid environment. i get a lot of split ends due to the dry weather and sun, even my leg hairs get split ends. but this stuff has transformed my hair. i use two pumps every two days. sometimes three if i am feeling grungy after a hike. i also use a good  conditioner, but supplement with the 10 min.  leave in product afterward or any time in between. i squeeze out the water , apply and work in. good suds. great feel and no need to wash every day if you have dry hair. doesn&#x27;t leave it limp and this supplier is so much cheaper than anyone else by many dollars. got the shipment fast and would order again. i got two bottles and a month later i still am only a quarter of the way through. i went through regular shampoo much faster. get this. you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has fixed my split ends and flyaway hair.  I highly recommend this product!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of professional hair products. My mil has her cosmetology license, so we get all the products wholesale. I have tried tons of things, even the popular Moroccan Oil. But Its a 10 keratin is the best!!! I was my hair every other day. I have long hair that tends to be greasy at the roots. This non lathering shampoo helps me get 2 days between washes and saves my color. YAY!!!! This is worth every penny. I use it, the conditioner, the leave in and the oil (only as needed.) Try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry! :)  Just a note on use... Saturate your hair with cool water first, then start rubbing it into the scalp, then to your ends. It does not lather so you have to really work it in. :)</li>
    <li> I have notice a remarkable difference since starting the 10 Miracle shampoo, this product works.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. I spent the last 6 months in a salon going from dark brown to light blonde successfully. And what was it that finally caused damage? A silly little toner. No joke. So, my hair was in a rough state. I&#x27;ve been using Pureology, Argan Oil, coconut oil, and a bunch of other ridiculously expensive product and just haven&#x27;t been able to get my hair back to the healthy state it was in before this final toner sealed my fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; 1 time. That&#x27;s it. Once. And my hair is AMAZING. It&#x27;s super soft, the elasticity is SO much better. There&#x27;s movement. It&#x27;s shiny. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this bottle but and I don&#x27;t really care. It could be distilled tears from angel babies that were collected by Gandolf himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wizard magic. I&#x27;m convinced.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian &amp; have med length (below shoulders), coarse, thick hair that is naturally frizzy and wavy. Love this product - turns my hair into a soft, manageable, silky mane. I use this and the Miracle Silk Conditioner, the It&#x27;s a 10 keratin leave in, then dry hair, straighten hair, and use large hot rollers (routine takes a while, but worth it to me). This product smells nice and works. I am a product junkie and try any/everything. This is one of the few products I have purchased twice. Also, it is sulfate-free so does not lather like a normal shampoo (don&#x27;t be alarmed) &amp; is safe for hair with Brazilian blow-outs or Keratin treatments. If you get a bottle that seems watered-down, this is not the right product. It should be thicker - consistency of a normal high-end salon shampoo. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This works well but only if you don&#x27;t over do. A little goes a long way. I have fine hair,so I find if I spray it into my fingers and then just apply it to the very tips of my hair before drying it works best. But if you forget to apply before drying you can do the same thing to your dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily or slick it just adds moisture and your ends don&#x27;t look all dried out. Nice product.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Great for post pregnancy dry and dull hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and especially love the price on Amazon ! 😉 It makes my hair so easy to blow dry after using this product !</li>
    <li> I loved the original It&#x27;s a 10 product.  Unfortunately, they stopped making it.  I tried this one, but didn&#x27;t like it as well.</li>
    <li> NOT like any other shampoo.  Be prepared---this does not suds very much at all.  However, my hair turns out like I just came from the salon every time.  This shampoo is a game changer---my color lasts longer, my hair is smooth, thick, healthy.  Really different.  I was using Pureology shampoos and conditioners---which are great.  But, this product is better for the health and behavior of my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my hair is cleaner and softer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff or how they make it, but it is outstanding!  Leaves my hair super soft and shiny, and helps protect it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and I can already see a huge difference in my hair. I just bleached the tips of my hair recently and after using this, my hair is so soft and bouncy. Used in combination with the It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Hair mask.</li>
    <li> This shampoo gets my hair clean, does not make me itch, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and comes in an attractive bottle which I shall reuse. What more could I ask.  Oh, and the keritin is good for my hair too.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not worth the price!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It lathers so well with just 2 pumps for my medium length hair!  The entire &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; system is great if you straighten your hair using a blow dryer.  Also, if you color your hair, you will have less color fading using this system.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, really cleans my hair without leaving it all tangled. Feels silky in my hair like it&#x27;s actually smoothing the strands.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo.  Added volume to my thin hair along with the moisturizer.  Something I needed to help my hair look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; of my hair since using it.</li>
    <li> I have been spending so much money on shampoo you buy from the salon. This stuff works so much better then any shampoo I have every purchased!</li>
    <li> I just want to start by saying that I love the smell of this shampoo. Also, is it me or does it not foam up as easily as the other shampoos? Using this product in combination with the conditioner and leave-in treatment my hair is finally looking healthy again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really well but it does not lather well. I love their conditioner and other products. I was a little disappointed int he shampoo.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I just had regular hair, now I have extensions.  I still use this shampoo and it is awesome!  I have frizzy hair and this shampoo is gentle and helps me have super shiny bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with static and frizz, especially in the winter.  The 10 Miracle Shampoo and Leave in Conditioner take care of this problem.</li>
    <li> Nice smell.  Still too early to see a result, but i like the way it cleans my hair.</li>
    <li> great product line, great prices at amazon. makes my older hair feel silky smooth and full again when used with the leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have lots of breakage and thought this shampoo would help my hair. It does not. As a matter of fact, it seams that more hair comes out when I use it. I tried to compare with my husbands head and shoulder shampoo, and I lost half the hair with his shampoo. I think I will never buy this shampoo again. It does nothing for my hair. I loss about 100 hair strands with it each time.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells awesome and leaves a smooth touch.very happy</li>
    <li> Hair looked nice, but it irritated my scalp so much I had to go to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Bought this product at a salon on the advice of my hair dresser.  My hair is heavily processed blonde and often feels like straw after shampooing.  My hair felt smoother and less straw-like after only one shampoo.  I still need to condition my hair and followed up with It&#x27;s a 10 Silk Miracle Conditioner.  My hair is now silky, shiny, and looks healthy.  I am a very happy customer.  :)</li>
    <li> love this shampoo.. smells great and my hair looks fantastic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s top rated on my scale. It leaves your hair polished and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I use all the products now. Great.</li>
    <li> I started a couple of years ago using the Wen shampoo. Sudless is better and helps use color less on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found several other shampoos that are also sudless and make my hair feel and look great. 10 Miracle shampoo is a great product to use.</li>
    <li> I love these products, they are wonderful for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. I am very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> NICE PRODUCT THAT HAD A NICE NEW PH EFFECT ON MY HAIR. I HAVE BEEN USING NEXUS PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS,&lt;br /&gt;AND NOW I ALTERNATE EACH ONE EVERY OTHER DAY.</li>
    <li> I have fine but thicker long blonde hair that gets frizzy without proper care.  I highlight regularly and get a Keratin treatment every summer with great results.  After using this for 2 months (3-4x a week) I have a record amount of breakage around my whole hair line.  Also my Keratin treatment declined rapidly after only a couple shampoos (usually it&#x27;s much more gradual).  I&#x27;ve changed nothing in my life other than this product (same hairdryer, processing, diet, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to &amp;#34;Keratin Complex&amp;#34; shampoo and &amp;#34;Redkin All Soft&amp;#34; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Kerastate Nectar Thermique&amp;#34; throughout but it wasn&#x27;t enough to protect from this damaging product.&lt;br /&gt;Truly shocked at the good reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if most of the reviewers have been using terrible products their whole life and anything with keratin is a step up?</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair really soft. Prior to using this I was having a lot of tangling and snarls. Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the silkiness of it!! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Just like the rest of It&#x27;s a 10 products this one works great!</li>
    <li> Just ok. Nothing spectacular for me. I like the scent but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look any better than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love this product. Really works wonders on my phone. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what keratin is or what it does but i saw an article online saying i needed it and this product had good reviews so i bought it. i don&#x27;t know what it does, if anything, but i did notice more compliments about my hair and more women wanted to play with it so i consider that a win!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works really well on my hair. I&#x27;ve got straight long hair &amp; it leaves it looking amazing - love the it&#x27;s a 10 line!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a good choice if your hair is damaged. My hair is fine, oily at the roots and dry at the ends. I use this about twice a week and put sparingly on my scalp and rinse it extra long at the roots. It is sticky if I don&#x27;t. It smells good and the dry ends of my hair seem to soak up that extra moisture. So I would recommend this if you have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally coarse, long thick hair that is prone to breakage due to getting regular highlights over the past decade. I&#x27;ve tried tons or products, supplements, masques, keratin treatments and serums. This has made the biggest difference so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using this shampoo, I noticed my hair felt smoother and stronger, almost like I didn&#x27;t need conditioner. I&#x27;d used wen before, this was like a more extreme &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; outcome but my scalp actually felt clean. It takes about 9 pumps for my hair. I followed up with alterna conditioner, but I may switch to its a 10 conditioner after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for about 3 weeks, I went to get a trim and highlights today. Both my stylist and another stylist who was between appts commented on how healthy my hair looked - I had never gotten that before! will definitely buy agsin</li>
    <li> Like this shampoo, helps smooth and condition my hair but recommend it be used with the conditioner to get full benefit.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been in such great shape since I discovered it&#x27;s a 10 2 years ago . Try it, you will see a big change in the health if your hair . Smells great too .</li>
    <li> I Love all its a 10 products! Always makes my hair soft and easy to brush! Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the 10 deep conditioner and I love the healthy, conditioned, silky, straighter effect - it smells great too!  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I use a small amount and still get a controlled healthy look.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I believe it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  My hair feels amazing after using this shampoo.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> To everyone complaining about how this doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s not suppose to that&#x27;s the point it&#x27;s sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. The lathering a lot of the other reviews talk about cause that&#x27;s what they want it is a shampoo that lathers, well that&#x27;s what damages your hair and is not good for it. It&#x27;d be nice if some people who post reviews new a thing or two about hair and hair products. I have very long hair past my mid back and it&#x27;s medium thickness with slight damage from hot styling tools and is naturally wavy/curly and have never had a bad experience with this shampoo I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t lather and it does what it says, for new people using it, it may take a week to see results but I feel it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Man, what a waste of money. Loved the conditioner so I was excited to try out their shampoo but it left so much build up in my hair and made it so greasy.</li>
    <li> Perfect pairing with the conditioner. Its hard for me to find conditioner and shampoo that works well for my fine hair, but these really are great.</li>
    <li> The best! I had just the shampoo and it made a HUGE difference since the first wash and my hair is dry and fine and difficult!</li>
    <li> Notice a difference in my hair within 3 days.  I will not buy anything else.  It is pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift and my recipient is very pleased with it. She uses it regualr and it makes such a difference.</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying out my hair. I love this shampoo but it&#x27;s a little more expensive than it should be.</li>
    <li> Fast and prompt shipment of product.  Only one or two pumps cleanses hair well.  Leaves my hair very manageable too.&lt;br /&gt;would order again  . five stars.</li>
    <li> The combination of shampoo and leave in conditioner works miracles.  This makes your hair smooth, silky and shiny.  Even my hairdresser commented on the texture.</li>
    <li> I have used many &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products and this one is a big disappointment.  I normally use sulfate free shampoos because I highlight my hair and I don&#x27;t like Parabens, but I thought I would try this based on the reviews.  It was horrible.  My hair was greasy AND frizzy all at the same time.  I used less than was recommended (I have medium length hair) and that same day my hair was fly away and frizzy (it was 25 degrees and no humidity) and the next day I needed to wash my hair.  I cannot recommend this shampoo at all.</li>
    <li> This shampoo contains sodium chloride - a salt, which strips out keratin. Almost ruined my new keratin treatment.  Also has questionable sulfates in it. May work on regular hair, but would not use it after keratin treatment even though it states it contains keratin.  Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 produces remarkable products.</li>
    <li> Many reviews have said this is an amazing product. I did realize that my hair has gotten more healthier. The only downside of this product is that I&#x27;m not used to the shampoo texture. It doesn&#x27;t feel soap-y. Great product afterall! :)</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s just like getting a gloss treatment at a salon.  I highly recommend its a ten with keratin.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap shampoo and makse my hair frizzy. I wouldn&#x27;t trust the reviews here.  I am going back to my regular shampoo for sure.</li>
    <li> We use of this shampoo plus the condtioner your hair will very softly, heathy and very shine so I recomend it because you could use with the blower as well with the iron.</li>
    <li> I rate a 5 start because i love the product! My hair feels smoother and i the price is right!</li>
    <li> I bought this as recommended by my hair stylist for a Keratin treatment. It is worth investing in a good product as I had invested in the keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> i wasnt expecting to love this stuff, but now i find myself unable to settle for my old favorites...&lt;br /&gt;if you cant afford to buy it, dont try it, because youll go into debt. its addictingy wonderful. works flawlessly. my hair feels natural!</li>
    <li> I get an expensive keratin treatment about every 12 weeks to straighten my hair. The keratin shampoo recommended by the salon was expensive and stunk. It&#x27;s a 10 keratin shampoo is wonderful at maintaining the keratin treatment and I like the way it smells, but it&#x27;s not a scented shampoo. Using It&#x27;s a 10 has allowed me to go 4-5 months between keratin treatments at the salon. I follow the shampoo with a couple of spritzes of the It&#x27;s a 10 Keratin leave-in conditioner. I was introduced to this product at a salon in another city and couldn&#x27;t find the products locally. I was delighted to find It&#x27;s a 10 on Amazon, and at a better price than the salon&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to the reviews, but just makes my hair gunky. If I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time great price</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and works well with leave in product by same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Ain&#x27;t no miracle girls.</li>
    <li> i am a loyal &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; user. i like the way this shampoo works</li>
    <li> I was told that it would keep my hair color in, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be true. My color was stripped and my hair looked like straw, with way too much frizz. I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> I love it, it made my hair feel really smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling dry</li>
    <li> This product, along with the plus keratin conditioner, is great, but a bit pricy. I will be trying other, cheaper brands of plus keratin shampoos and conditioners to see if this is really worth the price.</li>
    <li> I thank the Ulta store in Jackson TN consultants for recommending me this hair care and &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products. I bought the full set and very happy with it. I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much.  This product gave me silky, healthy-looking hair and I highly recommend it....and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, actually works. I get knots in my hair from using barrets. This takes them out even if a shower and conditioner don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! And I can&#x27;t return it! :(</li>
    <li> I swim and got this to recondition my hair. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it made my hair feel really soft and nice again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement to my hair since I started using this product last year. It actually leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it makes my hair feel, and It is a good price on amazon.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay anymore for it though.</li>
    <li> Not only does this make my hair feel great, I LOVE the smell. It&#x27;s so fresh smelling that even my fianc&amp;eacute; will come up behind me and nestle his nose in the back of my hair to take in a deep breath. Am a fan of all three products I use from this company</li>
    <li> Once I started using this product, my hair took a turn for the best. No longer looks frizzy. It&#x27;s softer to the touch and works great with my striaghtener to protect it from the heat.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews that this shampoo did not lather. Either they have changed formula or my water is much softer, but I get almost too much lather! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well to clean hair, but leaves my hair very dry.  You definitely have to use with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy, color treated long hair that shampoos would dry out.  I love this product.  It moisturizes, smoothes, cleans, and shines my hair so well, that I keep wondering why this works so much better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on hair care products, but now stick with this line of products exclusively because how healthy my hair looks.  The moisture version without keratin lathers better than this one, but this one really smoothes the cuticle and makes blow drying, flat iron, and curling iron less work on my hair.  Use with the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Conditioner, Leave-In Conditioner, Styling Cream and Shiner, and you&#x27;ll have A 10 beautiful head of hair! My hair is blonde and the new blonde line is really good.  Cant say enough about the attributes of this line.</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp felt vitalized, after using this product. One of the few shampoos that I felt cleansed my hair, without stripping it!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, does wonderful things for my hair. My hair is so soft and clean after using this product, and the frizz is nonexistent! If only it were less expensive!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and how it makes my hair feel. Using the shampoo in conjunction with the conditioner and the leave in conditioner leaves my hair feeling and smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> The best packaged product I&#x27;ve received in a long time.  The shampoo lathers well and leaves hair very manageable and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I paid 4 or 5x more for this little 10oz bottle than I would normally pay for a 16oz. I have long, thin and brittle hair and have been looking to find something to strengthen my hair. This product line is NOT it. I have to use at least 3 pumps of shampoo to get it all throuh my hair. Or at least as much as I can. The stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to want to distribute at all much less evenly. I do like the smell of it but that&#x27;s about it. Not sure what&#x27;s supposed to be so special about it, but with the rave reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it. Big waste of money for me. Maybe my water isn&#x27;t soft enough for it to work the way it should.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time adapting to this shampoo because of lack of lather.  At first, I was disappointed because didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in my hair and I usually love It&#x27;s a 10 products. However, after a couple of weeks using this, I started to notice a big difference in my hair.  I have dry, frizzy, curly hair and began to notice a better shine and less frizz with this shampoo. I use this with the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot! But it came damaged in shipping. The bottle dispenser was broken and product was leaking all over the box.</li>
    <li> The lady does my hair used this product on me and since then I can&#x27;t be without. It leaves my hair soft and light, most of all makes my tangled hair easy to comb. It smells good too when the wind blows it has that spring fresh smell.</li>
    <li> It is just ok. Doesn&#x27;t lather much and it takes about 10 pumps to wash my hair.  Will not last long.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great for hair that HSS been damaged due to heat and over processing. Leaves hair soft and silky looking</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Its A 10  and with the keritan this shampoo makes a big difference in my hair.  Thank you It&#x27;s A 10!</li>
    <li> I bought this recently and it came in the Mail yesterday about 4 days after I purchased it but when I tracked it online it said Estimated Delivery Date: Saturday, January 3,2015 the Bad Thing is what if I was on Vacation and it said that it was estimated then and I came back 4 days later  I find it Stolen, Wet, Etc. I blame that on Amazon along with the Fact that HALF of it Spilled along with the It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Conditioner, 10-Ounces that I also ordered (Came in Same Box) too. So I don&#x27;t trust Amazon for Shipping and Shipping Dates now on. On to the actual Item It works Great... Except it smells like Wet Dog but the Conditioner helps only with the smell though the Conditioner doesn&#x27;t De-tangle or Reduce Frizz like the Bottle Lists and the wherever it came from is so STUPID that the Pump was Broken so I had to unscrew the Lid and dump it in my Hand. And the Shampoo is Horrid when it comes to the Sulfate IT NEEDS SULFATE because when I put the shampoo in my Hand and lathered it on my Hair it felt like barely any Shampoo so I had to put on A LOT of Shampoo and it felt VERY Dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listed Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Opinion in Condition: Used and Broken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Never Buying it again and would NEVER recommend this to a Friend or Enemy!</li>
    <li> This my second order. That tells all.</li>
    <li> I love using the shampoo and conditioner on my hair and scalp.  It makes my hair look healthy and thick again.  I have fine hair and it really has helped with the growth.  I love the fragrance and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Had keratin treatment done on my hair so felt this was appropriate. leave my hair feeling soft and frizz free so i cant complain</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say my hair feels softer, but I can say that my hair is no longer a &amp;#34;freeze bomb&amp;#34; as my husband calls it. haha. Especially when I pair it with the conditioner and leave in conditioner. Based on other reviews, after washing hair, I&#x27;ve put the conditioner all over my hair, tied, and left it over night, The next morning my hair was SOFT!! other reviewers mentioned about leaving the hair in some heated oven or something but I dont have that. So next time I&#x27;m going to wrap it in some aluminum foil and keep it over night. This is supposed to work the same I think I read that somewhere. Anyway, what I normally do is, wash with this shampoo, rinse with conditioner, and spray the leave in conditioner all over my hair then blow dry it. it works beautifully. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I started using it&#x27;s a ten now and I just love everything, the shampoo and leave in is also great. My hair is shinny and soft. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awful shampoo! Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great for detangling hair.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product it helps my treatment last.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SHAMPOO THAT GIVES MY HAIR A HEALTHY FEEL...LITTLE SHAMPOO GOES A LONG WAY .... REALLY SUDSY!!! BUT PRICY!!!</li>
    <li> It works well but the pump is a little hard to manage.  It should come in a tube to squeeze.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Every It&#x27;s a 10 product I have tried has been great.  My hair responds so well to these products.  And you need so little that the price is well worth the quality.</li>
    <li> I adore the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Product Plus Keratin, so I changed from my usual keratin shampoo and conditioner to try this It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin, and it&#x27;s good...but not the best. I&#x27;ll be switching back to my original favorite, Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, but I&#x27;m never getting rid of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In, cause that stuff seriously changes your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo was good, it does make hair smoother and a bit shinier, more manageable. I should explain that I&#x27;ve got a white-girl &#x27;fro happening whenever I wash my hair with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; products, and I&#x27;ve learned over time to manage it. This shampoo is definitely a vast improvement to washing my hair with normal shampoo, but it&#x27;s not quite as great as it could be. The hair is less weighed down, which can be good, but the ends tend to be a bit fly-away, though not truly static frizzy, with this shampoo. Overall, it&#x27;s very good, but not good enough to de-throne the Suave Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard already, if you have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s best to &amp;#34;co-wash,&amp;#34; as they call it. Put conditioner in your hair FIRST, on dry hair even, if you can manage it, and leave it in for at least a few minutes. I put conditioner on, finish the rest of my shower routine, and as the very last step, I use shampoo on my hair (just the roots/crown area, not the ponytail/ends area), and it makes a huge difference. I think that&#x27;s one reason this set doesn&#x27;t work as well for me, because it really wants the conditioner second like normal, and the results are good, but it just doesn&#x27;t sink in and seal the cuticle with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisture the way &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would still say give this a try.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo for people that shampoo every 2 days</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I love it.It really makes your hair feel and look so healthy. I plan to keep using their products, they work so much better than a lot of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I have been struggling with fine hair my whole life, and have tried every shampoo possible to give my hair some volume. This shampoo (though obviously no miracle cure), is a big help. Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get limp as quickly, and I also like the smell. I use many of the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; products now!</li>
    <li> I recently went from dark brown hair to a light ash blonde color and in the process did some damage to my hair. I needed to find a shampoo that would nourish and help me restore the health to my hair. I watch Elle Bangs on youtube and she recommended this shampoo in one of her videos so I decided to give it a try. After shopping around I realized that amazon has the most amazing price for this shampoo, and I will continue to purchase it through them. The smell of the shampoo is very very nice. It isn&#x27;t strong or flowery, it leaves a nice light pretty scent behind. Other reviews have said that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather but it indeed DOES lather. It actually creates a nice rich lather if you decide to use a couple extra pumps, but that&#x27;s not necessary. After using this product for three weeks my hair is so much softer and easier to style. I have also noticed how much less irritated my scalp is and I have much less acne on my shoulders and back (if you have that problem). I have been using everyday for three weeks and haven&#x27;t even used half the bottle yet! Overall I am very happy with this product. It does what it says it will and leaves me feeling clean and healthy. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am now a fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle hair care products.  I love the keratin line of products.  My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first few washes.  Started to notice significant hair loss and dry frizzy hair.  Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the pump is stiff to use because the shampoo is so thick.  I do not care for the way my hair feels while it is wet--my hair feels like there is a coating on it that will not rinse off.  But my hair does feel clean when it is dry.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this entire line of products. My hair is so healthy and shiny now! I color my hair every 4 weeks or so, and still have healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Read rave reviews on this...&lt;br /&gt;Tried it... hated it.&lt;br /&gt;Left hair matted yet greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;No bounce.&lt;br /&gt;No Shine.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again...</li>
    <li> I have Latin kinda curly/wavy hair.. the good thing, it doesn&#x27;t let my hair felling too frizzy.. the bad thing, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really cleans it completely..</li>
    <li> Ordered this by mistake and gave it a try, so glad I did. My hair has stayed soft and manageable; even after 18 holes of golf.</li>
    <li> 2 reasons I gave it one star. Cap was broken. Only a little above half full. But, the product is great. Smells wonderful and brings your hair to a Shine and soft. If they replace the bottle I will change my eating to a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product line from a guest on the Steve Harvey radio show. Because it was an Afro-American hairdresser raving about it, and I definitely have tough-to-handle Afro-hair, I decided to try it. I love the way my hair feels after using this product. It&#x27;s so soft and manageable. The bonus is, it&#x27;s supposed to be really healthy too. If people who know hair believe in it, this probably will be the brand I use on the regular, on the real,</li>
    <li> Wanted something without Lauryl Sulfate because that seems to harsh for my hair. Plus who knows about the health concerns of that stuff. My hair is soft and no tangles as soon as I rinse my hair.That is not the case with regular shampoos.My hair feels like straw after most shampoos.  Don&#x27;t expect a big lather since there is no lauryl sulfate. Just a pump or two is plenty to get your hair clean.  Also, it has wonder conditioning ingredients and I like other products from this line. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite conditioners. I know I have a great hair day when I use this stuff! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> works good, no weight down, better than any Walmart type brand. i like this product line a lot, its good quality at good prices</li>
    <li> I have been going blonde for a few months. I figured this would help my hair remain shiny and healthy. This shampoo mats my hair into a clump of elastic hair and leaves me in fear of brushing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to anyone who has ever altered their natural hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was fried by a bad perm job. I tried multiple other keratin shampoos and this has been the only one to bring my hair back to its silky shine!</li>
    <li> This shampoo also dried out my hair and left it feeling like straw. I know many people have good results with the non-sulfate shampoos, but they just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to use this up... I&#x27;ve had it for a month and it has done nothing that it says it supposed to do. I used it with the miracle conditioner and the miracle leave in. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken in the delivery process and the contents haved leaked out. The plunger is broken and is unusable. I think the seller should send a replacement.I orignally thought the plunger was broken in the shipping and gave this a bad review, but after I washed off the shampoo that had leaked out, I was able to reassemble this and used it this morning.. It left my hair looking and feeling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ON EDIT, after I washed off the small amount of the contents which had leaked out, I was able to reassemble the plunger and use the shampoo.. It left my hair looking and feeling very nice.  So I have given it a new rating.</li>
    <li> Thought I would give this a try, but never noticed a difference so for the cost not worth it to me. Especially if you use the leave in its a 10.</li>
    <li> Very good smiling and make your hair strong and stop hair loss and very good for skin also,i recommended for every body.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried!! My hair has never looked better. It takes out all the tangles  so there&#x27;s no need to use conditioner. I highly recommend this product. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Most of my hair is long and healthy, I&#x27;ve stopped dying it years ago...however I do have 3-4 inches of processed/dried ends and i don&#x27;t want to cut it. This shampoo treats my ends miraculously without over greasing my entire head. My hair is the best it has been, super soft and bouncy. I don&#x27;t even need to/want to blow dry it straight anymore, I am embracing my nature wavy do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need much of this shampoo and it feels good in my hair!  My hair is softer without it being weighed down.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have used and I have used every expensive brand! My hair is shiny and manageable every time I use it.</li>
    <li> An amazing product ........Does everything it states it will !!!!! Will be buying more of this line without a doubt !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I love the products they were extremely well on my hair</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo with nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner and in tact.</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo.  It really help my dry hair.  It made it softer and I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much.  That was just what I was looking for.  I would buy this one again.  It really does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Ok so I purchased the original it&#x27;s a 10 and loved it, thought I would try this one after reading all the buzz about keratin. Every one noticed my beautiful shiney bouncy healthy natural curly hair. So far I love this one a bit more than original, I think this one feels lighter on my hair. I will never be without it&#x27;s a 10 again. goodbye wen</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. USED FOR MANY PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING WITH YOUR HAIR.  YOU CAN REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE.</li>
    <li> So, my hairdresser introduced me to this line. I absolutely love the deep conditioner and the miracle leave in product plus keratin, and was hoping to love this shampoo as well. My hairdresser said she tried it and couldn&#x27;t get it to fully lather. I like my shampoo to get really lather-y, otherwise it just is weird to me and i don&#x27;t think i get as good of a clean. This shampoo does not lather like I would have hoped it would. It&#x27;s a decent lather but not what I&#x27;m used to. However, I do like how the product smells and how my hair feels after I wash it with this shampoo. I would buy this shampoo again even though I&#x27;m not overly excited about the lather situation.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a friend&#x27;s true love for the It&#x27;s a 10 line. I&#x27;m not impressed. Maybe it takes more than one wash. But, the one wash has left my hair dry and funky. I will try it for a few more days and go from there. So far though, I would not make an effort to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the quality and wonderful smell of this shampoo!  Does all it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I started using the shampoo and conditioner about a month ago.  I developed a really bad rash from it.  It is down my back, shoulders and arms. The product works great on my hair but the rash is so bad that I had to see a doctor.  I have not used it in a week and the rash is slowly going away.  I returned the shampoo and conditioner and got a full refund.  I like the leave in conditioner and the mask but I will not buy the shampoo and conditioner again.  I have sensitive skin already but I have never had a product give me this bad of a reaction- ever.</li>
    <li> This product is really a Miracle, my hair is frizzy and curly. And this shampoo really makes a big difference. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice..and I&#x27;ve only shampooed my hair twice in the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo for my chemically damaged, fine, thin hair. I walked into one of my local salon...asked some questions and was recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has changed my hair in the best way...already!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very thick and non watery texture and you don&#x27;t even need alot of it.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this shampoo contains Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfate...which is what makes this stuff lather SO well.&lt;br /&gt;But when im done...my hair feels clean but not stripped of any nutrients or oil that my hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie..it can feel a little matted and dry but that&#x27;s because this shampoo does contain Keratin and it&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After have using this and some conditioner along with my it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner...my hair looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;The texture has completely changed from lifeless...thin and dull to strong, shiny, and SO manageable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is..my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to STAY clean for more than 3 days...but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I spent the $24 on this.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser shared this great product with me. I let my hair go back to natural gray and it was sooo dry!  This product instantly rehydrated my hair.  I also use the leave in product for extra condition.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This shampoo seems to do a terrific job of stripping all of the former product build-up out of your hair.  I have dry, very curly hair and cannot tolerate such a strong shampoo on a daily basis...but I sure LOVE it every two weeks to revitalize!</li>
    <li> My colored and dried hair from living in Florida is now luxurious and soft and shiny. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I read good reviews and wanted to try it for myself. I am a bit dissaponted in the shampoo. You need three or more pumps to get enough shampoo to cover the head, and I have short to medium length. Hard to work it through the hair as well. I will probably not buy the product again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, Her salon charges much more than what I pay for it on AMAZON. I really love this product. The only issue is that I ave to use alot (like 7-8 pumps) to get enough to use in my hair so I go trough a bottle quickly. But this is better than other shampoos I have used</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the ish! I use the spray that gives me shine, and this one of those fantastic products that does not leave your hairy greasy dry or anything.. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and my hair feels healthier than ever! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I looked up this product after hearing about keratin from a friend.  My hair is bobbed, is fine and limp and color-treated.  I noticed a difference after the first use of this shampoo.  It&#x27;s almost like it coated each strand of hair to make it strong and full.  I use it almost every day, on alt days I use a volume shampoo.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather but it does something great and it smells nice.  Definetely recommend to any hair type and lenght... i can already see mine growing out and stronger which was what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer.  Love this shampoo</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  It&#x27;s very creamy and helps keep my hair soft in shiny.  Use in conjunction with It&#x27;s a 10 Keratin Conditioner and Leave-in Potion.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. I can tell does not damage the hair. My hair is smooth and frizz free. No scent as I like.</li>
    <li> I used to use &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Moisture Shampoo&amp;#34; but it was kinda watery so I have to pump a lot each time I wash my hair. With this thick and creamy product, it&#x27;s sulfate-free yet still so viscous and just a small amount is enough for me. The price is good because I can use one bottle of this for 3 months at least (my hair is waist length and quite thick). The smell is just great! It&#x27;s really refreshing and much better than the Miracle Moisture Shampoo. Also, this shampoo is infused with keratin which I believe it does make my hair shinier (I&#x27;m using both leave-in spray and miracle oil so maybe they all add shine). Nevertheless, I love this product so much I just ordered myself a big 1L bottle. My hair is now my pride (:</li>
    <li> the miracle shampoo is smaller than i though, but it Works very well, cleans my hair very well, it is a good product</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is this shampoo doesn&#x27;t create tons of lather, so don&#x27;t expect that.  Fine with me, as long as it works.  I skip regular conditioner and use it with the It&#x27;s a 10 leave-in spray plus keratin.  I can easily go an extra day between shampoos with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It&#x27;s a must for my unruly dry curly hair. It makes my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> Is almost a miracle, really it works since first use. Since I was 14 my hair is freeze, I don&#x27;t know what happened with my brilliant and straight hair, but It was a nightmare, since I&#x27;m using this product, I feel my hair brilliant and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo from a salon, after having run through all of the drugstore brands and having no success moisturizing my dry hair. I was sold on the list of healthful ingredients featured on the Perfect 10 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo did absolutely nothing for my processed hair. It did not lather at all -which I understand that lathering \\&quot;friction\\&quot; can be considered bad for hair...but this shampoo did not leave my hair feeling the slightest bit clean.&lt;br /&gt;It did not make my dry hair feel more moisturized.  And it did not smell good.  In fact, it had almost no fragrance at all (which maybe some people might like).&lt;br /&gt;I spent almost $25 for this very small bottle of shampoo, and was extremely disappointed. I have since tried Biolage products and Catwalk products that faired better, for less money.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and there is just less than half left in the bottle.  This is the only shampoo I use.  At first I used 2 pumps cuz it was a little hard getting used to shampoo that didn&#x27;t suds. Now I use 1 pump on my below shoulder length hair.  My hair stays cleaner longer too!  My 55 year old dyed hair feels like a teenager!  I love the It&#x27;s a 10 product line!</li>
    <li> I have been using It&#x27;s A 10 products for over a year now and absolutely love them!  You will find the best prices right here on Amazon!  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, so this size will last a long time.  The shampoo rinses clean with no residue.  My hair is in much better condition since I began using these products!</li>
    <li> Nice, makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but I still have the dry fried parts in my hair. I think I need a brazilian blowout.  Then it will probably be great!</li>
    <li> Love this, makes hair smooth and shiny I would recommend for dry curly hair types. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It leaves my hair very soft and frizz free. I have very wavy hair so I like how it feels after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Lathers well but no sulphates.  Hair is left feeling soft and managable.  Stimulates hair growth.  I absolutely love it.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and tends to freeze in humidity.  With this shampoo plus conditioner and leaving in my hair has changed and keeps on soft and well.</li>
    <li> With hard water this doesn&#x27;t work as well but at home with my soft water it always makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Excellent for your hair, maintain your hair healthy, good for fine hair, good to use it every day. Try it! The price; I can&#x27;t complain when I by it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!! I&#x27;m in love with this product and my hair feels like silk. I have combination hair of black and white, curly with afternoon frizz. It was like magic with the first use.I It makes blow drying and flat ironing a since without any needed products (shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;My husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off my hair; and he says it smell clean and refreshing. That alone is a reason to purchase it. Give it a try ~</li>
    <li> My hair dresser first used this on my hair a couple of years ago.  I have tried it several times &amp; love it.  It has a nice smell, gives your hair body &amp; shine.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shampoo. Fortifies the hair. All their products are excellent and I strongly recommend. I&#x27;m using the lite leave in conditioner in the white bottle. Wow. Silky smooth hair and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use all of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle products Plus Keratin. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It has changed my life.  No more frizz even in summer and humidity.</li>
    <li> I got the Shampoo, Conditoner and Leave-In for Christmas gift from my Sister-in-Law I was skeptical at first but I am Sooooooo please it is the best thing in the world for my hair.  I have short black hair and was having problems changing shampoos but never finding one that makes my hair feel and look good.  This 10 makes my hair looks great and feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Good price and I love this product line. Way more expensive if you buy it in a grocery store. Makes your hair less fly away and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I use the shine spray and the leave in conditioner spray, so I figured I&#x27;d try the shampoo. I read it didn&#x27;t lather but I know that&#x27;s with most sulfate free shampoos. I would lather it in my hands first that put it in my hair and my hair just never seemed clean. There other products are great but not a fan of their shampoo. Plus when it came it exploded in the box... Won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
    <li> This stuff has seriously turned my hair life around. After many bleaches and dyes this has managed to get my hair back to a healthy state. And it&#x27;s sulfate free which is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this shampoo. I paired it with the conditioner and I haver NEVER seen my hair so improved - healthy, shiny, smells fantastic, thicker and stronger than before! I have very fine, thin hair and this shampoo and conditioner works absolute wonders. I have found the product that I love! I have never found a shampoo and conditioner like this! I highly recommend. And I also recommend the Perfect 10 leave in conditioner! Ok, I will stop with all the great comments. Just try it, you won&#x27;t regret it..PERFECT 10, THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t strip my hair &amp; seems to be repairing the damage that coloring &amp; styling has done</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not up to the calibre of 10 Miracle Mouse.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the conditioner and it is the best stuff I have used probably ever. My hair is soft and manageable, it smells nice, and it is free of all those additives I keep trying to get away from in other products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the correct product.</li>
    <li> my hair is dry and broke it looks like a french poodle on a bad hair day . this hair care line is wonderfull. iam hooked.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products,so I am always looking for a new improved product. Very pleased with this easy to use,makes my dry hair look like hair instead of straw,</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, really expensive.</li>
    <li> Comparable price after shipment is accessed.  Product is good because of who it is - great product.  Did arrive before estimated which was a plus.</li>
    <li> There is nothing I have tried that compares to this shampoo.leaves hair soft for days I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The product was open in the package and leaked all over.  However, the pump is not working.  I did try the shampoo that was left and it is too heavy for my hair.  I love the leave in conditioner but the shampoo, not so much.</li>
    <li> Do not go by the label on the front of the bottle.  Read the fine print in the list of ingredients.  If you&#x27;ve had a professional keratin straightening treatment, do not use this shampoo.  It contains sodium chloride and is not sulfate free.  Therefore, it will undermine your treatment and ruin your hair.  It took six months and four haircuts before my hair looked normal again.  I complained to the company, and they said it was an isolated case of mislabeling and they sent me a small box of free products, which I discarded.  I will never buy anything from this company again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift that was requested, then after purchasing it, the young lady went to a styling salon.  She was told that this product was not good for hair, the keratin snaps it off over time.  I have no first-hand experience with that so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not.  Since the young lady no longer wanted this product, I kept it for myself...  so we&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
    <li> By far the best hair care product Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! cheaper online than in store!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner combo for color treated hair.  I like to wear my hair straight, so thought the Keratin would be great.  The shampoo does not lather very well.  The conditioner does seem to make my hair soft.  All in all, for the price, I think there are better combo&#x27;s out there.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal. I just bleached my hair from dark dark brown to light champagne blonde and needed a good shampoo that would help rebuild my hair and keep my color brilliant. This has a great sulfate and paraben free formula and my hair is recovering *beautifully*. I used it once before I dyed my hair and it left it in its most natural beauty. I am in love with this brand and can not say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Really bad for the hair. Made my hair lumpy and greasy. Please do not call it miracle shampoo. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My hair is stronger, the color is lasting longer, the texture of my hair since it is colored with highlights is softer and shinny.  I would recommend this product to any one</li>
    <li> There are so many keratin shampoos out there these days.  I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price. I like Organix keratin shampoo and conditioner, and it is a much better price and sold conveniently at target.</li>
    <li> it dose smooth hair little but my hair is still has very dry and fluffy looking, and also the bottle&#x27;s design is very bad because it hard to hold in hand and spray special when hand is wet.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair looks when I use this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps my hair feel more silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite shampoo and I have tried dozens.  I can only use sulphate free shampoos because my hair dries out and frizzes out big time if I don&#x27;t.  It smells great, lathers well, and is very moisurizing and cleans really well, all while not stripping my hair of moisture.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 1 day (this morning) and I can tell already that I am absolutely going to love it.  It smells nice, it lathers up like crazy and really makes my hair feel great.  I have experienced problems with my hair getting really frizzy even right after a haircut and that is one of the biggest reasons I ordered this product.  I could tell a big difference this morning already.  I have ordered a couple of other similar products and cannot wait to use them as well!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner as it leaves my hair feeling soft afterwards.  I do use the It&#x27;s a 10 leave in spray conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I get the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; when the weather is humid--and I asked my 13 year old granddaughter how she keeps her long tresses so silky and smooth--and her reply was &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;...so I found it on my fave online store--Amazon--and ordered both the shampoo and keratin enriched conditioner.  Now my hair is &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now. I have to say it has done nothing for my hair. I would rather spend my money on TIGI Urban Antidote...my hair never looked and felt better than when I was using it. I can&#x27;t wait to finish the It&#x27;s a 10 so I can switch back! Also, I have the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in with Keratin and it makes my hair feel gross ;-(</li>
    <li> Smells good but a little thick. Doesn&#x27;t lather as easily as I would like</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves my hair smelling wonderful and feeling extremely soft.</li>
    <li> No soap. No scalp irritants. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the shampoo to clean. And, my scalp stopped itching. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo, conditioner, and a little of the spray and ended up with dryer hair than before and the color of my hair has dulled.  (I just had highlight/color done this past Tuesday, so it was noticeable.)  I can&#x27;t recommend this line.  I do like their original products, but this line with the keratin---that&#x27;s a no.</li>
    <li> Perfect looks like my hair original. It match with my style. no need to push hard or put more. just leave it and you will get good aspect</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife &amp; it worked so well that i started to use it ! Nice hair for us !</li>
    <li> Definitely gives my hair more volume.  Scent is a bit stront, however.</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Arrived on time as well!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, now its sold everywhere but I still love it!</li>
    <li> does help coat your hair in a good way......makes it stronger</li>
    <li> Great item, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does the exact opposite of most shampoos it cleans the hair but hydrates it at the same time...along with the deep conditioner my hair is being repaired &amp; it prevents split ends.</li>
    <li> This product has left my hair beautiful,soft shinny.My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch it&#x27;s a pleasure,and my hair smells great&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to washing my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is HORRIBLE! I can&#x27;t return it. I had it shipped overseas. It makes my hair really greasy and oily and parts of it are straw-like and dry but that is not the worst of it. Clumps of hair came out. The first time I was shocked but had a doubt that maybe it was caused by something else, so I tried it a second time and it happened again. I have never had a shampoo that instantly caused my hair to fall out like this! There is definitely something inside here that is not right. I do not chemically treat my hair, so there is no other logical explanation. Stay away from this product!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and have repurchased it a few more times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> With my short hair a small drop less than 1/4 of the size of a dime lathers .y entire head. There is &amp;agrave; noticeable difference in the feel of my hair and it looks healthier too.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair for decades. I have taken medicine that caused my hair to fall out. I blow dry and use a curling iron...nothing else to say about the condition of my hair; I&#x27;ll bet you either KNOW it or can PICTURE IT. I love this stuff. you only need a little and your hair is stronger and fuller. The seller is awesome I was not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> I had to get use to it.. But after shampooing my hair, I liked the texture of my hair and it smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was easy to comb out even before I put the conditioner on it. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is great for retaining hair color and straightening my hair.  The container is ok, although it is hard to shut down the pump spigot and it leaks when traveling.  It must go into a ziploc and I always lose some product.  Has the manufacturer tried to travel with this? If you don&#x27;t have to travel with it, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this on my hair. It smells great and I love the way my hair feels after I use it. It is definitely silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high &amp; low for a great shampoo &amp; conditioner that is sulfate free &amp; that hydrates my hair ..... I finally found it!! I typically use only salon grade products because I&#x27;m licensed to purchase at beauty supplies.  so, point being is that I typically use \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff ..... but nothing has really impressed me or made me want to buy a second round of the product ..... until now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Wen (I do like but not love), Kenra, Joico, Rusk Keratin, &amp; the list goes on.  All were just OK.  My hair is below my shoulders, &amp; very fine, &amp; damages easily.  My hair is in fair condition except the ends get really gross from flat ironing and/or using a round brush to blow it out.  I do use thermal protectants before I apply heat to my hair which helps but doesn&#x27;t protect as good as I&#x27;d like them to.&lt;br /&gt;SO. I&#x27;ve used It&#x27;s a 10 Keratin Plus shampoo &amp; the deep conditioner 2 times now &amp; I just picked up the It&#x27;s a 10 Keratin plus leave-in conditioner last nite.  I don&#x27;t know how, but the ends of my hair seem to be repaired. Not just a little bit, but as if I had my hair trimmed.  it feels AND looks like i got the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; stuff cut off.  My hair feels thicker &amp; stronger, yet it is still smooth &amp; silky.  I&#x27;m pretty much set on this stuff &amp; am going to try some of the styling products.  even at the beauty supply discounted cost its still expensive but totally worth it.  on a side note ..... i&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoos &amp; they do not lather, or not much.  &amp; my hair needs washed more frequently.  so far with this, it lathers very well &amp; feels clean.  I went my usual 2 - 3 days between washing &amp; my hair wasn&#x27;t matted down &amp; gross at the roots like when I used Wen.  Def try this stuff.  it&#x27;s a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is really work for me.It change my dry hair to oilly hair in a month. But somehow too oilly now.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have if you color or bleach your hair.  The fragrance is wonderful and the product will surprise you on how well it conditions and strengthens your hair.  Make sure you get the conditioner and leave in spray with keratin too!  Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I have colored hair and am always looking for shampoo and products that help reverse the damage of coloring, and styling my hair. This shampoo not only strengthens my hair but it makes it feel healthy soft and shiney. And it smells fantastic! A little goes a long way and the lather you get when massaging it in to your hair is so thick and luxurious. I love this shampoo and now use it along with the conditioner and the leave in spray. This stuff really is a miracle for my hair. It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - my stylist pretty much demanded I use what she did - and it makes my hair so much easier to come through and softer to the tough.  This is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> A friend sent me the blow dry spray and love the smell and how it works so thought I&#x27;d buy several more items in this line.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin and scalp. This bothers my scalp a little bit (not to the point where I feel as if I want to unzip out of&lt;br /&gt;my skin but enough to notice that the ph must be high) so I don&#x27;t use it all the time. I have fine hair and the keratin may be&lt;br /&gt;a little too much for it, it feels a little thicker or dryer with it but I think that is the point? To give it more thickness? I use Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;mostly because it is a low Ph but this smells so much better!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was horrible in my baby fine, oily hair.  It made it look dirtier than before I sprayed it as well as making it even flatter.  I am giving it 2 stars as it smells great and because it&#x27;s probably a great product for people with dry, thick hair.</li>
