      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of doing an exchange, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because it feels wonderful on my dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>It is also great as a soap as well leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft without the harsh smell of strong perfumes.</li>
      <li>The soap is so gentle and makes my skin so smooth the shaver glides across my face removing all the stubble effortlessly WITHOUT any irritation.</li>
      <li>This soap did not give me the moisture that experienced with the plain  shea butter one.</li>

      <li>The bar is pretty big and dense.</li>
      <li>The bar is large and will last a very long time so don&#x27;t let the price put you off, it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never before found a soap that makes my skin soft and heals roughness.  </li>
      <li>Plus this is a really big bar, it will last a long time, you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I was actually shocked that the soap could smell so refreshing and clean naturally.</li>
      <li>Nubian something or other, will be returning this bar because I found the real thing cheaper at target anyways.</li>
      <li>I have spent countless dollars on products that claimed they were gentle and would not dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>Tea Shea Butter Soap does not dry my skin out at all.</li>
      <li>In the shower or using the sink, I wet up my face and gently rub the bar directly over the areas I am going to shave, wet up the blade and just shave.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a facial cleanser that does not dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>Nubian Skin has an almost identical product (the only real difference is that their bar is a little bit smaller) which they sent me by accident.</li>

    <li> I cannot wait to use it! I felt like buying this because of spicyeve&#x27;s review of it on Youtube.</li>
    <li> Nubian Skin has an almost identical product (the only real difference is that their bar is a little bit smaller) which they sent me by accident. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of doing an exchange, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because it feels wonderful on my dry, acne-prone skin. A little bit creates a lot of lather, so I like to use it for shaving.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for this soap. I think I will stick with my Shea Moisture shea butter soap. This soap did not give me the moisture that experienced with the plain  shea butter one.</li>

    <li> I have used three different varieties of the Shea Moisture soaps.  I love them.  I&#x27;ve never before found a soap that makes my skin soft and heals roughness.  This soap healed my rough, dry hands.  I will say I am able to buy it in a local chain drugstore at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> I shave wet and have found an excellent product to lubricate my face before I shave which doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Shea Moisture Organic Olive&amp;Green Tea Shea Butter Soap.

The bar is large and will last a very long time so don&#x27;t let the price put you off, it is worth every penny. It is also great as a soap as well leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft without the harsh smell of strong perfumes. Great product!</li>

It&#x27;s huge too!</li>
