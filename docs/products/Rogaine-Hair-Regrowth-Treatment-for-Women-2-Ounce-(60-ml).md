### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My husband was so impressed with my Rogaine results that he&#x27;s purchased the Rogaine Men&#x27;s foam for himself!</li>
      <li>I guess it ether works for you or doesn&#x27;t and for me it works great!   </li>
      <li>So, though this may be an excellent product for results, buyer beware!</li>
      <li>The growth of hair is acceptable...but do not expect to have an incredible hair regrowth!</li>
      <li>(receding) was post-menapausal so perhaps it works best for women with that kind of loss.</li>
      <li>Women&#x27;s Rogaine has worked great for me.</li>
      <li>im happy with the product, will def re-order.</li>
      <li>I am so happy about this and can&#x27;t wait to see the finished results.</li>
      <li>Time will tell if it is effective.</li>
      <li>it grows faster but gives kind of dandruff where I put the product.  </li>
      <li>I saw new sprouts coming up at about three months in, and things were great!</li>
      <li>It was also very easy to use.</li>
      <li>the direction for use is twice per day (very easy)</li>
      <li>We received a great product at the best price and it was shipped in a few days.</li>
      <li>but I remedied that problem by using a better conditioning product.      </li>
      <li>As I am over 60, it might be more beneficial for&lt;br /&gt;younger women.</li>
      <li>Selling expired products is improper and not disclosing this, and then not responding to customer contact, even more improper...</li>
      <li>and i started loosing my hair in the top of my head...</li>
      <li>I have just ordered Lipogaine since those reviews state that it works better than just Rogaine alone.</li>
      <li>The hair around the treatment tends to be more managable at this time and I am hopeful it works for me.</li>
      <li>I think a pill would be a better choice.  </li>
      <li>and I notice that it works a lot better with Rogaine when you use both.</li>
      <li>So for women who&#x27;s hair is thinning at the top and at the forehead hairline</li>
      <li>For most people, as it says on the box.  </li>
      <li>I am unwilling to move up to the Mens Rogaine, as many recommend.</li>
      <li>I know that I have to continue to use it twice daily to keep the improvement, but the improvement is noticeable and welcome!  </li>
      <li>I notice them mostly along my hairline</li>
      <li>But with the monoxidil stimulating new growth and everything else I am doing, I feel like I am making some great gains in my treatment for thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>Works great for my mom who always had great thick hair, but started thinning after age 63.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t come in really strong yet</li>
      <li>This area is now completely filled in.  </li>
      <li>I am SSSOOOOO excited about Rogaine.</li>
      <li>I started noticing significant amount of hair falling out while I was on birth control.  </li>
      <li>The directions say that the first hair is baby fine but will come in stronger as you continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for fuller hair, but hopefully after several more months, it will be much more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I guess that I got lucky: it started working for me in about 8 weeks.  </li>
      <li>My shedding is completely reduced, not stopped but not nearly the amount of shed that I experienced before using Rogaine.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I will be able to see my hair&#x27;s full potential since I will never ever use permanent dye nor a relaxer again.</li>
      <li>it Is super dry scalp that cause even more hair loss</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy to have to use it twice a day for at least 4 months, as the product</li>
      <li>i still have it, if anyone wants to buy it from me!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Women&#x27;s Rogaine since it first came out, decades ago.</li>
      <li>but my dermatologist pretty much thought it was hereditary.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several months now and have noticed fine hair is growing in the areas where I apply the product.  </li>
      <li>I had a HUGE initial shed.  </li>
      <li>This was a real winner.  </li>
      <li>This area has definitely filled back in.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product at a reasonable price and ships really fast.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working or not</li>
      <li>During the first few weeks I experienced the dry, itchy scalp</li>
      <li>At first you don&#x27;t notice its working, then in a couple of months I saw all this new hair growing in.</li>
      <li>If I could say for certain that I have new hair growth then this product would get 5 stars.      </li>
      <li>After using Rogaine for 6 or 7 weeks, I noticed the amount of hair in the drain was a fraction of what it used to be, plus lots of new growth along my hairline!  </li>
      <li>I think I see new hairs growing too!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the result, though the growth was not dramatic, but at least I know it works</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly</li>
      <li>I will most certainly keep you posted over the next 100 years because if it keeps working, then that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ll be using it!!</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because the growth is only noticable by me right now.</li>
      <li>Just put it on your scalp in the morning and at night and just let the new hair grow in.  </li>
      <li>Now the new growth is down to my eyebrows which I find really cool.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and noticed my hairline was thinning, also saw too much hair was in the shower drain every morning.  </li>
      <li>Then shaved all the perm out at age 39 to become &#x27;Natural&#x27;).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still too soon to rate it, but just had to share my experince so far.  </li>
      <li>no help rather hair loss has increased considerably.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old and getting to the point that I am now balding.  </li>
      <li>The only improvements that I have really seen are at my temples.  </li>
      <li>Also worth mentioning: the new growth is my natural dark hair color, not the grays that are popping up all over the rest of my head.  </li>
      <li>With so many products on the market promising to produce dramatic results, I decided to stick with the brand I could trust, which is Rogaine.  </li>
      <li>I am just now finishing up the last bottle of Rogaine in my first three-month supply and came back to purchase another three months&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I started this review when I first started using this product and had given it 3 stars because I was still shedding quite a bit and this product caused a very dry scalp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve perservered with applying the liquid, faithfully, everyday, and I&#x27;m determined to use it for the full year that is recommended.  </li>
      <li>It lasted for about a month, and at the end of it, there was a definite new thinness to my head.  </li>
      <li>Under a harsh overhead bathroom light, I no longer notice &#x27;scalp&#x27; just above my bangs, just &#x27;hair&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>After this initial nightmare, shedding completely stopped!  </li>
      <li>I was growing out my natural hair for the third time</li>
      <li>It took about 2 months to begin to see the new hair coming back in after starting Rogaine</li>
      <li>After the initial 2-3 mos I only applied it at night--and not every night at that, but my new growth is still there--and still being added to.   </li>
      <li>I must mention as well that the hair on my arms has darkened a bit, and you must be super careful when applying it (if your hair is really thin, it will quickly run), or you will end up with unwanted hair on your face.  </li>
      <li>My hair was starting to thin out, losing hair in the front and sides and the top of my head.</li>

<li> I know it works for some, but for me, the extra thinning was not worth it.</li>
<li> I figured what do i have to loose  </li>
<li> Anyway, my temples had very little hair left, in a sort of triangle shape toward the back of my head.  </li>
<li> The previous 2 times it reached the back of my neck</li>
<li> As an Asian American, I have thick, coarse black hair.  </li>

<li> I spent 500 dollars to get a laser hat</li>
<li> My husband had absolutely no result with the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years. I started noticing hair loss around age 38. My hair looks fuller and healthier. For most women losing hair is quite depressing. There is a solution. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> I am just now finishing up the last bottle of Rogaine in my first three-month supply and came back to purchase another three months&#x27;.  Rogaine works for me.  As an Asian American, I have thick, coarse black hair.  At least I will again.  I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and noticed my hairline was thinning, also saw too much hair was in the shower drain every morning.  After using Rogaine for 6 or 7 weeks, I noticed the amount of hair in the drain was a fraction of what it used to be, plus lots of new growth along my hairline!  Under a harsh overhead bathroom light, I no longer notice &#x27;scalp&#x27; just above my bangs, just &#x27;hair&#x27;.  My bangs are fuller and the hair on the crown of my head seems thicker.  Also worth mentioning: the new growth is my natural dark hair color, not the grays that are popping up all over the rest of my head.  My husband was so impressed with my Rogaine results that he&#x27;s purchased the Rogaine Men&#x27;s foam for himself!</li>
    <li> For most people, as it says on the box.  Works great for my mom who always had great thick hair, but started thinning after age 63.  She saw noticable growth and coverage within 3 months.  Now me:  I am 39 and my hair started shedding dramactically about 6 months ago. I was not alarmed initially, but it continued for longer than usual and I started noticing thinner areas around my crown.  I started monoxidil 2 months ago (2 times a day, morning and a couple hours before bed).  I also started on a routine of oral supplements (multi-vitamin, biotin, iron, d3,...just to name a few).  The shedding decreased a tiny bit, however, in the past 2 weeks, the shedding has decreased dramatically. I am already seeing some growth around my bangs.  I should also note that in the past two weeks, I have increased my daily water intake to about 8 (8 ounce) glasses a day. Yes, it sucks having to run to the bathroom alot.  But with the monoxidil stimulating new growth and everything else I am doing, I feel like I am making some great gains in my treatment for thinning hair.  I gave it 4 stars because the growth is only noticable by me right now. It&#x27;s still too soon to rate it, but just had to share my experince so far.  Will update in a couple months.</li>
    <li> When Googling this product as a favor to a friend, articles sprung up that Minoxidil is extremely toxic to cats.  Even one drop or a cat laying on a pillow where someone who is using Rogaine has been can be fatal.  So, though this may be an excellent product for results, buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Women&#x27;s Rogaine since it first came out, decades ago. My hair was starting to thin out, losing hair in the front and sides and the top of my head. It took months for any results to show but I stayed with the program and by year&#x27;s end I had back the hair I had lost and as long as I used the product I kept my hair. Once, in an attempt to switch to something cheaper, I bought a chain drugstore product. I started to lose my hair and when I looked carefully at the container, it had expired! I went back to Rogaine, and now, 20 years later, my hair is as thick as it was when I was in my forties. I&#x27;ll use it forever.</li>
    <li> i hv been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably. not sure if i shud continue using it . very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started using womens rogaine in Jan. 09.  I had a HUGE initial shed.  It lasted for about a month, and at the end of it, there was a definite new thinness to my head.  After this initial nightmare, shedding completely stopped!  Woo hoo! I saw new sprouts coming up at about three months in, and things were great! This continued for two months(approx. till June), and then the shedding began again with a vengance.  It continued all summer long, with handfuls coming out every day.  I&#x27;ve perservered with applying the liquid, faithfully, everyday, and I&#x27;m determined to use it for the full year that is recommended.  It&#x27;s now December (11 months and counting).  The only improvements that I have really seen are at my temples.  This area has definitely filled back in.  I have not been officially diagnosed via testing....but my dermatologist pretty much thought it was hereditary.  I&#x27;m of the feeling that it&#x27;s a combination of genetics/telogen effluvium.  Anyway, my temples had very little hair left, in a sort of triangle shape toward the back of my head.  This area is now completely filled in.  However, the rest of my head.....well, the top/back is beyond thin....much worse than when I started.   I&#x27;m 38 years old and getting to the point that I am now balding.  I am unwilling to move up to the Mens Rogaine, as many recommend. I must mention as well that the hair on my arms has darkened a bit, and you must be super careful when applying it (if your hair is really thin, it will quickly run), or you will end up with unwanted hair on your face.  I can&#x27;t say that I would definitely recommend this product.  I know it works for some, but for me, the extra thinning was not worth it.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of faithful usage of the product my wife has had no tangible results. She continues to use the product with hope.    Arnold Sobrian</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product before trying it, even more so when the instructions said that it could take 3-6 months to see any improvement (and then only in a relatively small percentage of users).  I guess that I got lucky: it started working for me in about 8 weeks.  I know that I have to continue to use it twice daily to keep the improvement, but the improvement is noticeable and welcome!  My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a small one) is that it must be used twice a day, which is occasionally inconvenient, and you have to keep your hair dry for 2 hours after using.  Other than that, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Rogaine for Women.  It has not been sufficient time to allow the product to do what I am wanting.  Recommended time is three to four months and I have only been using it for almost one month.    The hair around the treatment tends to be more managable at this time and I am hopeful it works for me.</li>
    <li> Women&#x27;s Rogaine has worked great for me. My hair was thinning at the front of my hair line and as a women I could not have that. I started using Women&#x27;s Rogaine in October 2006 and now I have fuller bangs. At first you don&#x27;t notice its working, then in a couple of months I saw all this new hair growing in. Now the new growth is down to my eyebrows which I find really cool. It was also very easy to use. Just put it on your scalp in the morning and at night and just let the new hair grow in.  So for women who&#x27;s hair is thinning at the top and at the forehead hairline I recommend this product highly</li>
    <li> I couldnt write sooner because it took a couple of months to show growth. Even my husband says &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; I have lots of crazy new hairs that are about 2 -3 inches in length.  I placed Rogaine in a spray bottle and just sprsyed thinning areas.  Its working!</li>
    <li> I started noticing significant amount of hair falling out while I was on birth control.  With so many products on the market promising to produce dramatic results, I decided to stick with the brand I could trust, which is Rogaine.  At first I was skeptical and did not see new hair growing.  But after about 3-4 weeks, my hair loss had stopped, it was no longer handful when I brushed or shampooed.  By the end of 2nd month, I noticed tiny baby hair on my scalp, my hair was growing back slowly, I definitely saw improvement.  I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for over a year now, I have seen moderate growth on my scalp.  I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the result, though the growth was not dramatic, but at least I know it works and it&#x27;s not a scam.  Just be patient and you&#x27;ll notice a difference</li>
    <li> This was a real winner.  We received a great product at the best price and it was shipped in a few days.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered an initial 4-month supply which I received last week. Upon receipt, I opened the box, read the entire insert and decided the product is not for me. Note: I did not open the actual product. There were two boxes in this shipment: one box with a 3-month supply and one box with a 1-month supply. I opened the 1-month supply box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Rogaine Customer Care today and was told I am not eligible for a product return, not even a partial return since one of the boxes was opened. Again - the product was not used - I merely read the insert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned off by this return policy which is actually  pointless.</li>
    <li> If I could rate it negative stars, I would.     Order placed 5/31/08. Advised seller on 6/22/08, that nowhere in listing did it indicate product was expired as of 10/07. No response. Selling expired products is improper and not disclosing this, and then not responding to customer contact, even more improper...</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair 2 months ago (with the same dye I always use) and after washing, I noticed that my hair was EXTREMELY thinner. And yes there was a LOT of shedding. I am 44 years old and have ALWAYS had lots of shedding over the years (which I now believe has been due to permanent dye) but NEVER like this. 2 months later, or rather last week, I decided to purchase Rogaine, but I used he Men&#x27;s 5% version,and after 1 week of use, the shedding decreased by 80%!!!!!!! I simply CANNOT BELIEVE IT!!!! I was growing out my natural hair for the third time (I am African American and have had a relaxer since age 12. Then shaved all the perm out at age 39 to become &#x27;Natural&#x27;). The previous 2 times it reached the back of my neck then I dyed it colors I did not like and would shave it off and start ALL OVER. And I just did that again yesterday except this time the hairdresser refused to shave it and left me about 2 inches all over. I had to agree with that since I have always walked in on impulse and demand that my hair be shaved off, and I&#x27;m talking Rapunzel length hair. I am SSSOOOOO excited about Rogaine. I feel like I will be able to see my hair&#x27;s full potential since I will never ever use permanent dye nor a relaxer again. I am glad that I used it before I got my hair cut so that I could witness the decreased shedding! Otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten 4 stars after just one week of use. I have just ordered Lipogaine since those reviews state that it works better than just Rogaine alone. I will most certainly keep you posted over the next 100 years because if it keeps working, then that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ll be using it!!</li>
    <li> I guess it ether works for you or doesn&#x27;t and for me it works great!   A couple of years ago I stopped wearing bangs because i started looking like a cockatiel whose feathers had been plucked. With the Rogaine I noticed a dif after about a month. This is my third order (of 3 bottles) so I guess it&#x27;s been almost a year that I&#x27;ve been using. After the initial 2-3 mos I only applied it at night--and not every night at that, but my new growth is still there--and still being added to.   My hair loss (receding) was post-menapausal so perhaps it works best for women with that kind of loss.</li>
    <li> I got the worst allergy from this product, my head and face got swollen and rashes after using this thing for 4 days, looked ugly, felt awful.  And it took several weeks for the symptoms went away, meanwhile had to experience skin pilling like snow flakes.</li>
    <li> This is like putting poison on your scalp, not to mention that it is extremely difficult to do because you get more on your hair than on your scalp.  i still have it, if anyone wants to buy it from me!  I think a pill would be a better choice.  After four years of horrible hairloss and a ton of tests, I was given by my new doctor a medicated shampoo for the scalp and after two months the loss has stopped.  So before you spend money on this stuff, talk to your doctor about a medicated shampoo.</li>
    <li> I started using Rogaine about 1 month ago and am still experiencing some shedding.  I heard that this is pretty common and that it takes about 3 to 4 months to start seeing results.  During the first few weeks I experienced the dry, itchy scalp but I remedied that problem by using a better conditioning product.      I still don&#x27;t see results, it&#x27;s too soon.  I&#x27;m dedicated to using Rogaine for 6 months and I&#x27;ll post a follow up at that time.    FOLLOW UP: I just started my 4th bottle so I&#x27;m on month 4.  My shedding is completely reduced, not stopped but not nearly the amount of shed that I experienced before using Rogaine.  I no longer have to vacuum hair off of my jackets and office chair.  I think I see new hairs growing too!  I&#x27;m really not sure if they are new or broken hairs that are growing back.  I notice them mostly along my hairline and they are spikey and difficult to style.  I started this review when I first started using this product and had given it 3 stars because I was still shedding quite a bit and this product caused a very dry scalp.  I&#x27;m now bumping the product to 4 stars because of the shed reduction but scalp is still dry and flaky. If I could say for certain that I have new hair growth then this product would get 5 stars.      I will revisit when I finish month 6 to let you know how it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> I spent 500 dollars to get a laser hat and I notice that it works a lot better with Rogaine when you use both.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working or not</li>
    <li> Product came in and without any problems</li>
    <li> I purchased this for someone else. I know they tried it but it did not work as expected I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably&lt;br /&gt;it was soooooo scary, I lose a lot of my hair, which make me soooooooooooooooooooooooooo concern&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not recommend you guys using it&lt;br /&gt;noooooooo&lt;br /&gt;plz dont buy it</li>
    <li> No results yet!  Can take up to 6-8 months before you see any results.  It has only been a month since I started using it.  Time will tell if it is effective.</li>
    <li> I am only 34 and i started loosing my hair in the top of my head...A friend of mine told me to try Rogaine. I figured what do i have to loose  so i read the reviews and bought the three months supply from Amazon. My bald spot had no hair... the direction for use is twice per day (very easy) it says you will see a difference within three months...I saw the difference within my Second  month now i have hair ( little stubs) so i am grateful and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and have noticed fine hair is growing in the areas where I apply the product.  I was hoping for fuller hair, but hopefully after several more months, it will be much more noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed after reading the instructions because I didn&#x27;t know before hand that you have to use this product for life or else&lt;br /&gt;your hair will stop growing again.  I wasn&#x27;t happy to have to use it twice a day for at least 4 months, as the product suggests.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a long time to wait for hair growth &amp; it&#x27;s not guaranteed it will work.  As I am over 60, it might be more beneficial for&lt;br /&gt;younger women.</li>
    <li> My sister told me about using Rogaine to grow back my brows. It says not to use it on your face but I tried it anyway. I over-plucked my brows years ago and although I have a definite brow line I always wanted those areas to grow back in. Well it&#x27;s working after just a few weeks. It hasn&#x27;t come in really strong yet but I believe that it will. The directions say that the first hair is baby fine but will come in stronger as you continue to use it. I am so happy about this and can&#x27;t wait to see the finished results. The directions say that if you quit using it the hair will stop growing so if you end up looking like cro-magnon you can just quit using it.</li>
    <li> returned as not suitable for whatI needed,nothing wrong with the product,</li>
    <li> im happy with the product, will def re-order.</li>
    <li> Yessssss......i have a hair regrowth with product.  It takes about 4 months to show the result.  The growth of hair is acceptable...but do not expect to have an incredible hair regrowth! I have also used the one for men without any problem...it grows faster but gives kind of dandruff where I put the product.  My husband had absolutely no result with the product.</li>
    <li> Never experienced any hair growth.</li>
    <li> I started losing hair due to a medication I was taking.  It took about 2 months to begin to see the new hair coming back in after starting Rogaine but in it came!  I highly recommend it.  Easy to put on and it works.</li>
    <li> Horrible... Dont waste ur money. The only thing u get out it Is super dry scalp that cause even more hair loss</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a reasonable price and ships really fast. Rogaine works, you just need to stick to it.</li>
    <li> PREFECT!  Grew bck my hair when i had lost hair in some spots. thx</li>
    <li> Over time this is working well.  I just wish that they continued with the spray bottle instead of this eye-dropper feature.  It&#x27;s a pain to put on.  The Rogaine seems to drip all over.  I purchased a travel sized spray bottle and transfer the liquid so I can spray my spot.</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks of using this product, I began having headaches. I was not sure this was the issue so I stopped using and within a couple days the headaches ceased.  I haven&#x27;t had anymore headaches since I discontinued using.</li>
