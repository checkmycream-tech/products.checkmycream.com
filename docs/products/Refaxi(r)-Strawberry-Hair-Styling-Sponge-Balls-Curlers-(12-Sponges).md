      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>It is light weight, which is also good.</li>
      <li>I love theses curlers, they are very easy to sleep in.</li>
      <li>plus they don&#x27;t look as cute as the picture shows.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a ok product.</li>
      <li>Glad they were inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I think these would be okay if you had shorter finer hair</li>
      <li>So cute and easy to use</li>
      <li>But, really what I wanted was cults and these were not so good.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that easily tangles</li>
      <li>perhaps the old fashioned kind will work better.  </li>
      <li>They are super cute and exactly as pictured!  </li>
      <li>I am sure these would work great if my hair was just a little longer.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re soft, easy to use, easy to sleep on.</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
      <li>These are super easy to use and very soft.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay on very well without support.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like them... wont stay on very well</li>
      <li>They arrived very smelly and didn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
      <li>other than that it is overall a good product.</li>
      <li>and I was able to get them to stay a little better....until she walked around.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better if you have hair past your shoulders.</li>
      <li>After at first trying and failing I watched several you tube videos</li>
      <li>I have used many soft rollers in the past</li>
      <li>and they are hard to take off, and look more like tomatoes than strawberries.</li>
      <li>In the picture they look huge but they&#x27;re a little bigger than golf ball size.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m visiting family in midwest where humidity this morning is 91%, I left in my hair for my early morning walk.  </li>
      <li>Fun for a little girls slumber party only - they actually mash up and get all out of whack in sleep.  </li>
      <li>almost didn&#x27;t order due to the negative reviews but glad I did.  </li>
      <li>They tangled my hair so much i had to rip one strawberry in half and break/pull out a ton of hair to get them off my head.</li>
      <li>I decided to try these for my eight yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s pretty thick and just below her shoulders.</li>

<li> The &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; came in with all different strange shapes, and non of they (12 in total) can stay on my hair...</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using them that often, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long if use on daily basis.</li>
<li> If you have coarse or natural kinky hair they might not work so well as there is very little tension.  </li>
<li> Not for very long hair.</li>
<li> The only problem I had with them is that my hair would get a little tangled.</li>
<li> I was looking for wavy curls, but since the inner curl rod is small it gave me tighter curls than desired.  </li>
<li> (I have shoulder length thin hair, but lots of it with a wavy texture, these just &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; my natural hair.)</li>
<li> My hair is down to my waist</li>
<li> I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and the curlers held all my hair.  </li>
<li> I have hair that comes just below my shoulders and these turned it into a tangled mess.</li>
<li> If i rolled them realy tight (to make them stay)</li>
<li> I was able to curl my hair around them and the curlers did stay out, but removing them was just terrible.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get them to stay on your head.</li>
<li> and I had a really hard time with these.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am using these wrong or what.</li>
<li> I was not impressed with these foam curlers.</li>
<li> WRONG.  </li>
<li> Very very poor quality.</li>
<li> However, the quality of these are very poor.</li>
<li> so had visions of cutting these out of my hair.  </li>
<li> Packing was bad and it doesn&#x60;t hold my hair at all.</li>
<li> The material was bad, it didn&#x27;t hold well at all.</li>
<li> it created knots. :(  </li>
<li> The ones that did manage to hold, tangled my hair to the point I had to tear them out :(</li>
<li> These things are stupid.</li>
<li> I have medium/short length hair and these knotted my hair up badly and the &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; we&#x27;re terrible and frizzy.</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>
<li> horrible quality... don&#x27;t buy them from this vendor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These things suck. It&#x27;s hard to get them to stay on your head. They tangled my hair so much i had to rip one strawberry in half and break/pull out a ton of hair to get them off my head. And my hair looks whack. These things are stupid. But regular curlers,  not these.</li>
    <li> I am sure these would work great if my hair was just a little longer.  I will be returning them...perhaps the old fashioned kind will work better.  Great value, tho, and always good service</li>
    <li> My boyfriend did think they were tomatoes lolol... but they&#x27;re soft, easy to use, easy to sleep on. I have fine straight hair and I got it to hold the hair in by just rolling it up. In the picture they look huge but they&#x27;re a little bigger than golf ball size. Don&#x27;t judge my berries!</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use and very soft.  No tangles or dents.  I definitely recommend putting a cap on if you&#x27;re going to sleep with them as they tend to fall out a lot.  If you have coarse or natural kinky hair they might not work so well as there is very little tension.  (I have shoulder length thin hair, but lots of it with a wavy texture, these just &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; my natural hair.)</li>
    <li> So cute and easy to use</li>
    <li> almost didn&#x27;t order due to the negative reviews but glad I did.  I have baby fine hair that easily tangles so had visions of cutting these out of my hair.  WRONG.  Put these in my damp hair before bed, took a couple out to look and had perfect beach curls.

    <li> I decided to try these for my eight yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s pretty thick and just below her shoulders. After at first trying and failing I watched several you tube videos and I was able to get them to stay a little better....until she walked around. I think these would be okay if you had shorter finer hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for longer thicker hair, they just won&#x27;t stay in. I switched to curl formers and never looked back!</li>
    <li> horrible quality... don&#x27;t buy them from this vendor.</li>
    <li> This one got returned. The material was bad, it didn&#x27;t hold well at all. The ones that did manage to hold, tangled my hair to the point I had to tear them out :( plus they don&#x27;t look as cute as the picture shows.</li>
    <li> These were totally cute as strawberries in my hair and if that was the look I was going for, they&#x27;d be great. But, really what I wanted was cults and these were not so good.

    <li> Fun for a little girls slumber party only - they actually mash up and get all out of whack in sleep.  Fun sitting around in them at home though :D</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even use these for my hair. Packing was bad and it doesn&#x60;t hold my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Very very poor quality. The product is nothing like what they have in the picture. The &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; came in with all different strange shapes, and non of they (12 in total) can stay on my hair... Don&#x27;t waist your money!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
    <li> My hair woldnt stay in the rollers. If i rolled them realy tight (to make them stay) it created knots. :(  I think it would work better if you have hair past your shoulders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am using these wrong or what. I have used many soft rollers in the past so I don&#x27;t think I am, but I have tried sleeping in these twice now and came out with only semi wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this! i can sleep on them, feels like a pillow.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them... wont stay on very well and they are hard to take off, and look more like tomatoes than strawberries.</li>
    <li> They are super cute and exactly as pictured!  I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and the curlers held all my hair.  I was looking for wavy curls, but since the inner curl rod is small it gave me tighter curls than desired.  But they work perfectly!  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> knotted in my hair, and i DIDNT sleep in them...</li>
    <li> It is very cute. When use it, the result is looks good too. It is light weight, which is also good. However, the quality of these are very poor. I guess for the price it&#x27;s a ok product. I haven&#x27;t been using them that often, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long if use on daily basis.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay in hair. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Not for very long hair. My hair is down to my waist and I had a really hard time with these. They don&#x27;t stay on very well without support. When it came time to take them out my hair was literally ripping out of my head. If your hair is not longer than your ear lobe, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> I have hair that comes just below my shoulders and these turned it into a tangled mess. I tried several times and couldn&#x27;t make them work. I lost a bunch of hair! Glad they were inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love theses curlers, they are very easy to sleep in. The only problem I had with them is that my hair would get a little tangled. other than that it is overall a good product.</li>
