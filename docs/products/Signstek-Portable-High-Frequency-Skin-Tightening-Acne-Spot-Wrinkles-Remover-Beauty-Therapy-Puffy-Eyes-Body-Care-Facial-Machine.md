<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found that the Derma Roller was much simpler to use. The wand did relatively well, but you must have a good amount of face cream on to use it.</li>
    <li> I used the wand on one side of my face, and I could see a visible differences between the two sides. The instructions were not hard to follow, and if the results from my first time are typical, this is great!</li>
    <li> This product arrived with many of the pieces broken. It comes with long fragile glass tubes. The instructions appear to be written by someone with very little education, which actually makes me nervous to use this product. Something about it just seems wrong to me. When translating instructions into different languages, a credible company would have a translator edit it.</li>
    <li> I really love this device and I am planning to buy another one as I am a mobile spa operator. This machine is so convenient.</li>
    <li> I would buy a higher quality machine because the metal base piece on the wands keeps falling off.  Sometimes you can glue it back and sometimes it gets permanently stuck in the machine and you have to get a new one.  This has happened to 2 wands so far and have needed to replace 1 machine.  If this happens after the 1 year warranty runs out, you&#x27;re stuck having to get a new machine or do without. I do not abuse my wands but handle them delicately as they&#x27;re made from glass.</li>
    <li> I am writing a very new review on this product, so you know, and in case you were only curious to the results I have had from it use.  My only complaint is that the instructions are written and very broken English. I recommend that you Google or go to YouTube &amp;#34;how to use high-frequency facial machine,&amp;#34; this will bring you to videos that are extremely helpful and allow you to get your best results.  Also, I recommend that you purchase facial gauze (available on Amazon), which was something that I was not aware of when I bought mine.  I guess what I should say is, do your research first, and if this is something that you want to invest in, then the price is right. I figured for $28, this wasn&#x27;t a bad deal when you compare it to a $100 facial at a saloon.  This is also something extremely important that I believe Amazon should note with these type of products, if you have any heart conditions or a pacemaker it is highly recommended that you do not use this product. I do not feel like it gave me any high voltage shocks, because I kept it low, but it is better to be safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> first order broke with in first week.....will see how long this one lasts</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work was broken</li>
    <li> I used this wand years ago in my salon and had good results. I use it for aeration, bacteria and stimulation and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after about ten hours of use.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> It does not work after 2 months of using it twice a week.</li>
    <li> This works great to prevent bumps after waxing. Seems to help facial blemishes clear up more quickly too. The power seems a bit inconsistent. It kind of fades in and out. I have only used the mushroom head attachment, which seems like the most all purpose one from the set. Good price for decent quality product. At first I was a little apprehensive to put it on my face and turn it on, but I only zapped myself once and it wasn&#x27;t painful, just startling.</li>
    <li> I am updating product the first few days seemed to work then after that I had no results</li>
    <li> Salon quality.  Super impressed with how well this works.  Clears up blemishes in a day.</li>
    <li> Tried one of these at a facial and really loved it.  When I found this one I was excited about the price but was wondering if it would work.  It does!  It helps with breakouts and cuts the healing time down significantly.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this machine for over ten years.  Had to purchase this one because my old one finally quit. Love it.</li>
    <li> it works a lot better than I thought it would.I think it would do better if I used it more often. The only bad thing about it is I had to go to u tube for directions.</li>
    <li> Me and my girlfriend love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Truly works for acne</li>
    <li> Great product only have had for a few days and its clearing mine and my sons acne and my face is looking much better</li>
    <li> Bought this machine about a week ago and received it on Saturday. What intrigued me the most was the comb attachment for thinning hair and although the reviews stated that it was flimsy it was only $30 and I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the mushroom and the spot attachments twice and liked the results. I zapped a lingering pimple that I had had for weeks and it turned dark purple within seconds (which scared me) but then went back to the original skin tone. By the next day it had shrunk to the point where I had to search for the spot so it definitely did an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the comb attachment three times and got so excited because in that short span I saw new growth in my hair which barely grows 1/4 inch a month. I was already planning the glowing reviews that I would write when during my last scalp treatment I noticed the glass comb was shaking in the tube. I turned it off and turned it upside down on my bed and the comb fell out leaving the electrode inside. I was surprised because I had been so careful and it didn&#x27;t even snag in my hair or anything. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles for the price but was hoping for at least a few months use. The good thing is now I know that the high frequency scalp massages do work I can safely spend the money to purchase a better quality unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;19/08/15&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been a few months now that I have had this machine. I did not replace it. I just use the comb attachment since the electrode for it is still stuck inside. I am amazed that it is still working and my scalp is a lot healthier after weekly scalp massages and my hair is not shedding as much as it used to. The quality could still be better but as long as it works I&#x27;ll continue to use it and reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> I had to wait until I tried it before I wrote anything. I noticed a difference after about 3 times of using. I used it on the medium frequency. There is a &amp;#34;zap&amp;#34; when it touches your skin which kept making me jump. I love the fact it took off my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied and would buy again.</li>
    <li> when he was using when the cristal  fell to the ground  and broke off. it detached from the base</li>
    <li> i originally purchased this for my 40+ skin, but I am not sure if it was working or not. I did not see any measurable results after using it a couple weeks. My daughter acne however, responded amazingly. I have only used this on her a couple of times and her acne is clearing up! Although this is not the purpose I bought it for, we are both very happy that I did. I have purchased her a lot of products to combat her acne, this is the only thing that has shown results pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this little machine! Great to zap pimples. If the pimple is swollen and it is used daily on that specific pimple it will help it go down and dry up.  As for tightening the skin I&#x27;m not sure yet. I just started using it for that purpose like a week ago.</li>
    <li> My cat was chewing on the corners of a few pieces of furniture and a leather stool. I applied this and after the first couple of times she began chewing, she stopped and has not gone back. That was 2 months ago. Great price.</li>
    <li> it does work will you have to be patient because I take this time to work I recommended like I said in the beginning you have to be patient</li>
    <li> Not sure how much it really works, but I do use it and you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Would have been excellent if it had came with the ARGON wands instead of the freon wands and you need to loosen the screw in the top before you try inserting the wands. Trust me that&#x27;s important.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my high frequency machine! My BFF is an esthetician and recommend one for the painful underground zits that never surface. Well I now use mine 3x week zit or not! My skin has never been clearer!</li>
    <li> I love my high frequency machine its the same kind the lady uses when I get my facials</li>
    <li> This thing works just as good as the machines that are higher in price! I&#x27;ve been using it to treat my cellulite and after two uses it&#x27;d almost gone! Also, I&#x27;m using it for hair growth, skin tightening , and all the other great things it treats. I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product but definitely needs tohave better instructions included. I had to research on internet and watch tons of youtube videos to figure out process. After that I used once a week and have seen results thus far.</li>
    <li> I received it nicely pack, but on the third week of using it, on one of the instrument,the bottom half (silver part) looks like it melted and I didn&#x27;t get a returned slip, If I did I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> i bought this item in the past dont remember what company but i do have to say this thing is great makes your skin look better helps acne scars and dark marks and it is worth the money this is a great item</li>
    <li> Love love love! I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner. It is the best purchase for my skin :)</li>
    <li> For the price I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough but it works amazingly! I use it daily on myself to help keep the wrinkles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions that it came with were horrible and glad I was in beauty school for esthetics when I got it. You do NOT want to hold and zap on moles and freckles, it will not make them go away but aggravate them to get bigger!</li>
    <li> I havnt had the product very long but I feel as tho it works. It has dried pimples. It works best when u put a thin cloth or gauze over ur face cuz it leave those few millimeters of space to give the machine room to shoot electricity. It doesn&#x27;t do anything nor do u feel anything when it&#x27;s directly on the skin.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Great product, great packaging, great price.  I have already recommended this to a friend.  I love the rake attachment for hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter who has stated she loves it.</li>
    <li> Poor fitting accessories.</li>
    <li> Seems to help! Don&#x27;t forget to ground the wand by keeping a finger on the bulb at all times or you&#x27;ll shock yourself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see that it does much</li>
    <li> I like it to much it really help take care about skin !!!!!!!!!!! I recommended it . The best price</li>
    <li> Power weakened with each use until it just quit working after only a few times.</li>
    <li> Have a breakout? It will disappear almost instantly after using this!</li>
    <li> Broken after 6 times of use.</li>
    <li> This item put tiny electric shock. It&#x27;s suppose to help reduce wrinkles and fine line. I haven&#x27;t seen any change but I&#x27;ve only used it 5 time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect for at home use.</li>
    <li> I have using this for some time now and watched every video on you tube on how to use it because the instructions that came with it wasn&#x27;t much help. I have been using this for months and have gotten no results</li>
    <li> Very weak shock. I suppose it&#x27;s OK for beginners.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this item at a sex shop (yeah, I like a little kink in the bedroom)  It is great for those into sensory stimulation, particularly if you are blindfolded and don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going to be touched with it.  I came to amazon to look for a replacement part as one of the glass tubes broke when it fell off the nightstand.  Imagine my surprised pleasure when I discovered the added bonus of therapeutic benefits to the skin with use for blemishes and wrinkles.  So for any of you who bought it for therapeutic purposes, consider incorporating it into your foreplay for some added benefits :)</li>
    <li> Seems to only help with non-hormonal acne. If you have pimples along your jawline/chin those are usually hormonal and I haven&#x27;t had luck with this product for that.</li>
    <li> Great system for killing bacteria &amp; whatever.  Lost strength after first use. Sent it back. The company was fast, effecient and easy to deal with.</li>
    <li> a mess, don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> A great product. It function very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  She feels that this is helping on the acne issue.  It comes with instructions which is great.</li>
    <li> Love the way my scalp feels, have notice a difference in my hair feels healthier. Not to found of the look of the design of the machine.</li>
    <li> I decided that I&#x27;d like to do a better job of taking care of my skin now that I am in my 40s; this has really helped. I use this wand a few times a week (at night) after washing my face. If anything, this has evened out my skintone-- I used to have sun freckles and sun spots on the left side of my face and they have faded dramatically after 2 months usage. I use the attachments with a men&#x27;s facial lotion (Gold Bond Ultimate Men&#x27;s Essentials Everyday) and I really think my skin looks years younger. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for 2 reasons, 1. I have had cystic/nodular acne since puberty and have scarring and acne that just won&#x27;t seem to heal long after the breakout has come and gone. 2. Starting to see sagging of skin and fine lines. It has tightened my skin somewhat. And I have noticed &amp;#34;zapping&amp;#34; pimple does quite well. I haven&#x27;t noticed the evening of skin tone or decrease in pore size mentioned in other rate postings. But again I&#x27;m 2 weeks in. I&#x27;ve wondered if the neon or argon may have some difference as to which works best with which application. My understanding is argon &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; is best suited for fine lines and wrinkles. Neon &amp;#34;Violet&amp;#34; is best for acne.</li>
    <li> I just received it yesterday, and it is fragile looking thins, and was difficult to understand the instructions, and finally figured out, first time I tried to use it, it felt OK --kind of liked the felling of touching my face, but when I tried to take the tube out, the glass tube separated from metal end, the metal end stuck in the handle, I would replace it instead returning it, but  I worry about the durability.</li>
    <li> One of the tubes came broken and the instructions are written in awful English. If my esthetician hadn&#x27;t taught me how to use it I&#x27;d be terribly confused. Storing it means keeping the bulky box, it doesn&#x27;t come with a padded sectioned bag or anything for the tubes. Try something else.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing, they heal everything so fast. I&#x27;ve been using high frequency light for my facials and my family for over a year and we are continually amazed. It doesn&#x27;t matter which gas is in the tube, they do the same thing. All of the wands that I have used and sold have worked very well. No problems at all, they have a good strong current. The instructions are not the best but there is endless information on  the internet.</li>
    <li> Works poorly and the glass tubes are so thin they break easy. I broke one trying to put it in. They don&#x27;t screw in you have to push them in to make contact. The wand gets hot and doesn&#x27;t work properly so I can only use it for a few minutes and the unplug it and let it cool off. Poor item. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> perfect. easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the system for a couple of weeks a few times a week. I like it so far, but can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I&#x27;ve also been using another facial system for tightening the skin and for wrinkles so I have been receiving benefits already. However, I do know that HF does help with acne by destroying bacteria so you can&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing this very inexpensive kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone looking to fulfill any of the objectives this system claims to accomplish. For this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it because one visit to a doctor&#x27;s office or to an esthetician is much more expensive! I would also suggest you go on YouTube for instructions on how to use the various wands because this system does NOTcome with instructions.........which is really not acceptable! Thank goodness for YouTube! I gave it 3 stars because the instructions are not included.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time as promised, everything was packaged well without damage.  However, the instructions for use were confusing and obviously written either by a 1st grader or a foreigner.  I plugged it in and began to use it and in less than a minute, it QUIT WORKING !  So I am returning it ASAP for a refund.</li>
    <li> so far so good. it woks great</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had blackheads and acne and it dried it up. Be careful not to dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I.m in love with this thing. The end :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item for a few weeks and love it.  Highly recommended!  Prompt shipping too!</li>
    <li> I bought one like this a couple of years ago, and I thought I loved it... When I got this today I was super excited because I have a *ew* massive boil on my chin. I KNOW that zapping makes the boils go away faster, so I ran to my bathroom to tear open the package and use it. The one that I had before I would use at full power and not even thing about it. This one? I turned it all the way up and OMG, I kind of jumped it was so strong!!! BUT THAT IS A VERY GOOD THING! Instead of sitting there for 20 min on the same blemish I can do what needs to be done in 3! AT THE MOST! I can&#x27;t use it all the way powered up, but I am so in love with this. I have never used it on anything other than blemishes, but I am PRETTY sure that if it works this well on my face, it would work on everything else it says it does. I wonder if the husband will let me zap his head???</li>
    <li> Must be doing something because I was carded at an over 21 club and I&#x27;m almost 40. lol&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I noticed recently, my eyelashes have become very long and silky. I don&#x27;t even use mascara much now, I just use an eyelash curler and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> This device does nothing for wrinkles... Be careful, if you have a facial hair.... you will get much more after using this device.</li>
    <li> Received the box very fast and everything was in perfect condition. This unit did have the US style plug ends which I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, only was able to use once so far so can&#x27;t say if this works to tighten skin or rid wrinkles yet but I can say this...I used the little skinny wand to zap a zit that I literally had on my chin for a month.  I still had oil on my face after using all the other wants for a while on my face and when I used the skinny glass tube to zap the zit, it hurt and burned a lot.  I removed the oil off my face and redid it and although you can feel the heat from it, it was not painful and guess what..the zit was almost gone the next day and completely gone in 2 days! better and faster than using Retin A for a week and dealing with all the redness and peeling you get from that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update  my review on the wrinkles and tightening effects.  Hope it works for that!  It would truly be a miracle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this now, everyday for about a week.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference other than having red splotches on my forehead between my brows.  I&#x27;ve been spot treating a clogged pore with it hoping that it would unclog the pore, or at least make it smaller, but it hasn&#x27;t.  All that I can say is that it leaves your face tingly like it&#x27;s been shocked.  I&#x27;ve watched all the videos on youtube, but still haven&#x27;t seen any of the changes that the other reviewers have said they got.  I&#x27;m going to keep it, because I really do want it to work.  As for the instructions, mine were pretty clear, but like I said...I watched the videos before I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Device was as shown, but instructions are pitiful. What&#x27;s the screw for?  No instructions at all on original set up. Mine was delivered with a broken electrode. Just requested return for that reason.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Mom and I have a much more expensive unit but they are practically the exact same but mine is black.  They work the same have the same attachments and feel the same.  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have paid $100 for mine and just gotten this one for me as well.  We both believe this works to rejuvenate the skin cells.  It&#x27;s lifted my sagging eye brow that used to be noticeably lower than my other eye brown so they are even.  Start out with it at the lowest setting.  :o)</li>
    <li> Im loving this product, only had it 3 days and it&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Paula Jones</li>
    <li> I recently purchase this DW it&#x27;s a great product, I find it works the first time I tried it I had a pimple and the next day it went down which the pimple usually take about three days to go down. I also have acne scars and age spot one of the main reason I purchase the DW will give more feed back later on.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, item as described.</li>
    <li> Really woks, wrinkles almost gone</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t take it when I travel, so it was not possible to use this daily.  The product doesn&#x27;t good instructions and I think it gave me a broken capillary on my face.  (It sure wasn&#x27;t there before I used this.) I really didn&#x27;t see any results, but I wasn&#x27;t able to use it daily, so that could be part of the problem.  I sent mine back after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I chose 4 stars because this is a good machine and does what it is supposed to. It came quickly with all parts intact and works well.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted at the price but wondered how well it would work. It works just fine. I use it daily for my daughters skin to help with breakouts and it is working great! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE AT ALL. LEFT A FUNNY SMELL ON FACE AND IT JUST WASNT GREAT. ACTUALLY RETURNED</li>
    <li> This is a junk. It fell apart after one week of very gentle use. Going away for 2 weeks with no time to return. Money down the toilet. The glass wand came out and the metal part is still in the machine. It was held together with one little bead of glue.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this.  Thinking about sending it back. I&#x27;ve used several times but have not seen any results.  Instructions are very vague.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and exactly like the ones at the Skin Renewal Clinics. I would have liked more information and instructions on the other instruments included in the case. They were vague.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell you if this thing works but not because I haven&#x27;t used it (I&#x27;ve used this thing on everyone! (Me, my husband, friends...) but because it has varying degrees of results for different people.  Sometimes I feel like it blasts zits no problem, other times I&#x27;m not sure it does anything (Except smell like copper...which it does when it&#x27;s on)  It&#x27;s definitely not reduced any wrinkles or tightened my (or anyone else&#x27;s) skin.</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
    <li> Gets rid of acne scars!!  The best product ever!!! SO HAPPY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got it Wednesday and it worked for all of 10 mins and then the thing barely worked. Very disappointed to say the least</li>
    <li> Love this so far. Only been using for about 1 1/2 months. So far, nice results.</li>
    <li> its very good given the price</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first, but after watching Youtube videos, I wanted try, and I am glad that I took the chance.  After a week of using this HF machine, I have noticed pores on my nose area got smaller and my skin feels much softer than before.  I haven&#x27;t tried the comb attachment yet, but overall this machine sure works well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Live this! It works amazing. My only real issue is that it only has the neon bulb. It mentions that it comes with the neon bulb in the description,but it would be nice to have the UV bulb too.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 3 weeks almost daily. Noticed a lot of dandruff on the comb attachment for the first 2 weeks (never had dandruff in my life, got scared) - but I guess it was a natural exfoliation going on and now comb is clean and my scalp in the part area is shiny. Healthy scalp - healthy hair, so that&#x27;s a plus. Been using a mushroom attachment for my face - I did notice that skin is firmer, tighter and in general, feels like circulation has improved. Used the skinny attachment once on a household member who gets deep, swollen, painful, almost boil-like pimple now and then. Zapped it twice, followed with tea tree oil treatment and it was like it never happened. Usually those used to linger for 10+ days. I keep mine tucked under the living room sofa so that I remember to do it every night while watching TV :)</li>
    <li> I love it I bought another for my sister she loved it .every body says I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
    <li> I sent it back.  Within a few days of using it, it stopped working.  Also, very cumbersome and not user friendly.  Too hard to store easily and with the glass tubes it was not really safe.  Hard to push the rods into the base.  All in all, a very poor product.</li>
    <li> love this for zapping zits and works pretty good to dry them out. I am trying the hair growth tool to see if this works as well as its not as powerful as doctors office but has some good power</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t bet the price. I worked in a spa years ago and they charged 65 $ A season. I will tell my friends about this. My black heads are alot smaller.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks so I am still not sure if it is helping or not but I am hopeful. I had to go on you tube and watch a video for this type of system to find out how to use it, One of the tube accessories has already come out of its base but I have just switched to another one. If I decide it is worth it I can buy the accessories separately.</li>
    <li> When I received this it appeared to have been already open, the sticker seal was broken and the glass probes had finger prints on them and were not wrapped or secure with in the box itself, also looked either used, but for sure had been opened and handled, then once I started using the High Frequency it was HORRIBLE QUALITY, i guess you get what you pay for, really BUMMED.</li>
    <li> Hard to figure out, no directions come with the kit and there are multiple tools, but pretty excited to see some results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to combat skin breakouts in middle age.  I always had great skin and suddenly I&#x27;m dealing with daily breakouts and deep volcanos that were being slow to heal.  I figured for a round $30 bucks it was no worse than buying an expensive cream treatment so I&#x27;d give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  This is not a magic wand but it&#x27;s close.  It makes breakouts clear up quickly (usually almost gone the next day and completely gone in 2 days) and my skin tone on my neck seems firmer.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, probably closer to 2-3 times a week but I feel like it is working.  I looked up techniques on you-tube because it did not come with very good instructions (definitely written by someone who speaks English as a second language) but the Internet has plenty of opinions how to use these wands.  I use the technique where I hold the wand just short of touching my skin allowing the current to zap the area where the breakout is.  I have not found it is drying out my skin like most acne creams will so this is now my go-to gadget.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my step mom for Christmas, she&#x27;s really into skin care products. The day after she got it she plugged it in to use and then it shocked her.I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it supposed to do,but she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my clients who have acne breakouts. Works great however it seems to diminish on power if used for more than 10 mins at a time. Other than that I have no complaints as of now.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive substitute for a tesla coil.</li>
    <li> After applying this I was swollen so much my mouth around it and my cheeks I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL I had an infection don&#x27;t ask me HOW</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I used to have small sebaceous cysts on my chin and after just a few uses they are gone, and my pores are smaller. Don&#x27;t know about wrinkles yet but it works wonders for a healthy glow and to shrink pores and get rid of stubborn old age pimples</li>
    <li> Design issue: It is nice to have different tubes for different purpose. However, because it is not a fixed tube, on my first use, the glass tube felt off and dropped into pieces on my hard wood floor. My hardwood floor got scratches.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to avoid this and buy one that has fixed tube or one that has better design to secure the position of the tube.</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it, it runs your blood pressure up.</li>
    <li> I give it a 4.5. Noticeable difference after three uses. I recommend this product as a supplement to your facial care routine.</li>
    <li> good skin care device</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something like this for some time for hair loss around my edges due to chemical damage.  So far I am having great success.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for me. I used it everyday. Instructions were not clear so I had to do my own research on how to use it correctly. With all that said, I have had no results or changes on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It works great.</li>
    <li> Came fast, and well packaged.  For the price that I paid it can&#x27;t be much better.  I have been using it for a month now and have noticed an improvement in breakouts.  Every time I feel a zit about to come out I zap it with this thing.</li>
    <li> Seems ro work well...so I cant wait to see the results!</li>
    <li> It does its Job. awesome investment.</li>
    <li> seems to be clearing up my aged spots on myface not so much on anything else but there is a noticable lighter difference ,kinda smells like you have been in a tanning bed afterwards we will see how well it works in the long run but for the price i was very happy</li>
    <li> People started complementing me more, asking if I&#x27;m doing/using anything new on my skin ;) I just love it! My pores are smaller and my skin feels a little firmer.</li>
    <li> Love!!!!! A must have for all skin types.</li>
</ol>
