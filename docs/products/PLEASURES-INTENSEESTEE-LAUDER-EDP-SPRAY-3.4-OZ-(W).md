    <li> As advertised, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received the product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I finally have estee lauder pleasures and it smells amazing.  Its strong and stays on all day.  Always get compliments on it. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I always get complements when I wear this perfume. People tell me I smell like I just got out of a bath with flowers. It smells great to almost everyone because it is very reminiscent of a Jasmine tree in full bloom. Who doesn&#x27;t love that!? When you sweat, it just releases that scent more strongly. A small bottle will last you quite a while, but the bigger bottle will last you at least 8-12 months. It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny. If you like a more citrus-y scent though, try Pleasures Exotic.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife many years back. She loved it so much that she got another one after the first one was over. We got the second one from Costco for $35</li>
    <li> A good every day fragrance for work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of perfumes until I smelled EL Pleasures Intense. And each time I wear it, people tell me how they like it.</li>
    <li> No era para mi, sin embargo la mujer q lo esta disfrutando esta absolutamente encantada con &amp;eacute;l. No hay como un buen perfume.</li>
    <li> to buy it arrived very quickly and in perfect condition, I found the product in the catalog of amazon emphasizing quality, the seller and the price. I recommend it smells delicious, I like it.</li>
    <li> I recieved it in time, and the item was perfect. I enjoy  it and plan to bay this again, when my new one ends</li>
    <li> Product as described. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this.  The fragrance is so nice.</li>
    <li> I first picked this fragrance up when I was 16 and loved it immediately. My family bought me a small bottle for Christmas that year. It lasts a long time, the fragrance is very floral but also incredibly unique. Ten years later wanting perfume I ordered this and a few others but this is still my favorite it seems! I hope they never stop making this scent.</li>
    <li> I love this sent! I&#x27;m not a big parfume person but I enjoys this a lot!</li>

    <li> Wrong &amp;#34;Pleasures.&amp;#34; Didn&#x27;t want &amp;#34;Intense.&amp;#34; Tried to stop the order twice, but on the second try the sender claimed it was &amp;#34;too late.&amp;#34; Of course. I guess I&#x27;ll go back to Macy&#x27;s where I can see what I&#x27;m getting before it&#x27;s wrapped.</li>
    <li> It was a real pleasure to give someone you love and get good satisfaction, we are happy with this perfume</li>
