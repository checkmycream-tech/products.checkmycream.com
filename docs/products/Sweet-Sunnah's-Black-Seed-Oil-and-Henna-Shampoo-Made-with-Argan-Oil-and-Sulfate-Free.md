      <li>I like this product because it really works!</li>
      <li>From the first time I used it, my hair was noticeably softer and smoother and shinier.  </li>
      <li>this shampoo made my hair frizzy and I ended up getting more flyaways it also made it dry and extremly tangled</li>

      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I had great hopes for this black seed oil shampoo due to its use and understanding of islamic tradition of medicinal purposes</li>
      <li>I love black seed oil.  </li>
      <li>however the sulfate ingredient is to heavy to use on hair and is also cheap so thats why companies find it useful in their product</li>
      <li>Possibly made my hair more fragile!</li>
      <li>Im highly dissapointed</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these products.</li>
      <li>Honestly I have bought two bottles used probably half this lathers pretty well due to it having</li>
      <li>I am still loosing hair and have not seen any new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen new hair growth coming out in areas where I was losing hair.</li>
      <li>Start seeing new growth could also feel tingling on head at night.</li>
      <li>If your looking for a healthy alternative to harsh, stripping shampoos, then this it for you!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>the other herbal ingredients are good henna makes your hair feel and look heavy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things - extra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners and special hair masks and treatments, and even swimmers shampoo and conditioner, which only worked marginally well.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the hair quite light and fluffy and I do not even have to use any conditioner, I know henna is a natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is also clear, no color to it.</li>
      <li>Smells like essential oils and really cleans your hair without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and detangled after use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember a time when my hair was this soft.</li>
      <li>Stripped my hair completely.</li>
      <li>this product isnt cheap for a shampoo its money waste.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that It is all natural</li>
      <li>Before I began using this product I had soft shiny hair with no split ends</li>
      <li>after all, its your hair, and its worth every dollar spent.</li>
      <li>The only not so good side I would say is that it is more expensive than common brands on the market.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended I cant wait to see results with long term use.</li>
      <li>Although I did not use it to stop my hairloss, I was surprised to find out that after a few months use, I am not loosing as much hair as I used to.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately has a very strong medicinal smell that lingers in the bathroom and on the hair.</li>

<li> Unfortunately has a very strong medicinal smell that lingers in the bathroom and on the hair.</li>
<li> I was looking for a less expensive, more natural product comparable to Aveda products, but this was not the answer.</li>
<li> The scent is not great, but is not overwhelming or long lasting, so it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
<li> Its hard too lather......takes a lot of shampoo to really get the lather going....</li>
<li> I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
<li> but what is the point of that when the hair you have is tangled , shedding , dry and frizzy</li>
<li> But this is a quality herbal product, and I definitely recommend spending the extra few bucks to get a quality product like this...</li>
<li> I have medium length black south asian hair which is not naturally frizzy but rather silky and wavy.</li>
<li> and now my hair is starting to look dull and dry, and the ends are starting to split.</li>
<li> I am hardly a shampoo expert, bought this only because I needed a present for my hair crazy sister and because I love black seed oil and so decided  to try this, too.</li>
<li> If u have white hairs it will turn thought suckers brownish red .</li>
<li> The bottle is smaller, but I use very little on my medium-length hair.</li>
<li> but I am extremely hopeful.</li>
<li> there has to be a range of other ingredients which can lessen the effect this product does if supposed they changed and removed this ingredient to sodium cocoyl glutamate which is less damaging to hair</li>
<li> I have naturally dark brown hair.  </li>
<li> I bought this for the benefits of the black seed oil because I have scalp psoriasis.  </li>
<li> I myself was looking for a kalonji shampoo and value the use of black seed oil</li>
<li> It will make black hair slightly lighter .</li>
<li> however it is heavy and to over throw the effect of it</li>
<li> Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of swimming in a pool, and my hair has started to get stringy and dry and dull.  </li>
<li> I just gave my mom some of this shampoo and told her to use it since she is complaining about her hair lately.</li>
<li> I try to avoid those artificial colors and scents.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
<li> Hate it.</li>
<li> Smells outrageous!  </li>

    <li> I have been using this product since I received it on April 20th.  I still have dandruff so I have to use a dandruff shampoo with this. I am still loosing hair and have not seen any new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months now and I can say that my hair has gotten fuller and thicker. I&#x27;ve seen new hair growth coming out in areas where I was losing hair. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo with the conditioner plus the Rosemary Carrot Hair Oil. Highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> No actual effects. Possibly made my hair more fragile!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference with this shampoo though it did get my hair clean.  I didn&#x27;t notice it making my hair any softer or thicker.</li>
    <li> Hate it. Giving it to the homeless shelter.Stripped my hair completely.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been sleek and smooth, even though I color it to cover the gray.  I have naturally dark brown hair.  Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of swimming in a pool, and my hair has started to get stringy and dry and dull.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things - extra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners and special hair masks and treatments, and even swimmers shampoo and conditioner, which only worked marginally well.  A friend told me to try henna, so I tried this and I absolutely LOVE IT.  From the first time I used it, my hair was noticeably softer and smoother and shinier.  I have to say, even my skin is softer, too.  I will buy this again for sure, and will also try the conditioner as well.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a healthy alternative to harsh, stripping shampoos, then this it for you! It smells great, and the ingredients are fantastic also! I would definetly reccommend this product to a friend and i will be buying this again shorty.</li>
    <li> I have fine color treated hair.  This product adds volume and doesn&#x27;t strip color.  It has a great clean scent and works very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvements in shine or manageability.  The scent is not great, but is not overwhelming or long lasting, so it&#x27;s OK.  Not worth the cost of shipment, since many products at my local grocery or drugstore are just as good and of equal or lower price.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair clean, soft &amp; light.  My hair color looks fabulous also.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it really works! I really love the way this product smells, it smells like spicy flowers. It really smells good. I definitely would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants an all natural kind of product that is full of healthy ingredients. I give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> Honestly I have bought two bottles used probably half this lathers pretty well due to it having olefin sulfonate is it a form of SLS maybe on the ranking is low risk however it is heavy and to over throw the effect of it there has to be a range of other ingredients which can lessen the effect this product does if supposed they changed and removed this ingredient to sodium cocoyl glutamate which is less damaging to hair this shampoo made my hair frizzy and I ended up getting more flyaways it also made it dry and extremly tangled I was tearing hairs off it was a night mare the other herbal ingredients are good henna makes your hair feel and look heavy which is fine but what is the point of that when the hair you have is tangled , shedding , dry and frizzy I have medium length black south asian hair which is not naturally frizzy but rather silky and wavy. I myself was looking for a kalonji shampoo and value the use of black seed oil however the sulfate ingredient is to heavy to use on hair and is also cheap so thats why companies find it useful in their product this product isnt cheap for a shampoo its money waste.

    <li> Great product, wish it came in larger size. Didn&#x27;t really notice any hair growth but hair felt finer and softer and smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the benefits of the black seed oil because I have scalp psoriasis.  I do not feel that it helped my scalp in any way.  So I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expensive, more natural product comparable to Aveda products, but this was not the answer. Before I began using this product I had soft shiny hair with no split ends and now my hair is starting to look dull and dry, and the ends are starting to split.</li>
    <li> I love black seed oil.  I have used several brands and like them all.  I have ordered this brand twice and used it all up.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This is a great, shampoo that makes my hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t dull it. The bottle is smaller, but I use very little on my medium-length hair. I love the aroma. Thec onditioner is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember a time when my hair was this soft. I need to use it for a few more weeks to give it an honest review, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Smells outrageous!  I was looking for a natural product that worked well and smelled good.  This one is terrific.  Smells like essential oils and really cleans your hair without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately has a very strong medicinal smell that lingers in the bathroom and on the hair. Only used once, so can&#x27;t speak to its benefits to the scalp or hair growth it may have</li>
    <li> ordered grape seed oil and received this . ordering grape seed oil again and hope this time I will get it .</li>
    <li> Like the way it makes your hair feel. Smells good and will order again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product is everything it is suppose to be.</li>
    <li> Cleans pretty well ESP for it to be sulfate free. My hair feels soft and detangled after use. It also has a nice clean smell. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, baarakAllah feek.I like what it does to my hair... makes it more manageable. I like the fact that It is all natural</li>
    <li> This product is not for me. Thank you very much,</li>
    <li> Its hard too lather......takes a lot of shampoo to really get the lather going....I was not expressed at all!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good....Going to try again..</li>
    <li> This is a excellent shampoo . I had to discontinue though . the reason? Henna! It will make black hair slightly lighter . If u have white hairs it will turn thought suckers brownish red .</li>
    <li> I am hardly a shampoo expert, bought this only because I needed a present for my hair crazy sister and because I love black seed oil and so decided  to try this, too. WOW! Good stuff - my hair has never been this silky before! I was a little worried about the lathering properties since it is without LSL but it foams great.</li>
    <li> ok i wanting the oil instead.my mistake i want the oil not the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over six months now. Although I did not use it to stop my hairloss, I was surprised to find out that after a few months use, I am not loosing as much hair as I used to. Actually it was quite a noticeable change. The shampoo is also clear, no color to it. It has quite a mild scent. I try to avoid those artificial colors and scents. It leaves the hair quite light and fluffy and I do not even have to use any conditioner, I know henna is a natural conditioner. I just gave my mom some of this shampoo and told her to use it since she is complaining about her hair lately. The only not so good side I would say is that it is more expensive than common brands on the market. But this is a quality herbal product, and I definitely recommend spending the extra few bucks to get a quality product like this... after all, its your hair, and its worth every dollar spent.</li>
    <li> This product came in or time and in great order. the packaging was great and the product is exactly what they said that it would be.</li>
    <li> I just tried it once and already I am hooked :) I only used a pea size amount and it just glides through your hair wonderfully. I cant obviously speak for the hair growth part yet but I am extremely hopeful. I love the consistancy and my hair didn&#x27;t tangle it felt great when I rinsed it out. Highly recommended I cant wait to see results with long term use. My hair feels like silk! thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product, i love the results. Start seeing new growth could also feel tingling on head at night. Years of unintentionally damaging my hair has result in thinning and eventually leads to bald spot.  My wife loves it also</li>
