      <li>I love philosophy washes but seen this and thought I&#x27;d try it and very glad I did!!</li>
      <li>It does indeed smell good.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this!</li>
      <li>I love the scent!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and excellent packaging.  </li>
      <li>and I love the feel of it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will be purchasing this item again.  </li>
      <li>Scent is so subjective, however, that I imagine that others would love it.  </li>
      <li>I bought all of the cupcake line and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I usually love Vitabath.....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet-smelling and lathers great.</li>
      <li>We love the scent of this bath wash and it makes lots of bubbles.</li>
      <li>I love that it is free of many harmful products that many bodywashes contain.</li>
      <li>Vitabath has helped me be able to bathe and shower so much more comfortably without itching and scratching so severely after a bath.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making a product without floral overkill that makes my sensitive skin happy!</li>
      <li>I read about the ingredients and that it was sulfate and paraben free</li>
      <li>I have fair skin that is easily irritated, and to top it off, it can get really dry.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kinda strong in the bottle because it&#x27;s super concentrated, but when you use it in the shower it washes away and doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin.</li>
      <li>The rich scent does not stay on my skin after I rinse it off so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first use; my skin was softer, no signs of pores being clogged and it smelled fantastic!  </li>
      <li>It must be the sweet almond that makes it muskier.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>Will be back to buy more :)</li>
      <li>:) it smells like frosted cake and leaves your skin feeling soft!</li>
      <li>Even though the odor seems too strong when I took off the lid,  the fragrance when used was pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>and it made great fluffy bubbles too...</li>
      <li>I got a sample in the mall and loved it so much that I ordered a bigger bottle!</li>
      <li>I want to drink it right out of the bottle</li>
      <li>That smells like something right out of the oven.  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin REALLY smooth, more so than the other&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This is a very good product if you&#x27;re looking to get unnecessary chemicals out of your routine.  </li>
      <li>But the improvements it has made with my skin is more than enough justification to continue buying this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this body wash, but I only give 4 stars because every time I order it, it has leaked in the packaging it comes in.</li>
      <li>It seems to be very gently on my skin and that is very important in the winter when dry skin is a persistent problem.  </li>
      <li>I liked other scents by this brand, but I really cannot stand this particular scent.  </li>
      <li>frosting\\&quot; led me to believe it would be a lighter scent than it really is.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I will always look for a body wash such as this one,  free of parabens and alcohols.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new staple for shower time!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the wonderful smell doesn&#x27;t stick with you long after a shower.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to all skin types; I know I look forward to using it</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I will be more careful when I reorder and not have it packaged with other items.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t agree that it smells exactly like Dreamy Pink Frosting.  </li>
      <li>I once bought a yellow Soft-soap hand soap pump that was supposed to be vanilla that had the same chemical smell to me, so there is probably a particular vanilla additive that I am sensitive to.  </li>
      <li>It does really smell like a cupcake with pink frosting.</li>

<li> It does really smell like a cupcake with pink frosting.</li>
<li> It is very thick and rich.</li>
<li> A bath is NOT complete with this luscious bubbly concoction!</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, the quality is there.  </li>
<li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you out of the shower so don&#x27;t worry about smelling like Pink Frosting</li>
<li> The name \\&quot;pink</li>
<li> Vitabath Dreamy Pink Frosting comes out of the bottle in translucent, shiny pink.  </li>
<li> I am diabetic and have extremely itchy skin.</li>
<li> This has a mild Bubblegum undercurrent to it with perhaps a very faint plastic-like smell.  </li>
<li> The bottle was not closed tightly and at least 4 ounces were all over the inside of the box!</li>
<li> A little pricey for a body wash though.</li>
<li> It is not a warm scent though like Jaqua&#x27;s Pink Buttercream Frosting soap and lotion.  </li>
<li> I like how this smells but after using it for a few washes I noticed that my skin was a bit irritated by it.</li>
<li> Looking forward to trying green tea scent and others.</li>
<li> so I usually use Aveeno.</li>
<li> The label also looked like someone cut it with a knife.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this is my only disappointment with Vitabath.</li>
<li> &quot; kick as of late.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if my container was old or had gone bad, but it had an unpleasant combination of chemical and butterscotch smell that irritated my nose and the back of my throat.  </li>
<li> It has a very artificial vanilla scent to me.  </li>
<li> This bath gel is so yummy without any of the bad stuff like sulfates &amp; parabens in it!</li>
<li> I am giving it four stars instead of five because I was very disappointed with the shipping and handling.</li>

    <li> This is the most delicious body wash I have ever smelled. I bought all of the cupcake line and this is my favorite. It does really smell like a cupcake with pink frosting. The smell is kinda strong in the bottle because it&#x27;s super concentrated, but when you use it in the shower it washes away and doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. It&#x27;s moisturizing and non-irritating. I have to rotate with another body wash because sometimes I&#x27;m not in the mood to smell cupcakes.</li>
    <li> I smell like a cupcake!</li>
    <li> Vita Bath products are wonderful! I am diabetic and have extremely itchy skin. Vitabath has helped me be able to bathe and shower so much more comfortably without itching and scratching so severely after a bath.</li>
    <li> I liked other scents by this brand, but I really cannot stand this particular scent.  It has a very artificial vanilla scent to me.  Scent is so subjective, however, that I imagine that others would love it.  I once bought a yellow Soft-soap hand soap pump that was supposed to be vanilla that had the same chemical smell to me, so there is probably a particular vanilla additive that I am sensitive to.  I couldn&#x27;t detect any almond or sugary smell to it.</li>
    <li> Omg this smells sooo good!!! I love philosophy washes but seen this and thought I&#x27;d try it and very glad I did!! :) it smells like frosted cake and leaves your skin feeling soft! Will be back to buy more :)</li>
    <li> Makes me and my bathroom smell like birthday cake. It is very thick and rich. It makes a great lather.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my container was old or had gone bad, but it had an unpleasant combination of chemical and butterscotch smell that irritated my nose and the back of my throat.  I wasn&#x27;t about to use it - I just threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot; kick as of late.  This is a very good product if you&#x27;re looking to get unnecessary chemicals out of your routine.  It leaves skin REALLY smooth, more so than the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  And who can beat the price??  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is b/c of the scent.  The name \\&quot;pink frosting\\&quot; led me to believe it would be a lighter scent than it really is.  It must be the sweet almond that makes it muskier.  It&#x27;s not bad, just not what I was expecting.  Looking forward to trying green tea scent and others.</li>
    <li> We love the scent of this bath wash and it makes lots of bubbles. However I will never order from Park Avenue again. The bottle was not closed tightly and at least 4 ounces were all over the inside of the box! The label also looked like someone cut it with a knife.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this is my only disappointment with Vitabath.It feels luxurious and smells wonderful during a shower. The rich scent does not stay on my skin after I rinse it off so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.It is luxurious bath wash at drug store prices.  I am giving it four stars instead of five because I was very disappointed with the shipping and handling. I will be more careful when I reorder and not have it packaged with other items.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin that is easily irritated, and to top it off, it can get really dry.  I read about the ingredients and that it was sulfate and paraben free, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I noticed a difference after the first use; my skin was softer, no signs of pores being clogged and it smelled fantastic!  My only complaint is that the wonderful smell doesn&#x27;t stick with you long after a shower.  But the improvements it has made with my skin is more than enough justification to continue buying this product.  I look forward to stocking up on different scents in the future.  I would highly recommend this product to all skin types; I know I look forward to using it everytime I shower.</li>
    <li> Soften my body, sudsy, and smells delicious</li>

The fragrances are perfect without being overwhelming or underwhelming or setting off my fragrance allergies! Thanks for making a product without floral overkill that makes my sensitive skin happy! I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> A bath is NOT complete with this luscious bubbly concoction! I&#x27;ve used VitaBath for over 26 years and it&#x27;s my sinful indulgence in my baths!</li>
    <li> This shower gel smells so awesome I want to drink it right out of the bottle..smells soooo delicious!I used it in the tub and it made great fluffy bubbles too...I am a big fan of Philosophy bath products..this seem just as good and a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent packaging.  Item as described. I love this product and will be purchasing this item again.  I also bought this for my daughter and she also loves it.  The smell is wonderful but not overpowering.  The only thing is that I wish it came in a larger economy size bottle.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love that it is free of many harmful products that many bodywashes contain. It smells great and I love the feel of it.</li>
