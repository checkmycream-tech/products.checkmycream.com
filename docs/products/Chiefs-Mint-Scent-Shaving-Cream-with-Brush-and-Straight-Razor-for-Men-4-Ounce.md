<ol>
      <li>and he was very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Great lather!</li>
      <li>My husband was really impressed with the quality of this shaving cream from Chiefs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He said it is the best shave cream he has ever used.</li>
      <li>Great way to start the day!  </li>
      <li>Very good</li>
      <li>He says good lather and very nice manly scent!</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>: this isn&#x27;t great shaving cream if you like to use a brush.</li>
      <li>It is a great combination and very appealing to the nose.  </li>
      <li>To my pleasant surprise, &#x27;Chiefs&#x27; is among the best I&#x27;ve experienced and made right here in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and feels amazing on your face if you like mint</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin.  </li>
      <li>The Good:</li>
      <li>- Smells good (like Noxzema)</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>He loved the fact that it also did not gunk up his razor, allowing him to continue shaving without having to take the time to unclog it.</li>
      <li>Not So Good:</li>
      <li>Sort of a Noxema smell and consistency, smells great, lubricates for a great shave, leaves a cool sensation after use.</li>
      <li>Not too overpowering, and his face was very smooth!</li>
      <li>Gives me a great shave and feels great, smells good, and is definitely worth getting.</li>
      <li>The product also has a very nice smell to it, very clean and crisp...not over-powering.</li>
      <li>a close smooth shave and your face feels great after you are done shaving.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s got some kind of lotion built into it that doesn&#x27;t rinse off which leaves my face feeling moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just as effective as thicker creams)</li>
      <li>I think this cream would be nice for a disposable blade (you know the ones with 5 blades they lock up at the drug store) guy or gal as a replacement to an aerosol spray can of cream.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>It smells good, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>cream lathers nicely, and my husband preferred to use the shaving cream with out the brush he had.&lt;br</li>
      <li>even liked the scent that remained on his face after shaving.</li>
      <li>My husband does not use a brush to apply his shaving cream and it was very easy to apply just with his hand.  </li>
      <li>The scent is amazing, gives a comfy shave, but it&#x27;s the fresh invigorated feeling that is really great, Taylor of old Bond street and Chiefs are the two best</li>
      <li>and you have to use more than what it says to get a nice lather.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He got a nice clean shave, and said he felt refreshed and had a nice cooling sensation on his face.</li>
      <li>After I used for the first time i am truly impressed at how smooth this is and how smooth my skin is afterwards...</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>- Cute jar (my wife likes the jar)</li>
      <li>We would for sure recommend it.</li>
      <li>Lot&#x27;s of better options for us brush-hounds.</li>
      <li>The smell is manly and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the scent he had after using this shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always have time to break out the badger brush, and I&#x27;m not too keen on most mass-produced brands of shave cream.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this lather.</li>
      <li>We will definately be getting more of this for ourselves and be giving it out as gifts.</li>
      <li>Cremo but better smelling and over twice the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing that I find myself wanting to shave twice on some days, just as a pick me up.</li>
      <li>The lather for this product was super-easy to work with, one of the better lathering creams I’ve tried out there.</li>
      <li>Love the shave it gives, just wish it smelled a bit better.</li>
      <li>Amazingly lubricated, cool and a completely enjoyable shave.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pretty good as well, it smells like a more thought out Proraso.</li>
      <li>is a high quality product and would make a very nice gift for any man who shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It left his face smooth, refreshed and smelling wonderful.  </li>
      <li>He LOVED it so much I ordered more.</li>
      <li>The smell is so strong it can stop a moose at a full gallop!</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was how much I liked the smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
      <li>The cream was smooth and easily came off as the razor went across his face.  </li>
      <li>First, where the Chiefs  BEST Shaving Cream fell short......</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for making my husband smell and look great.</li>
      <li>His face felt so smooth</li>
      <li>Amazing wash thats very earthly and organic.</li>
      <li>It is a morning ritual that I enjoy.</li>
      <li>It lathers really well and has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Everyone else pick with what you like and enjoy your shave.</li>
      <li>To be fair I have an allergic reaction ,so far, to all the shaving creams ,and soaps, I&#x27;ve tried from amazon.</li>
      <li>Overall I am pretty happy with it and will continue to order more.</li>
      <li>It is of high quality and an overall wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to generating a rich lather when using a brush, and that&#x27;s not happening with this shave cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a single blade shaver for many, many years and the cream is a very important part of the mix, thus I have tried everything under the sun and from all around the world.</li>
      <li>Lastly, their customer service is very good as someone reached out to me on multiple occasions to see if everything was okay.</li>
      <li>He said especially in the hot summer weather like we are having it was a very nice</li>
      <li>It quickly became my go to shave creams.</li>
      <li>I was relegated (as the instructions indicate) to take a nickle (or more for me with three passes) sized dollop and apply to my face directly.</li>
      <li>and I defy anyone using a brush to get the right amount - should I use a spoon?</li>
      <li>I guess if you followed the instructions and use a &amp;#34;nickel&amp;#34; sized dollop, it lasts longer - I really, truly tried to shave with a nickel sized dollop, as it says to on the instructions - ouch - no slick coating - needs more soap</li>
      <li>He said he liked it so much that he will actually buy this product</li>
      <li>The only shave soap product that work for me that I&#x27;ve tried so far is good ol&#x27; fashioned Barbsol or Williams shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>For the cost, doesn&#x27;t lather like some of the other brands (Taylor of Old Bond Street for sure) but the cool menthol feeling is definitely refreshing.</li>
      <li>The amount needed to get a good lather has gone up because of it and trying to get a good wet shave going is a bit more difficult.</li>
      <li>It had a great scent and it produced a really thick lather.</li>
      <li>Expensive, but the best shave you will ever get.</li>
      <li>I still enjoy the shave, but for somebody with a bit sensitive skin and hair that grows sideways</li>
      <li>I tried on CHIEFS shaving cream when it first came out.</li>
      <li>Not that impressed with the item because I found it difficult to use with a badger shaving brush.</li>
      <li>When the container is first opened, the first noticeable is the scent of peppermint/menthol.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much I put on the brush, it just wouldn&#x27;t lather!</li>
      <li>It leaves his skin so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>The lime scent was strong as well and left me feeling quite fresh.</li>
      <li>My son said he really didn&#x27;t need to use much of the cream to get stellar results.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s lots of shave creams on the market that aren&#x27;t really creams.  </li>
      <li>He also had no nicks, which really agitates him to the point of not shaving.</li>
      <li>It is very invigorating.  </li>
      <li>so the brush doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, you will recieve 3 emails about pushing you to review their product and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well with a shave brush.</li>
      <li>We love that this company offers a 100% MONEY back GUARANTEE!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a shaving aficionado, I just use a regular disposable shaver from the grocery store,but my nephew turned me onto Chiefs and it&#x27;s by far my favorite shaving cream</li>
      <li>I really like a good thick lather to pull up the hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take to the brush very well, whether direct or from the hand.</li>
      <li>As a man who has been wet shaving for many years, badger hair brush, double edged shaver, Japanese blades, Chiefs BEST Shaving Cream unfortunately did not cut it.</li>

    <li> Great lather! Close shave!</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin.  This is a soft cream and not a hard soap.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s lots of shave creams on the market that aren&#x27;t really creams.  This is a cream ... its thick, kinda oily, and doesn&#x27;t foam at all.  While some folks will like that, it didn&#x27;t work well for me or my shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Not many shaves per jar.  The Good: - Smells good (like Noxzema) - Cute jar (my wife likes the jar) - Works well enough to shave  The Not So Good: - I have shaved less than 10 times and it is 90% gone - I guess if you followed the instructions and use a &amp;#34;nickel&amp;#34; sized dollop, it lasts longer - I really, truly tried to shave with a nickel sized dollop, as it says to on the instructions - ouch - no slick coating - needs more soap - I use a boar bristle brush and I defy anyone using a brush to get the right amount - should I use a spoon?</li>
    <li> Husband loves it!  He says good lather and very nice manly scent!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but the best shave you will ever get.</li>
    <li> Amazingly lubricated, cool and a completely enjoyable shave.  I will be gifting this next Christmas.</li>
    <li> Sort of a Noxema smell and consistency, smells great, lubricates for a great shave, leaves a cool sensation after use. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought it cause of the excellent reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Good stuff. Just a note from my experience though: this isn&#x27;t great shaving cream if you like to use a brush. You need very little to get a lather. Using a brush only wastes some of the product. It&#x27;s very thin (not a bad thing because it won&#x27;t clog your razor and it&#x27;s just as effective as thicker creams) so the brush doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> Cremo but better smelling and over twice the price. I&#x27;ve wet shaved for over ten years, but can&#x27;t figure out why this is advertised as able to be used with a brush--I can&#x27;t make that happen. Lot&#x27;s of better options for us brush-hounds.</li>
    <li> My husband was really impressed with the quality of this shaving cream from Chiefs.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is on the smaller size, but it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a thin consistency, and the scent is a woody, piney, and minty herbs like Rosemary and Peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;The cream lathers nicely, and my husband preferred to use the shaving cream with out the brush he had.&lt;br /&gt;He got a nice clean shave, and said he felt refreshed and had a nice cooling sensation on his face. He said especially in the hot summer weather like we are having it was a very nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product from Chiefs for testing purposes, and agreed to try the product and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is a high quality product and would make a very nice gift for any man who shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I even liked the scent that remained on his face after shaving. Not too overpowering, and his face was very smooth!</li>
    <li> I received the Chiefs Energizing Shave cream for review.  I was slightly surprised at the size of the container as I am so used to an pump for shaving cream.  However, this shaving cream is thick, creamy and a little goes a long way.  When the container is first opened, the first noticeable is the scent of peppermint/menthol.  It is very invigorating.  As it is used, it has undertones of manly/woodsy/pine scent.  It is a great combination and very appealing to the nose.  My husband does not use a brush to apply his shaving cream and it was very easy to apply just with his hand.  It lathered on very smoothly and as stated above, a little goes a long way.  The cream was smooth and easily came off as the razor went across his face.  It left his face smooth, refreshed and smelling wonderful.  I also decided to try it to shave my legs.  It truly was invigorating and went on smoothly without irritating my skin.  I may have to claim this for myself.  I would recommend giving this cream a try.  It is of high quality and an overall wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Smells like Noxzema (ugh! )with an ultra harsh smell that is just to much! The smell is so strong it can stop a moose at a full gallop! The shave was terrible also following the directions on the jar. Had to re-shave using Barbasol.  To be fair I have an allergic reaction ,so far, to all the shaving creams ,and soaps, I&#x27;ve tried from amazon. The only shave soap product that work for me that I&#x27;ve tried so far is good ol&#x27; fashioned Barbsol or Williams shaving soap.  That said, It&#x27;e time for me to quit wasting time and just stick what works for me. Everyone else pick with what you like and enjoy your shave.</li>
    <li> Gives me a great shave and feels great, smells good, and is definitely worth getting. It really isn&#x27;t a daily shaving cream though because it is expensive, I use it as my good shaving cream before I have a meeting, date, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you will recieve 3 emails about pushing you to review their product and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well with a shave brush.</li>
    <li> I tried on CHIEFS shaving cream when it first came out. It had a great scent and it produced a really thick lather. It quickly became my go to shave creams. I recently got finished with my last batch and I am ad to say that I think I will be moving on to something else. One thing has changed and the cream is no longer as thick as it used to be. The amount needed to get a good lather has gone up because of it and trying to get a good wet shave going is a bit more difficult. I still enjoy the shave, but for somebody with a bit sensitive skin and hair that grows sideways I really like a good thick lather to pull up the hair. If they ever go back to the old formula I&#x27;ll come back no doubt.</li>
    <li> My husband believe it or not is a dry shaver. He doesn&#x27;t like shaving cream. I got this for him and made him try it. He LOVED it so much I ordered more. He said its so slick and a little goes a long way. His face felt so smooth and I personally like the scent. We would for sure recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice. To me, it smells just like Noxema.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was how much I liked the smell. The second thing I noticed was how POORLY it lathered. No matter how much I put on the brush, it just wouldn&#x27;t lather! The third thing I noticed, once I stopped trying to apply it with a brush and started applying it with my fingers, was how well it actually worked. Additionally, it&#x27;s got some kind of lotion built into it that doesn&#x27;t rinse off which leaves my face feeling moisturized all day. As long as you&#x27;re okay with it not lathering, a little goes a long way, which is a really good thing because this stuff is expensive. It costs almost twice as much as the high end brands (Taylor of Old Bond Street, Art of Shaving, Geo F. Trumper etc.) or about 5 to 10 times as what you can find in your local drugstore.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I found it does not lather very well and does not provide the lubricated shave other creams offer.  There is also significantly less cream in the jar for more money making this product of lesser value. I will go back to using Taylor products</li>
    <li> When I first get it I  noticed that the jar was small and was worried that it would not last that long but you only need a small amount of this shaving cream to do the job. It lathers really well and has a nice smell to it. It gives you suh a close smooth shave and your face feels great after you are done shaving. We will definately be getting more of this for ourselves and be giving it out as gifts.</li>
    <li> For the cost, doesn&#x27;t lather like some of the other brands (Taylor of Old Bond Street for sure) but the cool menthol feeling is definitely refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this lather. Great way to start the day!  I&#x27;m not a shaving aficionado, I just use a regular disposable shaver from the grocery store,but my nephew turned me onto Chiefs and it&#x27;s by far my favorite shaving cream</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He loves it. He said it is the best shave cream he has ever used. The smell is manly and refreshing. It leaves his skin so smooth and soft. He only has to use a very small amount at a time. It lathers nicely. He said after shaving with this he feels as if just got a shave from a barber. I will defiantly be purchasing again for him and getting some for gifts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a single blade shaver for many, many years and the cream is a very important part of the mix, thus I have tried everything under the sun and from all around the world. To my pleasant surprise, &#x27;Chiefs&#x27; is among the best I&#x27;ve experienced and made right here in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent lather, scent, and shave. The Ginseng is addictive... It&#x27;s so refreshing that I find myself wanting to shave twice on some days, just as a pick me up. AND... several ladies have randomly asked what scent I was wearing. I wasn&#x27;t wearing any, so had to give it some thought. Low and behold, I had shaved that morning...CHA-CHING!!!</li>
    <li> My son is home from college so I let him try it out and he was very happy with the results. He said he never had a shave that was so close. He said his skin felt very soft afterwards - I felt his face and agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a manly smell, but didn&#x27;t linger on long after the shave. My son said he really didn&#x27;t need to use much of the cream to get stellar results. He said he liked it so much that he will actually buy this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHIEFS provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> Very good but it is a small quantity and doesn&#x27;t last as long as expected or other products.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing, gives a comfy shave, but it&#x27;s the fresh invigorated feeling that is really great, Taylor of old Bond street and Chiefs are the two best</li>
    <li> Not that impressed with the item because I found it difficult to use with a badger shaving brush. Like another reviewer said, the consistency is of melted whipped cream. It get your face slick, but I find other products like Taylor shaving creams work better for my beard.</li>
    <li> not as spreadable as reported</li>
    <li> Amazing wash thats very earthly and organic. It was a bit thin, but it lathered up easier than most of the Old Spice or Axe washes I have used before. The lime scent was strong as well and left me feeling quite fresh. Overall I am pretty happy with it and will continue to order more.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when receiving this product was at how small the jar was. My husband decided to try it out as soon as it arrived and we were really surprised at how little he had to use to get the lather he needed. Wow just a small dime size amount was  enough to get the effect he needed for the job. He has very sensitive skin and this product did not cause him any irritation after use. He also had no nicks, which really agitates him to the point of not shaving. He loved the fact that it also did not gunk up his razor, allowing him to continue shaving without having to take the time to unclog it. The smell is amazing. I fell in love with the scent he had after using this shaving cream. It reminds me of a peppermint and something else I can&#x27;t put my finger on. We love that this company offers a 100% MONEY back GUARANTEE! We always look for this when shopping for products. Thanks so much for making my husband smell and look great. AAA+</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES the entire set I bought him.</li>
    <li> Love the shave it gives, just wish it smelled a bit better. Personal opinion.</li>
    <li> The lather for this product was super-easy to work with, one of the better lathering creams I’ve tried out there. The scent is pretty good as well, it smells like a more thought out Proraso.</li>
    <li> This is the shave cream I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years. I don&#x27;t always have time to break out the badger brush, and I&#x27;m not too keen on most mass-produced brands of shave cream. This one has an invigorating scent and left me with no bumps or razor burn. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> As a man who has been wet shaving for many years, badger hair brush, double edged shaver, Japanese blades, Chiefs BEST Shaving Cream unfortunately did not cut it. My routine is typical of many veteran wet shavers (at least I think it is), hot towel, lather from cream tub (on hand to lather or straight to the brush), three passes, etc. It is a morning ritual that I enjoy. First, where the Chiefs  BEST Shaving Cream fell short......It doesn&#x27;t appear to be manufactured for traditional wet shaving like Truefitt and Hill or Taylor of Bond Street. The cream is very light, almost the consistency of thick whipped cream. It doesn&#x27;t take to the brush very well, whether direct or from the hand. I was relegated (as the instructions indicate) to take a nickle (or more for me with three passes) sized dollop and apply to my face directly. It never really lathers up but does create a very slick environment to shave from. As mentioned, for me, I repeated this process three times. If I used this cream in this fashion everyday, I estimate the bowl would have lasted about 30 days. The other aforementioned brands last 7 or 8 months typically. One more negative and this might be specific to me but after shaving, a red rash broke out on my face and neck. I used one of the eucalyptus formulas, my skin might have had an issue with one of the ingredients. Now for some positives....The cream although not what I expected, did give a very close shave. The product also has a very nice smell to it, very clean and crisp...not over-powering. I actually used a little on my face as a pick-me-up during the day. Lastly, their customer service is very good as someone reached out to me on multiple occasions to see if everything was okay. I think this cream would be nice for a disposable blade (you know the ones with 5 blades they lock up at the drug store) guy or gal as a replacement to an aerosol spray can of cream. For guys that are a little too shaving obsessed (like me!), this is not the cream for you.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell and feels amazing on your face if you like mint its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars because it does not lather nearly as well as other brands and you have to use more than what it says to get a nice lather.</li>
    <li> After I used for the first time i am truly impressed at how smooth this is and how smooth my skin is afterwards... Will DEFINITELY buy again</li>
    <li> All the hype and it really is not for sensetive skin and u need to use a lot out of a little container!</li>
    <li> It smells good, that&#x27;s for sure. However, the soap doesn&#x27;t make enough lather for me to know where I&#x27;ve already shaved, and what spots I missed. I&#x27;m used to generating a rich lather when using a brush, and that&#x27;s not happening with this shave cream. I use a pre-shave oil and a badger brush, and I can&#x27;t tell whether the shaving cream has been applied to all parts of my face. Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
