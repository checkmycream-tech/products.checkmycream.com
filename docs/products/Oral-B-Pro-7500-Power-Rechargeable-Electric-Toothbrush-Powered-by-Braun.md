<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best feature of this toothbrush is the indicator that lets you know when you are brushing too hard. Because a little red light goes off when brushing hard and there&#x27;s an indicator to let you know when to switch quadrants, the timer, while cute, is a little superfluous. I also liked that it had a hard case which is great for travel.  .</li>
    <li> Great cleaning machine.</li>
    <li> 为什么没有蓝牙功能？why it&#x27;s not Bluetooth???</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like... It&#x27;s too expensive.. In Current market are lot of same products which does same job and price is less</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction!  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Really love this toothbrush. Wish I had waited for the bluetooth version so I could show my brushing history to the dentist. :)</li>
    <li> i had bleeding in my mouth after using this two times!</li>
    <li> A very effective toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, teeth actually feel and look cleaner haha</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best toothbrush that I ever have！this is the second electric toothbrush i bought，braun 7000 compare to my old one，it&#x27;more powerful and make my teeth cleaner，but the bettry is not good than the old one，after full charge i can use around 8 or 9 days（two times per day）.  it&#x27;s good enough for me.  there&#x27;s only one thing：i think the rubber grab is too easy to scratch...  anyway，it a very good toothbrush, you worth to have it!</li>
    <li> Why bother to give a travel case when the power adapter can only be used in the US?</li>
    <li> i love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;very very good!!!</li>
    <li> Works about the same as my old model except with the new timer feature. Otherwise not a whole lot different.</li>
    <li> Fancy and expensive, but aside from useless features it has nothing more than other similar but far less expensive products (like Oral b deep sweep 4000)</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Oral B and it is the most powerful. I am amazed at how much faster it is. Very impressed indeed. There are a couple things that concern me. The blue light seems to flash all the time. I keep the bathroom door open because there are pee pads in there for my 2 small dogs. The first night I had this Oral B, it looked light lightening in my room. I don&#x27;t know why lights have to flash while charging. I put a cloth over it now so I don&#x27;t have to see it. The other concern is not with the brush - it was packaging. I wondered if I had received a returned item. There was a brush head on the handle and batteries installed in the little thing that times down. There were also batteries that were still sealed. Normally, batteries are not installed in items like this nor do they attach the brush head. So concerns aside, this is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used. I have had 3 Sonicare brushes and prefer the Oral B for sure. This is the best of the Oral B line (so far).</li>
    <li> Everyone talks about the latest and greatest, but when you look at a toothbrush, you want it to clean your teeth, clean easily, replace the heads, and go anywhere. This Oral-B has all of that and a little more. The features listed are exactly as it says they are. Here is what separates the this particular Oral-B from the rest. MOST travel cases are just an open container you throw everything in. This causes things to run around inside the travel case. That&#x27;s gross. I do NOT want my toothbrush bristles touching the side of my toothbrush. Eww. This case is a hard case that has little compartments that grip your parts. VERY NICE!!! And it keeps the case quiet while walking around with it. The next thing is, if you have a young adult (6-14 years old) and they want to move up to a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; boy/girl tooth brush, and dump the teenage mutant ninja turtles, get them this toothbrush. It comes with a very easy to use timer. The kids still get really clean teeth, and they get to use the timer and ensure they use the time correctly to brush their teeth. Great rechargeable travel toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I bought for my teeth in years. And I did end up buying another for my parents. It gives you a great clean feeling, and the display is fun to watch instead of just beeps. I highly recommend this device.</li>
    <li> it is a present for my brother and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that I&#x27;m getting older by the day and my teeth and gums with me, I got what was supposed to be the best toothbrush ever.  And I think it is, this toothbrush is amazing and very well built, however, I don&#x27;t use all the features and I think I overpaid for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first days I tried all the brushing modes, but I kept using the standard 2 minute one, and configured the included clock to beep after the 2 minutes and not every quarter/30secs.  I still don&#x27;t know if this is a good idea to do, because the principle is to keep moving from quarter to quarter, but I still do that within the 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included traveling accessories I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use them, as I keep this toothbrush in my home, and the charger isn&#x27;t universal, that is, is only 120V, I was hoping for a 100-240V 50/60Hz charger in the global day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my recommendation is... Get a toothbrush with a 2 minute timer with your favorite brush head and that&#x27;s it.  And for traveling, maybe there is a USB rechargeable toothbrush somewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B Recharable toothbrushes for years.  Each one gets better. Love when it tells me how much time I&#x27;ve brushed (my mind starts to drift to work). Love when it tells me I&#x27;m, brushing to hard. Love that it has a clock (my digital clock just went out).  Love the fact that it has a closed in as well as washable travel case.  I LOVE this device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for less than a year and it has failed on me. While the device is fully charged it will fail to turn on and when it eventually does it starts blinking orange. I&#x27;ve called in for warranty work but I was told I need to ship it to a service center at my own expense. What a joke!</li>
    <li> Love it, changed my life.</li>
    <li> perfect , it clean well ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but charge is too slow</li>
    <li> like it so far, functions well and is very stylish</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Really makes my mouth and teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> The disadvantage is that noise, pushing prompted some impact brushing comfort</li>
    <li> Five star!&lt;br /&gt;Very Good~~~</li>
    <li> Does everything it advertises to do but cost is high so only purchased when a special was offered.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Price gouging....think about it....how can this little device cost much more than an entire vacuum cleaner plus attachments? Right, there is no explanation other than the consumer is being ripped off. Not that the other brushes that only cost $60 or so are a better value. Just stick to a good normal brush...never needs charging, what a concept!</li>
    <li> Works really well. I don&#x27;t have any problems with battery life. I use it twice a day for up to a week away from home with no problem. The travel case is really nice as well.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended. 3 months and significant improvement. Problem is, too many choices of brush heads.</li>
    <li> For some reason it takes more than 24 hours to fully charge the battery</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush, and it has met all of my expectations leaving my mouth feeling as though I just came from the dentist.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect instrument.if you would have anotherone for the same price i will order it..</li>
    <li> This toothbrush met all my expectations and provides excellent service.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of getting used to as it seems to be a bit rougher than I normally brush my teeth.  My teeth are difficult to brush as they are not all straight and this makes it a lot easier and cleaner.  I highly suggest a toothbrush like this for if you have your wisdom teeth as well as they are hard to reach and clean properly (according to many dentists.  Mine are removed so I do not know how it works but assume it would work well for those teeth.)</li>
    <li> have had a a month now, I love it. the only thing I wish was the replacements heads were cheaper</li>
    <li> It does get your teeth whiter, than battery operated toothbrushes and for my special needs child is it a must for oral health and to prevent tooth decay.  Wisdom teeth were pulled and the dentist advised it&#x27;s use since this population has hygienic challenges. No regrets.  Worth the price for clean teeth and peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This item only works on 115 volts only. Can&#x27;t use it and have to buy a new charger</li>
    <li> Present for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She is crazy about it.&lt;br /&gt;Loves the little smiley face mirror stickers.</li>
    <li> best electric toothbrush.  Price was much cheaper than in local stores.</li>
    <li> has to be charged weekly for a minimum of 6hrs for full battery.. maybe bad battery?  anyway... i have always been a fan of oral-b electric toothbrushes...i&#x27;ve always used them...  i paid the premium price for this unit...  and i can&#x27;t notice a difference...just a few extra bells and whistles i guess...  my advice, FWIW, would be to get a more intermediate level brush, closer to $100</li>
    <li> The oral-B brushes are very good.  I&#x27;ve used a 3000 for 2-3 years, and the dentist &amp; his cleaning assistant seem to think I&#x27;m working much harder at tooth brushing than I am (as compared to their pre-3000 assessments). There&#x27;s no question that it does a better job cleaning and working the gums than the traditional brush-in-the-hand.  I thought the 3000&#x27;s rechargeable battery should not have worn out after only a couple of years -- replacing it is possible, but you need to know how to use a soldering iron, i.e., it&#x27;s much more involved than I care to deal with.  So I bought a replacement 7000 because the price was great (not much more on sale than the cheaper ones), and it works at the level I expected.  I don&#x27;t think the multi-levels of speeds the 7000 has are needed, but the red-light warning for pushing too hard is kind of handy, and the bluetooth clock monitoring is certainly overkill but makes you feel very high-tech.  Also gave a 3000 to my son to try to reduce the dentist&#x27;s bill for his cavities -- so having purchased 3 of these now is explanation enough for my 5 star rating of this product.  I do think the 3000 is adequate for hygiene goals, but the 7000 is slightly more fun.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth to hard and have been eroding my gums.  This has really helped to get my teeth good and clean, and keep me from brushing too hard.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good and useful.I like it.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Vibration is to much and when charging the blue light is way too bright...Will light up the entire room.</li>
    <li> Most Oral-B products meet/exceed my requirements.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Differnt settings are confusing.  Otherwise I like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> very good.&lt;br /&gt;but,Why don&#x27;t  change the input voltage to 110v-220 v?</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush! it does really work a lot better than your average electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Beautiful toothbrush. I used the 5000 series and loved it. Thought I would &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this. Horrible. Horrible Battery life!!!!! Total waste of money</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t support 240v but comes with a travel case which is ironic... Also thought this was the Bluetooth version but it&#x27;s not. Apart from that, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The battery indicator light never seems to work. After second use it blinks red!</li>
    <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much&lt;br /&gt;The teeth used cleanliness high&lt;br /&gt;Let my mouth cleaner</li>
    <li> We love this toothbrush in our house. It came with extra heads so both my husband and I have our own spin brush head (they are disposable). It is a strong working tooth brush with multiple settings and a timer to make sure you brush each quadrant of your mouth for 15 seconds, a total of 2:00. At the end of brushing, I really do feel like a got a thorough, clean brush of all my teeth and reached within all crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish they would include the timer in the handle of the brush so you don&#x27;t have to have an extra time piece sitting in your bathroom taking up counter space. However they did design is to hang on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery life is somewhat limited compared to other Oral B spin brushes we have had in the past and this toothbrush requires daily or every other day charging.</li>
    <li> I was told this was a premium disposable toothbrush and the 5000 was a better deal but this one was black and the new model and the ad was so cool and I couldn&#x27;t resist it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course if I was a sane person I would get the 5000 for much less (but it wouldn&#x27;t be black).&lt;br /&gt;110V only with a travel case is okay if you are not going too far, I felt offended and punished for my travel preferences.&lt;br /&gt;But it does actually work when connected to 220V (or 240V), tested myself.</li>
    <li> Needs a travel charger with 110-240V</li>
    <li> the smarter seems like an extra. others are ok. i like the color and the material. I like the tongue model either. feel soft with high vibrational frequency.</li>
    <li> very good,i like it very much</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great. My teeth is very clean after brushing and never ache again.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s I&#x27;m disappointed is the battery. It could only support 10 days use (twice per day). So the instruction suggests that you should charge it all the time!</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush to replace my old Oral-B.  Great toothbrush with great features.  I&#x27;m not sure a toothbrush with bluetooth is really something anyone needs but it cleans my teeth great!  Got it at a great price too!</li>
    <li> Turns off to show me where I am timewise. Don&#x27;t like that feature.  Other thanthat, great.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very satisfied with my purchase, and look forward to using every morning and evening.</li>
    <li> A quality product.  Much stronger than my Triumph that I lost recently.  Like a dremel for your teeth.  I love it. I don&#x27;t travel internationally so the 120v thing is not an issue for me.  Nor is the battery life.  I see no issues with that over my last product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my son, who does not like going to the dentist.  Since he has been using this, his teeth look great and he says it makes a huge difference in how clean his teeth are.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is incredible! I&#x27;ve had a sonicare for years and it was OK. I was never blown away by it&#x27;s performance. This thing though, is amazing. My teeth feel SO clean. After one use, my teeth already felt cleaner than they ever did after using my sonicare.</li>
    <li> Two months after purchase it stopped working. I have contacted Oral B for the warranty, but they make very little effort to help. You make arrangements and pay to mail it yourself, and they will presumably eventually send it repaired or replace. I may update my review with how that goes, but for now I&#x27;m annoyed and inconvenienced.</li>
    <li> Excellent price everything was delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> Good product, very nice, would buy again</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife as she had worn out her previous Oral B.  This is a fantastic tooth brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> Gives an after the dentist teeth clean feel!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Only wish they had black toothbrush heads . But over all very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Great purchase and Fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is in a class of it&#x27;s own - does NOT hold the charge, requires 24 Hr + to recharge - it is a definite downgrade from the previous model I owned. The brush carries a premium price without any of the premium attributes; a lot of gimmicks that sacrifice performance. I contacted the manufacturer on 2 separate occasions to review the low battery life - no response - probably not surprising. It is quite disappointing to have a manufacturer such as Braun (1) not respond to customer inquiries and (2) sell a high-priced product that does not deliver. To make things worse the tooth bush just stopped working - have not been able to figure out whether the charger broke or the battery died. Obviously the charging base of the old tooth bush does not fit the new model.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> Just too expensive and complicated for the simple function of a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Is this a joke?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember a single time when I was brushing my teeth in the morning where I had a moment of clarity and the realization that what my toothbrush has been missing all this time was Bluetooth.</li>
    <li> First time use oral-b, feel different from Phillip, but it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;not thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;liked my old 1 better.</li>
    <li> Like the timing device to tell you when to change areas.  My teeth feel clean after brushing. The holder is easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> The color suits my style. Love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It works great! I really enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are silky smooth everyday now.  Wish I would have discovered this earlier in life!</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush on sale, it was one of the best purchases I have made for my dental health. I can feel the difference between a manual tooth brush, and will never go back to manual brushing. The timer on the brush does all the work for you.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.  It is very well made and works extremely well at cleaning your teeth.  Timer is very useful to help follow results.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Took 24 hours for the unit to fully charge, but so far it&#x27;s been great.  no problems to report.  Easy to set up the remote timer.</li>
    <li> Over priced. Would not recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush and can&#x27;t believe I have been this long without it! It definitely has met my expectations. My teeth and gums have never felt cleaner. Feels like I left the dentist every time. I love all the modes and find the tongue mode a nice addition. I also had a little but of bad breath issue and after using this toothbrush it has been long gone. I&#x27;ve been reading some reviews about some battery issue and I&#x27;ll tell you what I don&#x27;t have that issue because I do it the right way which is I charge it for 24 hours and then use it and put it away in my case and continue to use it until my battery is low and then repeat and charge again for 24 hours and that keeps your battery from over charging and under charging and last a lot longer. I have had this brush for a month and did my charging process only twice! So that&#x27;s about 2 weeks between charges. Highly recommend this brush to everyone even it being a little pricey but it&#x27;s totally worth it, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> really like it,been use for 3 month</li>
    <li> I am enjoying it but I am still worried that if this was actually a new item as the box was not sealed</li>
    <li> Everything I could have hoped for. Enjoy it&#x27;s features and like the versatility of having the different cleaning heads.</li>
    <li> Oral B doesn&#x27;t support dual voltage - its a 110V and you are forced to buy a Voltage down converter in case you are a heavy traveler that spends his time outside the US.... Such a stupid buy!! would never do it again! Who builds devices with a single voltage i our day and age?</li>
    <li> Amazing toothbrush for an INCREDIBLE sales price! I am in love with this toothbrush. At first it seemed like the head was too big but after relaxing my jaw I found that I was simply not used to it. The brush head is the perfect size to clean each individual tooth- able to brush behind your teeth as well as my wisdom teeth in the very back. Hugely impressed. I will certainly take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could do without the Bluetooth however. Never use the app and find that the feature compromises the battery life. However I would say that the performance of this brush compared to other electronic toothbrushes I have is unbeatable and would not let that  dissuade me from purchasing it</li>
    <li> very nice！clean without bloodshed,but the battery charge is very slow at 110v</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great rechargeable  toothbrush .  Charts last long time.  It has a Bluetooth you can sync to your phone or a device… Which I think is stupid.</li>
    <li> the pressure sensor does not work</li>
    <li> Love my new toothbrush! I have had this for a couple months now and I am so thankful that I purchased it. My gums have been improving from the clean of this brush and feel that my overall dental health is getting a good brush.</li>
    <li> Was given as a Christmas gift that was very appreciated.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an old Sonic and I love it! My teeth feel like I just left the Dentist ever time I use it.</li>
    <li> Support from customer service is very poor. The toothbrush itself is good but if the charger goes bad they are not interested in the least in SELLING you a new one. It is not like I was asking  for something for nothing. I wanted to buy a charger from them. Apparently there is not enough profit in this for them to even bother.</li>
    <li> Excellent..I love it.</li>
    <li> An excellent toothbrush</li>
    <li> First time I have used and electric toothbrush.  Went to this at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  Seems to do a great job and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great and much stronger than our last electric toothbrush.  My only complaint is that it is hard to keep clean.</li>
    <li> It was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made yet , every time I brush it feels like I&#x27;ve just left the dentists office. Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in having an healthy mouth!!</li>
    <li> Nice style and lot of features</li>
    <li> some packages were opened, i feel that is used</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and fun to us.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush</li>
    <li> The battery is its weakness</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it daily</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is way too loud and the battery sucks.  I have always used Sonicare and I could go 1 week to 2 weeks before having to charge it.  This particular brush needs charging after 2-3 days.  This is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, easy to clean and it is super effective cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One of its best features is to compatible with all brush heads available by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to have some guidance on places to brush with its display, and the pressure indicator.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is to have that super clean sensation when you rub your tongue in your teeth. &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that it takes more time than conventional batteries to recharge (probably because its induction rechargeable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;It was really expensive, but compared to overall dentistry expenses, it is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> Bought this a year back and was the best brush I have ever had. Then suddenly, one day, it woudnt charge. For a product this ex[ensive, I would assume to get a better quality. Cant find the charger separately either.</li>
    <li> The vibration  is too strong even in the gentle mode. I don&#x27;t think it is good for the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it , Really makes a difference , pressure sensor is a smart idea , the small display (smart Guide ) is very encouraging to complete the 2 minutes , reason for giving it 4 instead of 5 is the charger , it&#x27;s only 100-130 volt , in spit of its for travel , I guess they meant within the US ,if you travel to Europa or any where else ,you shout get a volt transformer or you&#x27;ll burn the charger out , ...... very silly .</li>
    <li> just so-so,a little busy to use</li>
    <li> Does what it says, though i only use it in 1 mode, hate the 110V only plug.&lt;br /&gt;Overall experience positive and helps keep teeth shiny and clean, thanks a lot !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having issues with this product, because I can&#x27;t use it properly, the application that is supposed to connect to my smartphone claims that my phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) is not compatible with the software, which I believe to be inconceivable, I would like a solution too this issue ASAP...</li>
    <li> EXPENSIVE BUT APPEARS TO WORK FINE.  A GOOD ORAL-B TOOTHBRUSH.  HOPE IT LASTS LONG, BUT HAVE ONLY USED FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS SO FAR.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, it does just like it says it does</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush... and i LOVE it.  High quality.  Great looking.  Lots of features.  Love the accessory piece (the clock / countdown timer / smiley face)... especially fun seeing the frowny face when pressing too hard (handle also flashes red) and getting the smiley face &amp; five stars when done brushing.  The kid in me likes the positive reinforcement I guess.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is really good. It looks nice in your bathroom and it really cleans your teeth pretty good. I recommend an oral b toothbush.  Now, why 3 stars?  Because you don&#x27;t need to spent all that money for cleaning your teeth. I bought model 4000 also and that model has what you really need but for much less money. It&#x27;s the toothbrush. The difference is that model 7000 has bluetooth, premium travel case, and tongue mode.  The bluetooth is not really needed.  The premium travel case is nicr but I don&#x27;t know if you want to pay the difference just because of that.  And the tongue mode is absolutely useless! What did oral b really did? Program a mode with another time and less rpm? They just did that and called tongue mode! Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;resume: model 4000 and 7000 are the same toothbrush. If you don&#x27;t care spending more money for features that really don&#x27;t improve your teeth cleaning, you can buy model 7000</li>
    <li> Nice product, as usual from Oral-B</li>
    <li> Upgrade from my five year old Oral-B electric.  This one is head and shoulders above my old one.  It seems to clean my teeth better and I recently used the travel case on our trip to the Caymans.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I did tons of research and for the price this is THE BEST!!! Couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!!! Easy to use, comes with timer as well as Bluetooth interface with app on your mobile!!!! Strongly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice Toothbrush.Clean enough,smart enough!</li>
    <li> They mention travel... only 110V, so you might consider traveling as a more limited concept.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product and would highly recommend  it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used earlier versions and this has many options and will improve dental health for sure</li>
    <li> While black seems cool; toothpaste and white and now toothpaste has bleach in it.  See where I&#x27;m going with this.  I regret buying the black one.  All of the modes are great and all however, I use one of them 95% of the time.</li>
    <li> Perfect! The only objection is the plugin, which is for America and Canada, problem easily solved buying and adaptador</li>
    <li> I think they should have the option of a slower speed, which is needed at times. Also those tiny washers disappear when you take the brush off to clean it. If they were permantely attached to the brush it would be so much nicer. As is, they are gone into space when you remove the brush. I do think &amp;#34;in space&amp;#34; aptly applies since I have never found even one of them! They must be important to have or they would not be included with the brush but I&#x27;ve used the washers from four new brushes and each one of them flew off into the wild blue yonder! Also, it is almost impossible to get new brushes. I&#x27;ve seen about every type of Oral-B brush EXCEPT the ones I need for the 7000. I would like to be able to get them locally rather than ordering on line.</li>
    <li> Works very well - takes some time to charge so I put it back on the charger after every use.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is awesome, six modes are quite enough for me. and it can reminds me whether I brush too hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for LESS THAN A MONTH and it DOESN&#x27;T CHARGE ANYMORE!?? Come on guys! I didn&#x27;t mind the price as long as it&#x27;s WORTH IT. IT IS NOT! I ordered ALL THE WAY from overseas. The cost of returning it and all the hustle is like, &amp;#34;my goodness, it&#x27;s supposed to be an Oral b&amp;#34;. Never mind the price as long as I don&#x27;t have to go thru this but I am.  Just sad and disappointed!</li>
    <li> wife and I love this one. It&#x27;s cheaper buying in Amazon than in stores.</li>
    <li> Ordered it yesterday and it arrived today.  It was the newer Bluetooth model.  Can&#x27;t wait to take it for a spin when I get home.</li>
    <li> Battery life on this sucks I can only use it 3 times at most before I have to charge worst toothbrush to buy</li>
    <li> Very excited to try this product out! I have heard lot of good things about it so I&#x27;m giving it a try! I never thought I would buy a tooth brush that cost so much, but when you think about it it does way more then just what one toothbrush can do so it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> great  job  on  my  teeth</li>
    <li> Great performance, but I have small hands and I found it to be ... I can&#x27;t figure out the word - it just felt like it was crafted for a man. I chose to go with a sonic care brush instead. But this is a great option - that was my main complaint.</li>
    <li> Battery life not good, everything else is great!</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush, very classy box for travel comes with it. Have used an electric brush for years, and this is by far the nicest.</li>
    <li> Whats next? A Bluetooth tampon?  Completely stupid.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the difference this brush made versus the regular/manual brush I was using. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference but it was really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems good and they sent me three types of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that when the brush is charging, the LEDs flash and they are very bright. If you stumble into your bathroom in the middle of the night, it will ruin your night vision. It would have been nice to have a steady low/mid/high increasing indicator instead of three flashing LEDs.</li>
    <li> I love my oral-b 7000! It cleans my teeth better than any regular toothbrush possibly could. Every time I brush my teeth I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist!</li>
    <li> Not as small and round as other models/brands, also the battery is too weal and doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a little rough.  I have used an electric toothbrush for years, my mouth was sore.  Now I am so happy!  My teeth look great, no staining, and feel so smooth.  Very happy.  Do not, nor do I intend to, use the blue tooth feature.</li>
    <li> Works great ...But make sure you use the oral B coupon ...30$ off !</li>
    <li> I love it.  I also love the various heads.  It keeps me brushing for at least 2 minutes.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Handle is bigger than the older ones but still works great.</li>
    <li> I need to weigh in on this product.  This is the THIRD Oral-B that I have had; the second Triumph.  I admit that this is a pricey &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; brush however over the last almost 19 yrs have used nothing but.  (My brushes lasting from 5-7 yrs before that battery dies makes the math not too far off when buying new toothbrushes on a regular basis).  To me, the benefits of this brush FAR outweigh the cost.  If you have perfect teeth and no issues, maybe you can forgo.  However for some in the population, this toothbrush alone is the reason for great check ups, virtually no plaque and cavities to say nothing of the whiter teeth and brighter smile.  (Recommended by my dentist almost 20 yrs ago!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the length of time to charge the toothbrush.  If you need to use it while it is taking 24hrs to charge, you can stop it, use the brush and put it back on the charger.  Not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that people have mentioned the flashing blue light as it charges.  It can be annoying I suppose, but the toothbrush is in the bathroom charging and, looking on the bright side, can be a beacon pointing you to the commode.  Once the handle has the full charge the light goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the &amp;#34;1-2 second delay&amp;#34; after each 30 second period of brushing.  It is nowhere near that.  A second is  &amp;#34;one thousand one; one thousand two&amp;#34;.  It does hesitate (all of them did/do to indicate the time to switch quadrants of your mouth in brushing) but nothing even close to a full second rather than two.  When it hesitates, switch quadrants and by the time you get there you are off and spinning again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complained about how the battery runs down quickly especially when traveling.  I agree.  It does.  I travel extensively and I think it has to have something to do with the x-ray or the high altitude in flight.  No kidding.  When traveling by car, the charge seems to last longer.  Not sure why that is.  So, now I just throw my charger in my suitcase (since the toothbrush battery seems to eventually die, I have extra chargers).  I just keep one charger in my bag that is always packed for those last minute trips or I am packing so quickly I fear I may forget something important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of the reviews think the clock/brushing timer is a waste of money.  Not me.  I like that little guy smiling at me especially in the morning and many times at night.  In my line of work (the medical field) I don&#x27;t get a lot of smiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could they have chosen a better color than black?  Yep.  However, I&#x27;ve had white ones for the last 19 yrs and it&#x27;s a welcome change.  And this case is definitely classy.  I had cases for my last toothbrush but this one is VERY lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you want excellent check ups, brighter whiter teeth without all of these expensive toothpastes, clean teeth ALL the time then it is worth the purchase.  There is often a coupon available for these toothbrushes either on Oral-B website or your dentist.y that is.

    <li> Good product  - But I feel the price is on higher side.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush but there are some problems number one it did not come with a book a manual or anything of the sort no guarantee no paperwork and I have not received one yet. The toothbrush works great it comes with a timer that also doesn&#x27;t work I guess I would buy it again but sort of disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get everything I was supposed to still trying to get it hope I can</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made in Germany, can de used in 110-240V</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush. Like the timer that comes with it. Sleek design, and comes with multiple heads.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush ever had</li>
    <li> At first the new technology intimidated me but I persevered and am very comfortable with it now. I especially like that you may leave it parked on the charging stand without concern for batteries and having the brushes enclosed in a separate case makes a lot of sense. Very pleased with entire process from ordering, receiving, and product.</li>
    <li> Fits comfortably in the hand, and the different settings make it easy to get the job done.  The red light to indicate too much pressure is great visual aid.  I&#x27;d previously used the 1000 model and this was a great upgrade.</li>
    <li> Never owned an electric toothbrush and I must say, OMG! It&#x27;s a different kind of clean compared to a regular toothbrush! This is by far my best purchase yet. I love the digital clock that comes with it because it shows you what quadrant to clean and it has a timer. The toothbrush also vibrates to let you know to switch to a different quadrant! Everything about this toothbrush is awesome and you won&#x27;t regret your purchase of you give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> I am in Mumbai, India. I understand that different parts of the world use different voltages, so I have a 230 volts to 110/120 volts converter in hand. When I opened the case and tried to start the Braun, nothing happened. The system was unresponsive. I thought that the product was shipped with no battery charge. I then tried to charge the Braun, and it would refuse to charge, no lights came on when I connected the Braun to the charger. The same converter works with other 110V products. I have a intelligent bluetooth toothbrush that now behaves like a normal unintelligent toothbrush. Due to the fact that I am in india and there are international courier and customs issues, I cannot return the product back. Expected better quality from Braun, the last Braun product I will ever buy. Live and learn, brands should not be trusted.</li>
    <li> good but too expensive</li>
    <li> wife loved it...brushes three time a day...SMH</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my mom. She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush that is good quality. Comes with a high quality travel case and the toothbrush keeps its charge for a long time. I notice a huge improvement over plaque removal after using this for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Great brush, and makes a great Christmas gift! Good power and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love  the Oral-B 7000. My teeth are super smooth after I brush. The intermittent pause is not a bother like another reviewer mentioned. I am certain my next dental cleaning will be great!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a good job at getting my teeth clean (whitening brush head), however, the cons seriously drag the rating down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good cleaning experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- LOUD! Much louder than my previous phillips electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;- No brush head cover. So you wouldn&#x27;t want to leave the brush head on in a bathroom environment. You could take it off, as there is a covered (not sealed) portion of the plastic base to hold 4 brush heads. However, that leaves the metal piece/rod the brush head sits on exposed. To me, leaving a lubricated part exposed is not a great idea, and given the metal rod&#x27;s length and shape, potentially dangerous if you fell on/ran into it.&lt;br /&gt;- NiMH battery. Enough said. See others&#x27; reviews about charge times/battery life.&lt;br /&gt;- The toothbrush STOPs for a full second or two every 30 seconds to remind you to switch areas, instead of a small pulse like others. Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;- The bluetooth addon display is worthless since the toothbrush pulses every 30 seconds. Waste of battery in the toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;- The base includes the brush head cover and makes this take up a lot of counter space should you use it. You can use just the toothbrush charger portion that slips into it, but there are cheaper options that don&#x27;t include the base to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would not buy this toothbrush again. I gave it two stars for the cleaning ability, but most out there are similarly able.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  I have never owned an electric bruch before, and I love this one.  I was told that I brush too hard, so I had to switch from Medium to Soft bristles.  If you are like me, that didnt feel clean enough.  When I bought this brush, I could feel the difference in the cleanliness of my teeth, AND it is gentle.  I especially like that it has a red light to tell me if I am pressing too hard.  If you are techy, you will love this brush as well.</li>
    <li> Not worth paying extra. 5000 series is more then enough. Don&#x27;t understand why lithium battery is not used. Takes a long time to charge and wears off quickly. For those who need 240v, buy the cheapest vitality toothbrush and use the charger instead.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get better than this toothbrush. i would recommend to everyone that want clean and white teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve bought a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I ordered the toothbrush expecting it would work with the oral b app, but it turns out this model is SmartGuide (the smiley guy thing) but not SmartSeries (bluetooth / app). I&#x27;m subtracting one star for that since I searched amazon for &amp;#34;oral b bluetooth&amp;#34; and it led to my ordering this product. I decided to keep the toothbrush since it was on sale for less than the SmartSeries model and had good reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did because I love it! I mounted the smartguide on the wall. It smiles when you get to 2 minutes and it winks if you go longer. (Does it think you are using it for something else? LOL) It frowns if you brush too hard. I only wish it would make this face instead  :-[]</li>
    <li> Has more featueres then I would ever use but alot of them are nice. It lets you know when you press to hard and it times you. It is an improvement over the older electric toothbrushes</li>
    <li> Sonic Care blows this out of the water. I kept it because it is better than what I normally use, but go with Sonic Care.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is amazing. I have used it for about 3 weeks now and its probably the best toothbrush I have ever used. Cleans my teeth amazingly.</li>
    <li> Too harsh.  I had to return it.  Not a sonic toothbrush.  Beware!</li>
    <li> It is a great tooth brush but you have to ask yourself if you really need all, those other setting or are they something you might use once in a great while. I feel I could have bought a cheaper model with 1 or 2 setting and got as much out of it. Live and learn, this is my first electric or shall I say battery operated tooth brush. The other gadget that come with it our just that for me, and are tucked in a drawer. The battery life is great has lasted up to 2 weeks before needing charging.</li>
    <li> I have invisalign and have to brush my teeth an ungodly amount of times a day, this helps make it faster, more efficient and I stopped using retainer cleaner tabs, because this cleans the aligners so well! The battery takes DAYS to charge though, but lasts pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Takes a while to understand its working and different modes.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this brush for 5 months. It is working great.</li>
    <li> Love the brush the only thing is the battery it sucks........buuut I love it feel a big difference.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I made this year. Very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Volt support both 220V and 110V, no need to bring transformer when travel.</li>
    <li> Standby time is too short</li>
    <li> nice toothbrush, works well.</li>
    <li> cleans teeth fine but I don&#x27;t like the shape hard to hold.</li>
    <li> This unit replaces one that lasted about 6 or 7 years and is the third one I have owned.  So long time Braun/Oral B tooth brush user.  These things work so well that every time I go see my dentist he comments on how well I brush my teeth.  The 7000 is very nice and works a lot better than my old one did.  New works better than old.  Yes it comes to a complete stop every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.  The older ones do a stop-start hesitation rather than a complete stop.  I fail to see how this could ruin someone&#x27;s whole routine, but if you are that lacking in versatility good luck to you.  Yes it takes 20 hours to charge fully from dead battery to full charge, but you only need to do this once every 6 months or so.  The rest of the time just leave it on the stand and it is always ready to go.  Battery life is the same on the 7000 as it has been for my older ones.  I really don&#x27;t care what kind of battery it has in it.  The travel case is a nice addition for those of us who travel.  This is a very nice item.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it...got several mode to choose, although I only use one of it lol</li>
    <li> This is by far the best thoot brush I ever own.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled. As promised. I love it. The brushing for 2 minutes takes getting used to but my teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!  Love it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I purchased an Electric Toothbrush and I was hesitant if I would like it or not. But after a month of use, I absolutely love it and regret not jumping on the electronic toothbrush earlier. My mouth feels much fresher and having the timer helps so much. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems like it should be a good brush. It cleans well and functions great as a tooth brush. The problem is, the battery is absolutely garbage. That makes what should be a really good tooth brush basically worthless. When it was brand new, fully charged, it could only go about 4-5 brushes before it was completely dead. I have only used it a few dozen times and now the battery indicator light won&#x27;t go past the first indicator, no matter how long it charges for. I get about  1.5-2 brushes out if it before the battery is completely dead. Maybe instead of bluetooth oral-b should invest in working batteries.</li>
    <li> I love the quarterly update to let you know when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth so you are sure to get a good brushing over your entire mouth.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in my teeth and brushing habits instantly after I got this. Will never go back to regular toothbrushes</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush. The Bluetooth timer is great cause it propels you to continue brushing for those 4 stars!</li>
    <li> We had an earlier version similar to this that lasted is almost 10 years! It finally died on is. This was a great replacement.  Worth the few extra dollars compared to what&#x27;s out there.  We love it!  Hope it lasts as long.</li>
    <li> Tooth brush is great the separate monitoring item that came in the package was a waste of space as well as batteries is requires.</li>
    <li> as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just a month, so good so far</li>
    <li> Amazing performance! I have been using Oral B for over 12 years, they never disappoint.</li>
    <li> purchased Jan 6th. On April 12, the on-off switch stopped working. I had been noticing the unit needing to be recharged more and more frequently. Now, after 3 months, it no longer works. This is the first time with am Oral-B  electric toothbrush I have had a problem. I will try and get factory Warranty service and write an updated report later.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I travel frequently and the case is very useful. Cary-on accepted too. I don&#x27;t need the timer because the toothbrush pauses every 30 seconds to let you know it&#x27;s time to switch. I had not been to a dentist in 2 years and after a few months of using the toith brush my teeths were a little whiter and the dentist was impressed. I recoomend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the OralB Products,</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long. I like the various options such as Gentle and Poshing modes.</li>
    <li> Was using a old sonic care that the battery finally died on and would charge, replaced it with this and I really like the way my moputh feels when Im done. Glad I made the switch.</li>
    <li> This is the best !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Are your travels in Western Europe? Some of the Oral B power brush chargers automatically adapt to different voltages. Just check the voltage requirement on the charger. If 100 - 240 V printed on the charger it can be used globally. If it has 220 - 240 V is printed on the charger it can be only used in countries with 220-240 V. (For example in most of European countries, AAI area, not in US/Canada) However, you might need a plug adapter to fit the socket. You can find these plug adapters at most electronics and travel stores. (Oral B doesn&#x27;t produce plug adapters). It is good to buy the regular Oral-B toothbrush in a pack, the best sold in Costco for less than two a brush. It is the brushing that does the job, as well as a toothpaste without chemicals and flossing. The trick is to brush for ten minutes at a time, three times daily since once plaque get to set in, tartar comes next since all chemicals get to join the plaque that helps it to become tartar. When gums go down, never come up so brushing and flossing first after waking up as well as before going to sleep, swishing with a big spoon of VCO which is full of antibacterial, will help sparkling beauties stay as they are without tarter and gums staying where they need to be. Flossing removes the plaque in between teeth so no toothbrush is SMART enough to offer that either. This electronic toothbrush comes with limitations not possibilities.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush on the market and I have both philips sonicare diamond clean and this oral b precision black.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I love how it operates. The design is beautiful, and 3 brush heads for different usage. Best E-toothbrush ever!</li>
    <li> I love my Oral B 7000. My mouth has never felt fresher or cleaner after a brushing. The timer device is not only helpful, but it&#x27;s supplies you with that added incentive to keep on brushing. Great product.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush is great.  I had research the different models and opted for a more expensive one.  The way the brush attaches seems better as there is no gasket which over time can allow water in and I had one &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; because of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cheaper versions for years and loved them, so I thought I&#x27;d upgrade. Big mistake. This brush isn&#x27;t an upgrade, it&#x27;s a waste of money. The battery lasts less than a week, and the way it stops every 30 seconds drives me crazy. I liked the sleek black look in the picture, but the stand and charger is the same tacky white as the cheaper models. If you are considering buying one of these, do, but go for the cheaper models - same functionality without the added cost.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Packaging is too complex and not environmentally sensitive.  This is a toothbrush not an iPhone!  4 instead of 5 stars for not having a universal charger.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. Totally worth every dollar. Never knew a toothbrush can be so smart.</li>
    <li> Wether the product is second hand? the SmartGuide lack of two battery, and brush connections have traces of damage</li>
    <li> Teeth have never been cleaner!</li>
    <li> I got this for a great price and it arrived very quickly. Love this product -- great dental checkups (less placque to clean)!</li>
    <li> I purchased this while on travel and noticed I forgot the charger to my 5000, so I figured this was the perfect time to upgrade as my plastic blue case was broken for quite some time and unable to order a replacement case.....needless to say I gave myself a couple of reason to move forward with this purchase;-) When it arrived to my Hotel, I immediately unboxed it for charging. It appears to take a full 24hrs (slow) to charge but once it&#x27;s done you have one powerful toothbrush. I also like the lights and timer that&#x27;s included. I figured to maintain the 5000 as a travel brush only but I am strongly considering just buying another 7000 just for my travel bag;-)</li>
    <li> My gums have never been healthier and my teeth have never felt cleaner. I&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;30sec quadrant timer really motivating as well.</li>
    <li> All are excellent except for 100-120 V. power supply where there is limitation to take it around the world.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, my only complaint is how long it takes to charge it.  Be prepared to charge for 24 hours to get a complete charge.  It has some cool features but after about 3 uses, I stopped using bluetooth due to not caring anymore.</li>
    <li> i didnt got all the brushes as i saw others got and my smart guide is not workinG!!!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to use a power-tool to clean their teeth?! Love it!</li>
    <li> I got the goods very quickly and find it wonderful</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who hates brushing. This was perfect because it connects to his phone and times him. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this toothbrush. This was definitely worth the money. I love brushing my teeth even more now that I have this toothbrush. Don&#x27;t be afraid to make this purchase. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It has 5 model to use. I disconnect the dock. It is really nosing. It is stupid that I clean my tooth with a clock round and looking at it. One more thing, it could not remember the model that you used. I do not know whether it is my misake to setting. It would be better if it could remember the model automatically without setting. By the way, Oral-B should upgrade their toothbrush to li-ion battery. They are still using Ni-Cd battery.</li>
    <li> The Cadillac of electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. You will feel like you just left the dentist every time.</li>
    <li> Much better than Sonicare</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I could not imagine going back to the old way of mouth care.  Use it with the oral B app and your all set.  Love, love, love it.  Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Unbelievable&amp;#34; batter volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if this is what the producer can offer, then I have to say that we need a technological revolution of the rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush. I have permanent metal retainers, so it&#x27;s easy for tartar and plaque to build up on my lower retainer. This toothbrush is a HUGE help in getting around all edges and between the metal and my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews complaining about the few seconds between each 30 second interval of brushing are silly, it&#x27;s more like half a second and it&#x27;s helpful if you&#x27;re not watching the timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When charging, the blue light is pretty bright as some others have mentioned--so this can get annoying if you sleep with your bathroom door open. I just close the door or wrap a sock or something around the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is very nice and handy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic one from Oral B.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  It handles well.  Ergonomically well balanced.  Keeps charged for quite a while before needing to plug in.  Has nice travel case making it easy to take with you.</li>
    <li> huge and very strong ..i like it</li>
    <li> Only been about a month but so far so good. Easy to use, seems well made. The app is a bit gimmicky and I had to explore how to shut off the annoying feature of the app stopping and starting the brush to let you know to move on to the next quadrant. I&#x27;ve stopped looking at the app and just use the brush alone.&lt;br /&gt;The  hard travel case is bulkier than it needs to be - it could have been made narrower. It does have space for 2 tips. I would have preferred something more like a tube shape but I suppose that wouldn&#x27;t be easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m charging it only once a week or so not leaving it charging all of the time. I&#x27;m hoping that helps to preserve the life of the battery since I&#x27;ve read negative reviews on that subject. I guess only time will tell!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth definitely feel cleaner and I&#x27;m hoping that this brush will help with my gum disease. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Really does the job. Comes with a timer to help insure adequate brushing time. Attractive style and comes with brush heads so it&#x27;s ready to go out of the box. A bit pricey, but nit out of line with other eelectric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this very short (as possible) because Ive only had this brush 2 days but Im already looking more forward to brushing than I think I have ever been in my life.  All I can tell you is like most loyal Oral-B people I had my last electric brush for 12 years.  Tell me how many things you have spent money on in your house that have lasted 12 years?  I am sure back then I paid at least $99 for it so after careful consideration comparing all models and even looking at other brands, I decided to buy the top of the line unit.  (With coupon I paid less than $120 for this one) $120 over 12 years is less than .03 cents a day.  I think its worth .03 cents a day to get the very best jam packed product a company can make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will admit, if you are like me and use mobile apps to the extreme you can probably get the 5000 model as the 7000 comes with its own little Bluetooth computer to show progress.  The app is 100 times more detailed and makes the little computer thing look like a glorified travel clock.  Still I plan on mounting it in my bathroom just so in the morning when I&#x27;m half asleep I don&#x27;t have to hold my iPhone while I brush either.  The deluxe travel case however is 10 times better than the one that comes with the 5000 so I guess it all depends on what you are looking for.  For the past 12 years Ive had to deal with tossing my brush in a vanity case and having toothpaste smeared everywhere so I&#x27;m looking forward to cleaner luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush modes are amazing, at first I thought they were BS but the brush does change tempo to suit the various features.  For those who have sensitive gums like I do this will come in handy.  Although I have to warn you the horsepower on this thing is major so do not be shocked when you spit blood the first few times you use it.  Your teeth will feel like you just came form the dentist....no joke.  Couple that with a good tongue cleaning mode and floss and you literally will never have to go to the dentist except to gloat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real CON you will probably laugh at but its why I wont be giving this item 5 stars.  For the past 12 years my Oral-B brush has sat nicely on its charger which came with a simple wall plate to mount right next to my mirror in my bathroom.  With the minimal construction things are made with these days, I was seriously disappointed that I will now have to buy an actual shelf to put my new brush on.  Not the end of the world but certainly one thing I didn&#x27;t feel like doing just to change the way I brush.  My bathroom is small and I don&#x27;t have a sink with a counter top, it was a nice perch to place something I use everyday.  For now it will have to live on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second CON is I saw a YouTube video of an un-boxing of this product and it came with 4 extra tips (5 Total).  Mine only came with 2 (3 Total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing I will just add, I hope Oral-B can maintain the same level of quality...if so this review will stay unchanged.  If not I will be adding updates to this review with anything which prevents me from getting the same value I got 12 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay hygienic my friends!!!dentist except to gloat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real CON you will probably laugh at but its why I wont be giving this item 5 stars.

    <li> Awesome toothbrush so far! Teeth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> It was used, when I opened the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The toothbrush had dust on its handle and it was more than obvious that it is touched before,it did not look like a brand new device.&lt;br /&gt;2. The ring on the brush head was missing! Whoever put it back together forgot to put the ring back.&lt;br /&gt;3. Batteries had small scratches on them, and by looking at them you could tell that they are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in general, when you receive a used (possibly refurbished, maybe) product, you realize it, some people don&#x27;t care and continue using it but its a toothbrush and i don&#x27;t wanna use a used toothbrush...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but works great. My teeth never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> Brush works very well good brush shape, clock timer  does not work well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable to use compared to the brush it replaced, but it does seem to be getting my teeth a lot cleaner, and it&#x27;s very effective at getting the plaque in between. It&#x27;s reduced even some older, harder stuff on one of my teeth and I&#x27;ve only had it a week. I personally do not find the little Bluetooth unit useful.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush, weird quirks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to give it 5 starts because it cleans teeth so well, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a very long time to charge, more than 12 hours. Feels closer to 24 if charging from dead. Regular travelers should be mindful of this.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these they are incredible! Waited too long to get them. My teeth feel and look cleaner than ever!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is phenomenal!!! My teeth feel so much more clean, and they are looking brilliantly white. It was a little expensive, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Mouth feels so clean.  Only annoying thing is flashing light as it charges (our master bedroom and bathroom are open areas).</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it&#x27;s worth every dollar</li>
    <li> Battery die after 5 use, need to b recharge .. powerful but still dissapointed for oral b and the price</li>
    <li> I never thought I would spend more than $5 on a toothbrush, but I did and I don&#x27;t regret a single penny.  I brush my teeth regularly, but this toothbrush really does an amazing job with eliminating plaque and whitening at the same time.</li>
    <li> This oral-B does the job.  it replaced my old Oral-B of many years.  The Old one seemed to be rusting and I thought technology must be improved so I decided to replace it with another.  Overall I am satisfied with this new unit, but there are several things about it that I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is very annoying about this unit is what I call the disco lights.  There are blue lights that blink as the unit is charging.  In a dark room this blue light is rather bright.  We have an en suite bathroom in the master bedroom and if I forget to close the door after brushing my teeth before going to bed then that light annoy my wife and I while we&#x27;re laying in the bed.  It&#x27;s no big deal, but I find it amusing that I am concerned about the blue light on the tooth brush.  Just close the door and all is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. It is more powerful than my old Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;2. It has several settings for different types of brushing&lt;br /&gt;3. it has a timer so you can time how long you are brushing (I really like this feature)&lt;br /&gt;4. The timer unit also shows the current time when not timing your brushing.  That is a nice touch to the bathroom mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. It splashes more than my older brush though this may simply be due to it being more powerful (agitating faster or something)&lt;br /&gt;2. it has disco lights (see comments above)&lt;br /&gt;3. it takes up more space on the counter than my old brush&lt;br /&gt;4. The older brush was easier to hold than this one.  The old one was tubular this one is not tubular, but rather like a smashed in tube with contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again overall the brush does the job.  Though there are some cons they are not enough for me to get something else.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected from Braun .... top quality and superior performance.</li>
    <li> Got this at Christmas and went to the dentist in late February for routine cleaning  The hygeniest had much less to do this time and said whatever I was doing different to keep it up because it was working so well.  It&#x27;s this fancy shmancy black toothbrush.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Husband loved it for Christmas!</li>
    <li> omg ive always had oral b but always got the cheapest ones. switched to this and it is amazing!!! teeth get so clean. all the reviews that say they cannot switch the brush heads have to be sonicare reps. literally you just slide it off i have used these brushes for about 12 years and never had any issues removing or attaching heads or having them break in any way. also my family of 8 all use them for the same amount of time and have never reported such issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the regular Oral-B toothbrush for years, but recently replaced it with the Black 7000 model.  I am extremely pleased with my new one. It is so much more powerful than my old one that I was stunned at the difference in how much better it cleaned my teeth. My husband tried mine and now he wants one, too.  Thank you, Nadine Onodera.</li>
    <li> Love my Oral-B Black. I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B fan for 15 yrs... I like it so much, I should buy the company!</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush, the only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because Oral-B decided to make the Oral-B IPhone app exclusively for  US AppStore customers :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not a copyright issue because the app is available on the Android PlayStore&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B just choose to close it&#x27;s doors on it&#x27;s  Mexican customers, yet Amazon does ship the toothbrush to Mexico, very dissapointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it can&#x27;t be use with an IPhone, the toothbrush works as a regular 5000 series toothbrush :(</li>
    <li> Is very good,my firends is like it,thanks amazon.I am Chinese</li>
    <li> Great product, sleek design, aesthetically pleasing looks, this is a great product that works as expected. Very powerful, feels good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial charge the batteries didn&#x27;t last as long, currently lasting a week, although that is not a problem. When charging there is a flashing light that could be a little annoying to some people, it will look like a steady slow pulsing.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B 7000 SmartSeries is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; electric toothbrush. I had switched back and forth from manual toothbrushes and disposable electric ones. I knew plenty of people that utilize electric toothbrushes and always have my dentist harping on me to get one... However, I never felt the need to cough up the money to &amp;#34;invest&amp;#34; in a higher level electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to take the plunge and get one. I chose the Black 7000 SmartSeries brush because of the wide variety of brush heads available along with I thought that the travelcase (very high quality) that it comes with would get quite a bit of use from me. I have utilized this brush for around six months now and have noticed that my teeth feel cleaner and I got many more compliments at the dentist than usual without informing them that I made the switch. I personally use the floss-action head and the sensitive head.</li>
    <li> this is the 2nd oral B I have owned and I love it... The best toothbrush ever... Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> best ever! recommend to my friends. bought 4 already</li>
    <li> better than my old philips brush, but the battery is really bad, it even cannot last one week.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  I love the timer, and all of the settings available on it.  I feel like my teeth are getting super clean and the different brush heads that are available.</li>
    <li> Just dont like the battery ..... have to recharge every other day</li>
    <li> Returned it for a soniccare at the recommendation of my dental hygienist, dentist and periodontist (no kidding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well and looks great, but the rotating action isn&#x27;t as good on your gums as the side/side per the experts.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> great difference from the normal ORAL B professional electri tooth brush...greatly recommend it..it has a protetive plastic cover which was needed to avoid ruust..</li>
    <li> Very excellent and I am very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> After my first oral B tooth brush decided to die I had for 7-8 years I decided to buy this one. It&#x27;s amazing well worth the money. My teeth are also happy!</li>
    <li> Mine was dead on arrival. The battery compartment was broken, spent at least half an hour with a friend just to be sure I was not doing something stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not function at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the design to use the CHARGER to unscrew the battery compartment is a bad design. I will not be buying a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a year and it won&#x27;t hold a charge for longer than a day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that comes with all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> i like it.&lt;br /&gt;However, there are 2 things i didn&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1) it&#x27;s 110 v&lt;br /&gt;2) the sharging is too slow</li>
    <li> the charger is only 100-130V</li>
    <li> Excellent! Been using electric toothbrush for a while now, but this oral b brush is an excellent upgrade. Wish the free Brush heads were a little smaller (you can buy smaller ones)</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrush. does the job extremely well.</li>
    <li> Totally love it would defenetly recomend it. Take it with me even when i travel. A lil bit hard to get used to it but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love the upgrades on this model. The sensitivity sensor really lets me know when I am being too heavy handed. I appreciate that. The extra modes help me to do a more thorough job than ever before. When I am finished, my teeth feel like I just stepped out of the dentist chair minus the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My battery died after a year. I took the toothbrush apart and the battery is soldered to the toothbrush. Also I cannot find a replacement battery. My last oral b lasted for more than 5 years and the battery was still going strong when I replace it with this expensive waste of money.</li>
    <li> MY NEW DENTIST ADVISED ME TO GET A TOOTHBRUSH SUCH AS THIS. ( I HAD ANOTHER BREAND THAT IS NO LONGER WORKING) SO I INVESTED INTO THIS BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS FUN TO USE AS I LOVE THE &amp;#34;BLUETOOTH&amp;#34; LITTLE GUY WHO SMILES WHEN YOU DO A GOOD BRUSHING.&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH IT IS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IT DOES LET YOU KNOW IF YOU BRUSHED LONG ENOUGH AND GOOD ENOUGH. IF NOTN, HE FROWNS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY TEETH FEEL SO WONDERFULLY CLEAN AGAIN. SO GLAD THAT I DECIDED UPON THE ORAL B. IT IS GENTLE TO MY GUMS, AS I JUST GOT BRACES OFF A YEAR AGO, AND NOW UNDERGOING IMPLANTS AND BRIDGE CROWNS.&lt;br /&gt;AND GENTLE TO MY GUMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE BLACK BRUSH AS MY BATHROOM IS DECORATED IN BLACK ACCENTS IN PICTURES. AND MY COUNTER TOP IS (STONE)  LIKE  BLACK GRANITE...SO THIS BRUSH LOOKS GREAT SITTING ON THE COUNTER.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT YOU MIGHT EVEN LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO.</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference since using this product. I have gum disease and now my teeth feel and look cleaner. The bluetooth connection from the toothbrush to the app is like a motivator/personal coach that tracks my progress as far as brushing,  tongue cleaning, flossing and rinsing and gives me pointers for improvement. I also purchased a separate tongue cleaner,  Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner, Stainless Steel, and the two products together have improved the health and cleanliness of my teeth, gums and tongue. My only complaint on the toothbrush is that you have to go into the app on your phone in order for results to be recorded. Would prefer automatic upload of brushing data once the  brush and phone are in bluetooth range.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest toothbrush i have ever used.  The timer and accessories that come with it are amazing.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I was very much a disbeliever in all the electric toothbrush hoopla, but after using this i am amazed.  The way my teeth feel when i wake up in the morning or even at the end of a long day is amazing.... Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have cerebral palsy so a electric tooth bush is a must as manual I miss a lot. This baby cost a lot but it feels like a dental hygienist tool in your mouth. I had a lot of Oral-B brushes under $50 and they never worked this way and my teeth feels so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this mainly due to the fact I missed my floss action head which I used on my old one. I believe the floss action is the best head ever made by Oral-B. Due to power issues at my old apartment two of my bases died I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two modes I tested were&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Clean - This is the first setting and what flashing on the Smart timer which gives you a smiley face if you brush for 2 mins. I used this and it felt like a dentist hygienist tool in my mouth. Like I was laying in a chair having my teeth clean. It felt much different then any other Oral-B I ever used for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening - I switch heads to the pro white and again felt the same. I have used this head in the pass and I know it works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart guide or timer I call it flashes each section of a circle. This is suppose to be a outline of your mouth right top / bottom  then left top / bottom. The goal is to brush each part for the full time it flashes which is 30 secs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I  believe it will take time to get brushing the way the smart guide wants. If you need a new toothbrush this is the one to get. The price is high but I swear my teeth feels like I went to my dentist and had my teeth clean. The black looks slick also and the carry case is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just notice after 6 days the handle says TRIUMPH Professional Care it on the side sliver part.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I typically purchase SoniCare products, but I thought the price was a real bargain for the Oral-B and I was not very picky. However, this product is so difficult to really take out of the box and use. I guess, you have to spend time reading the directions and building the little gadget that comes with it. I honestly, don&#x27;t have time to put batteries into the little gadget, find a place in my bathroom and monitor my brushing habits. I need something that shows which setting I am using on the toothbrush. OTHERWISE, when the battery dies in the little gadget that accompanies the product, you have to replace it or tsk.. tsk... memorize the 6 speeds? I loved my Sonicare flex model, because it shows me which brushing stage that I am using and makes it simple. Let&#x27;s face it.. I have only so much time to shower, brush my hair, style, creams, makeup, etc. I am not going to spend added time, monitoring this product. Unfortunately, you have to send it back (once opened) to ORAL-B, for a VISA gift card refund, from the date of purchase, not when you receive it. I am packing it up and shipping this item back. Back to Sonicare, I go!</li>
    <li> my teetyh feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the Dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!!! I ordered it in the morning and got it the very next day. It has so many cool features, its very sleek and makes your morning brushing regime so FUN. This is pricey, but much cheaper on amazon then in stores. Almost a $40.00 difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt cleaner. Very powerful. My teeth got a little sore the first couple of times I used it. Changed the setting to gentler for a few times and now have it set to normal and everything is great. I previously Owen a Sonicare toothbrush and the Oral-b gets my teeth cleaner.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush it&#x27;s amazing who big it&#x27;s the change on the cleaning. ...I should by them long time ago</li>
    <li> I guess this electric travel toothbrush is meant for guys...  but it&#x27;s SO sleek looking and I love it!  I call it my luxury toothbrush.  I take pride in my teeth and I love to travel so it is absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and I bought it during an Amazon discount promo coincidentally - extra $20 off :)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great. I love the different brush heads that come with the kit, and the clock that keeps track of your brushing. I gives your teeth that clean feeling you get after going to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and great product at the best price around.</li>
    <li> Best rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Timer feature is great and doubles as a small clock. Only issues, and why I give it four stars is that the blue flashing light while charging is annoying at night.</li>
    <li> The charger cannot be used in Singapore:-(((</li>
    <li> Probably the best electric toothbrushes I have used. Many settings with good power.  Like the three minute dual program. Gives both deep cleaning and massage.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I went without an electric for a few weeks and tried to convince myself that the upgrade wasn&#x27;t worth it when my previous version stopped charging. The case alone is worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because after 3 years my 5000 bit the dust. Love this brand. Brushing with a manual toothbrush will never again make my teeth feel as clean as brushing with this thing! I&#x27;ve talked several people into making the switch and they said the same thing.</li>
    <li> Awesome produc! Battery should be lithium-ion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B 7000 for a month now and I love it! It will take care of every dental need you could possibly have and the travel case is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> Travelling only in 110-130V areas. Big dissappointment for a brush of this high price. Actually, Braun does not support any world travel tooth brush, except cheap batterie models.</li>
    <li> 1- Charger damaged! Stopped working just work with 110~ v, It&#x27;s not universal 220~ v , i should buy a universal charger about 220~ v&lt;br /&gt;2- Clock bluetooth device is not counting correctly, sometimes you wash your teeth without resetting time auto.&lt;br /&gt;3- Battery is low in quality i fully Charged 24h and used 1 time about 4-5 minutes then level indicator from 3 becomes 1 shows red indicator then stopped working, it&#x27;s a very big problem i faced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I returned items to seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sor for that reason i give 2 stars</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it!  My dentist loves it too.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my wife.  They work much better than our older power toothbrushes.  And, the display we hang on our mirror makes me always brush for the 2 minutes so I have the happy face on the display.</li>
    <li> The old electric toothbrushes, electric toothbrushes have been used, it is important to be honest</li>
    <li> This is one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made in a while. It&#x27;s easy to use and I get amazing results. My teeth have never been so clean on a regular basis. Totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A very nice toothbrush I had read about it in Popular Science magazine and it is all that it says it is. The little LCD screen is kinda more towards kids who may use this but to the general user the main unit is well built does a great job and is well worth the money. It is a little steep but the electric engine is BRAUN so its not a cheapie unit.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush with the typical Braun build quality- excellent!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It educates you on not to brush so hard with a happy and frown face depiction on a portable screen that is included.  It gets a 4 star because it will pause for a second to let you know to brush other areas of the teeth which is annoying at first, but I got used to it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for christmas for my son, he said he really likes it</li>
    <li> Excellent. Works beautifully and your teeth perfectly white. Amazing.</li>
    <li> better than the sonic</li>
    <li> Got it cheaper than normal, great product, but still looks fragile for something that works as daily basis like a toothbrush</li>
    <li> I like this Oral-B Black 7000 very much, it is worth that price very much. The SmartGuide is a clever design, it uses bluetooth to connect with toothbrush and it works perfectly to provide guide how much time needed for each different model. The only thing I&#x27;m not happy is Oral-B App I install on my iPhone can&#x27;t work, it can&#x27;t find my toothbrush...</li>
    <li> best electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> All the different heads, lights, modes, and features.  I love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good, very satisfied with the shopping</li>
    <li> Great product, gadgetty, does a great job getting my teeth clean. I found I&#x27;m more likely to brush more regularly since I bought this. It does a much better job than I used to do in a shorter time. I like the little screen that comes with it the feedback is a nice feature, and it doubles as a clock when not brushing. The case the brush comes with is nice as well. I found this product to be very well designed and easy to hold and use. I would definitely recommend it, and have. My dentist recommended a lower model of this line to me over the sonic toothbrushes and I decided to go one step up since I caught it on sale. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I feel I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth out of it in health benefits.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing</li>
    <li> To many settings..... it does the job.</li>
    <li> Just love this!  Amazing !</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush, but there is a lot of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; added to this model which is of dubious value.  It would be better if they stuck to the basics and lowered the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 months now and my mouth feels refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B toothbrush has some very neat features to it, let alone the fun timer that comes with it. This toothbrush is travelable very easily goes inside a boxed container and holds everything nicely. This also comes in black with blue LED digital screen at the bottom to tell you when the brush needs to be changed. The Oral-B Precision Black 7000 features the following included in pack: Rechargeable Toothbrush Handle, Charging station with brush head storage, Wireless SmartGuide, Handle Travel Case, and 3 Refill Heads – 1 Sensitive, 1 ProWhite, 1 Floss Action. When you&#x27;re brushing to hard it will tell you to stop, soon enough you will be knowing that it&#x27;s a power brush and not a regular one. The toothbrush is super easy to set up, needs to charge overnight and then ready to use. The handle to hold it while brushing fits into your hand nicely and when wet it stays put. After its been fully charged and has stayed off the charger for a few days now, and still very powerful. This brush has some great setting built-in and some great indicators to tell you when you need to do things. Like when your gums are bad, tongue cleaner, deep clean mode for 3 minutes not 2 minutes, massage, whitening and sensitive mode as well as many other neat features. Within right away it told me what needed to be worked on, however my husband got better end results with it then me. He has healthier teeth than I do. We seem to love it, though he took it. You get many different types of brushes with it, and you can buy them to for the cool features it has. Whichever your teeth prefer over others. There is 5 heads you can choose from and comes with 3. They all have different feeling when in use, and each do great for closed together teeth, spread apart teeth, and teeth that are in different spots. Great for everyone. Though if you have fake teeth not so ordeal for you.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful, fun featured toothbrush for your man in your life, this is perfect for him!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better is never the response you want from a product but in this case the Phillip Sonicare is so much better. The Bluetooth connection is a neat feature but you have to actually open the app on your phone for it to connect, if not the application sends you nasty messages like we haven&#x27;t seen you in 10 days. The battery life isn&#x27;t great as I only charge mine when it is less than 33% and that occurs at least once a week. One of the biggest drawbacks is that there is no way to know which cleaning setting you&#x27;re using on the device itself, you have to reference the detached screen.</li>
    <li> Great machine, noticed the difference almost immediately...</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is good ,but it takes a very long time to charge</li>
    <li> In general this is a terrific electric toothbrush with a lot of bells and whistles. It&#x27;s a little noisier than I was expecting, and for all of the different modes and features, I was a little disappointed by the controls. I never know which cleaning mode I&#x27;m in -- I was expecting either the app or the device itself to tell me if I was in Deep Clean or Whitening or whatever -- and the Bluetooth connection is sometimes slower than I&#x27;d like. Also, I wish the app would tell me when the battery was getting low, so I wouldn&#x27;t get all the way down to zero charge. (To be fair, I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush paired to my phone so I haven&#x27;t tried the included LCD readout thingamajig.) The travel case is pretty nifty, too. Amazon was offering a coupon when I bought it so it was a pretty good deal and I&#x27;d recommend it overall.</li>
    <li> I really like the timer that comes with the toothbrush. This toothbrush is well built and well balanced.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush.  It&#x27;s worth a few extra dollars for the nice carrying case and extra brush head.  I first bought the lower model - but exchanged it for this model (I love Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For either model the bio-feedback is great for making sure you brush your teeth (I was never a good &#x27;timed brusher&#x27; and I&#x27;ve always been a fan of &#x27;bio feedback&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few hours of &#x27;Amazon Shopping&#x27; to decide - but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.  It may be my last tooth brush.  I have all 5 heads - and use a different head every three days - for good teeth care.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I have owned.  Had a sonic for many years.  This one is superior in every way.&lt;br /&gt;Nice travel case too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. Different settings, and pressure settings are cool.  It was on sale, but i wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> After using a Sonicare for the past 15 years, I observed the quality went downhill (first brush lasted ~12 years and the second all of ~3) while the brush heads kept getting more expensive.  So, decided to switch to another model.  Oral-B has a good name and a long-time in the electric toothbrush market, so decided to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head design is much different.  My teeth feel cleaner at the gum line and equally clean on the tooth.  But, it&#x27;s harder to comfortably maneuver in the rear of my mouth to get all of the surface on my back teeth. I&#x27;m curious to see what my hygienist is going to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a sturdy feel and the material has a nice tack to it so there isn&#x27;t any slippage in use.  The brush pause ever 30 seconds is a bit long for the purpose, but it works. The clock/timer is a cute device that gamifies your brushing experience... ultimately unnecessary, though. And it&#x27;s about equal in loudness and at a lower pitch compared to the Sonicares I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost three months of use, I&#x27;m satisfied and see the brush as an equal alternative to my old Sonicare.  That said, I don&#x27;t see either brush as giving a perfect brushing experience.</li>
    <li> I am always a big fan of Braun for its craftmanship and engineering detail but this product does not live it up to the reputation at all.  It is an &amp;#34;Oral-B&amp;#34;.  The handling is bulky and very slippery when it gets wet.  It takes a long time to charge and the battery uses up fast.  I know it is induction-charging but my previous Philips Sonicare is not that bad at all.  The RF timer and display is a joke, wasting the limited battery.  The traveller case is meant to be for traveller but it is heavy and bulky.  And, the charger is just 110V only when it is so common for universal charger for 110V to 240V for international use.  A very bad experience with Braun / Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Quite an excellent product indeed... Just too bad can&#x27;t buy in Asia as Dlvry take a month..</li>
    <li> A big improvement over my 3 year old prior Oral B. However by the 4th use the battery still fails to hold a charge for more than 2 minutes of brushing before it is drained. Would be an excellent corded tooth brush. Since I had good luck with my prior one I will try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Update:&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with Amazon and of course with their fantastic customer service I was overnighted a new one. This one works perfect and really is a huge upgrade to my prior Oral B. I would give it 5 stars but knocked a point off for having to do the exchange. 5 stars for Amazon Service though. I would get another one of these for family.</li>
    <li> Update: battery stopped charging after 6months. Warranty voided for some unknown reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: I&#x27;ve been doing the &amp;#34;two-minute&amp;#34; brush time for years with standard tooth brushes, but this definitely works more efficiently. The pressure sensor has also helped reduce my habit of brushing too hard. It has dozens of cleaning modes, including gum messaging and tongue cleaning, and the waterproof body means I can brush in the shower and not worry about the toothbrush. The secondary display is easy to read, and has multiple means of communicating your brushing status, including a timer and graphic display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It takes almost the whole day to get a full charge. Definitely not the best for travel because you still have to bring the charging stand if you will be gone for a week. The travel case is rather bulky. Granted, this is because the toothbrush is rather bulky. I definitely prefer the Philips DiamondClean for sleekness and the fact that the travel case doubles as a charging stand. The secondary display isn&#x27;t really necessary. Being battery operated, once I run out of the two sets of batteries the toothbrush came with, I&#x27;m not likely to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Very good cleaning tool. My only real complaint is that Oral-B seems to think I want a ton of bells and whistles on top of solid performance.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love the speed and the timing to tell me when to wake up and move onto next area in my mouth.</li>
    <li> As many have already stated, if you don&#x27;t need the fancy travel case and the tongue brush mode, you&#x27;re better off buying the 5000. That said, while I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the markup, I decided I wanted the tongue brush mode option and bought it anyway. Essentially 50 bucks extra for a tongue scraper, yeah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I rate this only 2 out of 5 because:&lt;br /&gt;1. The aforementioned reasons&lt;br /&gt;2. The awful battery. In this day and age, I do not think it&#x27;s acceptable to incorporate such a lousy battery tech into a flagship device.  I mean, come on... 24hrs for a full charge that only lasts a week of regular use? That translates to a mere whopping 14 minutes, then you&#x27;ll need to recharge for at least 2 hours to squeeze 2 minutes of brushing time. For a top-of-the-line electronic product. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that it&#x27;s non-replaceable. Once the battery has reached the end of its lifetime, instead of simply purchasing a new replacement battery or sending it to some Oral-B/Braun service center for battery replacement, the manual actually instructs you to just throw away the entire toothbrush - a perfectly good, working piece of hardware, just because the internal batteries are dead. Are you for real, Oral-B/Braun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium DISPOSABLE electric toothbrush, folks. It&#x27;s intentionally designed so that the whole thing is destroyed if the battery is removed. I&#x27;d rather this was some conspiracy bulls***, but what I just said is written in clear text with illustrations right in the manual. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I actually like this product. Its cleaning capabilities are amazing, and I even find the somewhat gimmicky SmartGuide to be useful. But the battery issue really kills it, enough to knock it down to 2 stars and a solid DO NOT RECOMMEND from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2014/11/26:&lt;br /&gt;Someone left a comment and deleted it while I was writing up a response. I&#x27;ve decided to append my reply here since I believe the commenter raised a few valid points that I&#x27;d like to address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your input, I&#x27;m glad the product is still going strong for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t doubt the build quality of the toothbrush, rather I&#x27;m criticizing the \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; route they took when developing it. There is absolutely no reason to design it so that the product is destroyed if the battery needs removal. I find it highly unlikely to be an engineering limitation as you suggested. For example, although a different product category, Sony makes waterproof smartphones (the latest model Z3 has an amazing IPX8 rating), yet it can still be serviced, including battery replacement, without destroying the entire phone. Obviously, it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I didn&#x27;t say it has to be designed for end user replacement, I mentioned the possibility of sending it in for servicing, but that&#x27;s not even an option for the Black 7000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there has been some improvement in battery technology since you bought yours 8 years ago. Yet according to the numbers given in the manual and your experience, it seems the battery performance is pretty much still the same as it was 8 years ago. I suppose one can argue that it&#x27;s a cost factor for budget devices, but how is it acceptable for a flagship device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had the chance of bringing the Black 7000 on a 5 day vacation trip. I intentionally left the charger at home to see how the battery fares in real world scenarios. There were two users, brushed twice daily, I used standard mode and my wife uses the sensitive mode, no usage past the preset time of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - Performed same as it was at home; remaining battery end of day is 3 bars.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 - Noticeable degrade in motor power, I&#x27;d wager it was running at ~80% of original brushing level; 2 bars left&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 - Similar to Day 2; 2 bars left&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 - Significantly dropped performance, sounds like it was struggling to keep going; 1 bar left&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 - Only used once in the morning, felt like it was gasping for air; battery indicator flashed red&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say I was impressed with the battery life. The next time I&#x27;m on a trip for more than 4 days, I&#x27;m bringing the charger as well. Unfortunately, the premium travel case does not accommodate the charger, you&#x27;d have to pack it in a separate pouch (included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a myth that battery degrades over time, it&#x27;s science. Eventually, the battery will die, period. When that happens, your premium electric toothbrush becomes either a pain in the ass to use since it can&#x27;t hold a charge, or becomes a fancy relic destined for the dump. But why should it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Interestingly, I could not find a waterproof rating for the Black 7000 in the manual or on their website.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 - Only used once in the morning, felt like it was gasping for air; battery indicator flashed red&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say I was impressed with the battery life.

    <li> Best toothbrush to own</li>
    <li> All of the issues I have are already on here but I want to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery issue is there. Takes a very long time to fully charge....Like days...You have to recharge it almost weekly. They reccomend you keep it on the charger and plugged in, but some of us dont like to waste electricity. The motor is very powerful so I am assuming the discharge is faster due to this, and I am hoping the recharge time is slow so as to not burn out the battery(trickle charge)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again after using it.</li>
    <li> 铁杆是歪的，插牙刷头后也歪，每次需要充电24小时。因为退换邮费太贵，只能认了。&lt;br /&gt;There are some problems with it. The top of the handle is not right straight. It is a little distorted. And when I put the brush head on the handle. The brush handle will be distorted too.  Im a little disappointed. I am in china , the freight costs me 20$ from America to China.I want to return this goods. And who is gonna undertake the round trip freight?</li>
    <li> Very good purchase. Very satisfied. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Tons of brushing modes! Wireless monitor is very convenient.</li>
    <li> very good!very good!very good!very good!</li>
    <li> Here are some quick pros &amp; cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely stylish-more so in person than the product images&lt;br /&gt;-Love that it came with 6 brushing modes&lt;br /&gt;-Love that it came with 3 different brushing heads ( i used the sensitive head)&lt;br /&gt;-The small brush head is extremely convenient to reach the hardest spots on your teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging was phenomenal and very profesional&lt;br /&gt;-Charging dock &amp; case was very nice&lt;br /&gt;-The toothbrush itself cleaned really nicely! My teeth felt &amp;#34;after-dentist&amp;#34; clean every day and was getting noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-BATTERY is horrid...I was only getting 10 brush cycles (2:30 on each cycle-23 minutes total life)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery recharge is 24+ hours&lt;br /&gt;-The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t remember where you left off (I always used the sensitive brushing mode &amp; had to cycle to it every day)&lt;br /&gt;-The overall toothbrush is massive&lt;br /&gt;-Cannot charge overseas due to the restricted voltage&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the brush head actually caused my gums to recede&lt;br /&gt;-The Oral B smartguide was rather gimmicky...It never truly sensed if I was brushing hard and I always ended with a smiley face, even after one day of scrubbing really hard on my hand for 2 minutes. As long as you hit that two minute deadline you&#x27;ll end up with a smiley face. The extra clock in my bathroom was nice however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I returned this toothbrush to get the diamondclean sonicare black (on sale through amazon for $154 after coupon) because of the horrid battery and that my gums were receeding due to the brush head. It is a great toothbrush (minus the battery) and I would recommend it to anyone, HOWEVER I would warn people about the battery beforehand.</li>
    <li> Too bad, much worse than philipe&#x27;s sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;1, no travel ac.only a 110v ac.radiculous.&lt;br /&gt;2, verb too strong, not good for teeth.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great! I used to have a sonicare toothbrush but this one is much better.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toothbrush, I highly recommend this product. I have sensitive teeth and this toothbrush is perfect. I finally have super white teeth. My dentist was surprise with my result. Excellence service, nothing was missing, came in perfect condition and on time.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush.  It let&#x27;s you know all kinds of things:  When you haven&#x27;t brush enough; when you&#x27;re brushing too hard; when to change to a different quadrant.  when you&#x27;ve brushed 30 seconds on each quadrant (2 minutes for the math impaired), you get a smiley face and 4 stars on the clock.  If you go just 30 seconds longer, you will get a wink with 5 stars, by golly.</li>
    <li> Not good. I wanted a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; toothbrush that was going to help me focus on the 2 minutes of brushing you&#x27;re supposed to do while using a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; brush head to get between my teeth. For the first week, my teeth did feel a little cleaner. However, after a month, I now know why. This brush beats the crap out of my gums...to the point where they&#x27;re actually sore to brush for the full 2 minutes. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive gums but I know I never had this issue with my old Phillips Sonicare. I discussed this issue with my sister who works at a dentist&#x27;s office and she said none of the dentists like the Oral-B roundhead brushes for the same reason I&#x27;m having...it&#x27;s too aggressive on the gums and can cause gums to recede. I&#x27;ve gone back to my Sonicare recently and my gums are feeling much better. I know there is a sensitive brush option on this model and I started using that when my gums first got sore but it still didn&#x27;t help. Overall, the brush head is VERY aggressive. If you can handle the aggressive brush head, it&#x27;s a really nice toothbrush. The display unit is cool...it&#x27;s a clock and automatically starts the 2 minute timer when you start brushing. At every 30-second mark, the brush motor pauses while you switch quadrants. The carry case and charger are very nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the purpose of a toothbrush is to clean you teeth, I&#x27;m giving this one star. The accessories don&#x27;t help without doing the primary function well.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better on the market than this toothbrush. German engineering can&#x27;t be beaten! Highly recommend. Worth every cent of the purchase.</li>
    <li> Pressure sensor is bogus, bought this because I brush too hard and the pressure sensor really only detects if you&#x27;re trying to use it as a crowbar to break into a bank vault. Other than that, it charges nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big downside is the super annoying blinking light, I used electrical tape to cover it up but at night it is very annoying.</li>
    <li> Love using this toothbrush! Great looking and most imporlantly, leaves my mouth feeling super clean and fresh!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using sonicare since my dentist recommended it, I switched to the premium 7000 when a deal came upon it and I thought I was moving to a more premium brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things are great about this brush, the 1st time you hold it its a premium feel and the LCD display is also a nice gimmick. However the good things end there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The spin motion of the brush is very harsh, I can feel the enamel being worn away, 30 days of continuous brushing and my teeth are now super sensitive. I prefer the sonic motion of the Sonicare vs the spin motion. I know its cleaning, but it feels like its eroding my teeth while its cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For a MSRP $200 brush, the battery is plain junk. It lasts only 3-4 days and takes 24 hours to charge. There is no excuse for it, my 90s cellphone had a better battery. The thing is also very heavy presumably because of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. No 220V charger, for the demographic they should be aiming at, travel is a fact of life, unfortunately for Braun/OralB the whole world doesnt run on 110V so if you are travelling , there is a good chance you need a spare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The handle is far from ergonomic, by mistake I keep pressing the mode buttons,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The brushing indicator is a sham, you finish at 2 minutes even with harsh pressure and it will give you 4 stars, spend an extra minute with say the floss/tongue cleaner mode and it will always give you five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to return this to Amazon and go for the sonicare diamondclean platinum which has a 3 week battery life and usb charging as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope people read this review also, somehow the Vine reviews always seem to be biased for the product and arent very neutral. I hope I get to vine someday and give more objective views.</li>
    <li> In less than two months a full battery charge lasts fewer than 4 uses.  I&#x27;m not sure if our battery was defective or if others have the same issue.  Either way it is an issue since one can&#x27;t return the toothbrush after 30 days.</li>
    <li> Excellent machine. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I am replacing an Oral B 500 that I have used for over 15 years. It has the same NiMH battery as the new 7000 and it lasted over 15 years. I don&#x27;t feel the least concerned with the battery issue everyone else is talking about. This is the Cadillac of toothbrushes. I am over 60 years old and have all my own teeth - Oral B helped me keep them there.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I voraciously read all the reviews both here on amazon and on various other websites of both this toothbrush and the sonic-care diamond care black toothbrush. It was a toss up because this toothbrush had so many great features that the sonic-care did not but the sonic-care touted a much longer battery life. I opted for this tooth brush and I could not be more happy. My dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush because it promotes clean teeth and gums to a much higher extent than a normal toothbrush. My teeth have naturally deep valleys in them so I am more prone to cavities than most people. Because of this I have always tried to take immaculate care of my teeth. Unfortunately there is only so much I could do.&lt;br /&gt;I have now had this toothbrush for a full week and I can say without reservation that this is the cleanest my teeth have ever felt. It delivers a just got back from the dentist level of cleanliness and that alone is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;The battery has yet to be a major issue for me obviously as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week but it does last as advertised. A little more than a week between charges. I am fully satisfied and I feel like anyone searching for an electric toothbrush need look no further than this.</li>
    <li> Bulky. Makes you slobber like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;I had a Philips Sonicare HX6921/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;with a small brush, and it worked great until it died 4 years later.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this Oral-B brush and purchase my old Phillips Sonicare back.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny so far. The charge last a long time, and I get a great tooth brush. My teeth get a deeper cleaning than from what I was using a battery operated tooth brush. So far, a good buy.</li>
    <li> Received this item in April and as of this morning it&#x27;s dead, piece of junk and I can&#x27;t send it back. This was a waste of $147 dollars.</li>
    <li> Excellent Battery Life, and like all of the settings.</li>
    <li> My friend got it and he said that the Bluetooth did not work and 2 days later it said it was changed but it didn&#x27;t turn on</li>
    <li> What a waste of beautiful toothbrush with a ridiculous smiley face clock, that monitors your brushing. Really annoying idea, like having your parents watching over you as you brush your teeth. You pay alot extra for something like an enormous travel case, and the absurd smiley clock, that you just no not need.&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine.</li>
    <li> Heavier and bulkier than other Oral B models.</li>
    <li> These are excellent toothbrushes - I&#x27;ve been using earlier ones for some years now.  With the correct brush head you can really get your teeth clean.  One charge lasts for many uses - 10 - 20 in my experience without noticeable loss of power.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Oral b just put the dentists office in my latrine!  Hoorah!!  2nd best teeth cleaning, only to be trumped by a dentist!  Extremely satisfied customer!!!  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my OralB Triumph Professional Care 9000 toothbrush. My toothbrush battery was kaput. I was pleasantly surprised that my old SmartGuide (sensor with clock off the old 9000 toothbrush) works with my new black toothbrush. In fact, the new Black 7000 toothbrush works with both at the same time. The old SmartGuide, which is waterproof, is in my shower while the new one hangs near my bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this toothbrush. I love the various settings which can accommodate your specific daily preference for example, the whitening mode actually works, altough you do have to use it long enough to see the gradual results. The only weird part was adjusting to the SmartGuide attachment that you paste to the wall, but after a while you get used to it, especially after getting five stars for brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it! Teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> good pricing, great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. We use it all the time and I feel it leaves my teeth very clean with little effort. Our old one lasted 3+ years but was not holding a charge for more than a couple days. Would I purchase it again: Yes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to recharge&lt;br /&gt;Charger is only 110v so it can&#x27;t be easily used overseas&lt;br /&gt;Travel case is nice but heavy</li>
    <li> Like this product very much. Was as advertised and came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> very good, but I need a voltage transformer because I am in China.</li>
    <li> Really good electric toothbrush. Not sure how it is different from the older models. Makes my mouth feel really fresh. I will not go back to a manual brush any time soo .</li>
    <li> I love it very much !</li>
    <li> We have an older 5000 version of this brush; it still works after 4 years, but the battery needs to be replaced (they made it non-replaceable, but there are 3rd party replacements and instructions available online, rather complicated process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7000 is actually a downgrade from our 4 years old 5000:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Non-compatible for travel, 110V only. The older model was 110-240&lt;br /&gt;2. No constant battery charge indicator. The older one had an LCD with the remained charge indication which is always on and visible. The new one is not active unless you press the button. Very inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other issues are loooong charge time, and rather heavy travel case.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband because he needed a new one.  After he raved about how great it worked and how clean his teeth feel I decided to buy one for myself.  It&#x27;s the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It comes with a dial that detects pressure sensitivity, a timer and also indicates which of the 6 modes you&#x27;re using.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Unit would not power on after opening the box and pressing the power button.  Battery was completely dead on arrival.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was normal, so I plugged in the charger and left it to charge.  20 hours of continuous charging and the battery indicator was only blinking the one bottom battery bar, showing 1/3 of charge.  20 hours of charging and only one blinking bar?  I figured this was a bad sign and I returned it without ever having used the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> First time going to an electric toothbrush and works great! very happy with this product...</li>
    <li> The exterior timer is a little obnoxious, but equally informative. The toothbrush has a great battery life, and will make you wonder why you pay a dentist to clean your teeth. Brush heads are currently about $20-$25 on Amazon for a three pack, but this is a pretty modest investment considering the importance of oral hygiene vs discretionary income.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B toothbrushes for 24 years. After having suffered severe gum disease that required surgery the dentist recommended the Oral-B toothbrushes, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7000 is the top of the range, and as a number of other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s way overpriced compared to the 5000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for one additional function (out of six), a better carry case, a slightly smaller clock, and the black coloring, the 5000 is the same toothbrush. The 7000 is certainly not worth the additional $60 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care though if you choose to buy the 5000 as there are two different models. The earlier model has been discontinued, but it appears that some retailers are still selling it. It seems that there is a latent defect with the battery, which in my case lasted just over a year. There are a number of other people who have had the same problem as a search on the Internet will confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An irritation with both the new 5000 and the 7000 models is the electrical adapter which is rated 110-130 V. For an electrical device that needs to go everywhere, that&#x27;s an issue, especially when it costs so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great toothbrush, the 5000 is well worth the money. The 7000 isn&#x27;t worth the difference in price.</li>
    <li> seems OK and clean well but it cannot be fully charged.</li>
    <li> this was the cheapest i could find anywhere, i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Really like this toothbrush. Brushes teeth well without jarring and pounding one&#x27;s head like sonic brushes do. When set up with the enclosed clock/timer, there is a 30 second countdown for each quadrant with a smiley face reward when done.  Three different heads included, a very nice travel case, all beautifully packaged.</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed overseas, and was so happy with the delivery time of my new Toothbrush. Thanks and hope you won&#x27;t charge me too much for a replacement brush.</li>
    <li> They have taken the toothbrush to the extreme...all I wanted to  d was clean my teeth, I do not want to have a conversation with the brush</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Love all the cleaning modes and it looks nice. It was a great deal on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good thing for teeth health</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush and I could not be happier.  Braun / Oral-B was recommended by my dentist for cleaning those tough areas.  This one works great and has a lot of neat features.</li>
    <li> Just as described, it works well</li>
    <li> loved it until it quit working.  My old Oral b was years old and inexpensive.  Got this one and two years into it it quit.  so annoyed because I just threw away the old one.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this tooth brush and feel that it is very beneficial to my oral health.</li>
    <li> love it! excellent quality, love oral-b !</li>
    <li> So for the price, It was a bargain deal. I recently had Jaw surgery and if your getting this for post surgical clean up. I DO NOT Reccommend this product because its very very rough on the gums and when it makes contact to your enamels it gives you a very weird feeling.(Uncomfortable). So for a good electric toothbrush yes. but, post surgical cleaning no..</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a 7000 from several years ago.  The old 7000 was a simple, good electric toothbrush.  The new version comes in two boxes of non-friendly packaging including a separate timer electronically connected to the toothbrush, a total waste of money and resources.  As to the toothbrush itself, the amount of electronics requires a handle so large that it almost impossible to hold.  All in all, a case of marketing trumping functionality..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned multiple tooth brushes throughout the years, manual brushed and powered brushes.  My dental hygienist recommended this brush to me during one of my visits.  As I get older I&#x27;m more and more concerned about my teeth and their longevity.  I purchased this and received it within 2 days.  I had to wait 24 hours to use it but boy am I happy with this purchase!  Every time I use it I feel like I just got a deep cleaning.  My gums don&#x27;t bleed at all any more.  (Even though I had &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; habits beforehand I&#x27;d still bleed a little when I would get a cleaning) This thing has a timer, it pauses at 30 second intervals reminding me to move to the next quadrant of my teeth, and even lets me know when I&#x27;m pressing too hard.  If you&#x27;ve got the money to invest in this toothbrush I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Handle too big. I keep pressing the mode button by mistake. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> love it! does everything it claims</li>
    <li> I got this brush for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-small head which makes it easier to clean the back wisdom teeth&lt;br /&gt;-travel case&lt;br /&gt;-tongue setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can get similar benefits from the older model, but as one who travels rather frequently, the upgrade was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to have a peculiar annoyance with plaque on the back teeth (or that stuff that sticks onto your smooth teeth) ever since I could remember.  This brush actually makes your teeth squeeky clean and polished.  If I had this as a kid, my hands wouldn&#x27;t have to be in my mouth most of the time performing an extra plaque cleaning.  You still have to floss with the floss action brush head as it does not work nearly as good as dental floss.</li>
    <li> Started using this right after a visit to the dentist, and it&#x27;s keeping that super clean teeth feeling going more than a month later.  I upgraded from the 1000 series and really like this, but the other one is going to my daughter with a set of new brushes because it&#x27;s still a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Happy with this toothbrush.  Like the timer, even though it has 3 points during the 2 or 3 minute brush, to signify when to change location, it is still nice to have the time, as sometimes I&#x27;m thinking of things when I am brushing, and miss the beeps to change.  Would by nice if the head was black to match the body - but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this toothbrush  as a replacement to my 5000 series; unfortunately I did so without reading any of the negative comments, instead viewing the the star count - more 4 and 5 star reviews than 2 and 3 star reviews.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush about 6 weeks - looks sharp.  If looks could brush my teeth that would be great.  The battery is crap.  It worked great for 3 weeks, then I started noticing the toothbrush started feeling sluggish as if the battery is almost dead - the light up indicator on the front of the toothbrush indicates the toothbrush is charging, however the red light that indicates the rechargeable battery is nearing the end of its serviceable life is a constant red glow. The owners manual has picture steps for battery removal - great, I figure I can just purchase new batteries, problem solved.  Nope! I can&#x27;t find replacement batteries for this sharp looking toothbrush, apparently this is the most expensive disposable toothbrush I have ever purchased.  AND removing the batteries from the toothbrush invalidates the warranty - wish they put that sentence above the picture description of removing the batteries.  Don&#x27;t waste your time - read the low star reviews</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this toothbrush, although there&#x27;s a few modes we do not use. We love the travel pack and it works with all heads we purchased, there&#x27;s wide range of toothbrush heads to purchase and getting from Amazon is a bargain compare to local store.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. It&#x27;s smart.</li>
    <li> Very Good, I like the feeling when using it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this Tooth Brush Oral -B Black 7000 Rechargeable twice the first one delivered held specks of toothpaste embedded in the black handle and was difficult to clean or rinse off.  I returned that one and was sent a replacement unit.  Have been using the unit since it arrived in November around the 5 or 8 and have used since.  I have kept the base clean as well as the handle itself especially the bottom where it fits into the charging device.  I replace the device every on base after each use.  I am finding that the power of the toothbrush has reduced during the time I have had in my possession. I changed brush heads just to make sure it was not feeling slower due to degrading of the brush itself.  Amazon says I it is out of return window…I think having purchased the item and had to return the first and having problems with the replacement&lt;br /&gt;It should be able to be either replaced or returned.</li>
    <li> What am I missing...someone pays $200 for a toothbrush? Yikes</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I never actually got to use this item. It arrived with no User Guide and I had no idea how I was supposed to use it. There were flashing lights on the handle, a small device that looked like a clock with a smiley face,  and an assortment of brushes. When I turned the toothbrush on it stopped every few seconds, then restarted. I had no idea how all these pieces were integrated or what my role was.There was &amp;#34;no available&amp;#34; online manual for this particular model. I returned the item.</li>
    <li> Strong function, good quality and low price, especially toothbrush head comes too strong, with more than one month of both very strong. Yes!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Better than Philips!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my teeth look whiter. The smartguide times you to make sure you brush for two minutes and tells you when to go to next quadrant. I love the smiley face that shows up when you do a good job of brushing. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great teeth brush. It comes with a separate timer/clock which gives you a nice smile when you are done with the brushing, not sure about the usefulness because this is not the type of brush you would give to your kids as it is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I really felt a big difference with my teeth, like I was out of the dentist after a cleanup. It has some other functionality that I haven&#x27;t used yet however I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do a good job at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery like is shorter than expected, I can do barley a week before the led changes to orange using it twice a day and it seems like it takes overnight to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, after a few months I like it and would recommend if on sale or around $99</li>
    <li> Amazing brush - my teeth have never felt so &amp;#34;after the dentist&amp;#34; clean from a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, This toothbrush has taken care of this issue and my gums have stopped bleeding, swelling and hurting.</li>
    <li> I think this toothbrush is the best electric toothbrush on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, both Oral-B and the other guy with the regular toothbrush shaped head.  This has multiple speeds, rotates in either direction, and has the sonic functionality.  It does everything my dentist&#x27;s equipment does, and using it is infitnitely more enjoyable than going to the dentist.  This is my 2nd 7000 SmartSeries toothbrush; the other is at my vacation house.  Since I started using these brushes, my dentist visits have been a whole lot less stressful too!  It comes with several &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; that can be used for different purposes including cleaning, polishing, and getting between teeth.  It&#x27;s round, very flexible brush (like my dentist uses on me every 6 months), easily moves across the curves, dips, and grooves of my teeth with ease.  It has a slick, really classy looking leather-looking travel case that I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be embarrased by if it fell out of my luggage.  And for the real inner-geek in you, it also comes with a separate display screen connected via blue&amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; that gives you updates and guidance while you brush your teeth, including a sectional timer, and an indicater if you&#x27;re pushing to hard on your teeth and gums.  I just left that part in the box since it takes up more bathroom counter space than I have available, but if you want the assistance in getting your teeth cleaned right, give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive, but for the value I receive and the way my teeth feel so clean after each use, it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I bought an Oral B 7000 (black) for $151.00 in March-2014. As we all know -that&#x27;s a hell of a lot to pay for a vibrating toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the hope was it would help avoid cavities, root canals etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 months ago it just stopped charging. (sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has an EXCELLENT site for those in the UK to just post their defective products and get them serviced. However I can&#x27;t find a site in the US for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend 6 months each year in the Philippines (and no it&#x27;s not the voltage - PH is compatible with US) - and there&#x27;s only one service center here and they won&#x27;t respond to my emails (and Braun&#x27;s email form is screwed up as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short I&#x27;m left with a $150 piece of plastic that fell FAR short of a normal lifespan (12 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem sending the product FedEx anywhere on the planet - but Braun - you should make it EASY for your customers to return DEFECTIVE units for repair / replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By making it so difficult (other than UK) to return merchandise you lose customers. I for one will never buy another Braun product (trimmer, toothbrush or anything else) who wants to risk high-end devices bugging out - and really no customer service offered.</li>
    <li> my teeth have never felt cleaner...and it was awesome to receive a $30 coupon. would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loved his last oral b electric toothbrush but I was skeptical. however, this is an awesome toothbrush.  my teeth feel even cleaner and I always thought I was a good brusher!</li>
    <li> This baby is slick.  More functions then I need, but having said that it is also extremely fast and strong. Been using Braun products for over 25 years.  They have a proven track record with our household and this brush has all the newest improvements.  Really a champion.</li>
    <li> Works great and battery lasts long. A tongue brushing mode is added which is nice. Has the Bluetooth feature but hasn&#x27;t tried out yet. The smart guide still picks up the signal from the older model and when two toothbrushes are used at the same time, the smart guide shows only the time from the older one. Would be nice if the the entire toothbrush body is black but the two sides are silver.</li>
    <li> very good thing, i like it</li>
    <li> Love it. It replaces a previous model and is just as good if not better. I will always have one of these tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just ok. It feels very mechanical and is not smooth at all. I&#x27;m not sure if I don&#x27;t like it as much bc I am used to a sonic care though. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> as good as going to the dentist. but the battery life is horrendous. takes a full day to charge, and i get to use only for a week before needs recharging again. thats just sad. hoping for a refund!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice toothbrush, but highly over priced.</li>
    <li> Very good，my girlfriend love it.She said that was a great gift.Maybe someday I will buy another one for myself.And the Amazon&#x27;s service is very nice,it&#x27;s a wonderful experience to shop here.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it. I like the design. The case is very slick and made nicely. Easy to clean charger. Love the light that tells me I&#x27;m pushing it against my teeth too hard.</li>
    <li> Who would EVER go back to a battery run toothbrush after using this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product during a travel and have received it in my hotel. I didn&#x27;t check the toothbrush after I returned to my country (Chile), I have put the original package in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the smart guide did not work, I mean that it don&#x27;t show any smile face or image, just partially and diffuse, a clear sign that it&#x27;s damage. I replaced the batteries but the problem persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very frustrating that the smart guide is damaged and that I live outside USA so I can get the proper warranty. Also another issue is that the charger is only for 110 volts, not multivoltage, very astonishing nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you travel to Europe for a long stay, you should buy another voltage transformer in order to avoid damage your toothbrush. Probably the voltage transformer will be larger than your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon or Oral-B can can contact me and solve this problem.</li>
    <li> Freaking awesome toothbrush! This thing has changed the level of plaque build up on my teeth from cleaning to cleaning. Cannot recommend enough! The only thing I wish I could change is the minor pause every thirty seconds to indicate a section of teeth is done cleaning. Jus t a minor annoyance that is not enough to change my 5 start rating.</li>
    <li> This is really great product! It works great...!</li>
    <li> this is the real deal, cleaning your teeth machine....if a motorized toothbrush works for you, then this is the one. lots of speeds, takes a variety of heads, (u will find what you like on it and the right speed for you and probably never utilize all the speeds)/ rapid delivery from Amazon, with no damage, and has worked very well so far.  Had the predecessor, the 5000 and it was good, but this is better.&lt;br /&gt;The black design is very kewl, but shows more toothpaste that funds down it and on to the base///u won&#x27;t find it any cheaper anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this BLACK 7000 after my PRO 5000 battery died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m in general very satisfied with this 7000 and previous 5000 electric toothbrush, this is what I do not like about this new 7000:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No 220 V travel charger included (only 110 V).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Charging takes a lot more time (up to 24 hrs) compared with the 5000 (around 12 hrs. max.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Bluetooth connectivity doesn&#x27;t add a lot of value for me.</li>
    <li> Didnt Meet my expoectation, The packing , delivery were all excellent , unfortunately this Electronic brush was not the best i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for a previous model. The price is quite expensive in comparison to its performance. It took forever to charge, the voltage is US specific, bluetooth is gimmicky, and the difference between the 7000 and 5000 is $50 yet all thats different is a useless tongue cleaning feature and a nicer case. When taking a closer look at the brush I noticed the piece that connects the brush heads shows signs of wear only after 2 uses. This is a huge disappointment. I would not recommend buying this brush unless you have excess money to waste. Once the battery dies (roughly 1.5 years for my last Oral B brush) you will have to get a new toothbrush as they will not just replace the battery.</li>
    <li> Works but covered with a tacky rubberized material that has not proven to be very lasting on anything I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Travel case is luxurious.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B electric brush and it seems the battery life still has not improved.  After less than 10, 2 minute brushes it needs a recharge and the recharge time is absolutely ridiculous.  I plugged it in and left for an 8-10 shift at work and it was still not full charged!!  I had my old one for more than 2 years after the battery stopped holding a charge for more than a day or two and I foresee the same issues with this one already!!</li>
    <li> I want to love this toothbrush but I don’t. I used to have a top of the line Sonicare but I had read online that the Oral B kind where it rotates actually cleans your teeth better. I’d rather have cleaner teeth if it means I have to go down in quality and that’s what you do with an Oral B. Even this most expensive one just doesn’t feel expensive. The plastic on the handle is kinda gross to touch and the pausing between quadrants is way way too long. It also doesn’t turn off after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, you have to actually press the off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my teeth have never felt cleaner. I’m sticking with it even though it’s not a premium product.</li>
    <li> Met an exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> it like a used one，not Seal up</li>
    <li> We loved it so much - we purchased two (one for each bathroom). I went to the dentist recently and he asked if I had one of these toothbrushes, and when I said yes, he said keep using it. No cavities!</li>
    <li> Love it, no issues so far, no problems with battery as well.</li>
    <li> Battery runs out once a week. Only issue</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Charge lasts for about three weeks.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Replacing a similar Oral-B that has lasted 14 years.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I ever used.  I&#x27;ve recently switched from the competition at the recommendation of my Endodontist and my teeth feel cleaner than ever.  The price was right with an additional discount.  All the way around it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I would give it more stars if there were more to give. First class toothbrush, even has a beautiful carry case. I love the timer you could watch and get rated on as well</li>
    <li> truly awesome. i brush my teeth very clearly and try to get five stars someday</li>
    <li> very good product,i like it.</li>
    <li> The worse electric toothbrush i know what i say i have sonicare and braun but this one is waiste of money</li>
    <li> just started using it, well made and powerful enough to do the job ,,, love it.</li>
    <li> More than what I needed...</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Do I recommend it; YES of course I do.</li>
    <li> Received item, placed it on the charger, no lights. I don&#x27;t know why, but, I thought that maybe I had to open it up and insert the two AAA batteries that came in the package; probably because I noticed there were instructions for battery replacement. Followed the instructions to about the third step until I felt like I was going to break the device. It was just after that, I noticed underneath that it said upon opening the device the warranty would be voided. So in short spent $120 on a manual tooth brush...... I was really excited to get to try it out also.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute best toothbrush I have ever had.  It blows my mind using it.  I feel like I&#x27;m from the future and there is a little robot in my mouth kicking ass and cleaning teeth.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever. It takes some getting used to. Feels like a jackhammer the first few times. I&#x27;ve gotten ZERO plaque buildup since using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Easy and useful to clean tooth,better than other model</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I ever used! Love it</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery - Product as described</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Great product that really has improved my health.  I highly recommend.  Not sure its worth the premium over the next model down but its a great product and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The Toothbrush does not have a built in indicator to let you know what mode its on (cleaning, deep clean, whitening, tongue, etc). What it does have is a seperate electronic piece that is supposed to get this information via bluetooth or wifi, not sure exactly how it works. In any case, my seperate wireless indicator just goes nuts endlessly wether I&#x27;m using the toothbrush or not, so it is clearly not working properly and now I have a 150$ piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I only paid nearly half of what it&#x27;s currently selling for when the price dipped. I guess I lucked out. I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I can clearly see a visible difference in how my teeth are whiter by now. Remind you that I drink a few cups of coffee every morning and a few red wine every other night. It feels like deep cleaning every time I use it. You just have to be persistent in using this to cultivate good oral health. Highly recommended, but I would honestly not pay more than $150 for this.</li>
    <li> does not work with 220V and not mentioned!!!  I bought a 220 charger, in an official agency, price 25$. worked for 7 months and stopped working.  Agent told me there is no warranty!!! New one costs now almost 40$!!!  I never got any answer or feedback from Oral or Brown.  That means: a very bed service.  Don&#x27;t touch!!!!</li>
    <li> looks nice, yet not fully know how to use it.</li>
    <li> This makes brushing teeth so easy and really keeps your teeth super polished...like after a dentist office cleaning.  The brush sensors provide feedback that allows you to adjust your brushing to get maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> Works great but the handle is much thicker than my prior oral b and not as comfortable.</li>
    <li> Attention, the voltage is 100V, so you need transformer if you want use in China. 注意，该产品采用美国110伏电压，所以如果要在中国使用，必须要买一个变压器。</li>
    <li> great toothbrush a lot of nice functions , a lot of brush types , i lke it, smart control function is great</li>
    <li> i love my new tooth brush, it is so good to have a brush that works well, love it, best price ever.</li>
    <li> Makes the whole process fun.  Love the timer and the red light warning if brushing too hard.  Never use anything but the standard brushing feature but maybe I&#x27;ll try the other features sometime.  At this point I would say it is worth the price, but I got discounts so it only cost about $135.00.  Don&#x27;t think I would pay more than that.  Looks like one can&#x27;t change batteries in it but I used the last Braun for six years.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> great design, good product</li>
    <li> According to a leading consumer publication, this is the best electric toothbrush for removing plaque, though I don&#x27;t use the timer that comes with it. Elegant looking in black, it matches my black Braun electric razor.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it will</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth feeling very clean!</li>
    <li> Returned this toothbrush, it is not bluetooth enabled, as pictured in the description. Feels big and clunky, compared to Sonicare. Chose it for its sensitive mode, and sensor that warns you when you brush too hard. However, you need to apply ALOT of pressure before it warns you with a red light on the toothbrush, or if you are looking at the little clock, a non smiling face. I found I needed to stand there and look at the LCD screen to see my progress.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel its not worth the big price tag.</li>
    <li> it fits my teeth needs fully.it deserves you get it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice product, feels good when using it, and smart design to help better brush, problem is, it stopped working on 4th Day! it&#x27;s hard for me to believe the quality is so poor! And things go tricky as i am international buyer who is not in US, don&#x27;t know how to do with it</li>
    <li> Like it much better than my sonicare...so many variable modes and different kind of brush heads it&#x27;s just about got to fit any ones brushing needs...will buy again as a spare!</li>
    <li> Bought this for 30 yr old daughter. She loves it. Makes her mouth feel like a professional dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> Good selection with good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the cause. :)</li>
    <li> Lots of  unnecessary bells and whistles for a rechargeable toothbrush, save your money a buy a simpler version of this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Makes it so easy to keep track of dental health. You can track from the app when you brush and how long, rinse and floss. The brush indicates the timing on the app/attachment for making brushing an ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a travel case making storing while traveling easy.</li>
    <li> Good product but battery life is less than the Braun 5000.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever!!!</li>
    <li> The smartguide does not work when I want to use it .I can not adjust the time according to operating documents ,12:00 is always flashing on screen</li>
    <li> An excellent tool in maintaining my good dental health</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a proud owner of the 5000 series for the last 6 years and wanted to refresh a little bit. Here is why I returned my 7000 series:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very annoying stops in the middle of my brushing. The 5000 series has it as well, but the 7000 makes a complete stop for 1-2 seconds and then continues. It messes my entire \\&quot;auto-mode\\&quot; in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This 7000 series has an inferior battery. NiMH batteries die much quicker than Li-ion batteries. This is one of the reasons why your cell phones have the latter. The 5000 series (my brush) used to have Li-ion battery, but it looks like Oral-B (P&amp;G) changed all their brushes to NiMH to save some $ and offer you a more expensive brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Tongue mode is pretty useless. You will use it 1-2 times and then stop playing with the different brush modes and use only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Travel case is nice, but how much do you really travel? You can also purchase a case separately for the 5000 series if that&#x27;s important for you. Paying additional $60 for a travel case is pretty much absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The design is nice, but it&#x27;s weird that the brush itself is white and the handle is black. Looks disconnected from each other - but who cares how your brush looks like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The charger doesn&#x27;t support 240V. So if you travel outside the US - good luck with that. The old 5000 series supports both 110 and 240V. Current 5000 series doesn&#x27;t support 240V anymore. Another way for Oral-B to increase their profit margin I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The battery last for approx. 10 days (with brushing twice a day for 2min). It takes about 20h to get a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The blue light, while the brush is charging (flickering), can annoy some people. It&#x27;s the most common complain online on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Amazon is lowering the price every couple of days now and playing between $160 and $130. There is a $30 coupon right now, so you can get it around $100 - don&#x27;t pay more than that - it doesn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my 5000 series since it&#x27;s still working and don&#x27;t see currently any good alternatives on the market; Sonicare Diamond, for example, has only 31,000 strokes/minute while Oral-B has 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscilations (also known as 3D tooth by tooth cleaning).at - it doesn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my 5000 series since it&#x27;s still working and don&#x27;t see currently any good alternatives on the market; Sonicare Diamond, for example, has only 31,000 strokes/minute while Oral-B has 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscilations (also known as 3D tooth by tooth cleaning).</li>
    <li> Just like a visit to the dentist!!</li>
    <li> Have been a sonicare user, and I have no clue, why did I shift to this brush. I should have rebought the Sonicare Diamond Clean, the best in the business. The only reason I bought this, was my sonicare i left behind at some hotel, and its gone. Anyway, bought the diamond clean again, and this will go in the dump, there is actually no comparison between this product and the sonicare.</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush.  I think what my husband likes best is the timing clock that was included with the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;This clock begins a count down when you start brushing- it guides you to brush each quadrant for 30 seconds. For each 30 second interval a portion of a happy face is created.  At the end of the brush cycle- you are rewarded with a happy face smile.  Kids would love it, but I think adults enjoy it just as much.  Plus it keeps you honest &amp; diligent about brushing thoroughly!</li>
    <li> Great deal with the extra coupon. This is my second oral B after my Triumph got a little tired after 13 years. Love the black color and I actually use the options. Works excellent!</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun toothbrush for years and the last one lasted over 6 years.  It still worked perfectly until I decided to upgrade to the 7000. This toothbrush is amazing and worth every penny.  My teeth are several shades lighter just using the same toothpastes I have always used. My teeth feel cleaner than ever.  I love the smart clock which times your brushing cycle.  I also love the style of the brush itself;  It shouldn&#x27;t matter but it is very elegant and sleek.  This is just a fabulous quality product in every way.</li>
    <li> It also was given as a gift and the family loved it.</li>
    <li> Want to give it 5 starts because it cleans teeth so well, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. there is missing two Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head in the complact set&lt;br /&gt;2. Takes a very long time to charge, more than 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Wow...very classy and also well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Oral B electric toothbrush user for years, love this one. I like the more sensitive sensor for applying too much pressure thta incorporates an automatic slowing of the motor and a red LED light in the handle so I know when I&#x27;m overdoing it as I walk about. This model also had a pause and beep to indicate the end of each quadrant- one for the first, two for second and three for third. The older model only had a momentary pulse to indicate. And it&#x27;s black, yay!</li>
    <li> Replaced my 5 year old Oral-B (the lowest model they sold at the time) with the 7000 Black edition and it was quite the upgrade. Only negative for me was the travel case. It&#x27;s really nice but it&#x27;s extremely heavy, not sure I would actually take it with me.</li>
    <li> Best I can have.  It have too noise</li>
    <li> Not a bad toothbrush, but do you really need THAT many functions to a toothbrush? The timer thing is confusing and there&#x27;s WAYYYYY too much packaging. It&#x27;s a toothbrush, let&#x27;s not over engineer it</li>
    <li> This product is better than previous one - sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several using this, I am satisfied so far except one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the charging time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes more than 24 hours, I think more than 48 full hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I changed the charger with the one of sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger of precision 7000 supplies just 0.9 W, on the other hand, the one of sonic care does 2 W.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe the truth. the new one is less efficient and takes more time.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I am brushing longer and focusing on quadrants because of the timer.</li>
    <li> :( Very unhappy... NOT BLUETOOTH... even though reviews said so... I looked up Oral-B website prior to purchase to validate product name / number info... however this is not the unit I wanted.... Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth really well. When I used the regular toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t think I was cleaning my teeth well. With this, I can feel a difference. And it&#x27;s helpful that there is a timer.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I only bought this as a gift for myself for working soooooooooooooo many overtimes. Seems silly to spend so much on a toothbrush. I am sure glad I did  my teeth have never been so clean. IT feels like i just came from the Dentist!!!! When  I floss after I use it there is no plaque at all. I will never go back to a standard toothbrush. The timer makes me do the whole 2 min so I get all the stars. Another silly thing but it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to my review... I am still using this toothbrush as of 8/19/16. It has lasted a long time. I have changed my brushes every 3 months . I get a 9 out of 10 for tarter at my dentist. He said I am doing a great job on my cleaning. Thanks to this Oral-B pro... If it stops working I will definitely buy again...</li>
    <li> Way better than my old Sonicare toothbrush.  My dentist recommended this for the rotating head, zone brushing and pressure sensor.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner using this brush.  I also like the style of this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush ever. I&#x27;m Confident that Oral B products will always preform at a high quality.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was recommended by a dentist and that&#x27;s why i purchased it.  Ended up sending it back.  Very annoying bright blue light when charging.  I thought the police were outside my house when I woke up at 3am.  I am serious, this is how bright the blue charging light is.  I had to put a towel over it so I could go back to sleep.  Also, with technology getting better, this toothbrush seemed way too big.  I have been using a Sonicare for three years and the Oral-b 7000 just did not compare.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush, weird quirks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to give it 5 starts because it cleans teeth so well, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Takes a very long time to charge, more than 12 hours.  Feels closer to 24 if charging from dead.  Regular travelers should be mindful of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Charging lights are very bright. I know that sounds silly, but if you keep this is the same bathroom you might use in the middle of the night, know that you are walking into a bathroom with jarring, bright flashing lights (that will flash all night, see point #1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It has 7 cleaning modes with different purposes.  Would love to see an objective report on whether any mode actually (a) works better than any other, and (b) does it&#x27;s designated task better than any other.</li>
    <li> Just amazing, it comes with everything. A must if u want the whole package.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Seems to be an improvement over the 4000 series.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a amazing toothbrush ,I like it very much</li>
    <li> the best toothbrush ive ever used, very powerful becareful around the gums!</li>
    <li> This one is good, but 5000 item is good enough</li>
    <li> really do the job to clean the teeth. I just used the deep clean function.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing this toothbrush can&#x27;t do when it comes to oral hygiene. It&#x27;s got power and variety of settings; feels good in the hand and looks great on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> product is sames good.but i have meet two problem when i use it&lt;br /&gt;1.the smart guade is bad&lt;br /&gt;2.i can&#x27;t recharge the toothbrush with  charger</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t work like it suppose to don&#x27;t count when you turn on</li>
    <li> i was using 5000 series and wanted to try this 7000. frankly i dont find any major difference between the series(carry case is good) except the black color was not available in the 5000 series. I would recommend this product but 5000 series will do the same job for $20-$30 bucks less. thats the reason i gave this product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome toothbrush, and my teeth have never felt so clean! The portability is great, timer is very good for both me, and helping my 5 year old daughter brush her teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but great things to say about this toothbrush, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I also have the Philips Sonicare Diamond clean toothbrush, bought this Oral-B for comparison, significantly better- specifically the rotating brush aspect. It just feels more effective in my opinion. I also believe that the smaller round shaped brush can get into smaller areas and at different angles than the longer more traditional shape of the Sonicare brush. I will use the Oral-B instead of the Diamond Clean from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only dislike is the travel case. After you brush your teeth, you are placing a wet brush and handle back into the travel case (if you travel) and yet there are no holes or vents. When you open the case the next day, the brush and handle are still wet from the day before. The Diamond clean has vent holes in the travel case.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works really well but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price I paid for it. I originally thought seven settings would be like an at-home professional cleaner for my teeth. Honestly, I only use one or two of the settings. Also, I bought my partner a Panasonic that is whisper quiet. This toothbrush sounds like I am cleaning my mouth with a dildo compared to his toothbrush. It is really loud and clunky feeling in my mouth. I do get a nice clean but it does not justify the price.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush does its job very well; however, if I had to do it all over again, I likely would have purchased the 5000 or some other lower model because I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t use any of the extra features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::: CONS :::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7000 comes with a tongue-cleaning mode, which I&#x27;ve found doesn&#x27;t give any better result than just using the regular cleaning mode on your tongue. As for the other modes, I don&#x27;t use anything other than the regular cleaning mode because I don&#x27;t find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is nice, but be forewarned that there are no vent holes. However, the tray that the brushes and handle sit on is dishwasher safe, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent the brushes from getting gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product documentation says the battery can go about 10 days before needing to be recharged. I brush for three minutes twice daily, and I get between seven and eight days out of a charge. The battery takes about a day to charge, which seems like a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::: NEUTRAL :::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are right when they say the blinking recharging light is very bright. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I can see how it would annoy some people at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned that the timer is set to demo mode at the factory. Follow the instructions in the manual to turn that off. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll be annoyed and confused like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::: PROS :::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel very clean, much better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer feature is nice. I feel proud when I get five stars for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pressure light indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::: CONCLUSION :::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this toothbrush until it falls into disrepair because I&#x27;m very pleased with how well it cleans my teeth. However, I don&#x27;t use any feature other than the regular brushing mode, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and instead opt for a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean...Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had my last Oral-B tooth brush for 8 years. This one seems just as good.</li>
    <li> if the voltage of charger covers a wider range. It would be better!</li>
    <li> Very user friendly, very effective</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is daunting at first. The entire package and accoutrements seem like they could rival a mobile phone in technology. I am having issues with its battery; I charged it for six hours one day and it never exceeded 2/3 charge. I tried it again, same thing. Furthermore, the battery life itself seems to be an issue: 1/3 of the bars depletes in less than a week! For this price I am not enthused.</li>
    <li> Ahhh I only bought it because my HSA paid for it, but it is like heaven on earth after you get done.</li>
    <li> good item,and the quality is very good,worth to buy,and i wanna buy another for my family</li>
    <li> Product was as described and worked well.</li>
    <li> Gift for my son. He loves it</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase!  It works great and I love the new sleeker look of the black handle.</li>
    <li> We have been using Oral-B for a decade. The brand never fails you. Although a little pricey at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the top end model at a good bargain, definitely a must buy I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be good to replace the lower end model that my wife is currently using:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9GG?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B002HWS9GG&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;swiclu-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;SY2HZH32DTSSNTIO&amp;refRID&#x3D;0YT6NJMPBSJC3XMBWXDV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Does what it says on the tin. Hoping it will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ok with my new oral b black 7000, the only major is the battery sucks! It only last 4 days when they said it would last up to 10 days.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent device.Especially once you have used it a few times and become comfortable with the feel of it in your mouth. It&#x27;s worth the investment one thousand fold. Reduces plaque buildup and can also give a good polish to your chompers..your dentist and your chompers will be grateful.</li>
    <li> I am certain I will NOT buy this product, or the new 5000 based on the many reviews complaining about the lousy battery and the fact that it is NOT REPLACEABLE. I really like the product&#x27;s specs and its many functions but I will not buy it until these MAJOR FAULTS are solved. So now you know, Oral B, get off your butt and do your homework ...or else!</li>
    <li> It was nice, but it dies before one year of using. It doesn&#x27;t charge now. 170 bucks to a garbage can.&lt;br /&gt;Old Vitality worked for 7 years and still works.</li>
    <li> Great product seeing a huge difference in my teeth!!</li>
    <li> I have only had it for a few months, but it has been a very good toothbrush. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say that hasn&#x27;t been covered by other reviews for this product but maybe some input from a long-time Sonicare user would be beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Sonicare Diamond Clean and have used Sonicare for years. I like Sonicare and still use that toothbrush occasionally but I like this Black 7000 more and more each day. I feel like the clean is superior to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the 7000 is a bit rougher on your teeth. If you have a very sensitive mouth, the Sonicare might be a better option; however, sometimes the Sonicare is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t remove that harder to clean debris- the 7000 doesn&#x27;t have that problem. I love the Cross Clean and Floss Action brush heads- definitely my favorite 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B has a much broader selection of brush heads when compared to Sonicare, which is something that I enjoy. It makes the brush more flexible. The Bluetooth &amp;#34;screen&amp;#34; for the 7000 is a gimmick. It doesn&#x27;t do anything that a normal toothbrush timer couldn&#x27;t do. I&#x27;d rather have the battery usage savings from removing bluetooth than have the &amp;#34;functionality&amp;#34; of this little display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on the 7000 seems decent, though not as good as the Sonicare. The brush took almost 30 hours to charge out of the box- it was totally dead on arrival, so a dead to full charge is QUITE long. That being said, it seems to hold a charge well. I recently took the 7000 on a 4 day trip and used it twice a day on the Clean + setting, which is 3 minutes each time. So, over the course of the trip it was being used for 24+ minutes and it still had 2/3 battery bars lit. That seems to be about in line with the advertised battery life. Oral B claims 10 days of usage, 2 minutes twice a day, which equates to about 40 minutes of brushing over 10 days. I believe that is quite accurate, but still well below the Sonicare&#x27;s 3 weeks of use on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that the Oral B Black 7000 gives you the best and most thorough brushing experience available today, slightly edging out the Sonicare. That being said, the Sonicare wins in longevity, comes with a charging case, and charges MUCH faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pick between the Sonicare Diamond Clean and the Oral B Black 7000, I&#x27;d pick the Black 7000 but you can&#x27;t go wrong with either.the best and most thorough brushing experience available today, slightly edging out the Sonicare.

    <li> The LCD screen is defective. So now I will have to return it and hope next one is good. I wish I could just call someone for a new one.</li>
    <li> I love it! Very, very powerful, way more powerful than my 10 year old Oral B.  the travel case is sleek, can&#x27;t wait to use it and love the various heads.  The monitor smiles at 2 minutes but winks at you at 3 minutes which is so cute! LOL.  I can only give 4 stars however because the app does not work with Windows Surface nor Windows phone.  You have to have apple or android.  Do apple pay these people not to develop windows apps?  It makes no sense to me... at least make it so you can use a windows laptop with blue tooth or windows tablet even if you don&#x27;t want to develop a phone app.</li>
    <li> Over priced and too many bells and whistles an adult doesn&#x27;t need.  For kids great.  The overall cleaning I like.  Had an oral B for 9 yrs before this and won&#x27;t go back to a manual. If this lasts 10 yrs. I&#x27;d say it was a good buy...we will see.</li>
    <li> Really helps my sensitive gums.  The variety of brush heads provides cleaning for all areas of the mouth, including the tongue. Timer keeps me on track - tells me exactly how long I have brushed.</li>
    <li> Our second toothbrush from Oral B; moved the first one downstairs and bought this one to be the primary toothbrush.  This one works great and the only thing that is annoying is the charging light .</li>
    <li> The product is just excellent, very solid feels, very comfortable and do clean my teeth nicely. Very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> greatest toothbrush ever had. I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Electric Toothbrush for 15 years. This one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Superb quality and result. Nothing else more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as described. I haven&#x27;t really determined the benefits over this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that my wife and I can have our own.  We purchased the previous model a few months earlier and loved it.  However, the battery is much weaker and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the earlier model.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I had my previous Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 12 years and it still worked.  I just wanted the newer version.  It works perfectly.  I like the special brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush. A bit expensive but I really like it. Only had it a few days so time will tell but seems well built.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. the travel case is very handy and stylish and has space for two toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;The brush takes 24 hours to fully recharge once empty but then you can use it for 10-14 days.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason I give this toothbrush 4 stars instead 5 is because of the color contrast between the black handle and the white accessories it doesn&#x27;t match</li>
    <li> Love the feedback feature</li>
    <li> Good cleaning. Wish it held the charge longer.</li>
    <li> This my second one the first one lasted about 8 years. Since the new black I&#x27;m loving it even more could&#x27;ve ever used the old fashion ones any more.  Thank u</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush. Although I thought it was a little cheesy at first, the timer actually helps you stick to a great dental hygiene routine. I had a problem with bleeding gums and sensitivity that has pretty much disappeared since I started using this just over a month ago.</li>
    <li> Every morning feels like you have just left the denist office.</li>
    <li> Defective charger after 1 month of usage.  Can I get a replacement?</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever invented. My teeth are whiter then ever before, my gums are so pink and healthy.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I highly recommend this one for those who want sparkling white teeth and clean mouths with no effort at all!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at spending more than 100 dollars on a tooth brush, but I can honestly say my teeth are much cleaner with this tooth brush compared to my old one.  It tells you if your pressing too hard (which can lead to sensitive gums) and also times it so you get the reccomended 2 minutes of brushing time, everytime!</li>
    <li> This is so smart that helps you keep track of your oral hygiene</li>
    <li> Bought this but pref the older model 5000 for travel voltage convenience</li>
    <li> Works great, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used! Hold on for it is powerful!</li>
    <li> I just got my oral b black 7000 electric toothbrush it&#x27;s the best toothbrush oral b makes the price is high but amazon has it cheaper then other stores retail on it 219.00$ for the price it works great 5 different brush modes plus you can take out a 3 year warranty on it threw panasonic and panasonic customer service is great the price is high but last for many years</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, it was a little weird to have it Bluetooth enabled but I have found that I like that feature, it also comes with a timer that you can fix to your bathroom wall that helps with timing your brushing.  I thought before that I was brushing long enough, but in fact I wasn&#x27;t, and with the app, you can keep up with your brushing and your habits, as well as have reminders to floss and mouthwash and it gives you tips, the only thing I wish is that the app would run in the background rather than me having to turn it on prior to brushing.  The settings on the toothbrush are great, to name a few, regular brushing, deep clean, sensitive, tongue, massage (for your gums).  I am really enjoying it, and if it is like my last oral-B toothbrush, it will last for years to come, which is great, since it is a little bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Going from a non-electric to this was revolutionary.  My teeth and mouth thank you.  It feels like I just got back from the dentist every time I brush.  I could have gotten similar performance out of the next model down, but this thing looks great!  The case is well made and way better designed.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great electronic tooth brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with that!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my English in advance...&lt;br /&gt;I was never satisfied with regular toothbrush ...&lt;br /&gt;But now I really feel how can my teeth be brushed properly!)&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my wife as well... She is also like it very much!</li>
    <li> very amazing really cleans the timing clock is interesting but not needed as it also tells you with a pause .</li>
    <li> My dentist can see the difference this makes. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> The greatest electric toothbrush EVER</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, &amp; I am very pleased with my investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its rather pricey price tag, this toothbrush definitely does the trick.  Totally feel that all my teeth are left much cleaner, than when I use a manual toothbrush.  Love the &#x27;Brush Timer&#x27; that is included as well as the sensor that detects against hard brushing.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush with awkward pauses during brushing cycle. The pauses are simply too long for my taste. I had Braun, top of the line, toothbrush that lasted 5 years and gladly replaced it with 7000 model. The only difference I noticed between this model and the one I purchased 5 years ago is longer pauses, every 30 sec., during brushing cycle. It feels like brush quit working, but then decided to continue.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is great, takes a while to charge but love the travel case!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st electric toothbrush. I really trust bruan and oral-b. ( I am using bruan 790cc which is a good shaver.)&lt;br /&gt;I am really impression with the performance of this brush but it has too much mode. ( I only use normal)</li>
    <li> Great product. The timer really makes me brush for the full 2 mins. Great for someone who hates brushing their teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is good but it came open. If you are averse to getting a product that anybody could have opened and returned then this model is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By opened I mean the product is not sealed. There&#x27;s nothing preventing somebody from opening it, using it and returning it allowing for it to be resold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5000 model though is sealed.  There&#x27;s a cardboard tare you need to pull which once broken can&#x27;t be redone.  I bought the 5000 and it&#x27;s amazing.  I am sure the 7000 is amazing too, possibly even better but if the packaging concerns you buy the 5000.  The 5000 gets top marks and 5 stars without question.</li>
    <li> Bravo brushing experience!</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I am amazed how clean your teeth feel after each use. Almost like your annual cleaning at the dentist.  The color is nice too for it goes with almost all granite counter tops. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> This replaced a sonicare diamond, It just works 10 fold better. I love it my mouth feels cleaner than&lt;br /&gt;it did with others I have used. You wont be sorry. Im Not.......</li>
    <li> I DO LIKE THE ORAL B RANGE&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;The whole Oral-B range of toothbrushes vary in price. This is a mid range one and I think it&#x27;s another simply fantastic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the range have additional features that you&#x27;ll NEVER EVER use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one as it&#x27;s fast enough, light enough and holds a charge for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGER&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the smaller, neater charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN TEETH&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I have squeaky clean teeth after two minutes using this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve also had the much more expensive Oral B toothbrushes and also tried the cheaper ones. This is much better than the cheaper ones. (They&#x27;re a little slower) and the more expensive ones have a few more bells and whistles that you&#x27;&#x27;ll never use. Overall this is ideal for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re after a reasonably priced electric toothbrush, this is certainly one to consider. Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw it covered in a magazine, it really steps up  your dental care and you can see a marked improvement in color, reduction in plague and overall dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature I found was the attached digital clock/stop watch which turns on when you turn on the brush. It helps you tell the difference between brushing for 2 minutes v/s what you think is brushing for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head with the flossing attachments is my favorite, it really gets in there and makes sure nothings building up, the only thing is it takes a while to get used to and your gums may be sore for the first few days.</li>
    <li> Nothing better than know you&#x27;re getting a 2 min brushing session as recommended. Other features work good as well.</li>
    <li> This is like going to the dentist everyday. I am so impressed with the way this cleans...</li>
    <li> Very nice. Teeth really feel clean after using. Timer is a great feature. Wish I had bought sooner.</li>
    <li> Love this electronic toothbrush. First time I purchased one. First use, I noticed it left my teeth like I had a teeth cleaning from the dentist. Great product. Definitely getting my bf one of these. Plus I got a great deal</li>
    <li> I bought two of these... One for myself and one for my husband and we both love them.  My old toothbrush actually stopped when I brushed to hard but since it still &amp;#34;buzzed&amp;#34; it was hard to tell when it was going and when it wasn&#x27;t.  Very frustrating!  This one just flashes a red light to let me know when I press to hard and I know to ease up.  This is my husbands first electric toothbrush and he was skeptical but he absolutely loves his!  His teeth are noticeably whiter in the month he has been using it.  We both feel our teeth feel as clean after brushing as they do when we have a dental cleaning.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has served me well over the last month or so. The cleaning feels excellent -- slightly exceeding my old Sonicare. The interface is straight forward and the timing component is very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the extremely bright lights engaged when charging. Fortunately I can close the door between my bedroom and bathroom, but those with studio apartments or different living arrangements should consider another option or also buy some electrical tape to cover the light... unless you like a pulsing super-bright blue light rocking your world all night.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush aspect seems to be like most electric toothbrushes. It does alert you if your pushing to hard and once you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes. I really like the clock that comes with it. It gives you a 2 minutes count down as well as a smiley face once you&#x27;ve hit 2 minutes. It&#x27;s also a clock.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too noisy for me.</li>
    <li> Very harsh on gums. Have three Oral B electric toothbrushes but thought I should upate to a new model.  YIKES! This is really hard on your gums and teeth.  I read a lot of the reviews before I bought it but this did not work for me at all.  No way I can have that much power next to my teeth/gums.  Tried setting it on gentle and not gentle enough for me. I will return this and get another Oral B Vitality.  I was really surprised at the incredible power no matter what speed I selected.  If you have any issue with your teeth and gums - skip this model.</li>
    <li> A lot of money for nothing special. I would return it if i still had the packaging, total waste of money. Not even a user guide included and nothing available on the website either</li>
    <li> I did not check that lower priced model 5000 talks to your iPhone via BlueTooth but not this one. Why?! Otherwise a very good electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and works well.  Lots of features we don&#x27;t use but it was a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful 7000 to replace my old Oral-B Triumph Professional Care (model Unknown), .  My mistake.  I have yet to figure out how to prevent me from accidentluy pushing the Mode button.  This happens 2 -3 times a week. I cannot remember ever doing that on my old one.&lt;br /&gt;In comparing the two, the old one has a raised place on the handle surrounding tthe mode button while the 7000 does not.  Obviously the old model was designed for this reason, so why not the new one?&lt;br /&gt;The carry case is nice, but too big.  My old model carry case was more compact - preferable if flying is the mode of travel.&lt;br /&gt;The stopping completely every 30 seconds is another minor annoyance, prefer the older slow down instead.&lt;br /&gt;Travelling for more than 4 days and brush slows too much, at 2 1/2 minutes once a day - older went for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Complaining to Braun got me coupon for $$ off new toothbrushes - not a solution.</li>
    <li> Update 2 - June 24th: After no luck with the phone number, and the website, I posted on Oral B&#x27;s Facebook page. Within&#x27; minutes a representative provided me a link, and I was able to fill out a form. The next day I got a response with instructions on what was required of me. The unit comes with a 2 year warranty from the company, and the repairs were covered. I shipped the items out to the company, and in under a week, the product was returned repaired. I am readjusting my ratings back to 5 stars, as the unit does an amazing job on cleaning my teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 - June 8th: It&#x27;s June 8th, the unit no longer charges. The customer service line to Oral B is closed when I get home from work, and their e-mail customer service site is conveniently down. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else had an issue with their item dying in less 4 months, or if I just got unlucky with a defect. Until I can get through to their customer service, I&#x27;m leaving this review as a 1 star. The unit is great while working, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for more than a few months, and I can&#x27;t get through to the maker to resolve it; the product isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original - First week my gums wouldn&#x27;t stop bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second week, my teeth were always sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day I asked myself: &amp;#34;Whey the hell am I doing this?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And every night, I&#x27;d look at the accessory clock with the little smiley face man. That was it. That small fellow who winks at me, or smiles after every successful brushing session has been my sole motivation. In fact, when I&#x27;m having a bad day, I&#x27;ll brush my teeth just to see his smiling face to give me an extra boost. I&#x27;ve got to say Oral-B made a fantastic anti depressant in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it might also be worth noting that my gums no longer bleed, and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> Best Toothbrush ever !</li>
    <li> Works Fine, just the battery is not too much but in total I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought a black one and it also has Bluetooth!</li>
    <li> Save Your Money. I Purchase A $10 Arm And Hammer Spin Brush That Works Better Than This One. Also Mine Came With Missing Parts Even though It Was Brand New And Sealed</li>
    <li> Flashing blue recharging light is crazy annoying and bright.  You&#x27;ll have to have the bathroom door closed to sleep</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush!  It took a day to get used to it(I have used a Sonicare for years) but it leaves my teeth feeling very clean.  I also like the modes offered with this model.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> So glad this one is my first electronic tooth brush!</li>
    <li> Thanks for your fast shipping and great product! We like it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Until it falls apart I will remain loyal to the 5 star toothbrush. Hey guess what? You only get one set of teeth. Unless you have some made :-)</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I like the quadrant timer and the way my teeth feel very clean.  The deep clean with flossing action head has also been great.</li>
    <li> Not much to the setup really, I did read through the instructions as some others seemed to have issues. It pulses and beeps at the 30 second intervals and shines bright red when you push to hard. I had no idea I was pushing so hard when I brushed my teeth. The light is bright enough to see even with your eyes closed on those tired mornings. LOL</li>
    <li> Be careful with your order. &amp;#34;Black Bluetooth&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the actual Bluetooth model (at least it wasn&#x27;t when I ordered it March 2015). The WHITE Bluetooth model is the actual Bluetooth one. I have returned the black smart connection version and ordered the Pro 5000 since I know it has the Bluetooth connection. If you don&#x27;t want the Bluetooth, this would probably be a great brush for you. The travel case looked pretty fancy.</li>
    <li> Teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B electrical toothbrushes for years.  This one is the best by far. My teeth just feel more clean.</li>
    <li> Amazing product i will never go back to sonicare and i&#x27;m not sure about others reviewers but as of 4-7-2015 the one i order and received is the newer model that has Bluetooth. and it was only $117 with the $30.00 off. even thought on amazon it doesn&#x27;t show bluetooth for the black one. it does say black Bluetooth when you click on name.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that it cleans so well. Makes me feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  It lets you know if you are brushing to hard, if you did not brush long enough or the brush head needs changing.  The battery last on a full charge a week.</li>
    <li> Hi tech toothbrush uses different types of brushes to clean your teeth and report via Bluetooth to your phone or tablet how long you brush. The app also asks you if use are flossing, cleaning your tongue and using mouth wash.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s great product.  Using about a month now.  The remote wireless monitor is very nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it lasts better than the last Sonicare was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well engineered and designed.  Makes brushing teeth much more pleasant task and mouth feels a huge difference than traditional toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I had been using an older model for the past 8 years. This one is much nicer, the speeds are more varied and the bluetooth time display is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Nice improvement over lesser models, the pressure sensitivity is a big plus. Modes of operation can be  a bit daunting, but are comprehensive. The travel case is nice. Lighter in weight than predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment (hence 4 stars) is that the charger, while capable of 50-60Hz, is only 110-130V So it is not truly travel capable. I had expected a world travel charger (90-250V) with a unit of this price and build. So a transformer is required, one more thing a traveler does not want to carry.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Never going back to manual brushes. Bluetooth is unnecessary, I just like top of the line items. Teeth feels extra clean after brush.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an electric toothbrush for a while, Got it on sale from Amazon.  My teeth feel like I just came from a dentist every time I use it.  Really gets the plague off and the gunk out from in between your teeth.  My favorite feature has got to be the timer.</li>
    <li> The head of the brushes are a bit bigger than I anticipated but overall pretty good. The display thing is actually pretty genius especially if you have kids. The star rating and the smiley faces serve as encouragement</li>
    <li> Really pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance. This is my third and the best yet.</li>
    <li> I know its a bit more expensive, but i love it. I had a OralB classic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;But after first use with this, i could really feel the difference on my teeth.. Its more clean, like after u leave from the dentist..:)</li>
    <li> The battery can only last for3 days</li>
    <li> We recently moved from the UK to the US, and out of all the electronics we had to leave behind, this was the one that hurt the most!  We went a few months using regular tooth brushes, and finally caved and ordered this bad boy.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  We really like all the different settings - great improvement over the UK one!  There is a setting that even makes it feel like you just came from the dentist.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Invest in this toothbrush!!! My teeth feel great, they are whiter and overall I think they are healthier. I had never had a round head before but I love it! The clean is great and it is by far the best electric toothbrush I have ever had. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> seems to work very well. have been using it every day for almost a month now. had a Phillips Sonic Care brush but this one does a better job.</li>
    <li> Love love love this toothbrush! It is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing love it</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  My old Diamond died and decided to replace it with the best of this best, which is the Oral-B Precision Black.  The timer could bug some folks, but I appreciate it since it lets me know I&#x27;m doing getting the job done.  Every time I finish, my tongue slides smoothly over my perfectly clean teeth... just the way they feel after you&#x27;ve had your 6-month cleaning at the dentist.  You can&#x27;t put a price on healthy teeth and gums, so although this is more than your average toothbrush, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment... and it&#x27;s got all the bells and whistles to ensure you do a thorough job.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I decided to replace the Oral-B 4000 with this model for main use.  The purpose was to get the better travel kit and leave the 4000 in my travel bag, as I travel often, so that I would never leave my toothbrush behind any more.  The travel kit is nice and works well.  The 4000 had a travel kit as well that worked, but I do prefer this one better.  I like the black look of this toothbrush and I thought I would enjoy the blue light, but the blue light is a good bit brighter than the 4000 unit.  Yes, I am docking a star only for that reason as I enjoy a dark room in the morning and before bed.  I use two Mr. Beam auto-lights in the bathroom, which are awesome, and this 7000 unit&#x27;s blue lights are brighter than the green lights on the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both units have adequate battery life for travel.  I never bother taking the power charger on trips. FYI, I took the 4000 unit on a 3 week business trip and it lasted until the final few days; I haven&#x27;t tested the 7000 for that duration but the battery lights indicate that it will last, at least, the same length of time.  It has a less powerful mode, aka sensitive mode, that could probably be used to stretch it even longer if needed.  If you wanted to take the charger only, it does separate from the 10 brush holder.  If you want to travel with another for the week and only take one brush then this travel kit can hold two brushes, just label the brushes prior to doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the 4000 unit worked great and would be the unit I would recommend, for the price difference of course.  The travel kit for the 7000 and the black look do make the 7000 better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased the 1000 unit and leave it at another location.  The base charger for any of these will charge any toothbrush, or at least in the 1000+ up range.  That unit works for simple brushing from time to time but makes me miss the 4 or 7 K units.  It doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long either.</li>
    <li> Love the cleaning action and how it times each section and the smiley face you get for a job well done.</li>
    <li> Less then 6 months and the battery is ready declined big time! Do not buy it here.</li>
    <li> It is a good product for you to save your time</li>
    <li> Too messy! Tooth paste all over the place.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush works well for the 2 of us</li>
    <li> Great product. Speedy shipping.</li>
    <li> Hey,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to update my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Does well cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- Brush case that snaps on the charging station is convenient&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case is an advantage&lt;br /&gt;- I do like the star and smiley system (despite the 1990&#x27;s display...)&lt;br /&gt;- I do like the floss action and polishing head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely the value-for-your-money&lt;br /&gt;- Mike wrote this very well: 1 second interruption after 30/45 seconds to let you know to move to the next zone for brushing (please... waste of my time)&lt;br /&gt;- I almost never see the red light flash warning of too much pressure (which really makes it useless)&lt;br /&gt;- The charging station, battery at the bottom, and all accessories are white (I mainly got black to match the black granite counters; snobby reason, I know)&lt;br /&gt;- Too many useless modes (I use one all the time, not paying attention to the time but usually 3-4 minutes; I used the gentle mode one, the polish mode once a month... you get the idea)&lt;br /&gt;- I was disappointed to see it was NOT Lithium Ion. Even my $40 beard trimmer has that now. At this price, let-down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to say, I had the Oral B Pulsonic since 2008 and the battery finally died this (2014) summer. It did an equally good job brushing and it had a fast and a slow mode. I would seriously not waste my money on this brush because it has x-amounts of modes. I still would like to see the Joe Average who uses all those day in day out. ONCE I brushed and then buffered... 7+ minutes of brushing was for the symphony and a date with my better half. That was the only time that every happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still love Braun products but this one just isn&#x27;t cutting it for a Premium product.s just as out of place as a $40 brush. The travel case is nice if you actually need it. The timer is fun but I now mainly use it to look at the clock when I get out of the shower. It actually can be more on the annoying side because it interrupts the brushing cycle ever x-amout of minutes so you know which of the 4 zones you have to now brush. How did I ever make it through the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s with my teeth now falling out?</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Good features.</li>
    <li> Braun sells this as a travel toothbrush and then includes only the single voltage charger when they make and sell a universal one. I bought a 5000 a couple years ago after having a 4000. The 4000 had a dual voltage charger and thus with simple plug adapters can be used anywhere. Then I got the 5000 only to find the sheer stupidity and greed of this multi-national firm short-changing buyers with a 20th century charger. Hideous, criminal rip off. Now this so called premium brush and the same idiocy continues. Do not buy from this company until they supply their products with a truly travel-capable product. Go for their jugular vein - money - which is the only thing they understand.</li>
    <li> I had it for a few weeks and i did not have any trouble with it. All of the head that came with the unit are working fine and so is the traveling case. it&#x27;s the first electric tooth brush i have but it beat doing it manually so for me it&#x27;s a great help.</li>
    <li> Its like visiting the dentist every use.</li>
    <li> as the name is very accurate, does its job in the best way possible, highly recommended</li>
    <li> The product is OK, what I am not happy about is the &amp;#34;coupon&amp;#34; contained with the product says that if you register the product &amp;#34;on line&amp;#34; you will receive an additional &amp;#34;$7.00&amp;#34; off for a package of 3 or more brushes.  When I registered my product, providing ALL the information required, when I &amp;#34;submitted&amp;#34; the information I was informed that the &amp;#34;Offer had expired&amp;#34;.  There was/is nothing on the coupon that states there was a time limit.  In fact, the coupon expiration date is July 31, 2016.  I purchased the Oral B brush on the 27th of December, 2014 and received it on December 30th.  Numerous calls to P &amp; G were not helpful..really more finger pointing to &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; departments who would not acknowledge my inquiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is good.  I think the P &amp; G &amp;#34;rebate&amp;#34; is a &amp;#34;ruse&amp;#34;!  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything from P&amp;G when a &amp;#34;rebate&amp;#34; is promised.</li>
    <li> Ok ... AMAZING ........but whaaaaat  26 hs to full charge</li>
    <li> Well, better than manual brushing his much cleaner</li>
    <li> This new Oral-B is fantastic, although the timer and tooth brush holder base are not used.  I have not had a cavity in years since I started using the Oral-B and strong rinse.</li>
    <li> did take a long time to charge</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush but not better than the other lower price oral-b toothbrushs. There is no justification for the higher price. Also since it comes with a traveling case why doesn&#x27;t it come with dual voltage adapter. It&#x27;s a waste of money and useless for my trips to other countries outside of the U.S. where electricity is 220. I&#x27;m not going to log an electric converter just for this toothbrush, it&#x27;s just not worth it</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Black 7000 is a remarkable toothbrush. It cleans my teeth better than any of the electric toothbrushes I have owned in the past. Having said that, I am giving it 2 star because of 1 reason, the battery. I&#x27;m not going to debate different battery chemistry and their optimal recharge strategies, you can easily search the Internet for that information. This toothbrush takes up to 24 hours to fully recharge and I find that unacceptable.Thinking I had a defective unit, I wrote P&amp;G and their response is that it takes up to 24 hours to recharge. So I am left with a choice, when the toothbrush needs to be recharged, either I let the toothbrush fully recharge to maximize the battery life or I interrupt the recharge cycle and brush twice a day, like I&#x27;m supposed to.That is an unacceptable choice and that&#x27;s why I give the Oral-B Black 7000 2 star.</li>
    <li> Cleans much better than the 3000 (with floss action head) but battery life lasts only about 7-8 days before a full recharge is needed. Smart Guide not really needed. Wished it came with a multi-volt charger</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B Professional power tooth brush for many years and was very pleased with it. The brush storage on my charger broke where I could no longer use it.  I thought that I would upgrade to the new Black 7000 model. I am not disappointed. I like the versatility of the speeds. The brushing monitor unit is a great plus because it monitors my brushing and adds a clock to my bathroom to keep me on time. I love the new brush storage/charger unit that makes my brush heads readily available.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is nothing short of incredible.  Makes my mouth feel polished and amazingly clean.  I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare before, but this is worlds better.  I don&#x27;t live overseas so charging is not a problem for me and I like the fact it shuts off for a second to let you get to the next quadrant of your mouth.  The fact replacement heads are fairly cheap is an added bonus along with the $30 coupon.  Update-- I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 4 months now.  I&#x27;d have to say it is the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased to date on Amazon.  My mouth has never felt better.</li>
    <li> Very please with the performance of the Oral-B.  Not real happy with the stingy supply of brushes.  Be prepared to immediately spend more $s if there are more than two in your family.</li>
    <li> WTH is with the flashing blue light(s) while charging? I felt like I was being pulled over by a cop in my bathroom ........ Oral-B, please tone this down - geeze. Giving this a 4, will update when it&#x27;s stops charging and I can use it (been on the charger for almost 24 hours fresh from shipment box - still not ready to use)</li>
    <li> Awesome my teeth have never been so clean</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush,  but the timer doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I never knew teeth could feel this clean.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but after a while I realized that I will never use anything but the normal brushing mode with the normal head.  I should have bought a lesser model of Oral-B for half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for almost two months and the thing I like best about this toothbrush is the brush itself.  Since it&#x27;s round and very compact instead of rectangular like other brands it&#x27;s really easy to get to the  hard to reach spots on the inside of my teeth.  Leaves my teeth feeling really clean.  The toothbrush is black with silver sides.  It came with three different types of brushes and a &amp;#34;garage&amp;#34; attachment to store up to four heads rather than a snap on cap for an individual head.  As far as the &amp;#34;Bluetooth&amp;#34; attachment, I guess I&#x27;m not that high-tech. :-)  It&#x27;s more useful as a clock and showing what setting (for example, sensitive) you are using.  The toothbrush itself pauses and beeps at 20 second intervals so you know when to move on to a different quadrant.  The clock shows that as well, plus total brushing time.  The carrying case is very nice.  I think there&#x27;s a separate pouch for the &amp;#34;clock.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve only used the case once so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to fit the clock in the same carrying case.  By now I&#x27;m used to the sound of the setting I normally use, so I didn&#x27;t even bother bringing it along.  The instructions are pretty much pictorial only and were a little confusing at times.  The box and packaging are a feat of German engineering!</li>
    <li> Wish I had this when I was a kid. Great for my 5 year old. The interactive timer is a great piece.</li>
    <li> Very loud but does a good job cleaning</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It definitely keeps my teeth clean and white and is definitely worth the price. The battery does not last the advertised 10 days, but closer to 7. That&#x27;s something I can live with, however, because you can find an outlet literally anywhere.</li>
    <li> Well I returned the 1st one I ordered because the &amp;#34;Sophisticated pressure-sensor technology alerts you if you’re brushing too hard and automatically decelerates the pulsation and oscillation speeds of the brush head.&amp;#34; Failed after the first day.  After that it said I was brushing too hard even when the tooth brush was running by its self, with or with out a brush head on it.  It would I was brushing too hard in every mode except tongue cleaning mode.So i returned it for a replacement which I received today.  I&#x27;m letting it fully charge before I try it.  I have had older Oral&#x3D;B electric tooth brushes without all the bells and whistles this one has and they all worked terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised to 5 stars after using it for a wile.  Love the product I guess a lemon gets by quality control every once in a while.</li>
    <li> best tooth brush i ever used</li>
    <li> If you’re the type of person who loves the feeling of going to the dentist and getting your teeth clean, this is the brush for you. Every time I use it, I feel like I just had the A-Team of dental work, sneak into my bathroom all Special Forces like, knock me out, clean the ever living s*** out of my teeth and gums, disappear, then add in memories of a good tooth brushing, ITS THAT AMAZING. It takes 24 hours to charge, big whoop. Use your old brush in the meantime, because this brush will wait patiently, then stealth kill the s*** out of your old toothbrush when its sleeping, because it’s number one and we know, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. The only downside to this, is that damned blue blinking light when charging, but it can be fixed by placing duct tape over it or ya know, turn it around. I loved this brush so much; I bought another one for my girlfriend, because dental hygiene is no joke. Everyone need an amazing brush, this is the one to start with.</li>
