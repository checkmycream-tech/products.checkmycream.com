      <li>Thanks Amazon.com for carrying this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER recieved a nick from them, they give a comfortable close shave that I love, and the design is great, too.  </li>
      <li>i have reccommended them and they fall in love with it as most latin women have couurse hair and this razor has your legs smootht as silk!  </li>
      <li>Great for women&#x27;s hair growth (light to medium light).</li>

      <li>I have owned this razor for many years and have been completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>My favorite razors.  </li>
      <li>Men may need something more substantial with perhaps another blade.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for this for quite awhile and was happy to finally find it on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>It is ergonomically fit for the contours of my underarms and legs.  </li>

      <li>Looking long time for a schick razor I lost and loved.  </li>
      <li>This is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever liked.</li>
      <li>This razor is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>and so I purchased her a different razor of her own.  </li>

      <li>I love these, I get several at a time when I can find them.</li>
      <li>This is the first razor I used when I was in the sixth grade.</li>
      <li>I ordered an off brand head that holds the razors and works fine but doesnt have the same slope to the head.  </li>
      <li>They all left me wanting, either not allowing for a smooth shave or causing nicks and burns everywhere - something that never happened before.  </li>
      <li>It is very hard for me to find in stores, so was glad it was available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost 30 now and have tried every other razor available.</li>
      <li>I get a smoother shave with this than the new ones on the market.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like any of the new type of shavers now made.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be that girl who stockpiles them in case they&#x27;re ever taken off the market completely.</li>
      <li>The aloe makes it easy to use dry with minimal water and no soap.</li>
      <li>I was forced to test drive others - and I did, from teh cheapy cheap ones to the most expensive and super advertisized ones.  </li>
      <li>I started using this razor way back in high school, and I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully ever since.   </li>
      <li>This razor is very durable and last a long time.</li>
      <li>I finally found a replacement on Amazon, Thank You so much Amazon for having this long time product.  </li>
      <li>However when my first one broke a few years ago</li>

<li> When I first started shaving my mom bought me one, the same one she&#x27;d be using since college in the late 70s.  </li>
<li> they last so long</li>
<li> She was never happy until I was recently able to locate one on line as it is not available in stores locally.  </li>
<li> I have had one for a long time and my daughter tried it, so i had to find her one.</li>
<li> I have tried other razors, but always come back to this one.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;I was forced to break away from them for a while because they stopped selling the razor in local stores</li>
<li> my mom has  used this ever since i was little</li>
<li> Impossible Discounts is the best company you could ever hope to deal with, there prices you would think realy are impossible, but they do it!!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s hard to find refills because we live in such a stupid disposable world.</li>
<li> i can use the razor for at least 10myrs with just changing the blades.  </li>
<li> Hate the new and improved versions which keep adding blades, and which do NOT improve the performance of the razor at all.  </li>
<li> Very hard to find.</li>
<li> So sad.</li>
<li> So sad they no longer make this.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this is NOT A SCHICK product!</li>
<li> i am very sad that i find it very difficult too find the refill cartridges anywheere :(  </li>

    <li> This is the first razor I used when I was in the sixth grade. I&#x27;m almost 30 now and have tried every other razor available. I don&#x27;t understand the swivel-head craze - I&#x27;ve had to use disposables until I found out I could get Personal Touch online. I really, really love this thing. I&#x27;ll be that girl who stockpiles them in case they&#x27;re ever taken off the market completely.</li>
    <li> this is the best razor in the world for shaving legs that are sooooooooooo smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor a girl could ever own!! I have had one for a long time and my daughter tried it, so i had to find her one. Thanks Amazon.com for carrying this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This razor does not irratate my skin and allows a closer/smoother shave.  The blades just seem superior to the newer styled brands.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for years now, and I have been looking for a replacement for ever and no one sells it anymore. I finally found a replacement on Amazon, Thank You so much Amazon for having this long time product.  This razor is very durable and last a long time. I almost feel like I need to buy extras for stock.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for many years and have been completely satisfied.  It is ergonomically fit for the contours of my underarms and legs.  As a teen, my daughter was always using my razor and so I purchased her a different razor of her own.  She was never happy until I was recently able to locate one on line as it is not available in stores locally.  Now she too is completely satisfied and we both highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I love these, I get several at a time when I can find them. i think the co needs to bring them back in the stores. the disposable ones they sale in stores cut you all up. Ive never gotten cut from one of these. I love them.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best razors on the market when it was on the market. Why they ever quit selling it is a big mystery. I would encourage others to purchase it while they can, and also go buy the blades for it at walmart while they have them.  I get a smoother shave with this than the new ones on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of razor for years, but as time has passed, it has disappeared off store shelves. I have searched for it because it is the only brand of razor that I do not knick or cut myself with and it gives me the smoothest shave without having to use any shaving creams.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this for quite awhile and was happy to finally find it on Amazon!! This is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever liked.</li>
    <li> I love this razor and was very happy to receive it since I can no longer find it around here! It&#x27;s a great razor that shaves closely and provides  very smooth results.</li>
    <li> My favorite razors.  Very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I read such great things about this razor, and thought it might finally be the end of my underwarm shave bumps.  Not so.....  This razor did no better than the cheap disposables I&#x27;d previously used.</li>
    <li> Impossible Discounts is the best company you could ever hope to deal with, there prices you would think realy are impossible, but they do it!! and the best part about them is their AMAZING customer service...you can be sure i will be ordering from them again very soon!</li>
    <li> i wish they would put this razor  back out there! my mom has  used this ever since i was little and ive used this since i started shaving  at age 11.  they last so long i can use the razor for at least 10myrs with just changing the blades.  i have reccommended them and they fall in love with it as most latin women have couurse hair and this razor has your legs smootht as silk!  i am very sad that i find it very difficult too find the refill cartridges anywheere :(  as a dedicated user since i was 11, i amnow 40 i hope and pray they bring this back!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor for women!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Personal Touch Razor for over 20 years.  I didnt know until last year when i needed replacment blades that they had quit making this razor.  I had just thought the store was out until I googled it on line.  I needed an additional head so that&#x27;s when I learned of this.  I ordered an off brand head that holds the razors and works fine but doesnt have the same slope to the head.  So I baby my original head and keep praying I can order my blades on Amozon.com...</li>
    <li> Looking long time for a schick razor I lost and loved.  Found and happy again</li>
    <li> So sad they no longer make this.  Perfect size, perfect razor.  So sad.</li>
    <li> works great, like product, would buy again, a aa a a a a a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> Hate the new and improved versions which keep adding blades, and which do NOT improve the performance of the razor at all.  Enough already.  The aloe makes it easy to use dry with minimal water and no soap. Great for women&#x27;s hair growth (light to medium light). Men may need something more substantial with perhaps another blade.  I use a 3 blade too sometimes, but still prefer the Personal Touch.</li>
    <li> What a rip off!  Such a joke, THIS IS NOT A SCHICK PERSONAL TOUCH RAZOR!  I should of sent it back but didn&#x60;t have the time to deal with it....it&#x60;s in the trash.</li>
    <li> I started using this razor way back in high school, and I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully ever since.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was forced to break away from them for a while because they stopped selling the razor in local stores but I found them again and I&#x27;m back to using them again.  I&#x27;ve NEVER recieved a nick from them, they give a comfortable close shave that I love, and the design is great, too.  I&#x27;m going to buy 3 just in case they stop selling them on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This razor is by far my favorite.  When I first started shaving my mom bought me one, the same one she&#x27;d be using since college in the late 70s.  However when my first one broke a few years ago and I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores, though refill blades were avaliable.  I was forced to test drive others - and I did, from teh cheapy cheap ones to the most expensive and super advertisized ones.  They all left me wanting, either not allowing for a smooth shave or causing nicks and burns everywhere - something that never happened before.  However, thanks to the wonders of the internet I am now the happy owner of my favorite razor.</li>
    <li> I had used this razor many years ago and was so happy to find that it was still made and that I could order it on line.  I don&#x27;t like any of the new type of shavers now made.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, who loves the Schick Personal Touch razor. Unfortunately this is NOT A SCHICK product! This is an off-brand, and in fact does not even include any refills. Do not purchase if you are expecting a Schick product.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! I&#x27;ve had it for years but it&#x27;s hard to find refills because we live in such a stupid disposable world. I bought it for both my grown girls and just order tons of refills at a time ON LINE.</li>
    <li> I have tried other razors, but always come back to this one.  It is very hard for me to find in stores, so was glad it was available.</li>
