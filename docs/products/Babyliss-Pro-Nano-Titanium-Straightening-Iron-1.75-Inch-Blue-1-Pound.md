    <li> I love this flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sleek and durable and easy to clean. The titanium plates are quality and the entire product is superb.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and am prone to frizz and dryness.

To me, it is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;When this gives out in a few years, I will order again.</li>

    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned! Heats up super-fast and straightens beautifully. I only have to run through my hair one time, and it stays in place all day. Very happy with purchase. Costs a bit more but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my BaBylissPRO straightening iron - my only complaint is that the temperature settings are too high for the iron itself and the silver plating is popping off...</li>

    <li> Wonderful product. I have long, curly(frizzy) hair which I&#x27;d been wearing in a bun for the past month or so because I hate the time-consuming hassle of straightening after every wash.

It heats up almost instantly. A real time saver. Love, love, love it!</li>
