      <li>Honestly, I feel like I bought some overpriced version of Head and Shoulders, for all the good that it did for my dandruff.</li>
      <li>We were so happy when we found this shampoo/conditioner was available on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe site.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, it really works, when my scalp getting itchy, I use it for and it will stop the itching rightaway.  </li>

      <li>It creates more dandruff than I ever have before.</li>
      <li>I will def get more and ordering on line is convienant and no one sees you buying it</li>
      <li>This one smells much better than another one</li>
      <li>It is way better at stop</li>
      <li>dandruff and itch than head &amp; shoulders, just head and shoulders smell better and it is cheaper.</li>
      <li>Most anti-dandruff shampoos have the ingredient Pyrithione zinc.</li>
      <li>Since there are many causes for dandruff to occur</li>
      <li>love love love love this.</li>
      <li>This 2-in-1 set is just okay.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clean.</li>
      <li>This is a best shampoo I have tried in a long time.</li>
      <li>it worked perfectly, the dry skin just wiped off.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s really hard to tell whether or not this has reduced my dandruff, but I like to think that it does, so in that sense, it works great!</li>
      <li>is a great product used many and none compare to selsun blue notice a difference the week after i washed my hair</li>
      <li>I feel more conditioned and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>The smell is too strong for baby.</li>
      <li>But even if there are no &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; it is as good a shampoo as any other for cleaning my hair and leaving the hair in excellent soft condition.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this combination to people who have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have a busy life and often need to take very quick showers, so the s&amp;c-in-one is a good time saver.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s an ok shampoo, but the original formula works better for scalp conditions, which is why you buy in in the first place.  </li>
      <li>By week 2 I was practically flake free.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
      <li>It is relatively cheap compared to some anti-dandruff shampoos, and it works for me.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smooth.</li>
      <li>it seems that you have to make sure you are using the right shampoo for the exact skin condition you have.</li>
      <li>It left my hair about as greasy as it was before my shower, BUT my hair did smell better :)</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Quick Shipment.</li>
      <li>Love it, Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>5 stars for a dandruff shampoo combo that consistently works!</li>
      <li>but I think its worth it.</li>
      <li>it surely is worth it.</li>
      <li>I went to the doctor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t dandruff (even though this is dandruff shampoo) and was confirmed it was just dry skin.</li>
      <li>first I thought it was helping my scalp</li>
      <li>I would recommend T-Gel Shampoo as a much better alternative to Selsun Blue.</li>
      <li>ive had dandruff pretty much my whole life, this stuff is the business!</li>
      <li>Exactly what they said it would be</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>The generic that I found at the drug store worked better.  </li>
      <li>There are about six kinds of Selsun Blue, and I wasn&#x27;t sure which to buy, so I just picked one.  </li>
      <li>Faster relief and twice a week is more than enough to get rid  for ever.</li>
      <li>Best shampoo for dry scalp, not sure about dandrof.</li>
      <li>in the first week there was a very noticable difference</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very good, relieves itching scalp and removes all the dirty scalp waste also leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Now this shampoo REALLY does the job.</li>
      <li>I started using the 2in1 version just by chance, but it really leaves my hair</li>
      <li>It is ok in comparing to head and shoulders you are looking for something more expensive but better than it try American crew.</li>
      <li>Really happy with this shampoo, congrats to the team behind it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Well after using a whole bottle, I can&#x27;t tell any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>told my doctor my scalp was very itchy and he suggested this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>Im really thankful</li>
      <li>I use this product at least twice a week after coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle, pleasant smell and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He used it everyother day for the first week and is now using it once a week in conjunction with his old shampoo.</li>
      <li>It worked half way I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 weeks now.</li>
      <li>If there are dandruff flare-ups, it corrects such problems quickly.</li>
      <li>How embarassing for a High School student.  </li>
      <li>No sign of flakes and helps in the winter when my scalp becomes drier than normal.</li>
      <li>That worked very well in completely preventing the small white things on my scalp from appearing, but it wasn&#x27;t very good in actually making me feel as if my hair was properly shampooed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still on the Selsun Blue web site.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had dandruff due to seborrheic dermatitis for many years, tried different shampoos recommended by &amp;#34;specialists&amp;#34; but none of them really worked, such a struggle .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> helped but did not remove the problem</li>
    <li> I add teatree and this helps with my adult hairline acne.</li>
    <li> did the job and keeps the dry scalp away. I will def get more and ordering on line is convienant and no one sees you buying it</li>
    <li> This product is more expensive than most others but the result is bad. It creates more dandruff than I ever have before.</li>
    <li> I have terrible dandruff.  This product helps, but doesn&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my seborrheic dermatitis. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful either. Seems a bit pricey, but for it&#x27;s effectiveness it surely is worth it.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo that works.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for dermatitis. When applied to skin, it stops dryness and itchiness. Helped me and I would give it a thumbs up to others.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this particular formulation of Selsun Blue in Walmart, Target but these stores are not carrying it anymore. Found it on Amazon and you can receive it by the Subscribe and Save program. I like the combination of shampoo and conditioner in this version of Selsun Blue, I believe that it doesn&#x27;t leave hair as dry as other versions do. So if you can&#x27;t find it in your local B&amp;M&#x27;s, thank goodness for internet ordering.</li>
    <li> no more dandruff! yipee</li>
    <li> Only needed to use this twice to get rid of my son&#x27;s cradle cap!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff and safe for color-treated hair.  Great price when I have it on auto ship and use prime shipping.</li>
    <li> The shipping was on time, and the product is just the same as Selsun Blue (with purple cap) that you can buy in the grocery store. It is good shampoo/conditioner. It is relatively cheap compared to some anti-dandruff shampoos, and it works for me. With Selsun Blue, I get dandruff about twice a year for a few days, whereas I used to get dandruff about 7-10 times per year. I have a busy life and often need to take very quick showers, so the s&amp;c-in-one is a good time saver. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
    <li> Exactly what they said it would be</li>
    <li> best shampoo for dandruff</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, it really works, when my scalp getting itchy, I use it for and it will stop the itching rightaway.  It is way better at stop dandruff and itch than head &amp; shoulders, just head and shoulders smell better and it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my doctor since I was suffering from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was helping my scalp but unfortunately it was actually stripping my hair and making my scalp worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ingredients in this shampoo/conditioner combo is sulfate which is a harsh chemical not health for hair or scalp.... well at least not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely removes build up but I recommend doing a pre shampoo with an oil for an hour before using then deep conditioning with a heavy conditioner.</li>
    <li> I often have times of the year where I get a substantial amount of dandruff due to seborrheic dermatitis. Regular shampoo such as H&amp;S really doesn&#x27;t do anything to help. In fact I often get a burning sensation when I use it when it gets really bad. Most anti-dandruff shampoos have the ingredient Pyrithione zinc. This is the ingredient which is actually supposed to help with dandruff.    Selsun blue instead has selenium sulfide as the ingredient to fight dandruff. Since there are many causes for dandruff to occur it seems that you have to make sure you are using the right shampoo for the exact skin condition you have. Selsun blue has certainly helped me substantially. even in the first week I noticed a dramatic drop in flaking. By week 2 I was practically flake free. If you suffer from dermatitis and use other shampoos and dont see improvement, drop them and get this. Your hair, clothes, and just overall scalp will be grateful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, so if you do, this review isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my doctor my scalp was very itchy and he suggested this product. Well after using a whole bottle, I can&#x27;t tell any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a 5-star product for dandruff; I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m giving it 3 only because there isn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;N/A&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34; choice. But if you&#x27;re just looking for something for itchy scalp, I don&#x27;t think this is it.</li>
    <li> It did the trick for my dandruff</li>
    <li> This shampoo is recommended by my baby&#x27;s doctor. Just one thing I don&#x27;t like this shampoo...it is smell. The smell is too strong for baby. it smells good though..</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased Selsun Blue for the first time and after a month or so the product went bad. It smelled like sewer and the color turned khaki green. The expiration date said 10/2016 it&#x27;s only 5/2014. What&#x27;s the deal??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff due to seborrheic dermatitis for many years, tried different shampoos recommended by &amp;#34;specialists&amp;#34; but none of them really worked, such a struggle . Forget about T-Gel, this crap didn&#x27;t work at all. Now this shampoo REALLY does the job. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and still have no dandruff at all. I though my condition would &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34; to it but no. No more itchy scalp which implies no more awkward furious scalp scratching in front of everyone. My hair look good and the smell is nice without being strong. Really happy with this shampoo, congrats to the team behind it.</li>
    <li> added to a purchase, same as store</li>
    <li> 5 stars for a dandruff shampoo combo that consistently works! For whatever reason our hair/ scalp decides to get used to a dandruff shampoo and become immune to it, I have yet to run into that problem with Selsun blue. I started using the 2in1 version just by chance, but it really leaves my hair I feel more conditioned and squeaky clean. I have oily hair so that&#x27;s important to me. Im really thankful im done trying different dandruff shampoos. The gross dandruff stays gone and I cannot be happier.</li>
    <li> This 2-in-1 set is just okay. It left my hair about as greasy as it was before my shower, BUT my hair did smell better :) I would not recommend this combination to people who have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to treat an itchy flakey scalp.  I didn&#x27;t work very well.  I would recommend T-Gel Shampoo as a much better alternative to Selsun Blue.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that my husband will use.  It&#x27;s hard to find the 2-in-1 on store shelves so I&#x27;ve taken to buying it here.</li>
    <li> How do I remember a shampoo anniversary? I remember because that was the year when I was a sophomore in college and I met the freshman who became my future wife. This was the person who introduced me to Selsun. I think back then it could only be obtained with a doctor&#x27;s prescription and my wife&#x27;s mother was the MD that prescribed it. At any rate we both still use that shampoo. If there are dandruff flare-ups, it corrects such problems quickly. But even if there are no &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; it is as good a shampoo as any other for cleaning my hair and leaving the hair in excellent soft condition.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for dry scalp, not sure about dandrof. I tried all the other brand, even medicine shampoos but none helped me like this. Faster relief and twice a week is more than enough to get rid  for ever.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in my stores any longer, so I looked it up on Amazon. In fear of it being discontinued, I ordered 4 bottles. I have no idea if its being discontinued or not...it&#x27;s still on the Selsun Blue web site.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good, relieves itching scalp and removes all the dirty scalp waste also leaves a nice clean feeling. I recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who suffered from very bad dandruff. In just three uses she had no more dandruff. Obviously, she continued to use it and till this day I haven&#x27;t seen a flake on her. She stopped complaining about her hair. I recommend to those with bad dandruff.</li>
    <li> It definitely helped my scalp.  I only use it twice a week and will use my regular shampoo other times.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it sure does work well!  In the summer, I have absolutely no problem.  In the fall and winter, however, I get light-to-moderate dandruff.  It&#x27;s possible that this product wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient for someone who has serious dandruff caused by psoriasis or other complications - however, I can state that for my skin and for my light-to-moderate seasonal dandruff, this really does the trick.  I don&#x27;t use anything else with this except a leave-in conditioner afterward.</li>
    <li> Kills dandruffs, I am not happy with the smell. It is ok in comparing to head and shoulders you are looking for something more expensive but better than it try American crew.</li>
    <li> This is a best shampoo I have tried in a long time. My hair looks beautiful, it is shiny. I will continue to use this product..</li>
    <li> I have thick curly mixed hair and this shampoo is the BOMB!!! I get some psoriasis due to all the crap I have to use to keep this hair moisturized and the build up is madness! I have tried Nioxin (don&#x27;t work), tar shampoo (it don&#x27;t work, dries out and stinks!), head &amp; shoulders (did not work), and so on.... I even tried other selsum blue shampoos with no luck.  This one works like a sharm and clear up my psoriasis that was spreading to the back of my ears and side burns. (eeeeck and embarassing!)  Amazon offers the best price too so I&#x27;m happy I found as a Prime item. Loving it!!!</li>
    <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s really hard to tell whether or not this has reduced my dandruff, but I like to think that it does, so in that sense, it works great!</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily shampoo for my hair. This is by far the best remedy for my Dandruff. As a man we don&#x27;t like to add conditioner and shampoo in the shower, this solves both problems and makes my hair soft afterward. Love it, Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem with sores on his head. Not massive sores, but lots of little ones as a result of oil clogged pores on his scalp. I bought the shampoo after doing some research on the Internet, then begged my husband to at least try it.&lt;br /&gt;He used it everyother day for the first week and is now using it once a week in conjunction with his old shampoo. The sores are gone and so is the little bit of dandruff he had. We will definitely be repeat customers for this product.</li>
    <li> I get severely dry skin in the winter time and that includes my scalp. I went to the doctor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t dandruff (even though this is dandruff shampoo) and was confirmed it was just dry skin. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I only use it once a week and I&#x27;ve had no problems since starting it. If you do purchase this though I recommend you probably continue using it at least once a week for maintenance purposes.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed by this, as far as controlling my dandruff goes. I have used Selsun Blue in the past, but it was the medicated one with menthol. That worked very well in completely preventing the small white things on my scalp from appearing, but it wasn&#x27;t very good in actually making me feel as if my hair was properly shampooed. I was hoping that the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner variety would solve this problem, but it was not successful. My review is based on about 3 weeks of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very good, and it lathers up nicely. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be reducing my dandruff at all. I used to only use Head and Shoulders, but that didn&#x27;t help me either. Selsun Blue was the only type of shampoo I&#x27;ve come across that was actually successful in preventing my dandruff, but apparently it only applies to certain varieties. Honestly, I feel like I bought some overpriced version of Head and Shoulders, for all the good that it did for my dandruff.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Selsun Blue with the red cap (Medicated Maximum Strength) which is the one I buy normally. I was surprised that this shampoo wasn&#x27;t blue. It&#x27;s a peachy orange...like orange sherbet or mango smoothie. And didn&#x27;t have the menthol smell that I like...instead, it smells ambiguously florally-fruity. It&#x27;s not an annoying or overpowering scent. It&#x27;s very clean. But you can still smell the sulfur from the active ingredient. Unlike other reviewers, I love the blue color, menthol scent, and tingly sensation of the Selsun Blue Medicated Maximum Strength shampoo, so I was disappointed that this was different than what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a bit more, I do like that this is not as drying as the maximum strength. And even though it is not maximum strength, it works just as well and it helps me keep my stress eczema (on my scalp) under control. I almost have no flair ups now as long as I use this shampoo a couple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just massage it onto your scalp and let it sit there for a few minutes before rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the menthol fragrance or the minty/tingly sensation from the other Selsun shampoo, but you still need to use medicated shampoo, give this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My dog gets the occasional dermatitis flair up and I use this on him as well. It works on dogs, too. Just keep it away from their face and eyes.</li>
    <li> Very good in controlling dandruff.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Slightly pricey.  Quick Shipment.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference within days. Great shampoo. This is the one to get for me; I have had poor results in the past with &#x27;tar&#x27; shampoos and other brands.</li>
    <li> i had some dandruff problem was embarrassing  bought this , it is almost disappeared in few wash, i would recommend 100% ,</li>
    <li> Good product, gets rid of my husband and daughter&#x27;s dandruff.</li>
    <li> for color treated and damage hair this is a must! I use this product at least twice a week after coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle, pleasant smell and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good smelling and works great. No sign of flakes and helps in the winter when my scalp becomes drier than normal. use in conjunction with my own shampoo as this can be drying to the hair.</li>
    <li> I switch between this and Head &amp; Shoulders regularly: no dandruff for years. Solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it comes out brown. For some reason, a blue/purple bottle should not have coffee-with-creamer colored liquid pouring out of its hole.</li>
    <li> There is something in this shampoo that not only works for your hair but body.  Having worked in a tropical area and sweating at night, I had developed a fungal infection on my back in the form of a rash.  I was told to use this shampoo, which I already had, to take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple applications by wash cloth while showering I noticed a major change.  Within a fortnight the entire infection had been nullified.  Quite honestly I was amazed and thrilled.  A few subsequent applications kept everything at bay while working in that hot area.</li>
    <li> My 16-year old daughter suffers from severe dandruff.  How embarassing for a High School student.  We have tried various different products without much luck.  Selsun Blue was recommended to us by a friend.  She was extremely happy when we found it.  But . . . she missed having a conditioner that she could use.  We did find this once at a local shop but had been unsuccessful in finding it again.  We were so happy when we found this shampoo/conditioner was available on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe site. We are extremely happy!</li>
    <li> I was told by my 4 month old pediatrician to use selsun blue on my baby&#x27;s cradle cap.  it worked perfectly, the dry skin just wiped off.  obviously you have to be careful not to get it in the babies eyes but it did work great!</li>
    <li> Very effective great product i have been using it for 6 month. Never dry your hair. I just love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that stopped my dandruff.  I have tried others but the active ingredient in this one really helped.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s an ok shampoo, but the original formula works better for scalp conditions, which is why you buy in in the first place.  There are about six kinds of Selsun Blue, and I wasn&#x27;t sure which to buy, so I just picked one.  The generic that I found at the drug store worked better.  And the shampoo is not even blue!</li>
    <li> If you have problems with dandruff at all, this seems to be a great product.  It lasts for a while, even using it every day.</li>
    <li> It worked half way I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 weeks now. I tried using just a little because is a thick strong shampoo. My results have been just fine not what I expected but has decreased my dry sculp. Ah.. and you&#x27;ll probably need conditioning it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Got ride of my dandruff and left my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I will buy this product again. It does seem to be effective, but I just cannot get over the bad smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple products but so far this is the only one worked. It is a combination of shampoo and conditioner so no need to use any other conditioner after rinse the hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have an allergy on my scalp.  Doc gave anti itch cream and it works.  But we don&#x27;t know what the allergy is to.&lt;br /&gt;Been trying different anti itch shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.  This one smells much better than another one I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s the solution to my allergy.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended me this product, and let me tell you, this is the best purchase I made!!!! I&#x27;ve tried many dandruff shampoo, but this by far gave me the best results. I use this shampoo once a week and now my dandruff is all gone!!!!:):)Its a little pricey but I think its worth it. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> All that is running thru my head is the lyric &amp;#34;Selsun Blue, Selsun Blue, 24 hours a day. That&#x27;s why I bought!</li>
    <li> is a great product used many and none compare to selsun blue notice a difference the week after i washed my hair no flakes nothing ...don&#x27;t need to moisturized my hair all the time like i used too.. just a great product</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t had dandruff since. A great buy, I have purchased from this brand before.</li>
    <li> love love love love this. ive had dandruff pretty much my whole life, this stuff is the business! ive never used a dandruff shampoo(+conditioner) work like this one does. in the first week there was a very noticable difference</li>
    <li> It is in fact a bottle of selsun blue.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is Selsun Blue Shampoo, the real thing.  Just a little cheaper on Amazon</li>
    <li> Works well for a dry itchy scalp, breaking up and removing ear wax and relieving [face and arms] rosacea symptoms.</li>
    <li> Ive used other Selsun blue before this one. Its good for those that want one bottle that has 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. Same treatment everything in one. Im happy will buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Buy for my mom, and she said she is satisfied</li>
