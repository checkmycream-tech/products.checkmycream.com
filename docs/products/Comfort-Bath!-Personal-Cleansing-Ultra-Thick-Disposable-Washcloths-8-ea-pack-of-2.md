      <li>Used these after my surgery and I love how clean they made me feel since I couldn&#x27;t shower/</li>
      <li>In Keeping Him Fresh And Clean!</li>
      <li>I love this product, b/c the cloths contains a lot of moisture for very dry skin, and it&#x27;s good for a freshening up when you&#x27;re on the go in a hurry.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel clean at all, and needed to use another washcloth afterwards.</li>
      <li>I first used them years ago when I had a health issue could only shower with great difficulty.</li>
      <li>but there was none, only a refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>Someone told me about Comfort Bath and at that time was able to purchase it from a local drug store.  </li>
      <li>And there are times that I&#x27;m not going to leave the house, but I still want the feeling of a hot bath or shower.  </li>
      <li>These certainly did the job and helped me out when my hand was bandaged</li>
      <li>I found that the washcloths would do my whole body in the morning.  </li>
      <li>He thanks me each time he uses them.  </li>
      <li>I either got used to the scent or it dissipated in a reasonable time, however.</li>
      <li>I really like them they work well</li>
      <li>My husband REALLY likes this product.  </li>
      <li>I used a whole pack, as directed.</li>
      <li>have really, really helped.</li>
      <li>Pros: Large, moist, high quality cloth, really cleans and refreshes.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about a week after my workouts and I definitely feel clean and have no odor problems at all afterwards.</li>
      <li>Heated easily and were a good product the have when helping someone unable to take a traditional bath.</li>
      <li>If you find the sticky feeling a little more than you can handle before it dries then use a paper or cloth towel to wipe yourself again.</li>
      <li>I just had my 3rd spine surgery and couldn&#x27;t shower right away.</li>
      <li>but once it has dried off it feels fine.</li>
      <li>Each package comes with 8 cloths and they are pretty thick and do not look like they will tear easily, so please heed the warning not to toss these into the toilet.</li>
      <li>I was looking at several other full body washcloths and went with these based on reviews and price.</li>
      <li>The wipes are nice and thick, much thicker that other &amp;#34;adult wipes.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s why there is only 8 in a pack.</li>
      <li>These are extra big and extra thick and very wet to provide a comfortable real clean feeling in between baths.</li>
      <li>: A little pricey, but prolly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bathe for the first few days.</li>
      <li>It has plenty of solution on it that even after wiping your whole body down you feel that it did the job.</li>
      <li>Worked great for post op recovery when you are unable to bathe for a few days!</li>

    <li> These Comfort Bath Personal Cleansing Cloths Were Just What We Needed After My Husband&#x27;s Broken Ankle Kept Him Immobile For Some Weeks.  Between Showers, They Were Very Effective In Keeping Him Fresh And Clean!</li>
    <li> Worked great for post op recovery when you are unable to bathe for a few days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times. The wipes are nice and thick, much thicker that other &amp;#34;adult wipes.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s why there is only 8 in a pack. I first used them years ago when I had a health issue could only shower with great difficulty. I used a whole pack, as directed. Now I use them because, due to having very dry skin, I can only shower every other day. These are great for a quick refresher and I only use one or two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used them when I went to a family reunion where the conditions were &amp;#34;rustic.&amp;#34; I ran out because family members kept sneaking them!</li>
    <li> These are great for a sponge bath and being warmed up makes the job pleasant.</li>
    <li> Heated easily and were a good product the have when helping someone unable to take a traditional bath. The ability to warm and reheat was convenient.</li>
    <li> A few years ago had a surgery which prohibited me from taking a bath or shower.  Someone told me about Comfort Bath and at that time was able to purchase it from a local drug store.  I have bought this product ever since. Sometimes I just need to freshen up after a day at work and being able to pop these into the microwave is wonderful!  And there are times that I&#x27;m not going to leave the house, but I still want the feeling of a hot bath or shower.  I hope the manufacturer never stops making Comfort Bath.</li>
    <li> I love this product, b/c the cloths contains a lot of moisture for very dry skin, and it&#x27;s good for a freshening up when you&#x27;re on the go in a hurry. I use this for my patient.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve helped me a great deal.  I will order again.  I&#x27;m on oxygen, and have trouble with showering. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My husband REALLY likes this product.  I have to wrap his legs every 2 days and in that time he is unable to shower (which he hates) finding these cloths have really, really helped. He finds them easy to use and the result most pleasant.  He thanks me each time he uses them.  I thank the seller and Amazon, BIG TIME!</li>
    <li> My wife is recuping from  leg surgery and this is bridging the gap until a good bath or  shower is available.  We&#x27;ve used these previously while dry camping and it fits that also</li>
    <li> Used these after my surgery and I love how clean they made me feel since I couldn&#x27;t shower/bathe for the first few days. My biggest concern was residue but there was none, only a refreshing feeling. Each wipe is really thick as well so they held a lot of the cleansing solution, enough to cover all surfaces of my body.</li>
    <li> While I liked the size and thickness of these washcloths, the texture &#x3D; yuck. I didn&#x27;t feel clean at all, and needed to use another washcloth afterwards. I&#x27;d prefer to stick with using a boatload of unscented baby wipes.</li>
    <li> I was looking at several other full body washcloths and went with these based on reviews and price. Each package comes with 8 cloths and they are pretty thick and do not look like they will tear easily, so please heed the warning not to toss these into the toilet. There is no doubt it would be like trying to flush a towel.&lt;br /&gt;While the package says to use one washcloth per area (leg, arm, torso, back, etc) I find that for an after workout refresh one or maybe two tops is enough. The cloth is on the border between damp and wet. It has plenty of solution on it that even after wiping your whole body down you feel that it did the job. I put each washcloth in an individual ziplock bag so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out before I can use them but that is just my OCD kicking in.&lt;br /&gt;The only minor gripe that I have is that the solution feels soapy when you wipe yourself with it so it leaves you feeling a little sticky for a while but once it has dried off it feels fine. My recommendation from my experience to to wipe your sweat with a paper or cloth towel and then use the washcloth. If you find the sticky feeling a little more than you can handle before it dries then use a paper or cloth towel to wipe yourself again. I have used this for about a week after my workouts and I definitely feel clean and have no odor problems at all afterwards.</li>
    <li> these are actually really great, i&#x27;ve been using them a lot after hot yoga until i get home to have a shower. Also great for camping.recommended.</li>
    <li> These are for the tough situations.  And they do well because they don&#x27;t puncture with hardened finger nails.  It allows the bed ridden who prefer to bath themselves some privacy.</li>
    <li> Pros: Large, moist, high quality cloth, really cleans and refreshes. Great for lengthy air travel or extended work shifts.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A little pricey, but prolly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> I used this product as needed and was happy I order it ahead of time.</li>
    <li> These are extra big and extra thick and very wet to provide a comfortable real clean feeling in between baths. A must!</li>
    <li> Does the job without residue.  Bought these in case we couldn&#x27;t get the water system at a camp site to work.  The best plan &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I found that the washcloths would do my whole body in the morning.  The skin softeners do not bother my skin like soap and water would.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the bug out kit.</li>
    <li> I really like them they work well but are a little too expensive. I had to shop for something less expensive.</li>
    <li> I just had my 3rd spine surgery and couldn&#x27;t shower right away. These were great to help me feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> These certainly did the job and helped me out when my hand was bandaged and I couldn&#x27;t bathe, but I made the mistake of buying a product with a scent, but I personally don&#x27;t like at all, but that was MY mistake.  So, these did the job, I just don&#x27;t like scented products.  I either got used to the scent or it dissipated in a reasonable time, however.</li>
