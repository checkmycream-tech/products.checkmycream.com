<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping. Really nice color.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be too dark but after trying it, it is a very pretty color. Have enjoyed this shade.</li>
    <li> OPI never fails to please me.  This shade isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;ll wear every day, but will occasionally.  The color is in the palette of colors suitable to me.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own opinions, but I would recommend this product brand to anyone and everyone who uses nail color.  It&#x27;s the ONLY brand I use.  It goes on smoothly and stays beautifully.</li>
    <li> I always wear OPI polish and this color is amazing.  It makes me feel good to look at it.</li>
    <li> I chose this at a recent pedicure and loved it so much I immediately looked for it here on Amazon. So glad they had it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Meet Me on the Star Ferry is georgous, sparkely, shinny, purplish pink.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Love OPI Nail Polish! This color is a good one if you like more the lighter color...</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Arrived when expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My personal trainer called it \\&quot;purple\\&quot;, and while it&#x27;s in that color family (violet/purples) it&#x27;s a very muted, elegant but updated sort of version of that color. I don&#x27;t know what OPI officially calls this color, but I&#x27;d tag it a muted mid-tone purple-mauve/cool to neutral/metallic shimmer. It&#x27;s got a lovely finish that is sort of a metallic-meets-glimmer. It covers opaquely in two coats and is a discreet (ie, not loud) shade that&#x27;s great for winter, but will not be too dark for spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it is very durable. After a week and a half, it looks like I just put it on (and i haven&#x27;t retouched or added more top coat, lazy me). This color would suit a variety of skin tones, as I can see it being very lovely on pale ladies, and it looks good on me and I&#x27;m an NC44 via MAC classification (warm-toned, caramel colored Latina skin).</li>
    <li> I wear it all the time and constantly get asked what color it is. My manicure easily lasts a week too!</li>
    <li> Great Packaging, quick shipment, very good formula (hello it&#x27;s OPI!), &amp; authentic Opi definitely NOT a knock off I had a mani pedi at my local nail spa &amp; fell in love with this color, the bottle I received is a dead up match to what was on my nails. I have heard horror stories from FB about knock off or old polish but this seller is the real deal. Very professional &amp; my polishes were all sealed &amp; never been used. This color is beautiful &amp; if you work in a very professional environment as a financial analyst this muted lavender/mauve/grey is perfect. It&#x27;s what I call an all rounder. Meaning it can be worn year round &amp; it works like a neutral because it can be worn with nearly  any color but still gives you a beautiful color with a lovely understated shimmer you normally couldn&#x27;t wear in such a formal environ. I love the color it looks like a darker purple online &amp; I honestly got it to use for nail art making flowers (I prefer polish as my preferred medium). But it looks wonderful on by itself. Its much lighter but depending on the amount of coats you use could become darker. I used very thin coats &amp; it was opaque in 2. You could probably get by with one thick coat or go to a more dark hue with 3 or four just be sure to let each coat dry throughly before applying the next one. OPI is the best product it has a great formula, &amp; stays on longer than any other polish in this price range. I really thought the seller&#x27;s pricing was competitive &amp; they had at large selection of colors many hard to find ones too. I will Definitely order from this seller again &amp; have already recommended them to many family members &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for the Fall months!</li>
    <li> I love this color! The polish itself goes on smooth and lasts a long time whithout chipping. A great price too!</li>
    <li> Dark but pretty...I think I am just a little too old for it.  All OPI colors are nice.  Haven&#x27;t found one yet I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> It is more purple than the picture shows.  It&#x27;s a fun color though!</li>
    <li> love the title- as that is where i went to school for the summer&lt;br /&gt;great fall/winter color. sincerely kml</li>
    <li> First of all, there is no other polish like OPI. My manicurist introduced me to the product, and this particular color is heavenly! I use it on my toenails. It looks especially fabulous this time of year when I have a tan. I could talk for days about how much I love this color. There is nothing else quite like it, so I hope OPI plans on keeping it around for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> As with all OPI polishes, the polish wears very well and doesn&#x27;t chip.  Color is a nice occasional change from the popular dark colors.</li>
    <li> I love the color very shiny and opi is always excellent stays fresh and stays on for a least a week with out chipping i do a lot of dishes by hand .Or it probably would stay on long .Will recommend this to all my friends</li>
    <li> I love this color! The polish itself goes on smooth and lasts a long time without chipping. A great price too!</li>
    <li> I get professional manicures every 2 weeks and have used this product repeatedly, with the salon polish lasting the full two weeks.  I took each of the 3 bottles separately for my manicures.  In each case, the polish was thicker than normal.  Within the first week, the polish started chipping and peeling.  The seller refused to take back the defective product which was more than likely old, citing it was flammable.  They were able to send it to me; however, for this phony reason, they could not have me return it.  Will never purchase again from NewvoBeauty!</li>
    <li> I really like the color and the subtle shimmer.  To me the picture captures the color very well.  It was also easy to apply, which is good, because I am bad at putting on polish.</li>
    <li> Love the color It is one of my favorite . I don&#x27;t use it as much in the winter but I love it</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  The color is beautiful, elegant, and sexy.  A must have for your nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this color looks on my nails. Doesn&#x27;t match the color shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love OPI: Lacquer NLH49 Meet Me On the Star Ferry, 0.5 oz,. Have been using this shade for years. Had a difficult time finding it.</li>
    <li> Perfectly good nail varnish</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how this color looks in reality. it is not as pictured despite a few coats. not a good buy</li>
    <li> I loved this color so much, I used it for my engagement photos.  It went nicely with three outfits changes.</li>
    <li> Perfect color got this for my toes</li>
    <li> Pretty color that looks plummy/light purple in some lights, tan/brown in others.  Nice amount of sparkle.</li>
    <li> I love this color - it is the first glitter nail polish that you can use by itself with excellent coverage and lasts</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, Opi makes really nice nail polish colors. I am tempted to keep it but it&#x27;s a part of my gift sets</li>
    <li> Gorg-a-mous! Love the shade. Photos are pretty true to the color. Love how Opi glides on and lasts longer than most other brands. I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;Opi girl&amp;#34; for sure now!</li>
    <li> Great color, some sparkle and dimension. Love OPI products. Fast shipping. Got as a gift, but ordered 2 so I could have one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really a color I normally wear, it&#x27;s pretty though. I thought it would Be less brown, and it&#x27;s kinda goopy, like it is old. I do like how it has a little bit of glitter, not a lot, very slight, so you get a little sparkle. I&#x27;m going to put a picture up soon.. I did put on a gold glitter over my ring finger.</li>
    <li> I have worn this color for weeks now. I love pink and purple shades. This color is a mix of both. I going to order 2 more bottles. I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
    <li> I love the OPI colors, this is the best nail polish.</li>
    <li> I thought this looked real nice on the model and. The color I got was a bit off from this picture and it really isn&#x27;t a great color, I&#x27;ve o ly used it a couple times. And there it sits.</li>
    <li> Really like this color. It&#x27;s kind of a metallic lavender and suites my tastes of neutral colors while kicking it up a notch. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> This polish was delivered with no problem and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  The polish was thicker, but went on with no problem.  The color was dull and flat and mauve is not pretty when dull and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the polish off after two days--never done that before with OPI.  I will keep (not worth the trouble returning)and probably mix with some other polish, and hopefully get some shimmer.</li>
    <li> New color for me, LOVE IT.  Quick SERVICE, GOOD PRICE, PRETTY POLISH.  Happy, HAPPY, HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Definitely a go to neutral when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing pinks. Looks great with nearly anything. I heartily recommend for upper nails.</li>
    <li> worst o.p.i polish i own.  from the second i got this polish it&#x27;s been a love hate situation.&lt;br /&gt;first of all it chips super fast, as a o.p.i junkie this is the one polish out of that just doesn&#x27;t wanna stay on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;the color is decent.&lt;br /&gt;clumps up fast.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY LADIES.</li>
    <li> An old favorite - stocking up because not available locally anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish beautiful color</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color - it is one that goes with everything. I plan on ordering myself another bottle soon. :)</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous.  Thde polish stays on, &amp; is so attractive on your nails. I just OPI.  It is a quality nail pilish.  Deffinately reccommend it.</li>
    <li> Not bad, a bit light, and will do.</li>
    <li> This actually arrived quickly than I thought, but a very, very pretty color; can&#x27;t wait to try it :)</li>
    <li> Love this color - it looks just like the picture.  This is a color that will go with anything and should be easy to add any time you&#x27;re wondering what color to use today.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> LOVE this beautiful OPI shade! Meet Me on the Star Ferry is a gorgeous shimmering mauve purple color. It goes beautifully with my skintone and like all OPI polishes, the formula is excellent and long lasting. One of my absolute favorites. I&#x27;m so glad I snagged it!</li>
    <li> fine,arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the color I expect ....</li>
    <li> Nice on my toes. Stays on for weeks w/ topcoat.Nice purple/mauve color.I prefer it on my toes rather than nails.</li>
    <li> I love this shade.  I usually go darker colors since I wear a lot of black, but this is even better.  It is a very subtle shade &amp; has a lot of sparkle you just can&#x27;t see in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It also lasts a  good  5 or more days, depending on how hard you are on your hhands.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this nail polish. It is prettier in person than in pictures. The only downside is that it chips fairly easily.</li>
    <li> very nice on finger nails. my girl friend love the color specially on winter. i can rate this with five stars</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color. It&#x27;s more purple than the picture shows, but the gold glitter is beautiful and really makes the nail polish stand out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the color! It almost goes with anything that you&#x27;re wearing.  The only problem is: like most OPI nail polishes, it doesn&#x27;t last long  (maybe 1 or 2 days) and I have to touch it up . If you could add glycol to your polish, it would last a lot longer!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this color because it looks so pretty in the photo. However, it is much darker, more brown than shown. Not bad for a winter color. It goes on smooth and with good coverage, as I find almost all OPI colors do.</li>
    <li> Really dynamic color, great for the winter. Excited to add this to my collection, I&#x27;m sure it will be a quick go-to. Freaky fast shipping :-)</li>
    <li> but the bottle must have been an old bottle because the color was clumping and OPI doesn&#x27;t clump unless it&#x27;s very old.</li>
    <li> Beautifully color. Another person mentioned plum/mauve color which perfectly describes nail polish color. Definitely read the reviews because the color that is in the picture look more sparkly dark brown which I had hopped for, but satisfied with what I received too.</li>
    <li> I was pleased when the color arrived and definitely would recommend this to anyone. The price was reasonable and the shipping was swift. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my toes and fingers :)</li>
    <li> I was hoping for and expecting more of a brown. This purple color has become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail polish. I think it lasts much longer than any other nail polish. This color is a very soft color. Does need more than one coat to look like the picture.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the staying power of this nail polish. Just have to get my nails stronger as they still keep breaking!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and with no hassle but since it was an older color I was a bit disappointed to find it had thickened and wouldn&#x27;t apply to my nails nicely. It was like spreading frosting. I had to go out and purchase some Polish Thinner to get the consistency back to what it should be. Once i added thinner though, it went on like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful unusual shimmer/frost. Indoors it looks more dark pinkish purple, outdoor/natural sunlight it looks more like a true purple mauve with gold shimmer threaded through it. It has bits of glitter that disappear until you are in sunlight and then it sparkles. I really like the color and I add a coat of glitter to it so it sparkles indoors too.</li>
    <li> I have several colors of the OPI nail polish and you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of it.</li>
    <li> Love all the OPI nail polish es.  They go on great, and hold up to wear.  Use this brand all the time.</li>
    <li> This was the polish that was used with my last pedicure. This was a perfect match, and didn&#x27;t cost as much as I would have had to pay in a store.</li>
    <li> This is a great color.  It&#x27;s a little more muted in person, but it might get darker if you add another coat.  I did two coats as I usually do.  It is a pretty color...very feminine.  I think this color will look great on everyone.  I&#x27;m very fair and it looks great with my skin.  I think it&#x27;s a great buy for anyone.</li>
    <li> like this color...not too pink and not too dark.</li>
    <li> I like this color and OPI is a great nail polish.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with any of the OPI products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Wearing it now!!!!!!!! LOTS of compliments, good Fall transition color!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is just a perfect pinky metallic color.  I love looking at my nails when I have this nail polish on.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color. Love it</li>
    <li> Nice; love OPI. Stays on longer and colors stay true. Good color choices. Have tried other brands but just do not compare with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Love this brand.  Lasts.  Stays on very well.  Like the soft metallic finish that is just right.</li>
    <li> I do not like being REQUIRED to fill in this field.  If I have to continue to do this on all my purchases they will not get ratings!</li>
