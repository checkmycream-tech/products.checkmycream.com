      <li>Love this product along with the Conditioner, and Primer!</li>
      <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this BB shampoo,  I do use two Bumble and Bumble products that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>It would be good for fine hair as well</li>
      <li>I like Shea Moisture products better.  </li>
      <li>They are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they leave my hair gloriously shiny and moisturized and they&#x27;re $11 a bottle!  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found another line that&#x27;s a fraction of the price and works phenomenally well.  </li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased by the results as I am.  </li>
      <li>I love all Bumble &amp; Bumble products and this&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
      <li>Why should I spend more?  </li>
      <li>Smells great, leaves my hair manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at Sephora and loved it so much that I ordered it on Amazon</li>
      <li>Once a week it washes away all traces of styling products and hairspray and leaves my hair light and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light and not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>And SM products are available at Sally&#x27;s, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Target.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light and not at all</li>
      <li>Using the products I&#x27;ve mentioned has given me a good hair day nearly every day, something unheard of for me.  </li>
      <li>Almost as good as the Nexxus is Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which is completely unlike their regular light hold formula.  </li>
      <li>I especially love the raw shea butter formula.  </li>
      <li>Ok shampoo but not any more effective than argan oil shampoo or other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
      <li>For me, it was nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I have a hall closet full of do nothing hair products that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  </li>

      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the sellers on Amazon ask a fair amount for shipping, which sucks.  </li>
      <li>Raw shampoo is a different animal and although it&#x27;s sulfate free (and therefore color safe) it takes about 2 or 3 uses for the hair and scalp to respond.  </li>
      <li>I also love the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a dupe for the DIA spray, but so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>

      <li>When I&#x27;m short on cash, I&#x27;ll use Smooth Criminal primer, available at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much product, which means this product will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It gives invisible hold that looks natural and yet it holds my hair even into the next day.  </li>

    <li> This is a gift for my wife.  She LOVES this.  Also, I received this quickly with no issues</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Sephora and loved it so much that I ordered it on Amazon and it is NOT the same product at all!  It neither felt or smelled the same.  The same goes for the conditioner I got.  I hope to return it.</li>
    <li> Love this product along with the Conditioner, and Primer! Smells great, leaves my hair manageable and soft. One of three shampoos i use.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at Sephora and ended up returning it.  For me, it was nothing special.  I like Shea Moisture products better.  They are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they leave my hair gloriously shiny and moisturized and they&#x27;re $11 a bottle!  The shampoos, conditioners and masks are all good.  I especially love the raw shea butter formula.  Raw shampoo is a different animal and although it&#x27;s sulfate free (and therefore color safe) it takes about 2 or 3 uses for the hair and scalp to respond.  I found this to be the case and when my hair responded after the initial period, it was fantastic!!  I use the raw shea butter mask, as well as the 10 in 1 formula, for 5 minutes in the shower and once a week for 45 minutes with a heat cap.  I also love the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  Once a week it washes away all traces of styling products and hairspray and leaves my hair light and bouncy.  It smells divine, really clean and fresh.  All the SM products I&#x27;ve tried have lived up to their promises and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.  The shampoos lather well and the conditioners do an excellent job for any hair type. Although I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this BB shampoo,  I do use two Bumble and Bumble products that I can&#x27;t live without. First is the Invisible Oil Primer, which leaves my hair really shiny, frizz free and adds thermal protection.  It&#x27;s really light and not at all greasy.  It would be good for fine hair as well (my hair is medium in texture and slightly wavy). I spray it on damp hair and let it dry overnight. Also, Does It All styling spray is awesome and really holds my hard-to-hold hair when I use it on dry hair with a curling iron to create loose waves.  It&#x27;s really light and not at all sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t flake.  I don&#x27;t use it as a hairspray because it&#x27;s so expensive and I try my best to conserve it. Instead, I use Nexxus Comb Thru flexible hold hairspray.  It gives invisible hold that looks natural and yet it holds my hair even into the next day.  If I need to touch up my waves the second day, I simply brush it out, recurl my hair (adding a little DIA styling spray) and then respray it with the hairspray.  Almost as good as the Nexxus is Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which is completely unlike their regular light hold formula.  And it&#x27;s about $6 in the drugstore.  I also like Toni and Guy&#x27;s flexible hold hairspray, which works equally well.  The two BB products I&#x27;ve mentioned are expensive, $28 for the DIA spray and the same for the primer.  When I&#x27;m short on cash, I&#x27;ll use Smooth Criminal primer, available at Sally&#x27;s.  It also curbs frizz, leaves my hair shiny and provides thermal protection and costs about $7.  I&#x27;m still looking for a dupe for the DIA spray, but so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  I buy my BB products at Sephora (where you can return them if you don&#x27;t like them, which I did with this shampoo).  I&#x27;ve noticed the sellers on Amazon ask a fair amount for shipping, which sucks.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like this BB shampoo.  It&#x27;s just not all that great.  However, I&#x27;ve found another line that&#x27;s a fraction of the price and works phenomenally well.  Why should I spend more?  Sometimes high end hair products don&#x27;t work any better than their low end counterparts.  And although Shea Moisture isn&#x27;t cheap, it isn&#x27;t expensive either.  And SM products are available at Sally&#x27;s, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Target.  However, none of these stores carry the entire SM line and neither does Amazon.  My suggestion is that you try SM before buying this BB shampoo.  There&#x27;s certainly a SM formula that will work for you and all their shampoos and such are sulfate free.  I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased by the results as I am.  Using the products I&#x27;ve mentioned has given me a good hair day nearly every day, something unheard of for me.  My hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon.  And my hair color glows!  Instead of spending money on shampoo and conditioner, spend money on styling products.  I&#x27;ve found that high end stylers are generally better.

    <li> Works great on my thick curly frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Great product for my curly friz prone hair.</li>
    <li> Didnt make my dry, strawlike hair any softer or silkier. Actually felt a little bit as though it was stripping. Had to use extra conditioner to make hair even combable after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair a little dry but the conditioner makes up for it.</li>
    <li> Ok shampoo but not any more effective than argan oil shampoo or other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
    <li> smells great and works its amazing</li>
    <li> The wife loves it and Timely arrival too.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
    <li> The best of B&amp;B.  Stick with the shampoo conditioner and primer.  The oil in this line is worthless.  Try Kendi Bamboo oil.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! Amazon suggested it and I went with it. Thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> A good choice if you have dry, over processed hair.  I love all Bumble &amp; Bumble products and this&lt;br /&gt;was a great find!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good! Price... Not so much. It&#x27;s cheaper elsewhere,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to B&amp;B, and I&#x27;m now a fan.  I use all the Invisible Oil product, and none wear your hair down.  You don&#x27;t need much product, which means this product will last a long time.  The shampoo smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated hair, and it&#x27;s exposed to well water on a daily basis.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Expensive so only got 4 stars but it really works. Smells great and tames the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this....but can only use it once in awhile - stick with the conditioner on dry thirsty ends and the invisible oil for blowdrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo is soooo heavy and greasy! my stylist has this at her (expensive! B&amp;b!) salon, and agrees that the shampoo is just TOO much oil and heaviness. although she loves the conditioner like I do! stick with that, forget this shampoo.</li>
