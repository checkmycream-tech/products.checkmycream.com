<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this mirror and can&#x27;t imagine going without it ever! Lighting is plenty, 10x magnifying is amazing for applying makeup and spotting imperfections!  My husband was able to hardwire to the wall, omitting  the cord which is a huge plus.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 18 months now, use it daily and haven&#x27;t had to replace the bulb.  I only came back to review several of my purchases since I value product reviews myself.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these mirrors after shopping a little locally and browsing the available inventory online at Amazon.  I made my selection based on the following:  Mirror size as I wanted something 10\\&quot; or more.  Lighting, I was looking for a mirror with good illumination.  Optical quality and magnification power,  I was looking for a mirror with clear and non distorted optics and magnification of at least 10x.  Reviews and feedback, I consider products that have decent and reasonable customer reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the mirrors.  I offer the following comments to anyone considering purchasing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mounting the mirrors the first condsideration was to mount them in a position where they would be the most user friendly for us to use everyday. If that paticular spot happens to line up with a wall stud and close to an electrical outlet, great if not consider using some good hollow wall anchors or molly bolts.  The mounting hardware included with the mirrors is not adequate in my opionin.  The electrical cords are long, which is a good thing if you need to reach a distant outlet and a not so good thing if you don&#x27;t. I happened to have electrical outlets close by each mounting spot, so I shortend the cords to the length I needed.  If you have never shortend a cord before it can be a little tricky.  You&#x27;ll need some hand tools, wire stippers and connectors.  The hardest part of making the cord shorter is removing and reinserting the plastic cord retainer in the mounting base. You could cut the plug end off and wire on a new plug to a shorter cord, but its not as clean and you need to purchase a new plug.  The illumination on the high setting and the mirror optics are decent.  The mirror swivels and there is a phillips head screw in the bottom of the mount whih can made tighter or looser to get the desired swivel effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 30 minutes to unpack, shorten the cords and mount 2 mirrors and clean up.  I had everyting I needed on hand already though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, like everything else, might make you wonder why its so pricy. Its made in China for a Canadian based company, both of which are not known for paying a lot in manufacturing materials and wages and each have lucrative trade agreements with the U.S.  In fairness these types of products must be U.L. or ETL tested and listed, which this one is.  These listings don&#x27;t come cheap.  But still someone is pocketing a decent a profit.</li>
    <li> This mirror was everything i was looking for and more! It works great and the magnification is perfect. The lighting could be a tad brighter but, all in all, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I am little disappointed with this product because you have to be very close up for it to work and also the lights aren&#x27;t very bright. It was easy to mount on the wall.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present and procrastinated installing it. Put it in last month. It works great, and was very easy to install.</li>
    <li> Cannot wall mount directly to an electrical box</li>
    <li> Good quality finish.  It was easy to install and my wife loves it.  She wishes the magnification wasn&#x27;t so strong (10X) which is the only complaint but that&#x27;s more a personal choice I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great but the metal arm is not welded correctly to the center adjustment joint.  It fell apart after only 4 months of mild use and I am no longer allowed to return it.  Buy another brand-I totally got ripped off!</li>
    <li> The light should be brighter.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of wall mount mirrors before I selected this one. And I read a lot of reviews so I hope this review is helpful to someone.&lt;br /&gt;First - my near vision is +275. So I can not pluck eyebrows, put on makeup or pretty much can&#x27;t do anything unless my mirror is magnified - a lot. This particular mirror is 10x magnified. If I could have found a 12x or 15x magnified  with all the features of this one, I would have chosen the stronger one. But I could not find one so I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to wear magnifying glasses when plucking eyebrows etc..., but I can apply eye makeup OK with the mirror. I am not saying that this is problem with mirror. I just wanted you to have some idea of how well a 10x magnified mirror works if you have a strong near prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is good. It has two light levels. The low light is a little dim for me so I always use the higher setting which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;It swivels in every direction - which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I love the mirror. I know I said I still have trouble seeing in this mirror but I don&#x27;t think they make a stronger mirror like this, so I am so happy to have this one.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an extra bulb - which I haven&#x27;t had to use yet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s big and sticks out from the wall some, but not really bad. Anyway, I don&#x27;t care. Since it&#x27;s the only way I can see, I except it for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I think the big problem most people have with these mirrors&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about two months now and I am very happy with this mirror!</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror.  Quality product.  Looks Nice. Works well. Light is bright. Everyone that uses my bathroom also checks out the mirror and now I even have people asking me if I have tweezers or scissors.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this mirror, my husband mounted it with ease. and he likes it to trim his mustache. We are very pleased with this purchse, it arrived quickly also.</li>
    <li> Great product that was easy to install for a guy handy with tools. The product would have had a five star rating but the replacement bud filament was broken.</li>
    <li> This is one hulking piece of equipment!  It&#x27;s hard to believe that the technology isn&#x27;t there yet to make a lighted mirror that&#x27;s less than 3 inches thick.  It&#x27;s a very imposing presence on my bathroom wall, but it certainly does the job that it&#x27;s intended to do.  Stray eyebrows and nose hairs (yuck!) don&#x27;t have a chance to hide from 10x magnification, so I know my personal grooming has been much improved. Installation was not difficult and the mirror arrived in perfect condition and in a reasonable amount of time.  It would be great if it were just a litle more sleek looking.</li>
    <li> Very well built  and high quality mirror. Looking great on the wall. Easy access to replace a light bulb plus an extra bulb is included. Keeps a turning angle.</li>
    <li> not as bright as I was hoping.  magnifying mirror is great</li>
    <li> Seem to be an amazing product. Still not use but open and see it.&lt;br /&gt;Arrive on time.</li>
    <li> These are awesome mirrors</li>
    <li> The light was inadequate</li>
    <li> now i don&#x27;t have to hold a mirror to apply makeup.  i can use both hands when needed.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised.  The light is bright enough for easy use.  The installation was rather easy.  Sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly as advertised. I bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works awesome. My wife loves this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the money! A little hard to move but as for now works great!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this product again looked a lot of please this is best deal..</li>
    <li> Very heavy and difficult to mount on sheetrock/wallboard, as it tends to rotate when extended.  The light worked initially, but quit working on the second day.  Magnification is good, but these other faults suggest I could have done better with another product.</li>
    <li> The hinges are very stiff on this mirror - worries me that if it isn&#x27;t mounted into a stud, it could pull the attached drywall apart.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to have any means of loosening the hinges either.  If not for that, it is exactly as advertised and works well.</li>
    <li> . . . now she can spend even MORE time plucking -- whatever. She&#x27;s very picky. Her requirements were 1) that it be at least 10x (why, I have no idea), and 2) it had to be lighted. DONE! Plus, I REALLY impressed her when I hardwired it to the adjacent outlet, which eliminated an unsightly cord. I took the back of the base off, cut off the cord (she had to look away), drilled a (huge) hole in the sheetrock, and then spent 10 drunken moments trying to fish the wire to the nearby outlet. It was a SNAP! I&#x27;m a freakin&#x27; hero!</li>
    <li> Does what I was hoping for- magnification is strong. Light has two settings but the low setting doesn&#x27;t do much. Corded- cord is too long. Width of mirror is not very &#x27;subtle&#x27;, makes it a real &#x27;stand-out&#x27;. Overall good purchase so far. Only have had it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Light is not bright enough, needs a higher watt bulb. Can&#x27;t see so the light is useless for what it is intended for.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I wish i would have ordered a 5 X instead of 10 X.  But I definitely love this mirror.  Don&#x27;t need my glasses anymore to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror&lt;br /&gt;Larger then I expected&lt;br /&gt;But very good quality</li>
    <li> Got this mirror in no time at all and its just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was able to install it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;He is using it too now. :-(&lt;br /&gt;Good Magnification.. the light could be brighter but I think&lt;br /&gt;you could change the bulb.</li>
    <li> The magnification is great.  The lighting is great.  I use it every day and it is very sturdy and great quality.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very Good quality! The mirror is bigger than I thought it would be. I&#x27;m sure my daughter will love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The light on the mirror was not good. When comparing magnification to our existing (non-light) wall mirror, the new mirror reflection looked distorted, maybe due to front lighting. Other products costing $200+ may provide better lighting and reflection.</li>
    <li> Even though the box said there were mounting instructions inside, there wasn&#x27;t. It took a little while to figure out that you have to remove the back plate to mount it. After that it was very simple!</li>
    <li> It fits my needs for a close-up makeup mirror mounted on the wall to conserve counter space amd additional lighting.</li>
    <li> There are two light setting, however neither are very bright.  The mirror is on a base which resembles a drum.  Heavy and awkward&lt;br /&gt;to move.</li>
    <li> This is a great make-up mirror. I have not installed it yet in our RV, but shortly. I am excited to have found just what I needed. Thank you. Karen</li>
    <li> MY WIFE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT. IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL  I JUST ADDED A CORD COVER TO HIDE THE CORD.</li>
    <li> I like it - but wish the lights were brighter, and that the swivel arm was easier to move.  It magnifies well, and helps with flawless make-up application.</li>
    <li> I got the mirror on time but when I opened it up it was cracked. ... such a disappointment. ..</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a mirror like we always see in nice hotels. We bought one from Brookstone, but it was not sturdy. This one is the real deal -- very heavy, super high quality, 10x mirror is incredible to look into. The light has two settings. If you have to mount this on drywall, go to Home Depot and get better anchors or other hangers than the ones they give you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m adding this magnifying mirror to my wish list.  We used one at a friend cottage and I&#x27;m now wondering how we can live without  a magnifying mirror in our home.</li>
    <li> The first one was I got was  defective and frozen at one of the hinges. That didn&#x27;t work out so I sent it back with NO HASSLES! The second one was fine and I&#x27;m still loving it. I can&#x27;t even look in the regular mirror to put my makeup on anymore cause this one you can see every little thing on your face so clear.  I&#x27;m 56 and have to use readers for everything so with this I don&#x27;t have to worry that when I go out people will see makeup lines and uneven eyeliner on me, worse yet an unsightly black hair that&#x27;s an Inch long under my chin. The kind that just sneak up on you. Well worth the money. I l&#x27;ve seen the same one at Bed Bath and Beyond for way more!!</li>
    <li> I really like the mirror, it is heavy so make sure it is properly mounted on a stud.  I just received it so have not used it much yet, but it looks great with all the chrome that I have in my bathroom. I very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> hard to see the side of the head. good for women makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but the lighting is worthless.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just beautiful, easy to install and is my best friend when it comes to applying my make up. It tucks away flat against the wall when not in use. As we women age it becomes difficult to see in a regular mirror to apply, especially, your eye make up. This solved the problem and now I am confident when leaving the house for work each day that my make up is applied perfectly where I want it. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> For over 10 years I used the 5X lighted mirror and liked it a lot, but finally my eyes needed more magnification.  This 10X mirror is made even better than my last one and you can see every pore on your face!  Now I don&#x27;t have a bit of trouble putting on my make-up.  Yes, its a lot of money, but it&#x27;s a great product and you&#x27;ll use it for years and years.</li>
    <li> This mirror is good quality and is the perfect addition to any great bathroom.  My only wish is they made one with 15X magnification.  Ruth McLaughlin</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a lot of money on any product, but I have been looking for a good mirror forever! I am 62 years old and I couldn&#x27;t see well without my glasses; unfortunately it&#x27;s not possible to do my make up and makeover without my eyeglasses. I checked out the cheaper ones, even went to IKEA, I&#x27;m glad I did because even with 5x magnification, I can&#x27;t see my face clearly in the mirror! I can even \\&quot;shape\\&quot; my eyebrows now! The lighting is very, very good! It&#x27;s a plug in, and the mirror is very sturdy, fits well on the wall. Because of its size, the mirror comes out about 1 inch from the wall, but it looks expensive and nice it doesn&#x27;t look bad on the wall at all. The mirror came with a (light) bulb replacement, but the filament on the bulb is broken, and I don&#x27;t know if it came damaged already or if it is caused by jarring during the shipping.I was going to ask for a replacement but for the price (less than $3.00), it&#x27;s not worth the hassle. Though a little more expensive, this is one product that&#x27;s worth the price! The packaging was good, no dents nor cracks on the merchandise. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! My wife and I stayed at a swanky hotel for a wedding and they had something like this in the bathrooms. She immediately fell in love with it and said that she had to have one for home. I did some searching, and found this mirror to fit the bill of what she wanted. It has a higher magnification that most of the other mirrors. There are two brightness settings that really help, you could probably get away without the light if the room it is used in is well lit. The mirror is made of, what I can tell, high quality glass with a frosted glass ring for the light to come through. I mounted it in our bathroom wall, and it is very solid. It uses regular candelabra lights, I don&#x27;t know if CFL will works.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these mirrors that I have purchased for members of my extended family - although this is the first I purchased from Amazon. Each has been well received with many positive comments. They are each in daily use by all the members of each family. Amazon service is excellent and there is now shipping to Canada.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror in August 2011.  At first I was very impressed with this item. The only issue that I had was that it did get a little too hot to the touch.  That was not really a problem since I only used it when applying makeup.  It is now December 2011 and the silver on the inside of the mirror is coming off.  With the mirror lit, a very, very bright spot comes in through the area that has peeled off.  It is to the point now that I cannot use it as a lighted mirror due to the intense light coming through.  I would return it if I could, however I missed the deadline to make a return.  In my opinion, this mirror was too expensive to not be able to use it as intended so soon.</li>
    <li> My wife has wanted one of these for a long time. This one is well made, easy to install, and works great. She is ecstatci!</li>
    <li> This product was just what my wife was looking for. The price was fair and it was easy to install.</li>
    <li> 10x magnification is great, however mirror is very thick. Really only the magnification side is necessary.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as I had hoped!</li>
    <li> We had our bathroom redone about 11 to 12 years ago an I wanted a lot of lights put in. But my husband said the 2 resesst lights over my Jacuzzi an around my mirror I have about 5 glob lights around the mirror. Thats it. My husband promised me a better a lighting system . So I&#x27;m looking at this one. I hope this is the one that I will purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have to put my face very close to see and lighting is not enough. I wish I can put LED light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I find costco have 8x mirror for $20. I paid 4 times price for this 10x.</li>
    <li> wanted a chrome 10X to hardwire in - this wasn&#x27;t designed for that but, was able to hardwire with a couple minor changes -&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s happy!!! happy wife - happy me!!!</li>
    <li> Best mirror ever! Great for putting make-up on &amp; seeing EVERYTHING on your face!</li>
    <li> This was an easy install.  The only thing is the cord is a bit long.  I had to open it up and shorten the cord.  If you are a little bit handy you should be able to install this mirror.  Other than that its a no brainer. It seems to be well made.  I only wish that the light were a bit brighter.  It has two brightness levels, even so the highest level really isn&#x27;t that bright.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount, but recommend stronger hardware than that included. My wife just loves the ability to put on make up with good light and not having to lean in to a wall-mounted mirror.</li>
    <li> Got this for myself, but everyone else uses it more than me. lol  Good quality . Light could be brighter but still glad i got it. Have to get really close for the magnification side, but it&#x27;s amazing all you can see so close up.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this mirror. Mounted easy and has a two levels of light and two mirrors</li>
    <li> This mirror certainly had good magnification.  I was surprised and disappointed with the bulky size of it.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize what it took to house the light mechanism.  I returned it as it took up too much space and was far too bulky.</li>
    <li> My wife LUVs it, uses it every day / Should have bought a long time ago / A Very Happy Customer</li>
    <li> Was looking for something well made and solid and this was great. Love the magnification on the other side. Lighting is good and was pretty easy to hang. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I thought and takes more space on the wall, but it swings out easily and the magnification and lighting help a lot with makeup application.</li>
    <li> Buying a second one for our other bathroom.  Sturdy, good quality mirror and very nice light.</li>
    <li> i always wanted a shaving mirror that I could swing close to my face as I shaved, but generally they were always to costly for the benefit received. Now comes the Danielle lighted mirror. It was fairly priced, is a well built item (quality constructed) and has a two level lighted ring (I always use the high setting). It was easy to install - I elected to cut off the plug and wire it directly to the back of an electric outlet - it made a much cleaner installation. The only real drawback is the second side mirror which has a magnified image - the 10X resolution is too much; it is extremely hard to focus on the image of your face - 6x or 8x would be much better - this is the sole reason for not giving the product a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> It was to heavy ,took a lot to get it hung up.  The cord is to long for where our outlets are.</li>
    <li> Nice large size, great circuline light, and 10x magnification mirror is great. Chrome fixture looks terrific and was easy to install. Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t swivel as much as I would like.</li>
    <li> This Light works perfectly in our space and looks nice and not obtrusive.  It had all of the necessary screws and such to hang and works well.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a Christmas present. She&#x27;s been using it for almost a month and says it&#x27;s a dream. I did a few makeup sessions on it and am hooked as well, will probably buy it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the mirror works too well! The times I&#x27;ve snuck into her bathroom I spend much more time doing my makeup than I used to simply because it&#x27;s fascinating to be able to see such great detail, especially when the natural light is turned on. Has a beautiful silver finish that goes great with her bathroom.</li>
    <li> I tried to find one at Costco, Bed &amp; Beyond, Walmart, Target, etc....finally realized I had to shop online to get what I was looking for. Was nervous about not being able to try it out before purchase.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week but so far seems to be everything I needed.  Time will tell. Everyone that sees it, loves it and wants one of their own. No way I could have mounted it myself, but hubby was able to do it and reinforced the mounting by first mounting a vertical wood base. I was concerned that the mirror would look too big, bulky, commercial but it looks fine.  A MONTH LATER: Love it. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  Husband also uses it to shave.</li>
    <li> I think it was too much magnification for me.  It was blurry until you got really close and by that time your eyes started to cross and it would give you a headache.</li>
    <li> I searched long and hard for a quality mirror that had 10X magnification. I knew I&#x27;d have to paid a good price for it. This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I wanted to stop stooping over to put on my makeup. I am having back problems, and I figured a wall-mounted model would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stores did not have wall-mounted models in a shiny chrome, and that was one of my criteria. We got it promptly, my husband installed it (although we couldn&#x27;t locate it in a stud, he used moly bolts to put it up) and it works great! It is thick, because of the light inside, which is nice and bright, and the fact that it has both a regular and a magnification side. I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I live in an RV and needed a makeup mirror that didn&#x27;t take up too much space. This is perfect! Very well made and has a great range of motion. I really have loved it!</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. The 10X magnification is more than adequate and actually causes one to notice too many imperfections.</li>
    <li> Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;Looks good in the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;not too big, not too small.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product&lt;br /&gt;Client is very happy with it</li>
    <li> A great addition to my bathroom.  I only use the light when I&#x27;m tweezing, as other reviewers have said the light can eventually ruin the mirror.  My friend who also is over age 50 asked me the other day where I bought it.  My answer was &amp;#34;Amazon of course.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great price, great deal!</li>
    <li> I love my mirror and have no complaints other than... do you really want to see yourself at 10x magnifications? It can be shocking! Really though the mirror is great and the quality is good. I was able to shorten the cord easily so I didn&#x27;t have a big bunch of extra cord hanging near the bathroom sink. Some complain about the light being weak but I don&#x27;t think it is a problem in a normal lighted bathroom.  purchased in March 2013 now its Aug 2016... still love this mirror. Light still good after daily usage! Zero complaints</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. Recipient was quite pleased and said it was exactly what she had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This is a really Great product! It is easy to mount and easy to convert to hard wire so as not to have a visible cord to consume limited outlet accessibility.My wife has back problems, so the wall mount eliminates her bending to use the mirror and eliminates counter clutter.I would have rated this 5 star except for one thing, the 10X power mirror is to overpowering requiring you to stand right up against the mirror to maintain focus. It is great for plucking eyebrows but you are so close to the mirror it doesn&#x27;t allow adequate room to  apply make-up and maintain focus. My wife would prefer a 5x - 8x power mirror so she doesn&#x27;t have to stand so close. That said over all she loves the product in every other aspect.</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror that i could mount on the wall and be magnified&lt;br /&gt;I do think all wall mounted mirrors should have the same screw&lt;br /&gt;patterns i had a mirror already i just wanted a magnifing 1,was&lt;br /&gt;a little disapointed when i had to put new holes in wall, but it is up&lt;br /&gt;and works pretty good.</li>
    <li> We returned this mirror not because of the finish or the mirror itself but because of the weight.  Our wall would not stand the weight where we were going to use it.  The finish &amp; the mirrrr itself were fine.</li>
    <li> too heavy and cord not long enough</li>
    <li> Well, 10X is REALLY, REALLY BIG. My daughter said the 10X was the only way to go. Soooo, I did. Kinda wish I would have got a 7X or 8X. I have a 5X and its not quite large enough. Oh, well, I&#x27;ll live with the 10X. My guy loves it cause it lights up his face when he shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought a Jerdon 5x lighted magnifying mirror and have reviewed that separately.  Although that mirror was very well made, the magnification was not strong enough for my wife.  So we bought this one and the quality is marginal.  The main problem is a wave in the concave mirror that distorts the image of your face; this is especially noticeable if you move a little bit.  A secondary problem is that the wall mount does not sit absolutely flush against the wall and the mirror is heavy enough that it pulls the base away from the wall.  It isn&#x27;t going to fall out but the gap between the base and wall does reduce the stability of the mounting and frankly it looks cheap.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Jerdon.  As others have mentioned the cord is quite long.  I opened the base, pulled the strain relief out, shortened the cord and reconnected everything.  I was interested to see that the electrical connections had been done very well, so the problem is not the quality of fabrication, just the quality of components.</li>
    <li> I bought this because as I get older my eye sight is not what it used to be and I was having trouble seeing well enough to apply eye liner. I have reading glasses but I can&#x27;t wear glasses to apply eye makeup. This mirror is perfect. I had a similar mirror without a light that worked OK but this mirror with the light  is so much better. The 10x is a little too much for me and I have to get really close to the mirror or the image is distorted but I figured as time goes by and my eyes get older I will be happy I have the 10x.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very easy to install!</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but I didn&#x27;t realize the light source only comes from a small bulb which really isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. The only problem I have with it, is its a little stiff when you move it to different positions.</li>
    <li> Its well finished, and the light works fine, could be more strong but its OK. it have two regulations and the instalation is very easy</li>
    <li> Solid construction, but could have a brighter light, magnification is perfect. Over all I&#x27;d have to say it meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I had an electrician wire this lamp into the circuit with the other bathroom light so it unlikely to be left on.  The system works perfectly.  The magnification side is just right.  The lady of the house is happy.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what I was expecting, based on the advertisement I read on a magazine.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a classy bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a very high quality chrome with excellent mounting hardware and other finishes.  It has a two level brightness on the lamp.  It has a separate mounting bracket on the back and I was able to screw it directly into studs so I didn&#x27;t need to use the sheet rock anchors supplied. The cord is about 30 &amp;#34; and if anything a bit long for my application.  I&#x27;m thinking about either cutting the cord and rewiring it or hard wiring it at some point.  As to magnification, at 10x this one is strong.  I had a smaller 5x and wanted something stronger because I cannot see without readers, but this is so strong I have to get within just a few inches of the mirror to focus. There is barely room for my electric shaver.  I&#x27;d suggest visiting a retain store to confirm what magnification works for you before purchase.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It had 10x&lt;br /&gt;Lighted&lt;br /&gt;was able to wall wired by hubby&lt;br /&gt;Nice extended arm size&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again&lt;br /&gt;recommend to all</li>
