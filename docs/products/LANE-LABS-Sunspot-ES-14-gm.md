      <li>I think this is a great value</li>
      <li>Sunspot by Lane Labs Works great.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product.  </li>
      <li>it is very cheap.  </li>
      <li>But many do.</li>
      <li>but it is better than the spot itself.</li>
      <li>Many kinds of skin problems helped.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to find it.</li>
      <li>It seems to be most effective when the tube is first opened.  </li>
      <li>The product is easy to use, invisible etc.  </li>
      <li>However, this newer version is not so strong.  </li>
      <li>The area is smooth</li>
      <li>I should have stayed with the original style.</li>
      <li>The product was originally doctor-recommended to me.</li>
      <li>The product was originally called Skin Answer.</li>
      <li>The damaged skin is removed and new healthy skin grows in it&#x27;s place.</li>
      <li>This product works well, and is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product off-and-on for more than a decade (originally under a different name.)</li>
      <li>This restores the flaky, rough spots and &amp;#34;questionable&amp;#34; skin lesions to their healthy smooth nature when used as-directed and dligently.</li>
      <li>I have used it several times since then and now have three more to get rid of.</li>
      <li>If fact, I have bought a second tube to use on some of the areas that are darker from more sun exposure (like forehead).  </li>
      <li>I used it for 5 weeks to remove my rather large sunspots (I&#x27;m 62) and they are pretty much gone.  </li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t work as fast for me as was suggested.</li>
      <li>I was really worried about the spot</li>
      <li>After about a week things can get pretty intense as the spots get darker and larger for awhile during the treatment.  </li>
      <li>Sunspot ES works as good or better than PDQ skin cream and it is a lot less expensive.  </li>
      <li>It looked very scary for a few weeks but when it finally dropped off in the shower on day I saw beautiful smooth pink skin and was thrilled.</li>
      <li>It was really red at first and skin came off.</li>
      <li>It barely burned and really think it got rid of the spot.</li>
      <li>It only works on certain kinds of spots.</li>
      <li>only pink smooth area remained.</li>
      <li>It does work if you use it all the time and then use a cheap exfoliation product periodically to rub off dead</li>
      <li>and it worked very well in a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>A large red growth on my cheek completely fell off and never returned after using product twice a day for several months.</li>
      <li>It pretty much does what it says, It removes or at least lightens sun spots.</li>
      <li>A lot of people have used it including myself to remove spots of actinic keratosis (rough skin patches caused from too much sun).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the trouble and expense.</li>
      <li>waste your very large amount of money on this product though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works well, and is worth every penny.  Havine been using this product for several years in our family, and have always found it to work well</li>
    <li> Product came with no instructions or info.  just \\&quot;dab a little when needed\\&quot;?????  O...kay....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called, and received no helpful explanation, just a comment that \\&quot;well, we don&#x27;t quarantee any specific results...??? or to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use regularly (at least twice/day).  My sun spots are flat rough patches from the sun only.  I did this for 10 days.  It did nothing.  I have used OTC skin fading products, but wanted something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can now get a 3% hydroquinone where the dark-skin product are and it is very cheap.  It does work if you use it all the time and then use a cheap exfoliation product periodically to rub off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your very large amount of money on this product though.</li>
    <li> It pretty much does what it says, It removes or at least lightens sun spots. Be patient,  it does not happen overnight, but it does happen. It only works on certain kinds of spots. I have some that do not lighten unfortunately. But many do.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and some of best prices can be found for it on Amazon. This product is widely discussed on several skin cancer forums. A lot of people have used it including myself to remove spots of actinic keratosis (rough skin patches caused from too much sun). The active ingredients are glycoalkaloids derived from sand brier. The product was originally called Skin Answer. The glycoalkaloids in the product cause the skin to exfoliate (peel). The damaged skin is removed and new healthy skin grows in it&#x27;s place. It works.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last five years; on sun spots, skin tags, warts, and moles.  It takes time to work, sometimes four or five weeks depending on the size and thickness of the skin problem being treated; a thin coating often is not enough, you have to gob it on sometimes.  It seems to be most effective when the tube is first opened.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had used this product a long time ago, and within a few days to a week, the spots would redden, scab over and fall off for good.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not seeing anything change. They must have diluted the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it years ago, and the spot never returned. The areas where my dr. burned or cut off brown spots not only have left pits, but some have grown back. That&#x27;s why I bought this again, to remove the ones the dr. once removed but have returned.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works.  It just didn&#x27;t work as fast for me as was suggested. I used it for 5 weeks to remove my rather large sunspots (I&#x27;m 62) and they are pretty much gone.  If fact, I have bought a second tube to use on some of the areas that are darker from more sun exposure (like forehead).  The product is easy to use, invisible etc.  After about a week things can get pretty intense as the spots get darker and larger for awhile during the treatment.  But then they peel off and are gone.  It&#x27;s worth the trouble and expense.</li>
    <li> I had used this product years back and it worked very well in a short period of time.  However, this newer version is not so strong.  I used this for a couple of weeks and, although it did seem to work, somewhat, I just couldn&#x27;t get it to go all the way to eradicate the spot/spots.  I&#x27;ve gotten discouraged and stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this skin answer 15 years ago on a Basel cell. It looked very scary for a few weeks but when it finally dropped off in the shower on day I saw beautiful smooth pink skin and was thrilled. I have used it several times since then and now have three more to get rid of. All about the size as a pencil eraser. I had one on the end of my nose surgically removed and my ins. Paid through the nose for that one. I didn&#x27;t use the product at that time because I was working and it gets rather ugly for a while, brown and crusty. It would have looked like a.(you know what) hanging on the end of my nose.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Many kinds of skin problems helped.  A large red growth on my cheek completely fell off and never returned after using product twice a day for several months.</li>
    <li> Sunspot by Lane Labs Works great.  I was so glad to find it. We have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off-and-on for more than a decade (originally under a different name.) This has worked for me every time. This restores the flaky, rough spots and &amp;#34;questionable&amp;#34; skin lesions to their healthy smooth nature when used as-directed and dligently. Also a bonus that no scars are left (not so if going to the doctor to have them frozen or cut off.) The skin lesions have never come back. I think this is a great value and I hope they always make this (even if they change the name again.) The product was originally doctor-recommended to me.</li>
    <li> Actually i think it worked rather well.It barely burned and really think it got rid of the spot. only pink smooth area remained.Hopefully it wont come back.It was really red at first and skin came off.I was really worried about the spot but it seems gone. I will use it again if i have to.I only reapplied it several times over 3 day period.The area is smooth i hope the pink will dissapear but it is better than the spot itself.</li>
    <li> Excellent and effective product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for what used to be called &amp;#34;skin answer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I later ordered a tube of Sunspot ES Exfoliate as a finisher.  I should have stayed with the original style.</li>
    <li> Sunspot ES works as good or better than PDQ skin cream and it is a lot less expensive.  I read the two negative reviews, so I guess it does not work for some people but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough for this product. I have used it for years, even before they renamed it. It removes the sun damaged skin, we didn&#x27;t know would begin showing until 20 years later. Thank you Amazon for including this product on your site.</li>
    <li> TOTALLY USELESS,, DID IT RELIGIOUSLY FOR WEEKS, TWICE A DAY,, NO RESULTS,, I AM RETURNING IT...</li>
    <li> I have been using this of and on for years. Whenever I find a skin spot that looks strange I put a tiny amount of this product ont it.&lt;br /&gt;It might take a month or so before it &amp;quot;burns&amp;quot; off the spot. but it has always worked,</li>
    <li> I am still using product, as of yet have not go the results that were promised  by the manufacturer on the web sight</li>
    <li> I have used this for a month with minimal change</li>
