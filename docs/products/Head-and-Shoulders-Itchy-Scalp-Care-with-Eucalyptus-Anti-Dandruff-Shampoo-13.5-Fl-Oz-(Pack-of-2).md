      <li>and they love it.  </li>
      <li>So this one definitely is better.  </li>
      <li>It is much better than the Pantene Volumizing shampoo and is&#x27;t listed as a \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoo at all.</li>

      <li>As soon as i used this, most of my flakes dissapeared.</li>
      <li>I love being able to part my hair and seeing nothing but clean, non-oily hair and scalp without flakes.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel the urge to scratch as much as before, so the product receives good marks in this</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s when I notice the really full effect!</li>
      <li>its strong but</li>
      <li>Have used this for more than one and half years, always good!</li>

      <li>but my hair is now flake free and unitchy.</li>
      <li>Made my hair 100000% Smoother, healthier and fresh feeling!</li>
      <li>Best part came that night, no more itching keeping me awake at bed time.  </li>
      <li>no more itch at all, and the smell is great!</li>
      <li>This shampoo stopped my itchy scalp, but the eucalyptus in it burns your eyes a LOT more than normal shampoo.</li>
      <li>Wal-Mart and I could not believe how lovely my scalp felt and how soft my hair was</li>
      <li>The next day my scalp and hair still felt clean and refreshing just like I had stepped out of the shower.</li>
      <li>gets that itch right out there.</li>
      <li>my head has been itching on and off for over a month, dandruff, the whole works!</li>
      <li>I was actually able to sleep last night.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million, Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
      <li>my scalp felt healthier before i even got out of the shower the first time i used this.</li>
      <li>I was completely itch free.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>I tried this variety about a month ago for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as the first thing to turn to when seeing symptoms like mine.</li>
      <li>great for eliminating itchy, dry scalp...when accompanied with same name product conditioner.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that keeps my scalp calm and itch free.</li>
      <li>I have used MANY shampoos over the last 30 years looking for one that gives my fine hair EXTRA volume without drying it out and, LO AND BEHOLD, this shampoo really works!</li>
      <li>I have dry scalp and dry hair so anything that can help alleviate these problems is welcome in my home.</li>
      <li>As some one who travels a lot and has a super busy schedule having time to care for my hair almost never happens.</li>
      <li>As a guy who has always had a full head of thick hair with no family history of baldness, I was kind of worried.</li>
      <li>I have a real problem with my scalp and have been to the dermatologist&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it as I really like the effect it has on my hair.</li>
      <li>My scalp itch has decreased tremendously in just 3 washes that has cut down on my hair loss in the shower which is great for someone who has fine hair like me.</li>
      <li>I have used many shampoos in my time, including other types of Head &amp; Shoulders, and I have never experienced a reaction like the one I experienced with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Hard to review - great shampoo &amp; conditioner in that it gives great hair, BUT after 1 month of regular use, resulted in 100% worse dandruff</li>
      <li>SO - good shampoo and conditioner, but not a good dandruff treatment.</li>
      <li>(i might be able to wash my hair every other day now!)</li>
      <li>Head &amp; Shoulders manufactures slight variations on its products from time to time and the latest is Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different brands, even different types of H&amp;S and nothing would help.</li>
      <li>the minute I used my old shampoo, so I reckon it only just covered up the problem, it clearly didn&#x27;t treat the dandruff issue, as like I said, my dandruff with my old shampoo was MUCH better before this 1-month test run.</li>
      <li>dried out scout more than what it should have won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
      <li>, I am guessing she was right as the itching and redness went away and after a while, the thinned areas grew back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally I was reading a magazine the other day, and a free sample of H&amp;S with eucalyptus fell out, and I tried it.</li>
      <li>I blamed this undesireable scalp and hair on stress of a new job and relocation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo does help get itching under control and it leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>At the end of that work day I suddenly realized for the first time in over a month</li>
      <li>but WOW thats not</li>
      <li>I may be sensitive to some ingredients in this shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t even wash this stuff out with my old shampoo.</li>
      <li>Thinking i was doing myself a favor by using the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products for several months, i developed such an itchy, flakey, more oily than usual scalp and hair.</li>
      <li>I went back to H+S sensitive scalp care and had to shampoo 3 times before the itch was reduced.</li>
      <li>My head feels clean, fresh, and I no longer have that crazy itch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo did help, but my scalp still has itch problems.  I have a real problem with my scalp and have been to the dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;several times.  I was using Head &amp; Shoulders for oily scalp and that was driving me crazy.  So this one definitely is better.  I do not seem to need a conditioner with this one.  My dermatologist does recommend head and shoulders so I guess I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> At the risk of sounding like a cheesy commercial, it really did work in 1 day!  After about a month of itchy scalp purchased the shampoo and tried it next morning.  At the end of that work day I suddenly realized for the first time in over a month I didn&#x27;t have to awkwardly try to sneak in a head scratch.  Best part came that night, no more itching keeping me awake at bed time.  Now one week in and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> actually made the itch go away.  works well</li>
    <li> I am having a terrible reaction to hair color I used last week. I couldn&#x27;t sleep, was constantly itching, and COMPLETELY miserable!! Bought this product yesterday and am completely in love. It is cooling, refreshing, and best of all... completely stopped my itch. I was actually able to sleep last night. Haven&#x27;t scratched once all day. So thankful for H&amp;S!!</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is a well- known and well- respected name in dandruff control and its products are generally effective and perform as promised. Head &amp; Shoulders manufactures slight variations on its products from time to time and the latest is Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sampled this product and I have noticed a difference in itching. I have dry scalp and dry hair so anything that can help alleviate these problems is welcome in my home. This particular Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo does help get itching under control and it leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t feel the urge to scratch as much as before, so the product receives good marks in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the itch control and the moisturizing properties, the other standout with this product is the scent. There is no mistaking that eucalyptus is one of the ingredients in this shampoo and you will realize it the moment you open the bottle. Besides the eucalyptus scent, there is also an element of menthol and this combination makes the product smell a little medicinal. This could be a turn- off to some consumers, although I found it perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry scalp and itchiness go hand in hand, but Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus is here to remedy the problem. Its active ingredients help to moisturize the scalp and get the itching under control and while it is a tad on the expensive side, those who have these problems will likely consider the relief provided by this shampoo to be money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shampoo that would soothe my itchy scalp for years. I have tried so many different brands, even different types of H&amp;S and nothing would help. I tend to have an oily scalp and dry hair, so when I would come out of the shower, my scalp would itch so badly (and because of the oiliness, I have lots of painful bumps). When I saw the name of this shampoo, I just had to try it! I bought it (2-in-1) a few days ago @ Wal-Mart and I could not believe how lovely my scalp felt and how soft my hair was (it&#x27;s like the angels were singing). I think I&#x27;m in love and I will never go back to another shampoo ever again!!! I hope they&#x27;ll have it for the rest of my life! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. every scalp is not the same, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, keep trying!</li>
    <li> As some one who travels a lot and has a super busy schedule having time to care for my hair almost never happens. Over time my scalp had become terrible itchy a day after showering due to the cheap shampoo I was using. Normally shampoo with tea tree oil solves the issue but lately even that had failed to work. I went to the store and was determined to find some thing to help me out. I bought this shampoo and it was very different. The next day my scalp and hair still felt clean and refreshing just like I had stepped out of the shower. Three days later when I had time to wash my hair I was completely itch free. This is the best shampoo!</li>
    <li> So I seriously just went to walmart yesterday and picked up this because I couldnt stand the itching anymore! my head has been itching on and off for over a month, dandruff, the whole works! I would even wake up in the middle of the night from scratching! Usually as soon as I get out of the shower my head starts itching again.. but not anymore it has been over 12hrs since my first use and no itching at all!!!! sooo amazing! I will write another review in a couple days to update just incase I may be \\&quot;jumping the gun\\&quot;. Also my fiance is using it as well as he had the same problem and his has completly stopped already as well!</li>
    <li> I have used MANY shampoos over the last 30 years looking for one that gives my fine hair EXTRA volume without drying it out and, LO AND BEHOLD, this shampoo really works! It is much better than the Pantene Volumizing shampoo and is&#x27;t listed as a \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoo at all. I will continue to use it as I really like the effect it has on my hair. P.S. I wash my hair twice, letting the 2nd wash sit on my hair for maybe five minutes before washing it out and that&#x27;s when I notice the really full effect!</li>
    <li> This stuff did a good job with my itchy scalp but it is so gross. I have never had a shampoo work this poorly with my hair before. Even after I rinse and rinse and rinse it leaves a sticky, oily coating on my hair. My hair looks like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week and I can&#x27;t even wash this stuff out with my old shampoo. My hair, which is usually soft and shiny, is now stiff and gross. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo stopped my itchy scalp, but the eucalyptus in it burns your eyes a LOT more than normal shampoo. And it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep it from getting in your eyes because it&#x27;s so runny. I got out of the shower 10 minutes ago, and my eyes are still burning from this shampoo, even after flushing my eyes with water a couple of times. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> There are so many varieties of Head and Shoulders that it is sometimes impossible to decide.  After trying numerous different brands and a number of the H&amp;S varieties, I was still having problems with dry scalp, itching and flaking.  I tried this variety about a month ago for the first time.  The problems almost immediately disappeared, including an overdry forehead.  All I can say is -- IT WORKS!  All other varieties and brands are now history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0043OYFJQ Head &amp; Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Shampoo, 14.20-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I have OIly.. Flaky.. Itchy hair with dandruff. As soon as i used this, most of my flakes dissapeared. but WOW thats not even why i gave this 5 Stars!  This Shampoo ( and I use the conditoner ) Made my hair 100000% Smoother, healthier and fresh feeling! Im so glad i bought this! I just recently started getting dandruff ( winter... ) But now its going away and my hair also look a million times better!  P.S- I Love the Minty, Menthol, Eucalptus smell! its strong but I like it. (:</li>
    <li> The best dandruff shampoo. This also has a scent appropriate for men and women. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had over 7 years of horribly itchy scalp and dandruff. The itch actually woke me up at night. I&#x27;d had several treatments from my doctor (which didn&#x27;t work). I&#x27;d tried previous Head &amp; Shoulders products - they dried my hair out dreadfully, lessened (though did not get rid of) the dandruff and did nothing for the itch. This product actually worked. It&#x27;s slightly drying (though not as bad as previous H &amp; S shampoos) so I use a hair mask treatment every 2 weeks but my hair is now flake free and unitchy.</li>
    <li> My entire family and very dry dandruff hair and they love it.  Even the teenagers use it.  Helps reduce the flakes</li>
    <li> great for eliminating itchy, dry scalp...when accompanied with same name product conditioner. My entire family uses weekly and raves about it!</li>
    <li> The best dandruff shampoo for the price.  Generic versions just don&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> Within 12 hours of use, my scalp started itching. I tried to shampoo again and again within 12 hours, the itch started again. I went back to H+S sensitive scalp care and had to shampoo 3 times before the itch was reduced. I may be sensitive to some ingredients in this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells amazing, works good gets that itch right out there. Has a nice tingle feel to it. Well balanced not to dry not to greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good going head and shoulders</li>
    <li> Hard to review - great shampoo &amp; conditioner in that it gives great hair, BUT after 1 month of regular use, resulted in 100% worse dandruff the minute I used my old shampoo, so I reckon it only just covered up the problem, it clearly didn&#x27;t treat the dandruff issue, as like I said, my dandruff with my old shampoo was MUCH better before this 1-month test run. Disappointing but not surprising - it does have a strong smell of perfumes and is based on SLS. SO - good shampoo and conditioner, but not a good dandruff treatment.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the savings, this was cheaper then the local stores. This is a great product and it worked just as it was supposed too.</li>
    <li> I started getting a dry itchy scalp in my 40s. Some areas near my hairline also started to look red and angry and my hair started thinning in select areas. As a guy who has always had a full head of thick hair with no family history of baldness, I was kind of worried. My doctor said it was likely seborrheic dermatitis and recommended Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am guessing she was right as the itching and redness went away and after a while, the thinned areas grew back. I am not sure what caused the dermatitis, but I do know that Head and Shoulders took care of it. I would recommend this product as the first thing to turn to when seeing symptoms like mine.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner combo...I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that keeps my scalp calm and itch free.</li>
    <li> I have used many shampoos in my time, including other types of Head &amp; Shoulders, and I have never experienced a reaction like the one I experienced with this shampoo. During washing it made my scalp tingle as if it were Dr. Miracles. When I washed it out and I was drying my hair, my scalp was burning terribly, felt like I was perming my hair; my scalp was tingling and on fire so I rinsed my hair with cold water which only made it worse. The burning sensation eventaully ceased after about 10 to 15 minutes. When my hair dried there were sores and scabs on my scalp, like chemical burns. This is not a shampoo that I will buying again. I will not even be finishing the bottle I have.</li>
    <li> my scalp felt healthier before i even got out of the shower the first time i used this. i would say it&#x27;s probably neutral as to how my hair likes it, but my scalp is just so relieved. no more itch at all, and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.  It smells nice, reduces dandruff, stops scalp itch and doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> dried out scout more than what it should have won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Worked Great.  Had itchy scalp and didn&#x27;t know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;Heard about this shampoo and decided to try it.  After 3 to&lt;br /&gt;4 washings my itching was gone.  Really works!</li>
    <li> I have always thought the more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products would give better results than the more \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; kinds. Thinking i was doing myself a favor by using the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products for several months, i developed such an itchy, flakey, more oily than usual scalp and hair. I blamed this undesireable scalp and hair on stress of a new job and relocation.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, i couldn&#x27;t take the itch, oilyness, flakes, and chunks of hair loss from constantly itching! I bought this shampoo at CVS and am on my 3rd day of using this wonderful product. It is so refreshing, cleansing, and invigorating on my scalp. my hair is shiny (not from being oily!) And my hair hasn&#x27;t got oily between my daily washings! (i might be able to wash my hair every other day now!) My scalp itch has decreased tremendously in just 3 washes that has cut down on my hair loss in the shower which is great for someone who has fine hair like me. I love being able to part my hair and seeing nothing but clean, non-oily hair and scalp without flakes.  Thanks a million, Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
    <li> Made my head worse. The itching was awful. I was experimenting with different shampoos trying to get the itching to stop.  Should work on regular dandruff though.</li>
    <li> Have used this for more than one and half years, always good! Will keep on using it, head shoulders shampoo!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully at cleaning as it lathers great, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy yet isn&#x27;t drying on my scalp either. A nice even shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another subtype of Head &amp; Shoulders initially, however, Amazon does sell that. So, I picked this one instead. My wife are satisified. Effective as advertised and gentle on the hair and sculp.</li>
    <li> I returned from a trip and realized that my scalp got a bit of sunburn.  Then the itching began - ugh!  I decided to try this shampoo and it worked like a charm.  Gives your scalp a pleasant cool tingle while you shampoo.  Itching and flaking disappeared within a week.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing crazy itchy scalp for many months now, probably because of stress from school. The only thing I&#x27;ve ever used was regular 2in1 head and shoulders, but I would still wind up with tons of flakes on my shoulders and back behind my neck. I hope other kids in the class didn&#x27;t notice. but I&#x27;m sure the haircutting stylist did. I felt so embarrassed when she was cutting my hair, it was like a winter wonderland, flakes everywhere on the stark black fabric. She tried to sell me this paul mitchell tee tree oil shampoo. That one smelled really good but didnt do jack for the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I was reading a magazine the other day, and a free sample of H&amp;S with eucalyptus fell out, and I tried it. My head feels clean, fresh, and I no longer have that crazy itch. Its awesome!</li>
