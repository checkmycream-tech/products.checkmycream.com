    <li> Too expensive but cheapest I could find online</li>
    <li> excellent product and buy</li>
    <li> These razors work just fine for me. They are made in Poland and for the Indian market but I am still happy with the quality. I use them both for my face and body.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor blades , what more do you need to know?</li>
    <li> I think 3 blades are good enough for me.  I don&#x27;t need latest and greatest 4 or 5 ones.&lt;br /&gt;Note: This package made in Poland for the India market but somehow sold in here.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised and I enjoy these blades.</li>
    <li> These are good blades.  I shave every other day, and I only change my blade about once every two weeks.</li>
    <li> Came as scheduled.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Blades edges may not be the same as originals</li>
    <li> I believe the mach 3 blade replacements are just a little bit too expensive as well as the in store prices.</li>
    <li> Great blades. good price. delivered to my house with prime-awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like a really close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mach 3 are well made.</li>
    <li> Good deal compared to my local stores. They fit my razor, and last just as long as the overpriced ones I buy in the stores.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> They work just fine, just wish they were a little more affordable.</li>
    <li> I love the Mach 3 blades, and I&#x27;m always looking for a great deal.</li>
    <li> When I saw these blades were made in India I though they would not be good.  Used the first one today.  I got the smoothest, cleanest shave ever.  Great blade.</li>
    <li> Ordered 10 count, sent me two 8 count packs......16 blades for the price of 10!!!!!!! thank you!!!!!!!! :) Very Happy With this buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> The amount of heads for the price is just perfect, much better than any stores!</li>
    <li> Great blades at great price.</li>
    <li> Product is from Asia not the same quality as US market products</li>
    <li> These appear to be from India, but they are geniune Gilette refills and work fine.  I recommend this seller to a save a few $!</li>
    <li> thank you. fast delivery and excellent price</li>
    <li> Great price by comparison. Not the best or the worst.  Some M3 sets out there are garbage.  This one I found to be ok.  I got better blades in the past.  Seems you can never tell what you&#x27;ll get in these packages.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, so I don&#x27;t have much to sat</li>
    <li> Shaving blades have gotten ridiculously expensive so it&#x27;s necessary to shop any deal you can find.  DH and I prefer this brand, this was a very good deal, will definitely shop with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a fan of the wet shave, and the Mach3 blades offer these balance of comfort and value. I shave 3-4 times per week, and I get at least 3-4 weeks per head. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat the Mach3.</li>
    <li> These work great so far, only had for a week so we&#x27;ll see how long they last but for the price you can&#x27;t beat them</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price.  I shave usually about once a week (my work doesnt mind) and I&#x27;ve got strong stubble by Sunday and these blades work fine.  I only change them maybe every 3 months or 12 shaves or so.  Mach 3 is a good blade, just not exactly cheap.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mach 3 for years. I am more than satisfied with the closeness and comfort of the shave. Unlike the cheap disposable shavers, I tend more shaves from the Mach 3. The price I got on Amazon, was better than big box stores.</li>
    <li> great service. bladesmade in  poland. blue stripe lasts longer than usual. seems to shave as wellasmade in us so far</li>
    <li> There were imported from some foreign nation and seems old. They only lasted me about a week per blade! This is garbage.</li>
    <li> It is definitely a big saving in compare to Walmart. I will buy it again after I run out!</li>
    <li> Match3 Refill Cartridge Blades., thanks guys, Good product</li>
    <li> Indian product...Not Good!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, top quality!</li>
