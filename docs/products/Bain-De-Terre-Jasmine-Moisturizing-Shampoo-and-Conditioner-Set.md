      <li>I love the fragrance of Jasmine.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I looked in my area to find some more of it, but never could.</li>
      <li>Not as great as I expected but still a good shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>The scent is light and the value is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner makes your hair feel so good.</li>
      <li>Because I am looking for that unique pure Jasmine aroma that will stay with me for a longer period of time, and a good quality conditioner to stop those fly-away&#x27;s without blow drying, I know my search is not over.  </li>
      <li>Was worried the jasmine scent might be too strong, but it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
      <li>Had bought this from beautician and liked it so much, I ordered here.</li>
      <li>I have been using this line for some time and really enjoy the products.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner because it is simply a moisturizing duo that smells great.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy much better than any other salon shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet, earthy smell to me.</li>
      <li>It really helps my hair stay healthy</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smelling so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and have to use product on my hair and when I use this shampoo it leave my hair feeling clean and the conditioner is very light.</li>
      <li>and it feels good on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry</li>
      <li>This shampoo is exactly what they use at the salon!  </li>
      <li>Love how soft and shiny my hair is when using these products.</li>
      <li>Although I was pleasantly surprised and quite happy in regards to the affordable cost and quick delivery time of this product, I found the product itself to be of an average quality.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell or feel like the one in the salon very much.</li>
      <li>This is the exact product he obtained for me with the convenience of coming to my front door.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo/conditioner and online is the only place I can find it anymore,</li>
      <li>With a cupboard full of different brands, I didn&#x27;t really need another, but I love Bain De Terre products, so I ordered this duo because of the quality of the product, the jasmine scent, and the color of the bottle which matches my new bath remodel.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if the product didn&#x27;t travel well or what, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good, nothing like what it smelled like at the salon.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a pleasant Jasmine smell that would last in my hair long after I had washed it, however, the quite mild but pleasant Jasmine smell of the shampoo and conditioner gets rinsed away with the dirt down the drain, making this product fall into the category of average.  </li>
      <li>It still seems to cleanse and condition like it should, but the smell is very chemically..</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon I can get it online, since some stores have discontinue it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day, and it leaves me with such good texture that some days I just brush my wet hair and go.  </li>
      <li>On days I want to look nicer, I blow dry, quickly set with curlers, and I&#x27;m ready in 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have always bought the small amounts from stores by my house, but the 33.8oz containers are such a great value I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser used them on my hair for the first time not long ago</li>
      <li>This product makes your hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>Typically salon products are thicker and rich.</li>
      <li>I bought this due to the jasmine scent but it has a strong chemical smell and it is definitely not an organic product, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product which clearly states that each bottle comes with a pump.</li>
      <li>Cleans my hair and leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and moist.</li>
      <li>Go get the bar shampoo from Lush instead.</li>
      <li>She has very oily blonde hair</li>
      <li>There is nothing about the product to make it stand out with any type of Wow factor.  </li>
      <li>As far as shipping; couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking these might be old</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, this really helps with detangling and keeping the frizz down!</li>
      <li>but the smell is not long lasting in your hair.</li>

    <li> Wonderful products!  My hairdresser used them on my hair for the first time not long ago and I loved how my hair felt and lasted.  Was very happy to find the products to purchase here since my hairdresser didn&#x27;t have the products for sale.</li>
    <li> Noting spectacular. Didn&#x27;t smell or feel like the one in the salon very much.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out about 4 years ago, and I really liked it. I looked in my area to find some more of it, but never could. So I looked online and found it here. I am so happy to have it again. It really helps my hair stay healthy and I like the smell. It has a sweet, earthy smell to me.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I expected but still a good shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Had bought this from beautician and liked it so much, I ordered here.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell like jasmine. Go get the bar shampoo from Lush instead. That is jasmine my friends. Plus, shampoo and conditioner quality are on par with drugstore brands. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line for some time and really enjoy the products. Thanks to Amazon I can get it online, since some stores have discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and my daughter visited me and ended up taking the rest home with her! She has very oily blonde hair and it helped her issue and she loved the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and moist. Smells great, too!</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  It is the only hair shampoo and conditioner that we use.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair so soft and shiny!  I tried it at a salon, and I had to buy it.  The price here is great, and the service was awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the jasmine scent but it has a strong chemical smell and it is definitely not an organic product, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love this product....my hairstylist uses it at her salon.  I&#x27;ve been using it at home and also taking it with me when I go to a blow dry bar (those Asian-owned salons usually use cheaper shampoo/conditioners!  Great value for a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! I have the Bain De Terre Keratin Phyto-Protein at home so I wanted to give this one a try. Definitely love the smell and the fact that it comes with pumps! As far as shipping; couldn&#x27;t be happier. It came a day or so before estimated day of arrival, which is always great. :)</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of Jasmine.  My stylist was having difficulty locating this product for me after his supplier discontinued carrying it.  This is the exact product he obtained for me with the convenience of coming to my front door.  My hair loves the product.</li>
    <li> Update: The second time I ordered this product, there were no pumps included. At a quart each, these things are too heavy and cumbersome to hold and pour single-handedly. It&#x27;s going to make showering awkward and wasteful. Also, the shampoo bottle cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tightly, allowing it to leak.   8/14/14 review: This shampoo is exactly what they use at the salon!  It makes my hair bouncy, shiny, and soft, and it smells delicious.  After just two shampoos with it, my husband complimented me on the good smell.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day, and it leaves me with such good texture that some days I just brush my wet hair and go.  On days I want to look nicer, I blow dry, quickly set with curlers, and I&#x27;m ready in 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Hello, my name is Deb and I&#x27;m a shampooaholic.  With a cupboard full of different brands, I didn&#x27;t really need another, but I love Bain De Terre products, so I ordered this duo because of the quality of the product, the jasmine scent, and the color of the bottle which matches my new bath remodel.  I use them daily and my hair looks great!  The scent is light and the value is outstanding. I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
    <li> Although I was pleasantly surprised and quite happy in regards to the affordable cost and quick delivery time of this product, I found the product itself to be of an average quality.  There is nothing about the product to make it stand out with any type of Wow factor.  I was expecting a pleasant Jasmine smell that would last in my hair long after I had washed it, however, the quite mild but pleasant Jasmine smell of the shampoo and conditioner gets rinsed away with the dirt down the drain, making this product fall into the category of average.  The conditioner itself does not feel like it&#x27;s conditioning my hair, and that too gets washed down the drain.  I find that even without blow drying, I still get fly-away&#x27;s.  Because I am looking for that unique pure Jasmine aroma that will stay with me for a longer period of time, and a good quality conditioner to stop those fly-away&#x27;s without blow drying, I know my search is not over.  If your goal is to purchase affordable bulk shampoo and conditioner with a pump, with not caring about the actual Jasmine aroma of the shampoo and conditioner itself, then this is a 4 star product.  Because I am looking for a better quality product for my hair, I&#x27;m sorry, but it only rates a 3 star for me.  My search continues.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product which clearly states that each bottle comes with a pump. I did not receive the pumps at all, only the bottle of shampoo and the bottle of conditioner. I absolutely LOVE this shampoo/conditioner and online is the only place I can find it anymore, but I&#x27;m disappointed I did not receive the pumps as promised</li>
    <li> The shampoo works good. Nice smell but the smell is not long lasting in your hair. The conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Works well again smell is nice but  smell does not last long in your hair. I have dry course hair and the products worked well for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! Definitely a good buy much better than any other salon shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner, but I wanted the smell like the small bottles and it didn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering this product again.  Maybe without the pump.  The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. Both my daughter and my self use it.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner because it is simply a moisturizing duo that smells great. It isn&#x27;t as concentrated as most expensive salon shampoos so I feel like I have to use more of it which is why I didn&#x27;t leave 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bain De Terre &amp;#34;Rise and Shine&amp;#34; for years.  Thought I would try their shampoo and conditioner, but was disappointed.  I have thin hair and the product did nothing to increase volume or condition.</li>
    <li> Bain de terre is always a winner. Leaves my hair smelling so clean and fresh. Was worried the jasmine scent might be too strong, but it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, this really helps with detangling and keeping the frizz down!</li>
    <li> great shampoo and conditioner, I like it a lot and it feels good on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner. I have always bought the small amounts from stores by my house, but the 33.8oz containers are such a great value I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It was 5 stars at the salon but buying it here online I can only give it 4 stars. I am not sure if the product didn&#x27;t travel well or what, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good, nothing like what it smelled like at the salon. It still seems to cleanse and condition like it should, but the smell is very chemically.. I&#x27;m thinking these might be old &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> It has a very strong perfume smell, thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve had just as good shampoo &amp; conditioner from Target. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the coconut mango instead.</li>
    <li> I love the Bain De Terre Jasmine Shampoo and Conditioner.  It smells great and doesnt leave build up on my hair.  I have naturally curly hair and have to use product on my hair and when I use this shampoo it leave my hair feeling clean and the conditioner is very light.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner makes your hair feel so good.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok for me, no build up</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Received quickly. The smell never leaves your hair and it is wonderful. Love how soft and shiny my hair is when using these products.</li>
    <li> The only brand I will use.</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent. Cleans my hair and leaves it soft. I was surprised that both the shampoo and conditioner are a little watery. Typically salon products are thicker and rich.</li>
