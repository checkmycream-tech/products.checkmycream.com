    <li> I initially found the Amir Argan Oil Hand Protector at a local department store.  I figured I would give it a try since I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else with no luck.  I was so pleasantly surprised to actually find something that works!  I loved it so much that I had to find more (it was the only one in the store) for not only myself, but my mother-in-law that is also plagued with dry hands.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, feels like velvet, works great and smells amazing!  I was so happy to find it here on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, absorbs quickly, nicely moisturizes (though not heavy on moisture) . If it bothers anyone: has a feeling of too much silicone or some other overly smooth (yet not necessarily moisturizing) texture.</li>
    <li> used before .best stuff for dry cracked skin &amp; smells good too...will continue to buy</li>
    <li> Good service, good product</li>
    <li> Love the scent, the feel &amp; the results.</li>
    <li> Has a nice coconut scent. And really helps dry skin. My skin drys out and cracks and bleeds this helps keep it moisturized</li>
    <li> Excellent! Everything was super easy, love the product! Got it quick</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.  I AM A NURSE AND AT WORK I WASH MY HANDS A LOT.  THIS PRODUCT SAVED THEM THROUGH THE WINTER AT WORK.  NOW MY CO-WORKERS USE IT.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the best I have purchased. Have tried so many types for dry hands and the lotions never lasted very long before they evaporated. This lotion has a very nice smell, although strong at first...kinda smells like cherry bark. It does go on greasy, but that goes away within a minute or two and your hands are left feeling so nice and soft. Would definately recommend!</li>
    <li> great product; keeps my hands soft; kind of pricy; may not purchase again..</li>
    <li> Great smell and great texture!!!! I recommend it to anyone with dry hands, since it&#x27;s not really oily. I don&#x27;t like to feel oily</li>
    <li> Makes your hands feel super smooth.  Great for cold weather, cold water, cold wind of the winter.  I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Helped hands and nail&lt;br /&gt;Growth</li>
    <li> This product is just what I was looking for.  Not too oily.  Not greasy.  Absorbs nicely, leaving your hands so so soft.  I purchased extra for my mom, and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> great stuff. goes on creamy, and no mess. will continue to use forever.</li>
    <li> I love to use this product on my hands! Te shipping was fast. I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Not bad. Especially good for keeping your cuticle well conditioned. I work in a warehouse so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands. Smells identical to coconut lime verbena . Has a lotion like texture but with the moisturizing properties of Vaseline but better for your skin. Works well on feet too. Especially on dry skin on the toes.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this works...I couldn&#x27;t get over the sour coconut smell that this product has.</li>
    <li> It left my hands feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s, therefore very dry skin.  This hand cream is so wonderful and if I let anyone else try it, they love it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It leaves hands smooth and soft and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is the best substance on the planet for maintaining great hair and skin.  The combination of ingredients along with the Argan Oil, makes this one of the best hand creams I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I just love this lotion and will be re-ordering more.</li>
    <li> Initially purchased this product in a department store and it works miracles.  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite hand lotion. I love the fragrance and I am not allergic to it. It would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Loved the moisturizer so got this to try on my husbands rough, very rough workman&#x27;s hands. Works better than anything we have tried on both his hands and my feet! Already re-ordering with in a month of trying a small size because we use it so often we need more. Ordering a larger size because the quality is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting close to 50 and my hands get so dry.  A lot of lotions don&#x27;t help very much.  This lotion seems to actually moisturize my hands and even helps with the texture of my skin.  It works great for feet, too.  I use the lotion at bedtime and I rub an argan oil into my hands in the mornings after my shower.  It is a good combination for keeping moisture in my hands.</li>
    <li> I am an RN so I wash my hands constantly and this keeps my hands soft and helps prevent drying.  Everyone at work is using it too after they sampled mine.  The smell is great also ,like the beach.</li>
    <li> I but this for my mother-in-law who suffers from dry, cracked, chapped hands. She swears by it.</li>
    <li> I am a nanny in the morning and a Barista at night, so I wash my hands more that a ton of times a day. Thia product is so wonderful that I bought 2. One for my purse and the other for the house I nanny for.</li>
