### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
      <li>bUT they delivered it to me in a box thrown together without original boxes, SHAME !!!!!</li>
      <li>It is that good!  </li>
      <li>Great, but get the GEL version.</li>
      <li>Works great - prevents itching and redness.  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>This is not just good for the bikini zone, it is also good for underarms.  </li>
      <li>Either way, good value.</li>
      <li>so I do not if it is as good as bikini zone gel</li>
      <li>This kind separates.</li>
      <li>About 95% effective...</li>
      <li>Date is still good on the package however and seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>This cream is amazing, I figured once the bumps show up they are there till they heal, but I made a concerted attempt to follow all the good advice out there and have had success.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>pfb and tendskin are much better</li>
      <li>I will be able to shave more because it literally eliminates the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product, it really works to prevent bumps, razor marks etc.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
      <li>Wish they would do something to make it smell better.</li>
      <li>Have used this for years, it works great, highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was fine with it being a cream, well guess what it comes</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the very first use of this product, it reduced inflammation and ingrown hairs by about 90% or more.</li>
      <li>- you just have to apply it several times (which is fine because this is a great deal).</li>
      <li>I use both the gel and cream of the same brand and they work great for me.</li>
      <li>So glad that this is a clear gel.</li>
      <li>but you will be able to shave far more often and your skin will actually be fit for a swimsuit in public.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely clear the bumps, but better than northing</li>
      <li>in the bikini area, once used right after shaving.</li>
      <li>It works and doesn&#x27;t cause any undue burning right after shaving.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
      <li>Only way I am able to shave that area.  </li>
      <li>and this has been the first product that helps me.</li>
      <li>It really works, and is worth buying the three-pack.</li>
      <li>I saw this advertised so much decided to give it a try!</li>
      <li>I gave up home bikini grooming years ago, as all methods resulted in fast regrowth and/or rashes for days.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>It really does work.</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps with razor burn.  </li>
      <li>This works very well and has a soothing effect on your skin.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone going to the beach.</li>
      <li>However, it did appear to be fairly older and a little more of a runny liquid than I had seen before.</li>
      <li>It itches after you shave in certain sensitive areas.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because i have very sensitive skin and every time i shaved</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is a great product and i highly recommend it for sensitive skin for people that might have a bad reaction to razors.</li>
      <li>I exfoliated, then shaved with the Bikini Zone shave gel and a new Schick razor (with a swivel head) and then applied this creme out of the shower and then again 12 or so hours later.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works very well and has a soothing effect on your skin.  I highly recommend it for anyone going to the beach.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this ever again. I was fine with it being a cream, well guess what it comes and it is definitely not a cream! It is also not a gel. It is a very runny, almost like water, liquid that stinks like crazy! I will be contacting the seller and seeing if I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in the drug-stores, and often, it is sold out.  It is that good!  It decreases the redness and bumps at the bikini zone after shaving.  It really works, and is worth buying the three-pack.</li>
    <li> About 95% effective... noticed a big difference - you just have to apply it several times (which is fine because this is a great deal). First time I ordered it they came without the exterior packaging (tubes only), and this past time they actually came in the Bikini Zone box as pictured. Either way, good value.</li>
    <li> I was having a difficult time finding this product after Walgreen&#x27;s stopped carrying it.  It works tremendously, and it is less expensive when purchased in bulk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now. It really does work. When I don&#x27;t use it I notice I have red bumps and irritation. It says to use only after shaving or waxing but I use it daily for comfort. My only complaint would be it has an awful smell.</li>
    <li> This product works well overall.  However, it did appear to be fairly older and a little more of a runny liquid than I had seen before. Date is still good on the package however and seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 16 and it works wonders!! Don&#x27;t go without it! Makes razor burn disappear within minutes of application. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> The product does work, but the smell is horrible! It has a fishy type smell to it, which no woman would want \\&quot;down there\\&quot;. Wish they would do something to make it smell better.</li>
    <li> Everything I use never seems to get rid of the bikini bumps. I saw this advertised so much decided to give it a try! It burned and still left bumps! I was very unhappy and still in search of a bump free bikini zone!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i have very sensitive skin and every time i shaved i would get like a rash and it was awful. This is a great product and i highly recommend it for sensitive skin for people that might have a bad reaction to razors. I use both the gel and cream of the same brand and they work great for me. I hope they can do the same for you!</li>
    <li> So glad that this is a clear gel. I was afraid it would be some type of cream. There is no scent to it whatsoever which is also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product to stay trimmed so that I&#x27;m not bare but almost bare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally after every time I shave, I get about half a dozen ingrown hairs and also razor burn sometimes even though I don&#x27;t actually use a razor. Because of this, I don&#x27;t shave as often as I would prefer to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first use of this product, it reduced inflammation and ingrown hairs by about 90% or more. I think I had 2 irritated areas and that was it. I&#x27;m very impressed and I will continue to buy this product. I will be able to shave more because it literally eliminates the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though this is marketed towards women, I think guys could use this, too, and have it be just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave up home bikini grooming years ago, as all methods resulted in fast regrowth and/or rashes for days. This cream is amazing, I figured once the bumps show up they are there till they heal, but I made a concerted attempt to follow all the good advice out there and have had success. I exfoliated, then shaved with the Bikini Zone shave gel and a new Schick razor (with a swivel head) and then applied this creme out of the shower and then again 12 or so hours later. Bingo. Your hair will regrow as ever but you will be able to shave far more often and your skin will actually be fit for a swimsuit in public.</li>
    <li> I just got my bikini zone 3 pack, I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I do not if it is as good as bikini zone gel bUT they delivered it to me in a box thrown together without original boxes, SHAME !!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it really works to prevent bumps, razor marks etc. in the bikini area, once used right after shaving.</li>
    <li> It itches after you shave in certain sensitive areas.  In fact, often times, there begin to be ingrown hairs and it is just bad.  This takes care of the itchies as well as the ingrown hairs.  This is not just good for the bikini zone, it is also good for underarms.  This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works as stated ANYWHERE you shave.</li>
    <li> this product actually works elsewhere too!  I have Itching bumps after shaving my legs.  When apply after Hair Removal, it stop the irritation and doesn&#x27;t leave any redness or bumps.</li>
    <li> Only way I am able to shave that area.  Works great - prevents itching and redness.  Need to apply 2-3 times per day like directions say.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely clear the bumps, but better than northing</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works and doesn&#x27;t cause any undue burning right after shaving. eliminates bumps from shaving with a razor. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Tried for almost an hour and ended up tearing the plastic tube.&lt;br /&gt;My wife will never ever buy this again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do much. pfb and tendskin are much better</li>
    <li> It works, but if you are looking for an actual cream instead of a gel, DO NOT buy this product. It is basically the BikiniZone gel with a bit of white coloring added. I was looking for an actual lotion-based cream, whereas this is definitely gel-based.</li>
    <li> Great, but get the GEL version. This kind separates.</li>
    <li> Stops razor itch instantly</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps with razor burn.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this has been the first product that helps me.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, it works great, highly recommend it.</li>
