      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>It works wonderfully -</li>

      <li>Product works great.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>The smell is great and it gives my hair amazing volume.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It also adds some volume which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited because it got great reviews.  </li>
      <li>It comes in handy those mornings you realized you hit snooze too many times or just don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair.</li>
      <li>The spray is very, very fine</li>
      <li>Give it a good shake before you use it, then hold it 6-8 inches from your head and give a quick spray where you need it.</li>
      <li>I found it pleasant, fresh scent.</li>
      <li>The smell is ok but not anything I liked, I didn&#x27;t find it strong.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is okay</li>
      <li>I also wanted to add that I didn&#x27;t find the smell really overwhelming like some reviewers have stated.</li>
      <li>This works ok.</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a bit strong &amp; not everyone likes.</li>
      <li>I like the fine mist &amp; texture, but one star off for the smell</li>
      <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
      <li>And it takes some effort to clean it off when you shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve smelled other ones that are better but don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell all that specially either.</li>
      <li>It works great on my hair which is super fine and usually needs to be</li>
      <li>Also, after you spray it on, it leaves a light film at first, but you can either brush this out or rub your hair with your hand to get rid of it.</li>
      <li>and yes it leaves a white cast you have to work in, but it&#x27;s still much much much better!  </li>
      <li>Simply the best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using this product a few times to really give it a fair chance, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
      <li>I much prefer the Batiste dry shampoo, the smell is better and the price is better</li>
      <li>I used to use Suave and was happy enough but it always left my hair looking gray.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use very much for it to work well.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best dry shampoo there is.</li>
      <li>It does give me a little root volume which is always good.</li>
      <li>Having brightly colored hair I try to only wash my hair only once a week to preserve the color.</li>
      <li>The scent is subtle which is great since I am a nurse and don&#x27;t want to wear scents that might make my patients not feel well.</li>
      <li>To get a feel for how much product comes out I do recommend you just spray your hand or the sink</li>
      <li>The thing that really bothers me is the smell.</li>
      <li>My new favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Product has a refreshing smell the only thing that I do not like is that I would get white built up now and then... do not now if I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>It has a really strong and heavy smell when you first spray it on, so hold your breath.</li>
      <li>Came highly recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>As far as dry shampoos go, it is fine.</li>
      <li>I have been able to use this a few times and it has done the job well.</li>
      <li>(that&#x27;ll help add some volume to your hair, too), then style as normal.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>This is a new staple for me.</li>
      <li>Plus I feel as though it gives me some extra volume at my roots which I really like!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe the good reviews, this stuff did nothing but give my hair a coat of white powder which when combed through left my hair only SLIGHTLY less oily.  </li>
      <li>But as others have said you have to be careful to use lightly or you will build up white powder on your scalp...</li>
      <li>If you spray in one spot for a while there&#x27;s a chance it may look a bit white-ish, but that&#x27;s easily fixed by rubbing that spot with a towel.   </li>
      <li>This spray has saved the day multiple times when you really need a shampoo, but don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with a dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>(if you get too much on you CAN tell - you get like almost a grey wierdish color).</li>
      <li>Especially if you have dark hair (as the white will be even more obvious)</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair and it gives me VOLUME!</li>
      <li>You do have to be careful how much you use</li>
      <li>(I use it a few times a week for a root lift) and its so much better than any other dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have tried more expensive brands and less expensive brands in the past and have to admit that this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I do find that at times it lightly powders my hair while at other time it seems to heavily powder.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to use dry shampoo and some of the reviews on other sites weren&#x27;t stellar for this product.  </li>
      <li>I like that it really does allow me to go a day or 2 longer in between washes; not only does this product smell fresh, but it does not weigh my hair down or promote greasiness like some that I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I am very pleasantly surprised with this Dry Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair and it shows up white on my hair, so I really have to work it in well.</li>

<li> I have dark brown hair and it shows up white on my hair, so I really have to work it in well.</li>
<li> My hair looks just as greasy with this dry shampoo, only in addition, it leaves a white film, and makes your hair feel gross.</li>
<li> The dry shampoo helps me make it those last couple of days to wash day.</li>
<li> I have long hair but just spray this at my roots and wait about 30 seconds.</li>
<li> I use it as a &amp;#34;once in awhile&amp;#34; dry shampoo.</li>
<li> Double thumbs down.</li>
<li> This product does not change the color of my hair and lasts a lot longer than any other dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
<li> No, not for the price absolutely NOT.  </li>
<li> , like I have with other products.</li>
<li> I have used Rockaholic Dry Shampoo for a few years now.</li>
<li> I saw a negative review on a different amazon page for this product saying the girl didn&#x27;t like it because she ran out after 2 uses.</li>
<li> It seems to last at least two days for me after one use.</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair highlighted and I&#x27;ve never seen a residue.</li>
<li> Gives a bit of freshening and maybe helps it to not be so weighed down.</li>
<li> I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t make it look like I&#x27;m going grey, or like I dumped a bottle of baby powder on my head.</li>
<li> This does NOT work, what a huge disappointment!</li>
<li> The only recommendation I would give is to spray it at least 10 or so inches from the hair or it does go on a little thick and can be seen.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve smelled other dry shampoos that are worse</li>
<li> When it leaves a heavy coating it does take a bit longer to brush the powder around in my hair to spread it out</li>
<li> If your hair is oily or you just plain don&#x27;t feel like washing it some days, this is the product for you.</li>
<li> But since my hair is already dry, I didn&#x27;t feel like I could use it without making things worse.</li>
<li> Then I just style my hair as I usually would.</li>
<li> I shook and extra shook the can thinking maybe I was going about it wrong, but</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
<li> but I find just a small amount of this product sprayed on (goes on like hairspray) at the roots sops up that bit of grease that hair starts to get when it needs washed.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts me about two months</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m extremely disappointed</li>
<li> Really horrible.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>

    <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many! I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t make it look like I&#x27;m going grey, or like I dumped a bottle of baby powder on my head. This stuff works like a charm. Give it a good shake before you use it, then hold it 6-8 inches from your head and give a quick spray where you need it. If you spray in one spot for a while there&#x27;s a chance it may look a bit white-ish, but that&#x27;s easily fixed by rubbing that spot with a towel.   After you spray your oily spots I recommend massaging it in with your fingertips (that&#x27;ll help add some volume to your hair, too), then style as normal. It works great!  I also wanted to add that I didn&#x27;t find the smell really overwhelming like some reviewers have stated. I found it pleasant, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> This spray has saved the day multiple times when you really need a shampoo, but don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
    <li> My new favorite dry shampoo. I used to use Suave and was happy enough but it always left my hair looking gray.

    <li> As far as dry shampoos go, it is fine. Gives a bit of freshening and maybe helps it to not be so weighed down. But since my hair is already dry, I didn&#x27;t feel like I could use it without making things worse. I use it as a &amp;#34;once in awhile&amp;#34; dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Need an extra day between shampoo&#x27;s? This product is definitely for you! It works great on my hair which is super fine and usually needs to be shampoo&#x27;d daily. It also has a great citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Product has a refreshing smell the only thing that I do not like is that I would get white built up now and then... do not now if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo I have ever used.  This works well for oily hair.  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Simply the best dry shampoo on the market. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleasantly surprised with this Dry Shampoo. I have tried more expensive brands and less expensive brands in the past and have to admit that this is by far the best. I like that it really does allow me to go a day or 2 longer in between washes; not only does this product smell fresh, but it does not weigh my hair down or promote greasiness like some that I have tried in the past. Plus it does not cause my skin to break out, which has also been a problem for me w/ these types of products. Plus I feel as though it gives me some extra volume at my roots which I really like! The only recommendation I would give is to spray it at least 10 or so inches from the hair or it does go on a little thick and can be seen. I made this mistake but just used my fingertips to spread it out a bit and the product disappeared.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe the good reviews, this stuff did nothing but give my hair a coat of white powder which when combed through left my hair only SLIGHTLY less oily.  Um...No, not for the price absolutely NOT.  I was so excited because it got great reviews.  The smell is ok but not anything I liked, I didn&#x27;t find it strong.  I shook and extra shook the can thinking maybe I was going about it wrong, but no...it&#x27;s a dud.  I much prefer the Batiste dry shampoo, the smell is better and the price is better and yes it leaves a white cast you have to work in, but it&#x27;s still much much much better!  So bye bye Tigi.</li>
    <li> This works ok. I have dark brown hair and it shows up white on my hair, so I really have to work it in well. The thing that really bothers me is the smell. It&#x27;s horrible. Really horrible. Reminds me of the smell of nail polish remover. For that reason, I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have used Rockaholic Dry Shampoo for a few years now. It comes in handy those mornings you realized you hit snooze too many times or just don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair. A friend of mine who does hair got me a bottle and told me to try it. I have used it ever since. I saw a negative review on a different amazon page for this product saying the girl didn&#x27;t like it because she ran out after 2 uses. If you run out after 2 uses then let me just say that a good sign that you just need to take a shower! I get plenty of uses out of the bottle, you don&#x27;t need to use a ton. The fragrance is okay but I&#x27;ve smelled other dry shampoos that are worse and I&#x27;ve smelled other ones that are better but don&#x27;t work as good. I will continue to use this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the fine mist &amp; texture, but one star off for the smell that&#x27;s a bit strong &amp; not everyone likes.</li>
    <li> If your hair is oily or you just plain don&#x27;t feel like washing it some days, this is the product for you. It has a really strong and heavy smell when you first spray it on, so hold your breath. Also, after you spray it on, it leaves a light film at first, but you can either brush this out or rub your hair with your hand to get rid of it. And voila! Your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy anymore. A+</li>
    <li> This does NOT work, what a huge disappointment! I&#x27;ve tried using this product a few times to really give it a fair chance, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all! My hair looks just as greasy with this dry shampoo, only in addition, it leaves a white film, and makes your hair feel gross. It doesn&#x27;t smell all that specially either. Double thumbs down. Especially if you have dark hair (as the white will be even more obvious) don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use dry shampoo and some of the reviews on other sites weren&#x27;t stellar for this product.  I was pleasantly surprised. It works wonderfully - You do have to be careful how much you use but I find just a small amount of this product sprayed on (goes on like hairspray) at the roots sops up that bit of grease that hair starts to get when it needs washed.  It also adds some volume which is nice.  To get a feel for how much product comes out I do recommend you just spray your hand or the sink so you don&#x27;t go overboard (if you get too much on you CAN tell - you get like almost a grey wierdish color). I have dark brown hair highlighted and I&#x27;ve never seen a residue.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best dry shampoo there is. It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts me about two months (I use it a few times a week for a root lift) and its so much better than any other dry shampoo. I have thin, fine hair and it gives me VOLUME!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a dry shampoo. It works well. Having brightly colored hair I try to only wash my hair only once a week to preserve the color. The dry shampoo helps me make it those last couple of days to wash day. I do find that at times it lightly powders my hair while at other time it seems to heavily powder. When it leaves a heavy coating it does take a bit longer to brush the powder around in my hair to spread it out so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a powdered wig. I&#x27;m quite please with the product. It seems to last at least two days for me after one use.</li>
    <li> Product works great. Definitely extends time between Washington. Would have been 5 stars, except the sprayer mechanism broke and no shampoo comes out now. I&#x27;m only about halfway through the can so I&#x27;m extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I can definitely get an extra day or too between shampoos. But as others have said you have to be careful to use lightly or you will build up white powder on your scalp... And it takes some effort to clean it off when you shampoo.</li>
    <li> Came highly recommended by my hairdresser. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been able to use this a few times and it has done the job well. The spray is very, very fine so I haven&#x27;t felt like I had white powder to deal with, like I have with other products. The scent is subtle which is great since I am a nurse and don&#x27;t want to wear scents that might make my patients not feel well. It does give me a little root volume which is always good. Also, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use very much for it to work well. I have long hair but just spray this at my roots and wait about 30 seconds. Then I just style my hair as I usually would.</li>
