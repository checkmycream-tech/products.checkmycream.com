<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It thickens and holds my very fine hair without any buildup.  It&#x27;s also very easy to use</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  If you use hot rollers this is a great spray to use .  I use it on each hair section before I roll it. I have fine hair and live in the South (humidity).  It holds my curl until I comb it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product since they stopped selling it on HSN.  Love LiquiFIX better than some the foam products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Been using Liquifix for years for a good style aid.  I use it after every shampoo and between if needed.</li>
    <li> diCesare LiquiFIX Liquid Mousse is like no other hair product that I have used.  Most products I have tried in the past make my hair feel &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;.  This product has no sticky build up.  I apply this product daily to wet hair and then blow dry - it gives my hair just enough body to be manageable.  I LOVE that there is no sticky gummy buildup.</li>
    <li> I love this liquid mousse but the spay bottle itself does not work well so I just use my old bottle.  The product is perfect!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I cannot live without the LiquiFIX! I spray it on when my hair almost dry and style with a blow dryer &amp; brush.  It adds so much volume and body to my hair and looks great all day without adding drying hair spray!  It is a product I am never without!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for this product since it left HSN. This is the only product that will give my hair body and curl and I have very baby fine hair.  I have used this product for years. So glad I found it again.</li>
    <li> This product used on dry hair sparingly as you use your curling iron will give you great curls that last.  I have used this product for at least 10 years.  I even used it on my mom&#x27;s wet hair as I curled her hair with rollers and then put her under the dryer.  She also loved her hair.  I have not been able to find Liquifix and DiCesare on a program on tv I used to find him on.  So, I was so thankful when I found it at Amazon.com.  I will continue to purchase from them as I found them to be an excellent supplier.  Terry Beary</li>
    <li> Gives my hair that &amp;#34;almost has a curl&amp;#34; a curl, love it.</li>
    <li> When I originally ordered this product on line I paid a little more than half of what I just paid.  Although I like the product I think I can find a similar product out there that will do the same as LiquiFIX.  After all it is just a product that helps give you volume and hold for your do.</li>
    <li> I love this  product,  I use to get it on Home Shopping,  however you can&#x27;t anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it comes cloudly,  but still works,  better if its clear.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with the seller as it came quickly and wrapped  very good.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love LiquiFix!  I have been using it for years and never go anywhere without it!</li>
    <li> The best holding style product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not sticky or tacky and I often only use once between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product and as others bought this on HSN, but sadly Michael left and I am out of this. My hair just isn&#x27;t the same without the LiquiFix,,so Michael, please don&#x27;t stopped producing this product,,,we are out here.  Mary</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this for my sister-in-law who borrowed mine on her visit.  She typically doesn&#x27;t use any mousse but when she tried this, she loved it and asked me to purchase it for her.  I too believe it is a great product.  One has to make sure you only use a couple of quick sprays otherwise, you won&#x27;t get the great results.</li>
    <li> I first tried Michael diCesare&#x27;s hair line through HSN. I feel in love with it. Over time, it became harder and harder to find on the shopping network. So hence my search online, Amazon being my \\&quot;first-go-to\\&quot; website. This is a wonderful styling product as is his copper peptide shampoo which my husband and I both use. I was very pleased with the purchace, price and arrival time. I would not hesitate to purchase from Amazon again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i have used it for years</li>
    <li> ding dong!! this product is FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> Twelve years ago, I got a gift of some rollers an small bottle of LiquiFIX for a birthday present.  I instantly fell in love.  I have been addicted to this product ever since and don&#x27;t think I could live without it.  LiquiFIX is truly amazing and I hope that is around for many many years.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried anything like this, I highly recommend it.  This is the best stuff ever.  I use it with velcro rollers.  You just dry your hair, roll it up, and spray it with LiquiFIX.  Then put on your make up or drink coffee and after about 15 minutes, you pull the rollers out and you I have beautiful, full, smooth, sleek hair.  This is the best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> Curles delights, its what really describes this product, I used it for a long time when it was available at HSN, and could not say enought about it,  I have long straight and thick hair and cut it in layers, and since I&#x27;m unable to blow dry it like in the salon where it comes out with uplifted tips and it looks favolous, I just spray this after regular blow dry and roll my hair up with one of those flexible rolles and wola, its beautiful.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to use for you own style its great, I&#x27;m happy I found it at AMAZON will  definitly keep buying.</li>
    <li> I used to use this a long time ago and couldn&#x27;t gert it anywhere but HSN.  I found it on Amazon and purchased it.  I love it!!  I have very fine flat hair and this definately gives it lift and volume.</li>
    <li> This product (LiquiFIX Liquid Mousse) is the most outstanding hair product I have found in many, many years.  I have lived and travelled worldwide, and this I have used for years.  I am so upset that I can hardly find it anymore.  Amazon is the only website where I was able to locate it at a cheaper price than I was paying at HSN (and they don&#x27;t have it now).  Hence, I bought many bottles.  LiquiFIX is amazing for body, shine and volume.  I blowdry and curl my hair and have fantastic hair for whole day and the next day.  I use this product everyday.  I tell everyone.  I have 22 bottles in my cabinet and plan on buying more so I don&#x27;t ever run out.  Please don&#x27;t let this company stop making it.  Who do I write to?  This is an excellent product for your hair.  Try it, you will be saying the same thing no matter what; if your hair is thin, thick, short or long.</li>
    <li> Great for holding in curls w/o being too hard to brush thru.Hairspray is too harsh sometimes to use w/ hot rollers, this does the trick.</li>
    <li> I continue to reorder this product because it works .  It holds the hair style without daily resetting and gives the hair extra body and texture without any sticky build-up or flaky residue.  I hope diCesare liquidfix stays available for a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine. This is the only product that helps my hair curl and hold curl. It is not sticky or goopy and allows my hair to shine.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I love it, and try to never run out of it.  Works great with my hot rollers and heated brush.</li>
    <li> My wife has used Liquifix every day for a large number of years and has always highly recommended it. However, the latest ones purchased have disappointed, the texture of the mousse is different and more importantly, it simply does not work. It is not the same as it once was, please buy with caution !!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the rave reviews. I have short hair and honestly did not see what all the fuss was. It didn&#x27;t seem to be any different than any other mousse. I will probably will not buy again at the price point. I felt it left my hair with a dirty feeling. It took a few times to get the amount right but I still noticed my hair didn&#x27;t hold any better than the cheap store brand product.</li>
    <li> WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, WHERE I USUALLY BUT IT WAS SOLD OUT AND WOULD NOT BE GETTING MORE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, I AM SO GLAD I FOUND YOU.  THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Would highly recommend to anyone who needs&lt;br /&gt;extra bodyproduct for their hair,never  makes the hair&lt;br /&gt;dry .&lt;br /&gt;  C.H.&lt;br /&gt;  New Jersey</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this product. It works really well on wet hair with some smoothing drops any kind that you like to use and you will have lots of volume. Spray directly and it&#x27;s stiff and dirty looking so knowing how to use it is the key. I have used it for 10 years, I don&#x27;t know if I would like it if I didn&#x27;t color my hair to that ultra shine, I think if my hair was still youthful and natural in color I believe this product would dull it out, but due to the dye it works--if this makes sense to people.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only product that give my hair a style &amp; shine. Please don&#x27;t stop carrying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. The last order has dirty looking water inside the bottles. It is either really old or bad batch.. I will no longer recommend it or use it.</li>
    <li> One of the best  products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this spray on damp hair before I blow dry.  It gives a great set when I use a hot iron to add a touch of curl to my pixie cut.  I love the look afterwards!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love it, but it can be difficult to obtain.  So happy to see it sold on Amazon.  I have very thick, very coarse short hair.  This is the one styling product I have found that enables me to get a fluffy, somewhat curled look using an electric styling brush, but I&#x27;m sure it would work well with other styling devices and other types of hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years. Thank You !</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived promptly and was carefully packaged. I buy LiquiFIX several times a year and always on-line because It&#x27;s not available in stores and I will always buy through Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, Fast Shipping, Will do business again!  Highly Recommend! A+++++</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of the LiquiFix recently. Product works great. The problem was with the pump/spray. Instead of a mist it came out too heavy. Both bottles had this problem. Have used this product years ago and the spray system worked better.</li>
    <li> I have strait thin hair. This product is good for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best hair mousse. It&#x27;s a spray on liquid that takes only 15 minutes to set my fine hair and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> The best ever for holding body into my fine hair!!!  Use this with his rollers and it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
    <li> The sprayer does not spray it only streams.  Not a good thing at all.  Have never gotten one like this.  Will have to try to find some kind of bottle that will spray it.  It is a little bit thicker than water and I am having a hard time finding a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have had a bottle of this product in my cabinet for years, but have never used it.  I&#x27;ve been conned into using other  professional products sold through my hairdresser at much higher prices.  Now that I&#x27;m looking at &amp;#34;downsizing&amp;#34; in retirement, thought I would give this product a try.  WOW...amazing!  My hair is very fine and getting thinner with age, but I fool everyone at work...they think I have thick, curly hair.  Works as a root lifter, on wet hair or dry hair.  My favorite trick is to spray it into my palm, clap my hands together and then work thru my hair.  I get even more volume!  Love it!!  I am 67 years old and have been coloring my hair for a long time.  This does not dry it out, but actually gives me a little gloss.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this mousse for years.  It is great for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> when my hair is wet I scrunch it into the curls, always dries perfect no frizz</li>
    <li> This is not the same product I have used for several years.  - I re-ordered this in hopes that is was just a bad batch, unfortunately, the product doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other similar products on the market, but I&#x27;ve found that this hair styling product is the best for my hair. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> The rating loses one star because I love the product BUT the sprayer nozzle always clogs up, even at the very first time one uses it.  Instead of a fine spray mist, a strong stream jets out; not exactly the best way of spraying it on your hair, is it? I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it under hot water, but it doesn&#x27;t help.  If anyone can tell me what to do, I&#x27;d be grateful - and the product would earn all five stars!</li>
    <li> ONLY THING THAT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;Do you or your kids wake up with crazy hair?  This is the ONLY product we&#x27;ve found that makes my kids hair lay down in the morning.  1-2 spritzes where their hair is standing up, comb through and perfection!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using for at least 10 years.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SUPER THIN STRAIGHT HAIR.  I SPRAY THIS ON MY HAIR BEFORE I PUT IN VELCRO ROLLERS, AFTER I BLOW DRY MY HAIR. HOLDS THE CURL GREAT AND GIVES IT ALOT OF BODY. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest mousse I have found.  Gives body to my ultra fine hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> my hair loves this product !!</li>
    <li> I recommend it to everyone.  Wonderful product, hope they never discontinue it because there&#x27;s nothing else out there like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a hair dresser in a bottle!! Squirt it on; comb out hair; let dry a few minutes and then blow dry.  That&#x27;s all you have to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Recently found it on Amazon.com.  I love this product and hope to be able to continue to get on Amazon for years to come.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> When I received this order the sprayers did not work on either bottle. Amazon immediately refunded the purchase price. I love this mousse.  It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and when I style my hair with Liquifix it gives body and volume. Spray it on damp hair especially the roots and it really helps.</li>
    <li> Bought this originally on HSN but they didn&#x27;t have it anymore when I needed more so I was thrilled when I found it here!  That brand also had a root lift spray I love too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using diCesare LiquiFIX with Michael&#x27;s rollers for several years now.  It&#x27;s the fastest, easiest way to get some curl in your hair, and the set lasts.  I&#x27;m not good with a curling iron and hot rollers take longer.  I recommend this product to anyone of any age.</li>
    <li> The best ever out there</li>
    <li> please keep this product in your repertoire. I love it and couldn&#x27;t manage my hair without it. I will be ordering again</li>
    <li> Have been using for several years.  Have been unable to localy.  Got here in excellent time and packed with much care.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me the ability to buy at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I a fine hair headed.  Ugh.  But this product is great.    I have always used it as directed with the roller set but I&#x27;m going to try the first reviewers way now.    This product is a must have for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It makes my fine, damaged, blows-around hair have shape, shine, more bulk, and it stays put.  It also protects and seals the hair shaft when I style and smooth it using heat..  I hate sticky uncontrollable blobs of mousse.  LiquiFIX&#x27;s light spray that I can direct exactly where I want it is so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this prodcut for a long time and was happy to find a supplier.  I&#x27;m set for a while but will be back when I get low.</li>
    <li> Makes hair so sticky and horrible looking... I had to wash my hair again immediately after using this product, that&#x27;s how bad this product made my hair feel... Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR, BUT IT&#x27;S FINE. I SPRAY MY HAIR THEN USE MY CURLING IRON! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I love liquifix.  I&#x27;ve been hooked on it since I bought it originally on HSN or QVC.  I never been a fan of mousse or hairspray because it always made my hair hard and crunchy.  I tried liquifix and was amazed at how soft and manageable my hair was and it still held the style I wanted.  For instance I love volume and long luxurious waves in my hair but my hair is fine and thin, so I straighten it and then put my hair up in a ball on top of my head and spray liquifix all over my head.  An hour or so later I have hair that looks like I&#x27;ve just been to a salon.  Basically, liquifix keeps the style I want for how long I want without that hard crunchy feel.  Plus 1 bottle can last you for a couple of months and since I got 2, I&#x27;m also set for a while.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years; and it is the best liquid moose on the market. I roll my long hair dry and then use this moose and then dry it for about 5 minutes  with my hair blower. Looks great and stays.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product several years, I have fine hair and I look like I have a lot of hair w/this product.  I do not use hot rollers anymore.  Thanks for this product Michael.</li>
    <li> I use this product on damp hair with a little gel. I am 77yrs. old with fine hair.  This adds body and shine and manageability.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I actually set my hair with this product and it is the only way I get any curl that actually stays for a while.  Keeps your hair soft after it is combed out.</li>
    <li> Product as expected but slight leakage from one of the bottles...package was wet</li>
    <li> This is the only thing my elderly and picky mother in law uses regularly to help manage her hair style.  Her hair is thick and full, but this makes her style managable</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Gives nice hold to my thin hair.  Lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;I dry my hair, add a few rollers and spray this on them. Then I apply my makeup ( about 10 minutes) and remove the rollers. My style holds nicely using this product in this fashion.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive from New York!  A shame on can&#x27;t aget it in the UK. Best product on the market for my hair as can use with heated rollers - perfect fix as not sticky etc</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time. And absolutely love it. It holds your curls and it lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t found another product like this. It is amazing. Although this last order of bottles I ordered from thi seller is not the same product. The bottle looks different and the product is really thick.  It sprays in a stream... it&#x27;s so frustrating. I will be returning. It&#x27;s not the normal diCesare  Liquid Fix.</li>
    <li> excellent product - use almost everytime with rollers to give beautiful curls to your straight hair everytime.  Absolutely marvellous product unfortunately had to pay a lot of tax - can you Amazon not bring this item into the country ???</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using Michael DiCesare liquifix liquid mousse for many many years.  We love it.....gives the hair body when styling and blow drying yet it is not heavy or sticky.  It is not messy to apply.  We ran out for awhile and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  My husband was surfing thru Amazon and found the product available and in stock.  We ordered 2 2paks.  I hope to never run out of this again. Thanks Michael and amazon.</li>
    <li> I received it in good condition.  They taped the bottles so they wouldn&#x27;t leak.  I have bought this off HSN in the past and didn&#x27;t see it there.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with this product. It is not the same as I have bought before. I have purchased this on QVC and HSN and had wonderful results. It does not give the same results. I feel as if I have been snookered!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It does just what i want it to. Makes my hair fuller and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and love it. When my daughter comes and visits, it seems to disappear. So, last order I bought us each one. I hope to always be able to purchase this, liquifix.</li>
    <li> I use this product with Velcro rollers. A light spray first and another spray on top of the rolled hair. It dries while I am doing my makeup and the brushed out hair is manageable, curled, and soft.  It is not stiff as with mousse. It is the best product that I have found and I am sure to get compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years it is great</li>
    <li> Nothing like it!  This liquid spray works like magic to refresh your hairstyle.  Just a small spray and blowdry will reset your hair back to its perfect style and hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, and it works with dry or wet hair.  Also good to travel with too.  I&amp;#34;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am 71 and have short hair and just need a little volume on top. LiquiFIX is never sticky, a couple of quick sprays is all it takes for lasting volume all day. I started using this, at least 12 years ago, first from QVC, then HSN, then Bed Bath and Beyond and now thank goodnes I&#x27;ve found it again on Amazon.com.  If I&#x27;m willing to keep trackng it down it is because I can&#x27;t be without it.  My bottles last a long time and I love the little travel size for overnight trips.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair more volume and it helps my fine hair to hold a style.  I love this product also.</li>
    <li> I Have used Liquifix for years and was so happy to discover I can purchase it here.  I use it daily in my hair styling. I have very fine hair and it makes the set hold.</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would do.  It held my curls for two days. It was easy to use and was not sticky.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years.  Use it with curling rollers as it drys fast and sets the curl you may need in a short period of time. It gives the body in the hair I am looking for.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and this is a good price.  I use it before drying my hair or if I use Velcro rollers, I will spray my hair after curling.  My hair comes out smooth and this product helps hold the curl longer.  My package was leaking a little but the caps were sealed so not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> used it once before and loved it but, but this time around not sure of it? lokking for something else. any suggestions????</li>
    <li> Best hair liquid mousse ever!!  Could not live without it....</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Used to buy it elsewhere and they stopped carrying it. Its the only product I have ever found to put a curl or lift to my hair and have it stay in for a long time. Keep this product around as I will be back when I run out. Also bought some for a friend, so she is hooked as well!</li>
    <li> This product is good for men and women with thinning hair.  It makes the hair managable and appears thicker without weighting it down.  I use it every morning.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and have tried so many products that did nothing for me. I first saw diCesare LiquiFix on a home shopping show and tried it from there.  It wasn&#x27;t a miracle, but it did actually work for me.  I spray a little on before blow drying, then to style I add&lt;br /&gt;it to my dried roots and use a curling iron (at the roots) for lift.  I can run my fingers through it to style, then I might give it another spritz for hold (instead of a hairspray).  You can comb or brush through this and there is no flaking, and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel dirty.  I used to wash every day, now I can go longer.  I can even re-style on top of the product already on and that&#x27;s a first for me.  My biggest complaint is that the home shopping show no longer carries this.  It was at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for a while, then they stopped carrying it.  I have a trusted seller on Amazon that I buy from and hope she continues to offer this.  I do try other products from time to time but nothing measures up to LiquiFix for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I just reordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that gives lift and body to my fine hair.  After shampooing, I spray my damp hair with diCesare LiquiFIX; then I just use my blow dryer and a round styling brush to style my hair. That&#x27;s it!  This product gives my hair plenty of volume without making my hair stiff, sticky, or gummy.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product for many years.  This is the only place I can find this for her.  She swears by this product.  She has used others and always goes back to this.  She gets awesome volume and her hair looks really thick.</li>
    <li> product does what it is suppose to and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Everything was fine on the shipping also.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and was so happy to see it offered on Amazon and at such a good price.  It is the only product I have ever tried that truly tames my thick ,dry, wild hair without burying it under loads of conditioner that makes it look and feel dead.  I spray the LiquiFix on my wet hair before I blow dry and when I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s shiny and managable and looks great.  I would recommend this product to everyone, regardless of what type of hair you have.  It really does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed.  This is not the same quality as the LiquiFix they sold on HSN.  This is a VERY watered-down version of the original LiquiFix.  I will not purchase again. So sad.</li>
    <li> Love this product it gives my hair so much volume shine and bounce.Try It You&#x27;ll Love It !!! Great price! Fast Ship!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, What was in these bottles are not what it is suppose to be. They came with some sort of plastic on the caps that was leaking when I took them out of the box. I am having serious doubts about ordering from this site again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and works great.  I have used for years and when no longer available on HSN I finally found on Amazon. Can&#x27;t do my hair without it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent mousse for the hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff, would  not be without it.  Keeps my styled hair looking great, from week to week.</li>
    <li> One great hair product. Easy fix. Perfect hair style mousse.</li>
    <li> have always liked the lift from this product...makes style last</li>
    <li> Great as always. Arrived in fast order and the product is one I don&#x27;t want to do without.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hairdo going all day even in New Orleans humidity. I&#x27;m almost out again. 2 bottles last a year. Need to order.</li>
