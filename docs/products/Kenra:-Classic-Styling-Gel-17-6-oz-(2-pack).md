    <li> I have medium length, mostly gray/white hair with some natural wave.  My hairdresser was using this on  my hair and recommended I get it.  She told me what she paid as a hairdresser at the beauty supply.  I check Amazon.com first for just about everything and you beat the price by several dollars.  It was on the front porch before time to wash my hair again.  I love the gel.  My hair holds the style so I need less spray.  I highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> Many years ago my hairdresser used Kenra on my hair.  I was hooked.  I moved many states away from home this year and didn&#x27;t know how to obtain this product.  Voila!  Amazon.com came to my rescue.  I searched and found Kenra and ordered a 2 pack.  This gel is great.  And so is Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I can use! Doesnt dry my hair and its not greasy, I&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds and THIS is the one</li>
