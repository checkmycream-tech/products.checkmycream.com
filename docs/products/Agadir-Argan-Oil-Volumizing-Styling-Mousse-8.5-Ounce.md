      <li>Wonderful smell, strong but light</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I was anticipating a great product that might help give lift and volume to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>It has a nice hold and once you use it, I have not found the need to use it every day because it holds a set.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice plus for me.</li>
      <li>This gives nice volume.  </li>
      <li>The package was nicely wrapped and arrived in a box.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product twice and agree with the label that it moisturizes and has a super great aroma that \\&quot;awakens your senses\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This Mouse has a very strong fragrance I would&#x27;ve returned it</li>
      <li>Nice stuff; like the foam; like the smell; like the way my hair looks; lasts looking well for more than one day.</li>
      <li>Its ok if you like oil in your hair, nice aroma but don&#x27;t care for product, gave it to a friend who uses oil treatments.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best mousse I have tried.  </li>
      <li>These products are not heavy and oily they work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>The top breaks very easily</li>
      <li>Price was even better.</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>Love the quality and the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>

      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the Agadir products  </li>
      <li>This is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love the mousse --</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like 2 products in 1, a styling mousse &amp; a leave in conditioner  :-)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this elsewhere</li>
      <li>It seems that the creatively designed nozzle which looks great does not work very well.</li>
      <li>and this is the best mousse for keeping the frizz out of my hair and allowing me multiple stylying choices.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Not so many products are up for this job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly the product I needed for my hair.  Love it ! Saved lots of money buying through Amazon verses the Salon.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gives hair a thick look</li>
    <li> I use this to spray on my damp hair before blowing dry to keep it protected and shiny.  It helps mend split ends.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use, does a great job! My hair does not look &amp;#34;spray starched.&amp;#34; It has a slight fragrance but it&#x27;s a nice smell and fades quickly. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> I really like Agadir Argan Oil Mousse.  It leaves my hair soft, not dry and my hair stays in place.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Way cheaper on Amazon - I recommend this product for any style of hair. It is very light weight and make my hair smell great.</li>
    <li> I have used other products by Agadir (shine spray, shampoo, conditioner, and now mousse), and I love it!  It smells great, it keeps a good hold, and it makes my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this mousse, everyone makes comments about my hair whenever i wear it and they can smell it too, very happywith this hair product.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse heavy hair.  This gives me the&lt;br /&gt;Lift I need at my roots without drying out&lt;br /&gt;My hair. There is no alcohol or parabens in this product</li>
    <li> Love this mousse!  I have thick wavy hair and live in the south, so the humidity can make it frizzy.  This product controls the frizz, and helps define my curls like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.  All that, and it smells great, too.</li>
    <li> What a great product! Fantastic volume, hold, shine and smell. Makes my hair look healthy!  It only requires a small amount, so don&#x27;t over use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, I am so pleased.  its like finding and bargain in a department store and you call all your friends and tell them about it. GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say I like this product, but I was able to get very little out of the can.  I love their shampoo and conditioner and the leave in oil hair treatment, but the styling products fall short.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this mousse on me and I really like it.  I was able to get it at a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Loves how it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is awful!  It truly smells like you&#x27;re running a man&#x27;s cologne through your hair.  The product itself is nothing special at all.  After reading the reviews, I was anticipating a great product that might help give lift and volume to my fine hair.  It works AVERAGE - at best...nothing at all to write home about.  TOTAL waste of $.  :-(</li>
    <li> Not sticky.  Gives great volume and texture.  Makes my hair feel and look a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> Great service &amp; product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Agadir Argan Oil Styling Mousse for a couple of weeks now and it has eliminated the static and fly aways argan oil treatments can cause. Using both Agadir Oil and Agadir Mousse has made another big difference in the health and shine of my hair. It has a strong perfume smell when you apply it but it fades as your hair dries. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on the health and shine of my hair. I&#x27;m sold on this product and would recommend it&#x27;s use to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray! I wanted something that was similar to moracon oil hair spray without the cost and I found it with this product!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair smell wonderful but it doesn&#x27;t do much as a mousse.  After shaking and inverting, the foam comes out of the bottle nicely and is readily converted to a liquid to put in your hair.  I have used a little bit, a medium sized amount and tried a large amount with no apparent effect.  Maybe if you want a very gentle mousse this would be the product for you but if you&#x27;re looking for hold, this one doesn&#x27;t deliver.  Again, it does have a great scent.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the fast service and I will use it for future purchases.  This is a very good product, the best I found in a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mousse!! I have extremely fine/flat hair and this product does give my hair shine and volume.  It also smells great and the scent lasts about 8-10 hours.  I use a baseball size amount in my hair and make sure my hair is a little dry, very little, doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well if you try putting it into your hair just out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Very nice product but don&#x27;t use too much. A little goes a long way. Works great styling hair.  l&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thick wavy/curly &amp; dry hair</li>
    <li> This does not have the hold that I was looking for out of it. Although it does have a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well with my hair as the other Agadir Argan Oil products do.  NOt sure I would ever purchase again.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a styling mousse that I would get to style like any other mousse product. Not the case, it says on the directions to apply to DRY hair then style. My whole intention was to use this as a styling product when my hair was damp not dry. Would not recommend for use when wanting to style with a somewhat firm hold.</li>
    <li> The texture of the mousse is in good foamy quality. Light and easy to apply over the hair. The foam holds for reasonable amount of time. The container has good weight of mousse in it. The package was nicely wrapped and arrived in a box. I ordered four items and and arrived in proper condition and timely manner. Will defintely be a return buyer as long as the price remains attractive.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Holds style in place without any stiffness.  Gives my hair a healthy, shiny look.  Incredibly easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;m a black man with naturally curly/wavy hair. I like to accentuate my curl pattern without using heavy pomades or things that are just too heavy or too oily.  This product is what I was looking for.  The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it would if my hair is short.  Sometimes I like to grow my hair out to a longer length to get the larger curls but this just does not help with my hair longer.  But other than that, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice and agree with the label that it moisturizes and has a super great aroma that \\&quot;awakens your senses\\&quot;. The problem is I can&#x27;t get the foam out of the can. It seems that the creatively designed nozzle which looks great does not work very well. Sorry to say, I won&#x27;t buy this a third time.</li>
    <li> It did not give my  hair volume but instead dried it out. I tossed it.</li>
    <li> This mousse is great. Leaves your hair silky smooth and smelling terrific</li>
    <li> I have to use it with additional root lifter. My hair is very fine, so it needs for me, an extra kick.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, strong but light hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;I re ordered 2 before I finished the first.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !! I have curly hair and I use it to define my curls. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or crunchy at all and I can wear bouncy two day hair without it looking lifeless . It smells great ! It is totally worth your money</li>
    <li> This styling mousse is fantastic.  It holds hair for styling, yet is not heavy and it smells terrific!  I now have all of the Agadir Argan products which I use daily.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing on hair loved it.</li>
    <li> I dont think its authentic. the pump is different from the original bought in store. and doesnt hold like the original does. i had to go to cvs and buy the authentic one cause something is fishy  about this one!</li>
    <li> Used to buy this product from my hairdresser, but she&#x27;s no longer cutting hair.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a local store so&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from Amazon.  Love the mousse -- it&#x27;s light and not sticky.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is light and easy to shape without shinning greasy look,&lt;br /&gt;No hairspray needed. Great product for dry areas such as desert locations</li>
    <li> This mousse is AMAZING! I have fairly curly/wavy hair and I don&#x27;t like to do much with it so this mousse is perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a low-maintenance product. I just put it in and go! The smell is incredible, and it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I recieved my argan moose today an I tryed it out on my hair while dry I have alot of baby hairs so I wanted to see if this would tame them while my hair was in a bun and sadly it didnt which i half expected any way cause it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or that stinky residue most hair products have... but I still like it because it foams very well, it does leave a shine to my hair as well as leaving it soft, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t harm my scalp if I sweat like other harsh hair products all in all it does as advertised an it does smell like a mans cologne lol a very old man &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> They use it at the salon I go to and I had to have it.  I love it and I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This is an okay mousse, but I don&#x27;t think I will get it again. I understand it has rave reviews, but I just don&#x27;t find it to be any better than suave or herbal essences. Maybe that&#x27;s just the nature of mousse; it&#x27;s a hard product to get wrong.  At least the bottle seems to be lasting a while, but I still think you will get better value for money out of the cheaper brands. Save you cash for the hair oils which DO make a difference, but get macademia oil over this brand&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
    <li> Foam mousse might be old news for some. For me however, it is a must! I blow my naturally curly hair out every day. I use this mousse every three days. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mousse I have tried.  I highly recommend it!  It will leave your hair shiny, soft, manageable and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;It gives it body without feeling weighed down, or sticky. It&#x27;s like 2 products in 1, a styling mousse &amp; a leave in conditioner  :-)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and was looking for a product that makes my hair look healthy, without being crunchy. This worked wonders. The next day i curled my hair with a curling iron with this product in, and omg my hair has never looked so amazing after being heat styled!</li>
    <li> Great hair care line!  I have re-purchased several other items from this hair care line.  All are superior quality products.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this producr 0 stars!! It certainly does not volumize (except maybe the seller&#x27;s bank account). The product was delivered on a very hot day and was quite warm to the touch. It hardly foams up. What&#x27;s worse is that this product is not eligible for a refund. So buyer beware!! Maybe no one should purchase certain items from Amazon in hot weather. Did this cause the mousse to be almost liquidy instead of moussey or is it just an inferior product that definitely costs too much?</li>
    <li> the style and smell are wonderful.......... it really holds your hair the way you want it too. ill always keep some in stock.</li>
    <li> Great product. Price was even better. I will continue to order when I need more.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> Helps give fantastic body - easy to use - light - doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down!  Keeps the frizz away!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time that I use a hair mousse that does not STICK to my hair and makes it look un-natural.&lt;br /&gt;I like it that it controls the heavy humidity that my hair goes through everyday living in South Florida. Not so many products are up for this job.</li>
    <li> My hair looks so shiny and is fuller and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Its ok if you like oil in your hair, nice aroma but don&#x27;t care for product, gave it to a friend who uses oil treatments. Olive oil is better so since not satisfied with results only one star here.</li>
    <li> I love the Agadir products  the is the 1st time I turned the mousse. It keeps my hair soft and shiny while adding curl, body and bounce.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick curly hair that I color alot and I also use a flat iron every day.  I am always looking for a hair product that will smooth my hair without making it greasy and this product is AMAZING!!  If you have curly or thick hair or damaged hair and you want something inexpensive and easy to take away the frizz and add shine; this will do it!!  I&#x27;ve tried sooo many hair products over the years so I am really skeptical about products that claim to work.  This product really does; you WILL LOVE IT!!  I have gotten so many compliments on my hair and asked what I did differently.  I also don&#x27;t write reviews on products but I had to with this one.</li>
    <li> Like all Adigir products this styling mousse is wonderful.  It gives my hair shine and volume.  I just partially dry my hair and then add a small amount of the mousse and finish drying it and then style with curling and flat iron.  Has a wonderful fragrance too!!</li>
    <li> This is very good product, the only problem is the container. The top breaks very easily and I&#x27;ve got 2 of these that I can&#x27;t use.  DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product that I am no longer able to buy locally. Really nice to be able to keep using a product that I love instead of getting on the merry-go-round of trying new products.</li>
    <li> Gives great volume. Love this product</li>
    <li> I love it. It leaves my air inky Smooth and soft. I will keep buying this product, and other products of this brand.</li>
    <li> Gave me the volume I&#x27;m asking for . I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. And I also love the smell!</li>
    <li> This product was new for me.  I love how it does not weigh my hair down and leaves a wonderful shine.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair felt heavy and sticky. I&#x27;ll give one star, because it smells great.</li>
    <li> It is very drying and almost frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give it ZERO star if i could</li>
    <li> The best mousse for my hair, I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Lovely smell and works very well!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good styling mousse. I would say try it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!!!!! I have thin curly hair, and agadir argan oil volumizing moose just gives it so much life! Seriously one of the BEST volumizing product I&#x27;ve tried! Leave my hair super big love love love it! THANKS!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair, because of age is thining, I try differents products, but nothing work like this one</li>
    <li> I made a huge and expensive mistake of buying into the whole Argan oil hype. I purchased this, the shampoo and conditioner, and hair spray only to be extremely disappointed. This mousse really does not provide any volume nor does it make my hair any smoother than if I were to do without. I know because I tested my theory. I will return to using Toni and Guy products.</li>
    <li> I stayed away from styling mousse for many years because it left my hair dry and flaky; Agadir styling mousse is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and it works great! It gives you the volume as if it gave you another set of hair on top of your hair. Definately a great product and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. Did leave my hair feeling sticky but smooth and soft yet held up against the outside elements. Great product!</li>
    <li> It works well, too much makes hair too soft and heavy. Does not match Silk Foam that was taken off the market.  I wish they would bring Silk back,</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for my think curly hair!  I use this then put on the Argan oil by Agadir!  Great price and smells good!  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love the quality and the way it makes my hair look and feel. Use it every day. Fast shipping. Cost is right</li>
    <li> Love this mousse, I also use the conditioner. Gives me lots of volume, I use it after every wash. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for anout seven months and it works well, however the most recent bottle has been more diffucult to use.  Product does not dispense as easily and is not as foamy</li>
    <li> Buying this product changed the way my hair looked completely,  in a good way. When im done putting this product on my hair looks and smells great. And its pefect for styling.</li>
    <li> For some reason my hair HATES&lt;br /&gt;this mousse, I&#x27;ve used it 3&lt;br /&gt;different times alternating&lt;br /&gt;oils with it and everytime&lt;br /&gt;my hair ends up ExTrEmElY&lt;br /&gt;dried out and later on really&lt;br /&gt;fRiZzY and I don&#x27;t want to&lt;br /&gt;come against Agadir products&lt;br /&gt;because I&#x27;m in LOVE with their&lt;br /&gt;shampoo, conditioner and mask&lt;br /&gt;which is why I bought this but it&lt;br /&gt;was a waste of money for me&lt;br /&gt;personally.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product smells and the idea of what it is supposed to do with the benefits of Argan oil but would not use as a mousse. I think of mousse as something to give your hair a little lift at the roots but this product did not deliver for me.</li>
    <li> I use this when I curl my hair with my hot rollers. The curls stay all day, and my hair shines.</li>
    <li> So disappointed... I think the product wasn&#x27;t I just use it one day and after two days it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff; like the foam; like the smell; like the way my hair looks; lasts looking well for more than one day. I stopped washing my hair every day, and it looks good, which is great because I worry about washing too often as I was doing before.</li>
    <li> Perfume smell is over powering and it doesn&#x27;t hold my curl, it makes it fly away. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Mouse has a very strong fragrance I would&#x27;ve returned it but they don&#x27;t take returns.</li>
    <li> it was ok, a little too stickey.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous! These products are not heavy and oily they work wonderfully. It has a nice hold and once you use it, I have not found the need to use it every day because it holds a set. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have dry curly hair from getting blonde highlights throughout my life. This mouse never dried out my scalp always made my hair shine smell awesome a curl the best any mousse ever could.</li>
    <li> For my hair, it was too heavy and by the end of the day, my hair was flat. Going to try the gel.</li>
    <li> I use this when I wear my hair curly. It adds shine and it does not get crunchy. The scent is great like all of the argan oil products have.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this mousse.  I put it in at the locker room, it was almost dry about 45 minutes after I got to the office.  I have a wave in my hair and this product let the waves keep their shape.</li>
    <li> How are people writing that this stuff smells good?? After putting this on, I smell like a cheap hooker. This stuff will give you a ghetto aura. For the price, seriously go with something else</li>
    <li> This mousse does what it&#x27;s supposed to to.....it holds my hair, isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey, and looks and feels natural to the touch.</li>
    <li> With this volumnizing mousse hair looks thicker and it is not drying. Most mousse makes my hair look dusty. Not Agadir Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product much different from any regular product sold in drug stores.  I did not notice extra shine or much volume but it did leave my hair with more softness.  I probably will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Very strong yet light .  Isn&#x27;t one to leave a heavy residue.  Smells wonderful as well.  I strongly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> This gives nice volume.  The little bit of fragrance is nice.  I would recommend it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Okay hold, hair gets a little matte, but I love the way it smells. The product itself expands to about three times what you would need to come out of the tube, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Worst Product I have ever tried...it leaves my hair totally dry and dehydrated. I know that in general Agadir products are great &amp; hence doubt if the product is a genuine one. Its not even eligible for a return!!</li>
    <li> appears to be very moisturizing  and smells fantastic</li>
    <li> I have long blonde hair and this is the BEST! It makes my hair silky smooth without a residue feeling.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this on my curly hair when she straightens it. It helps give me volume without drying it out. A little goes a long way. It is no different than the products you get from the store. Works just as good.</li>
    <li> My first time using and it makes your hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I ordered a second bottle way before the first was gone...I haven&#x27;t been able to find this elsewhere and I love it. I keep my hair in a towel for several minuets before applying. It works beautifully, nice shine and soft tot the touch.</li>
    <li> Did not like.  Made my hair greasy</li>
    <li> Well the name of this product does say &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; so I should not be surprised that it felt a little oily in my hair.  I have fine, thin, somewhat oily hair and this wasn&#x27;t the right product for me personally.  Not a bad mousse, but I prefer those with a stronger, crisper hold (and no smell).</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this is the best mousse for keeping the frizz out of my hair and allowing me multiple stylying choices.</li>
    <li> As you will see with all of my Agadir reviews, I absolutely love this productline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have to be one of the best mousse I&#x27;ve used on my hair, ever. I have fine, then, hair that doesn&#x27;t take well to a lot of other products. Most other products way my hair down and make it look worse. I Agadir actually makes it look better, healthier, stronger, and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the way it smells, like the hairspray, when it first goes on. But I get so many compliments throughout the day that I am overall extremely pleased with the smell!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best mousse ever! It coats my hair but it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or crunchy. I will definitely be buying this again+</li>
    <li> Great.&lt;br /&gt;Does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> The product delivers volume as promised. I have been using the argan oil products for more than a year and Amazon has the best value. The scent is a nice plus for me.</li>
    <li> but this mousse made hair feel stiff (even after much brushing) and very dulling of the little shine I had</li>
    <li> Again, another product which did not work for me.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. Works very well for her, I enjoy the scent as well.</li>
    <li> Bought a 2nd one, the same day I received the first one</li>
    <li> Smells very good unlike the chemically ridden ones. I have only used it twice so far. The hold is not as strong as the suave, pantene, herbal essence ones I have used.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair shiny, styled and helps with frizz</li>
</ol>
