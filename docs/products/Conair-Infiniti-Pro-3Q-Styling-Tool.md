      <li>I am truly impressed with this hairdryer.</li>
      <li>best blow dryer i have ever owned!!</li>
      <li>And the best part is my hair does not frizz!</li>
      <li>and when I use the diffuser, it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>The best hair dryer ever !!!!!!!</li>
      <li>AWESOME!</li>
      <li>Love it!!!!!!</li>
      <li>best I&#x27;ve seen even at 3x the price....</li>
      <li>The heat and air power generated from the Infiniti Pro is quite impressive.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>Wife loves it - that&#x27;s the important thing !!!!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I had some great quality bonding time</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be a great test</li>
      <li>But once you let it &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; the electrical fire smell off it functions great.  </li>
      <li>not as great as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>It was a great Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>the air concentrator stays locked in place and doesnt fly off.</li>
      <li>I do recommend this product and think you will be happy with the choice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow very warm</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This would be perfect if it had more than 2 speed settings.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Engineering wise, the brushless motor should provide longevity.  </li>
      <li>There are 4 heat settings and 2 speeds, which I think give good flexibility.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always bought Conair Infiniti dryers and loved them.</li>
      <li>It works, and, it works good for a blow dryer</li>
      <li>I found it to be fairly noisy</li>
      <li>Good this as a gift for my mother in law.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>what more could a girl want?!  </li>
      <li>how amazing my hair could have been had</li>
      <li>hi 606w  warm</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know why no one comments that, but the air is BARELY WARM even on the hottest setting...</li>
      <li>Would we buy it again, for that kind of money?</li>
      <li>and my wife liked it</li>
      <li>, I would have liked it to be a bit hotter.</li>
      <li>’s go thru the manufacturer claims, with my own assessment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, even on &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; it is barely warm.</li>
      <li>But all of them agree that this is a good hair dryer and are pleased with it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The cool air button works great too.</li>
      <li>Very nice blow dries quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a really good dryer, and I like the fact that it is light for its size.</li>
      <li>I’d day that was accurate but in a good way.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong but what a way to get some air time!</li>
      <li>You can also remove the filter to clean this hair dryer which is good to keeping it running longer.  </li>

      <li>They are completely satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>This dryer is lightweight and does a grand job of drying.</li>

      <li>I love this dryer.</li>
      <li>W8less instead (and love it).</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>That being said if you have short hair that needs to be styled while drying your hair this may not be the best item for you.</li>
      <li>Finally, I love how the intake has two screens, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair getting sucked in a pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If those were in a different spot, it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>and I found myself accidentally switching air/heat settings more than once.</li>
      <li>Okay this thing is jet-engine approved.</li>
      <li>It sounds more like a leaf blower than a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>And you may well be able to catch 3 more minutes of morning sleep, knowing your hair routine will be shorter.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s lasted so well that I bought two more for when the cheapies die.</li>
      <li>The volume of air seems to be 30% to 50% greater.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a leaf blower than a hair dryer</li>
      <li>Should know better than to believe what they advertise.</li>
      <li>So much better than all the dryers I have had before&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>Excellent performance and low noise.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH, 100% HAPPY.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>My husband is now able to come into the bathroom without feeling like he’d just stepped into the wood fire oven from Hansel and Gretel.</li>
      <li>I get way more knots</li>
      <li>I love the dryer though</li>
      <li>Seller package arrived perfect as well as quickly, and was brand new as promised.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cool breeze feature is my favorite - after being under the dryer it is nice to allow the cooler air flow through my hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m proud to report that I have been able to dry my hair completely and flawlessly</li>
      <li>Very good deal for the price as well since I saw the same dryer at Target for $120.00.</li>
      <li>The most important factor, she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but, you can get just as good of ones, at much lower prices.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great buy and a much better price than I found at local stores.</li>
      <li>Kicks butt and dries hair VERY quickly.</li>
      <li>the controls can&#x27;t easily be used while holding it.</li>
      <li>its lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>I have used it once with the concentrator and twice without and despite the fact that my hair tangles easily, gets frizzy all the damn time</li>
      <li>/&gt;-Airflow is too strong</li>
      <li>My hair has a tendency to lay flat against my scalp, not the most attractive look.  </li>
      <li>and it takes an incredible amount of time to dry -</li>
      <li>You ideally want a hairdryer that can dry your hair without making it look windblown.  </li>
      <li>hair is on the fine side, but there&#x27;s a lot of it</li>
      <li>I love that this hair dryer makes my hair softer and it dries it quickly.</li>
      <li>It is relatively quieter and dries her hair very quickly in the morning, which is great when she is in a rush.</li>
      <li>But now there’s a dedicated website about it, available at http://www.3qhairdryer.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Conair is probably the master maker of blow dryers, and their Infiniti is supposedly a new type of styler. The claims made for are certainly true: it is lighter than the average blow dryer. But does it dry your hair 70 percent faster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does dry your hair faster, but that&#x27;s because it has an air output unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. On high, this thing can move a refrigerator across the room! I don&#x27;t know if I need a blow dryer with quite that much velocity. I can say that without using the diffuser or without learning the right way to manipulate all this power, your hair will frizz into a Ronald McDonald &#x27;fro if it&#x27;s anything like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the fine side, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and it&#x27;s wavy. After I got the hang of managing the air pressure with this thing, it did take about a third less time to dry it. I&#x27;m still working on how to manipulate a brush and this dryer; once I get that down, I think this will be an improvement over my old dryer (which is a Conair I liked immensely.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair says this dryer uses a new technology that will make it last &amp;#34;5,000 hours,&amp;#34; which they say is ten times longer than the average blow dryer. Considering that I&#x27;ve worn out exactly one blow dryer in my life, that would mean this one will last for years after I&#x27;m dead! Timewise, you really don&#x27;t use a blow dryer as much as you might think you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be the last blow dryer you ever need!</li>
    <li> If you’re like me, you’ve struggled to find information about this new hair dryer. But now there’s a dedicated website about it, available at http://www.3qhairdryer.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, the Conair Infiniti Pro Styling Tool was $119.99. I feel that price is about $30 too expensive for what I’ve experienced. But its worth noting that I’m comparing this to a mid-range hair dryer, and not an entry-level $20 dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s go thru the manufacturer claims, with my own assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“up to 75% less frizz” – My wife has a frizz issue, and her assessment is that it was reduced 10%. So, she did notice some change, but nothing drastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“5,000 hours of life” – After 2 hours, its still working. Ha. Seriously, at 15 minutes per day… that’s a claim of over 54 years. Note that the [limited] warranty is 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cuts drying time by 70%” – Compared to our mid-range dryer, it did cut drying time by ~50%. That is a significant reduction. And you may well be able to catch 3 more minutes of morning sleep, knowing your hair routine will be shorter. Ok, that’s a bit tongue-and-cheek, but for some people with one bathroom… you might see this as a significant benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Up to 40% less noise” - Their claim, if you look at the fine print, is that there is up to 40% reduction compared to the same dryer without their noise-cutting technology. IOW, you can’t possibly test this claim. But compared to my mid-range dryer, I notice what I’d guess (I didn’t use a sound meter, obviously) was a 25%. So, based on what little testing apparatus I have available… I’d suggest their claim is valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant Links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer Product Page&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.3qhairdryer.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User’s Manual (don’t expect much and you won’t be disappointed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://infiniti.conair.com/files/user_guides/3q_14pd006041_ib_final.pdf</li>
    <li> Okay this thing is jet-engine approved. I use the low setting on high heat and get ready for blast off! I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong but what a way to get some air time! ha! I give it a 4 only due to the fact that I cannot power it any less, lol. Seems absurd but other than this, it works great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow very warm air- maybe that&#x27;s the point. Both high and low settings are very strong.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer is better then I expected</li>
    <li> Both my wife (who is a former hair dresser) and my daughter love this hair dryer.  They say it dries faster than any brand they have ever used.  The box does say it is 70% faster drying time than other brands.  It is quiet enough to not wake me when my wife gets ready at 3 in the morning for work so that is a plus.  You can also remove the filter to clean this hair dryer which is good to keeping it running longer.  It has a locking cold button, and three settings of heat.  It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment.  Being a guy who doesn&#x27;t use one of these I relied on my wife and daughter to give me the details.  Overall they say it is light and heats up faster than other brands.  They love it and I am sure if they both got ready at the same time they probably would argue over who got to use this one first.  They are completely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I am truly impressed with this hairdryer. It is noticeably different from the one I used previously.  I have tried it in wet, semi-dry and dry situations and in all styling modes it has been great.  It is not as loud as my other dryer and it dries my hair at a lower heat setting than I normally use.  This dryer has 3 heat settings: hot, warm and cool (it also has a setting for cool blast to set styles).  It also has two heat settings of low and high.This dryer comes with two attachments one is good-sized diffuser. This dryer is sleek and in an anthracite color grey.  The cord length well for me in my bathroom and I have not had to finagle around to move.  Overall this dryer has exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> With a wife and two teen daughters in the house - all with medium to long hair - we&#x27;ve gone through a few hair dryers over the years.  I&#x27;ve long heard the complaining, too, about how they need a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; hair dryer, and the word &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; has come up more than once - supposedly because it doesn&#x27;t make their hair as frizzy (but I&#x27;m not sure I understand why that&#x27;s so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box claims that this will dry hair faster - up to 70% faster!  Almost every morning I hear it as my daughters get ready for school and it doesn&#x27;t take them as long as before.  70% faster?  I don&#x27;t know about that, but it puts out a lot of air (they also like the button that gives cold air).  It also claims to be 40% quieter, although this is one claim I&#x27;m not entirely buying.  It does not have the high-pitched whine of the other dryers but it still makes plenty of noise.  In fact, I almost think the lower-pitch noise carries a little more and makes it *seem* louder, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet money on it.  As for the claim that it&#x27;ll last 10x longer than other dryers - I guess I&#x27;ll have to take their word on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the final verdict - my daughter who likes her hair straight loves it.  It works faster for her and seems to leaver her hair shinier.  My wife, who often uses it to curl her hair (and the other daughter) feels it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well for that and prefers the old one.  But all of them agree that this is a good hair dryer and are pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Powerful, light, AC motor &amp; a 5 yr warranty....best I&#x27;ve seen even at 3x the price....what more could a girl want?!  Dried my past shoulder.length hair in about 5 minutes w lots of body...not too hot; just right.  Conair has always provided a quality product at reasonable price and it continues to do so.</li>
    <li> This does blow very hard, however to me it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other hair dryers.  This would be good for someone with straight hair who just wants to get their roots dry, but if you are someone who really uses a dryer for styling and shaping this might not give you the heat or control that you need.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is all that silent; especially when it is on the highest speed/heat.  However, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the sound.  I bought it for the speed in which it would dry my hair. I gave it 5 stars because it lived up to my expectation.  It definitely dries my hair in half the time.  It usually takes me 20-30 minutes to blow dry my super thick hair.  Now with this hairdryer, it only takes me 10-15; which saves me so much time in the morning.  And because the time is shortened, my hair actually dries straighter than with my old hairdryer.  Not only would I buy this again, but I would recommend it to everyone I know!!  This hairdryer is a must have.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted!!!!!!!! I hate to take a long time to dry out my thick, heavy hair everyday, this hair dryer is SO POWERFUL, I can feel the wave blows on my skull, kinda like skull massage, quite like it, if you don&#x27;t like the turbo, switch it to the low sitting, good for the styling, LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH, 100% HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Good this as a gift for my mother in law. She loves it and says its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not surprising the manufacturer states their product will dry hair in 70% less time- Not the case very disappointed it did not dry my hair any faster than any other dryer. Should know better than to believe what they advertise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a leaf blower than a hair dryer Wow does this thing put out some air, I would have liked it to be a bit hotter. Tremendous air flow not to hot</li>
    <li> I have Multiple Sclerosis and it is difficult for me to dry my hair. This dryer is so much faster than my old one. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought Conair Infiniti dryers and loved them. I can see how someone would really like this dryer, but it&#x27;s not for me. Two cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Airflow is too strong&lt;br /&gt;-Heat is not intense enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair, but a whole lot of it. The airflow leads to tangles. The lowered heat means it takes forever to get the center of my hair completely dry, and it doesn&#x27;t style well on heat that low (I don&#x27;t straighten--usually blowdrying makes my hair pin-straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sold it to my friend who loves it (she has short, coarse hair and straightens everyday). I just bought the Rusk W8less instead (and love it).</li>
    <li> This is a really good dryer, and I like the fact that it is light for its size. Has powerful airflow, and reasonable heat settings. While it doesn&#x27;t necessarily seem quieter, the motor runs at a lower pitch which is far less annoying than most dryers. If I use a spray-on conditioner, it seems to cut way down on the hair tangling. All in all, a very good product, but maybe a little over-priced compared to what else is available on the market right now.</li>
    <li> LOVE this dryer. They usually burn my hair up. Didn&#x27;t realize you don&#x27;t need all that heat if it puts out a lot of air. This dryer gets it dry faster with much less heat. Only design flaw is the buttons are right under your hand so I&#x27;m always turning it off when I don&#x27;t want to. If those were in a different spot, it would be perfect. The cool air button works great too.The extra money is well worth avoiding the years of hassle I&#x27;ve had with the lesser models.</li>
    <li> Blows with more air than heat, but so far very good for the hair. Powerful, high is like a tornado.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great if you&#x27;re used to drying your hair in a convertible with the top down, doing 90 mph. It definitely blows! If your hair is wavy like mine, be prepared to have a frizzy disaster of epic proportions. Also, even on &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; it is barely warm. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews before BLOWING $120. I&#x27;m returning it to the store.</li>
    <li> I admit, I was skeptical at first.  I read all the reviews, did a ton of research, and hemmed and hawed about for a while before I finally took the plunge.  I mean, this is not an el cheapo piece of beauty equipment.  Could I really justify spending that much on a hair dryer?  Well, to all the naysayers out there, I say this:  DO NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME READING THE REST OF THIS REVIEW. CLOSE YOUR LAPTOP, STEP AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER, RUN, AS BLOODY FAST AS YOU CAN, TO YOUR NEAREST STORE, (or better yet, don&#x27;t close your laptop and purchase this on Amazon at a significantly lower price than I paid at an unmentionable department store ($117.94 + tax @ Walmart Canada)) AND BUY THIS HAIR DRYER IMMEDIATELY!  I can honestly say, the Infiniti Pro has exceeded my high expectations.  I have thick, long, coarse hair that tangles easily, frizzes on top and is straight in the front and wavy in the back.  Sounds like an Elvis impersonator who just got electrified, I realize.  Maybe it’s not quite that bad but in all honesty, it’s a real pain and my hair and I have had a love/hate relationship for years.  I use tons of product on my hair to keep it manageable and wash and blow dry it daily.  I know, I know.  I am scolded by everyone who knows me...&amp;#34;You shouldn&#x27;t wash your hair every day and drying it daily will cause damage&amp;#34;.  And I agree, that drying it for literally 30 minutes (on high heat) every day for the past 20+ years has done a bit of damage.  However, the Infiniti Pro has a really low heat setting, which means that I can continue to dry my hair daily without causing the heat damage that my old dryer was causing.  I purchased this puppy on Friday and I&#x27;m proud to report that I have been able to dry my hair completely and flawlessly (like I just stepped out of the salon) in a whopping 8 MINUTES!!!  My hair is softer, has more body, HAS NO FRIZZ!!!!?!!!, and looks like my hair dresser just professionally blew it, all without using any product other than my usual detangling spray that enables me to brush this rats nest post shower.  I have used it once with the concentrator and twice without and despite the fact that my hair tangles easily, gets frizzy all the damn time and I&#x27;m trying to make the back waves straight, I do prefer it without the attachment.  There were many comments about how the output on this is like stepping into a wind tunnel and how it could blow a fridge clear across the room, and it is super powerful, but for those with hair that tangles easily, the trick I&#x27;ve learned is to just brush it out after a couple of minutes and continue blowing.  My finished do is straight and smooth, like I brushed it the entire time I dried it...only I didn&#x27;t.  The extra-long, 7 foot cord on this baby is a real bonus too and offers true multitasking capabilities.  I was able to dry my hair flawlessly, all well moving from one side of the bathroom to the other, having a soccer game with my rottie this morning.  Not only was I able to step out of the bathroom looking like a beauty pageant contestant, my pooch and I had some great quality bonding time….what beats that???  I do wish I had purchased this on Amazon for the cost savings… (I paid $133 incl. tax, don’t tell my hubby).  However, now that I’ve used it 3 whole times, I realize how blind I’ve been to professional quality hair dryers and how amazing my hair could have been had I just made this purchase earlier in life.  This hair dryer is WORTH EVERY PENNY!  I am a true believer and will never go back to those shabby 34-45 dollar dryers ever.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding a blow dryer with enough power... Until I bought this one! Very powerful and even though it is getting hot it doesn&#x27;t make you feel hot. Nice when you have to blow dry when it&#x27;s hot outside. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer and I&#x27;ve found that my curl is far more defined than when I was using my 10 year old Chi that this dryer replaced. Great buy and a much better price than I found at local stores.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer ever !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> 40% quieter?  I ask, quieter than what?  The noise level is a show stopper for us and we will return it.  Why does a company like Conair mislead in its packaging text?  Some of us are buying based on the representations and this does not leave one with a positive image of the company.  Ear plugs are recommended if you are going with this one.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is very powerful and really dries hair fast. That being said if you have short hair that needs to be styled while drying your hair this may not be the best item for you. I love the dryer though and I think it work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> No cool button in  a inconvenient  place....</li>
    <li> I love my new blow dryer. Everywhere else wants like $120 and I think it&#x27;s ridiculous! It does tangle my hair up a little more but I&#x27;m not a professional! It does cut the dry time in half..</li>
    <li> Over priced and does not deliver. The dryer blows fast and hard and tangles my wife&#x27;s long hair. The air isn&#x27;t hot enough so drying takes longer than the last $20 Conair! Everyone in the house has commented that it&#x27;s noisier too. It sounds more like a leaf blower than a hair dryer. All the claims for such-and-such percent less seem to be theoretical/marketing. We&#x27;ll be going back to a $20 model.</li>
    <li> I love that this hair dryer makes my hair softer and it dries it quickly. Less than 5/7 minutes. I have medium thick hair and straight hair no curls. It works great! Quiet too. Well worth the money cause it saves you time on hair drying.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It is relatively quieter and dries her hair very quickly in the morning, which is great when she is in a rush. Her last blow dryer broke and got stuck on the cold setting. The heat and air power generated from the Infiniti Pro is quite impressive. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a massive amount of long, thick, slightly wavy, course hair and drying it was an event worthy of a marathon runner. It took me an average of 25 minutes to dry at high heat. I’d often brake out in a full sweat and heat the bathroom up to about the temperature of the sun every morning. When finally dry, my hair would be frizzed out and about three times the size of my head. It would take an equal amount of time to tame the frizz back down with a curling iron or flat iron just so I could walk through a doorway. Then I tried the Infiniti Pro by Conair 3Q and my life changed. One reviewer said it was equivalent to drying your hair with a leaf blower. I’d day that was accurate but in a good way. My hair is very heavy and can take the gale force wind speed of this dryer. Because it blows so hard it doesn’t get as hot which is actually better for your hair. Not only did it dry my hair faster – about 15 minutes instead of 25 – it did so without me feeling like I needed to take another shower from sweating so much. My husband is now able to come into the bathroom without feeling like he’d just stepped into the wood fire oven from Hansel and Gretel. And the best part is my hair does not frizz! It’s smooth and manageable. I don’t have to beat it into submission to get it styled the way I like. Curling it was faster because I didn’t have to first tame the frizz. This hair dryer is amazing however; it is not for the week or slight of hair. Fine or thin hair need not apply. This is a beast of a dryer and I’d recommend it to only those of us with hair like Cousin It.</li>
    <li> All the previous comments about this blow dryer are correct.  The high level of air will practically life your scalp, although the lower level is much easier to work with and it does dry your hair very quickly.  I found it to be fairly noisy so I&#x27;m not sure what they are comparing the noise level to in the product information.  All that said, I decided to keep it, primarily because it gave my thick hair some lift that stayed after it was dry.  My hair has a tendency to lay flat against my scalp, not the most attractive look.  This blow dryer does lift the hair up and give it some body, which I really like.  I do think the price is high, but for me, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> We have owned many hair dryers over the years but most end up tossed into a drawer. I have long/thick hair and it takes an incredible amount of time to dry - I usually wash it the night before allowing it to air dry. However, with the colder weather coming to town I decided that I would try this one since it supposedly &amp;#34;Cuts drying time by 70% with faster airflow and less heat to minimize heat damage&amp;#34; - I will admit that it does seem to dry my hair quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool breeze feature is my favorite - after being under the dryer it is nice to allow the cooler air flow through my hair. The handle/buttons take a little time to get comfortable with - it is slightly top heavy.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I have coarse, thin and very straight hair without any body. This hair dryer blows too hard on high+high heat, but on low+high heat it&#x27;s too cool to increase my drying time. Wish it had a medium air setting.  My hair is left looking frizzy and unhealthy. Another problem is that the rocker switches are on the side of the handle and I found myself accidentally switching air/heat settings more than once. At this price I expected a lot more. Didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Really does dry faster and doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat hair.</li>
    <li> The air speed generated is enough to blow water around on hard surfaces. Measured wattage at all settings cold/low speed 60w cold/hi speed 103w cool/low 311w cool/hi 606w  warm/low 530w warm/hi 1070w  hot/low 660w  hot/high  1470w.  This would be perfect if it had more than 2 speed settings.  at cold/low can make pressure 6 mm HG (3.2 in H20)  cold/hi  10 mm Hg  (5.3in H20) at zero airflow.</li>
    <li> As someone who has hair with natural waves/curls I find myself wanting to &amp;#34;Straighten&amp;#34; it quite a bit. Since I color my hair - sometimes just a single process color and occasionally with highlights I find drying my hair to straighten can leave it a bit frizzy. I&#x27;ve probably been through 4 to 5 hair dryers ranging in prices from $25 up to $300 and I will have to say this Infiniti Pro by Conair 3Q Styling Tool has not let me down as of yet. I always use the products for awhile before posting my reviews so I can say I&#x27;ve had ample time to voice my opinion. After using it my hair does not look like a complete fuzz ball, and feels soft/smooth...more so then any of the other dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I still like to put a nice smooth to it with a flat iron, but now I don&#x27;t have to separate the hair into small areas to assure complete smoothing, I can just take sections and run the iron down them quickly for a nice touch. I do recommend this product and think you will be happy with the choice.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance and low noise. Will probably buy another for a friend!</li>
    <li> not as great as I was hoping. my old hairdryer was hotter and easier to maneuver...the controls can&#x27;t easily be used while holding it. it works fine but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is not a Hair dryer. Just Blower. When you buy this, you&#x27;ll definitely regret it.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a quiet hair dryer which was the sole reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> No brushes &#x3D; long life  This thing is expensive, and for the price I would have thought it would feel higher quality, that is probably the reason for some of the bad reviews.  But once you let it &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; the electrical fire smell off it functions great.  We&#x27;ve had it for about 10 months now and it hasn&#x27;t died yet.  The normal cheap ones would last about 8 months before they started to die.  We had the AC motor ones with better brushes and those would last about 18 months before we had to change the brushes.  This one replaced three old ones that died at the same time so I thought it would be a great test and it&#x27;s lasted so well that I bought two more for when the cheapies die.</li>
    <li> Horrible not worth the money.  The buttons are in an odd place so it is hard to adjust as you go, have to stop and adjust the temp.  Blows a&lt;br /&gt;Hair all over the place so you can&#x27;t control the direction.</li>
    <li> She loves it.  It was a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> After using this hair dryer against my current one, here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer says: &amp;#34;Cuts drying time with up to 70% more air pressure and less heat to minimize heat damage.&amp;#34; I can attest to the fact that it does, in fact cut drying time. At least it does for me. 70%? That may be over-stating. But the &amp;#34;...more air pressure...&amp;#34; statement is significant here. It has a LOT more air pressure than my old hair dryer. That was actually a problem for me, because even on a low setting, it blew my hair so hard, it was hard to style. I had to eventually switch to using the diffuser, so the air pressure would be diffused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer says: &amp;#34;Up to 40% less noise with patent pending noise reduction technology.&amp;#34; Well....yes and now. It seems just as loud, but where other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used emit a kind of loud, high-pitched whine, this one has a lower sound, so although it may be just as loud, it doesn&#x27;t seem that way, because the sound is lower. Hopefully, I said that correctly and it made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer says: &amp;#34;18% lighter than standard a AC motor hair dryer&amp;#34; Yep, it did seem lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer says: &amp;#34;7 feet, heavy gauge, professional quality line cord for extra durability.&amp;#34; Yep, the cord seems durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other claims from the manufacturer, I&#x27;ll take their word on. &amp;#34;5,000 Hours of life&amp;#34;? Ok, but no way for me to test that, really, until I use it for another 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line is that it seems great, but extra air flow might make it difficult to use for some, unless they use the included diffuser.</li>
    <li> This thing is  good only for drying your car after you washed it! BLOWS so hard! I can’t style anything with it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why no one comments that, but the air is BARELY WARM even on the hottest setting... I took me 20 min to dry my hair this morning, because it is blowing COLD air.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product and overpriced...I&#x27;m so mad!</li>
    <li> I loved my old Conair hair dryer so much that when it finally started to go, I went with this.  I briefly had an expensive Solia hair dryer that crapped out in just over a month (Folica wouldn&#x27;t take it back) and it was nowhere near as good in quality and features.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is much lighter than my previous cheapo dryer, and it really does dry my hair quicker!  I was prepared to be underwhelmed, but that was not the case at all.  My hair is shinier and healthier, even when I forget to use my heat protection spray.  I have arthritis in my hands, and it was getting more and more difficult to blow dry my hair.  But now that I have this new dryer, it is easier than ever to blow dry and style my hair in the morning.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who dreads blow drying and styling their hair.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, it is way more quiet too!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love this dryer. I have arthritis so the heavy dryer was getting difficult to hold. This dryer is lightweight and does a grand job of drying. The first time I used it I could feel a difference in my hair. It gives my hair a ton of volume and whether I dry it with the round brush or just a vent brush it always looks great. Very good deal for the price as well since I saw the same dryer at Target for $120.00. Seller package arrived perfect as well as quickly, and was brand new as promised. This is my first hair dryer over $30.00 dollars and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to make a step up without going the $200.00 route. My hair is shoulder length and color treated so frizz is an issue..not anymore!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it - that&#x27;s the important thing !!!!</li>
    <li> Kicks butt and dries hair VERY quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer blows REALLY hard!  Even when I use the diffuser, it blows too hard.  You ideally want a hairdryer that can dry your hair without making it look windblown.  My current hairdryer blows hot air, at a decent speed and when I use the diffuser, it is perfect.  If you have fine, thin hair like me, you can&#x27;t use a dryer that blows your hair this hard.  I have naturally curly hair so dryers that blow too hard, blow the curl out of my hair, and make it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It advertises that it is quiet, but it is super loud.  I have never had a hairdryer this loud.  Not only that, but when you use the diffuser, the air comes out lukewarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a [[ASIN:B00NEVDJ4G Helen Of Troy RVDR5111BLKD Revlon 1875W Nano Diamond Pro Styler, 1875 W, Black]] and it dries fast, is much quieter then this thing, and it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair out of your skull.  I will stick to my Revlon hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product.  It leaves my hair tangled &amp; the drying time is no better than my old cheapy blow dryer.  I&#x27;ve never owned a blow dryer that actually tangled my hair &amp; made it rough. I expected a lot more at thus price point.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice blow dries quickly. Great product. A little awkward sometimes to hold end up hitting the buttons and changing the setting but I have small hands so maybe that is it. So much better than all the dryers I have had before&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This unit is basically equal to an average blow dryer. Nothing special. To me, it&#x27;s really not any quieter than any she&#x27;s previously owned. Would we buy it again, for that kind of money? Nope. It works, and, it works good for a blow dryer but, you can get just as good of ones, at much lower prices.&lt;br /&gt;SR</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blow dryer and for me it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster as advertised and while using it I get way more knots</li>
    <li> This Infiniti Pro by Conair 3Q styling tool is the hair dryer I&#x27;ve always dreamed of owning. I was lucky enough to be in the audience of a talk show last week where these were handed out as a gift to everyone in attendance. I tried it the next time I washed my hair. It comes with two attachments, a diffuser and one that directs the air to a certain spot. I first used the diffuser and was thrilled with how quiet the dryer is and how quickly it dried my hair. This morning I used the other attachment and used a brush with it to straighten my hair. My hair looks softer and healthier than it has in months. The dryer has three heat settings (cool, low, hot) and two speeds. It also has a switch for just cold air. The cord is nice and long which allows you to move around and get all areas of your hair. It cut my drying time and made drying m y hair feel like less of a chore. The gently hum of this is such a nice change from the obnoxious sound of my older one. Another nice feature is that this is cool enough to put away in the closet as soon as it is turned off. I was able to put it right into my suitcase as soon as I was done using it. I love this! Thanks so much, Conair, for the free gift!</li>
    <li> Quite and my wife liked it</li>
    <li> The difference between the warm and hot settings on both the low speed and the high speed does not seem to be as noticeable as on traditional dryers.  Due to the air speed being about 30% faster than traditional dryers, the manufacturer needs to alter the heat output of the hot setting to be warmer (maybe 10-20%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the heating element fails first, this unit could be used as a leaf blower.</li>
    <li> Way too much wind force, blew my hair around like crazy into tangles. Even with the direction nozzle on. Also the medium heat setting isn&#x27;t hot enough but full hot is a bit much for every day use, I worry about the long term damage it would do to my hair. I ended up returning the product.</li>
    <li> best blow dryer i have ever owned!! hair type is thick and curly, blows wicked fast air and the cool button actually blows cold air not just air, its the difference between standing in front of a fan and standing in front of air conditioning. its lightweight and easy to maneuver. the air concentrator stays locked in place and doesnt fly off. my ONLY con is it isnt as quiet as they say it is. however, with all the pro&#x27;s it is a hair dryer, its going to be loud but its not as loud as something this fast should be, think medieum speed or low setting on your regular dryer. cut my drying time by 10 minutes, gave my old t3 to my sister.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer after my last one stopped producing heat. I was a little apprehensive to purchase this because of the cost, but I&#x27;m so happy I did. This hair dryer is so powerful and you can feel it when you turn the drying on. If you&#x27;re holding your arm up when you turn it on your arm literally moves back about 8 inches! My hair is very fine but at the same time very thick. It used to take me around 25 min. to dry with this dryer it only took 8 mins. My hair looks great after I use it, however because it is so powerful my hair tangles a little. I love how much heat is put out. I read others are not satisfied, saying it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. But, I like how I don&#x27;t have to worry about frying my hair or burning my scalp. The cool feature also has a switch so you don&#x27;t have to hold a button down and the other two switches control the temperature and speed. I really like how much control it allows you. Finally, I love how the intake has two screens, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair getting sucked in a pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is too early to tell if the product will really last as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> It seems to move air much faster than conventional 1800W hair dryers.  There are 4 heat settings and 2 speeds, which I think give good flexibility.  Hopefully it does live 10x longer than most other models, as I seem to go through 1 a year, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> It seems to do everything it was advertised to do: dries hair fast, is quiet and lightweight</li>
    <li> WITH THE NARROW FRONT OPENING , IT IS LIKE BEING ON HIGH SPEED RVRN WHEN IT IS ON THE LOW SPEED SETTING, AND IT MAKES A LOT OF NOISE , IT IS LOUDER THEN , MY  1875 WATT DRYER , DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  It is significantly more powerful than the current model my wife was using.  The volume of air seems to be 30% to 50% greater.  I did clean the lint out of the old one to insure I was getting a fair comparison.  The dryer has a five year warranty although they want you to include $5.00 if you send it to them for warranty repair.  In general,  I find that policy of requiring the customer to pay for shipping and handling on warranty repairs repugnant.  Not just Conair but any company that does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the dryer significantly quieter than the dryer currently in use.  I plugged the dryers in side by side and my decidedly subjective sound test determined that there was not a significant difference in noise level between the old dryer and this dryer.  Although in all fairness the current dryer was purchased primarily because it was supposed to be significantly quieter than normal.  Personally I find all of them grossly loud but being  bald I don&#x27;t need to suffer through that inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineering wise, the brushless motor should provide longevity.  The casing seems much more durable than the current hair dryer.  That casing may be the reason it did not seem any lighter than the claimed 18% decreased weight from a conventional AC motor hair dryer that Conair claims.  The old dryer feels much flimsier than this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer appears to offer greater durability and a higher air flow than my wife&#x27;s older (approximately 1 year) dryer.  The most important factor, she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: The bloom is not off the rose but the higher air flow does present some issues.  You can not lay the hair dryer down while running as it blows itself off of the vanity top.  In addition with shorter hair, the dryer blows the hair off of the brush.  Longer hair probably doesn&#x27;t cause the same issue but the greater power does seem to create some small issues of its own.</li>
