<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really appreciate the price and the quality and the fragrance, and may try other oils in the future.</li>
    <li> Great blend! I diffuse while the kids are doing their schoolwork and we have much calmer days.</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality oils along with brochures that teach you about essential oils, and how to use them. As a beginner I really liked this. I also found the descriptions of the fragrance combinations to be very accurate.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought several of the oils. they are ok but dont last long</li>
    <li> looking forward to see if this works</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It smells like lavendar, vanilla, woodsy, and a little floral. This smell is very calming and smells very good.</li>
    <li> Perfect well packaged I like all of the scents I have purchased priced right I would recommend this seller and product and I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> Has a strange smell.  It seemed to be relaxing and I felt better after using.  But the smell is very strange.</li>
    <li> I consider essential oils a MUST. ALL essential oils improve brain n immune systems as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Instead of using \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; to cover up smells, use essential oils processed from \\&quot;heirloom plants\\&quot;. This particular \\&quot;blend\\&quot; has 7 WONDERFUL oils to make a unique aromatherapy experience. There is no need to pay for a diffuser. I add a few drops to my home air filter. Add some to almond oil or other \\&quot;carrier\\&quot; oil n put in a pump sprayer. I spray some in my linen closet, bed. Eventually, your home will absorb the essential oils you use n people will notice the peacefulness n fragrance. Make your space a true sanctuary with essential oils. This is also a great oil to spray during thunderstorms to help your pets calm down.</li>
    <li> Liking all the essential Oils for aroma therapy in our home</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> This smells so good ! I use it in my diffuser!  can&#x27;t wait to try more essential oils from Edens garden!</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden and this is my favorite scent. It is soft and has many different notes. When I put this on I catch myself sniffing my wrist all day! So good.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the oils. It is amazing how moods can be affected by different oil combinations.  I just ordered one of the sets which is much more cost effective in the long run. I am using them in a small humidifier I got from Amazon that also has a light that changes color which for me adds to the experience. I fill with about 16 oz of water and add 2 drops of oil. Any more than that is too strong for me, the oils are very concentrated. Would highly recommend, especially for people whose moods and energy are highly impacted by their sense of smell.</li>
    <li> Essential oils are amazing.  The are natural and pure.  No more medicaitons for me or my family.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage everyone to try them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years, i love the entire line! They ship/package great, last forever and are very strong scents. I dilute some of the notes with water in my diffuse to make them a little less intense if need be. Otherwise, I am a huge fan... even got my sister hooked on them. :)</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this oil. This is the second type I have ordered and will be ordering more. Thanks</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smells great in the diffuser!</li>
    <li> love this smell. my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get a bigger bottle. it&#x27;s stronger if you burn it or use it in a bath but it works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil! I will definitely be back to order more essential oils from Eden Gardens!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite essential oils! I use it daily! Edens Garden has quality oils at a fraction of the price of other companies. They are now my go-to place for oils.</li>
    <li> I wanted a nice fragrance for my living room and this is a very nice one. The cedarwood and chamomile are really nice together.</li>
    <li> This is one of the loveliest scents.  I use it in a lamp ring which goes on top of a light bulb.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Everyone at work loves it too and asked where they can get this.  Glad that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I make soap and candles so I require strong smelling scents. This is a wonderful, high quality blend. Very good for a calming effect.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent!  It smells like an amazing spa</li>
    <li> was recommended to me to get this to help ease nightmares for children. to help my granddaughter sleep peacefully, so far doing well.......</li>
    <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
    <li> It is a perfectly balanced aroma which calms me almost instantly. Truly very much like the desert after a rainstorm. I loved it so much I went ahead and bought the 30 ml bottle! I highly recommend this blend for relaxation and general ambience. Also love Edens Garden. Pretty much the same quality as doterra, much cheaper, and without the crazy cult following.</li>
    <li> This is a great company that send out a quick guide with their product that was very. This smell is a little too woody for me but still a great product.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and enjoy the rest of my leisure time in bliss and tranqulity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to your friends</li>
    <li> Bought to add to my collection</li>
    <li> I love this its great delivery was and smells really great this line is pretty good. I have ordered more</li>
    <li> Does wonders for myself</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it is relaxing and calming the rich aroma is refreshing.others appreciate it also. thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite aromatherapy scent..will be buying more</li>
    <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
    <li> just okay.  With all the rave reviews I thought this scent would be terrific.&lt;br /&gt;To me, it is not. I smell more Clary sage and nothing else.  As of today , I will alway try the scents of essential oils in person.&lt;br /&gt;This Essential Oil will be regifted to someone else  who loves the smell.  The service was very fast with Eden gardens and item was well wrapped.</li>
    <li> Very nice blend.  Love the scent.  Others gave it great reviews... so I gave it a try.  Will be trying some of their other blends.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAAAAAZING! I love this EO synergy blend! Smells great, relaxes my daughters and creates a happy mood! I used this blend in my diffuser when ppl were coming thru our house to get it ready to sell ... they commented immediately on how great our home smelled!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, it&#x27;s woodsy and a little spicy, but not too heavy or overpowering. More of a masculine scent than I expected, but could be mixed with something else to lighten it up a bit maybe.</li>
    <li> I really like this blend.  It has a woody scent which is very grounding.  I think the grounding scents are good for promoting harmony.</li>
    <li> This product is simply wonderful, a mixture of pure essential oils. The service is also fast which is very convenient!</li>
    <li> Smells so good I almost slipped into a coma of relaxing bliss.</li>
    <li> I love love love love love this essence. It&#x27;s our favourite. We have it in our aromatherapy unit all the time. Not too strong but perfectly balanced. All of the products I&#x27;ve ordered from Edens Garden have been outstanding and the shipping is very fast and easy.</li>
    <li> This blend is my families favorite. I diffuse this almost daily. Will keep on purchasing as long as Eden&#x27;s Garden makes it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic blend, I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Helps me breath easier. I just feel better after a nights sleep with Harmony in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, bit pricey though, hence the 4 star</li>
    <li> This oil helps to create a better environment in my home</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent in a diffuser</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my oil diffuser. The scent fills the room with an aroma of Spa - like calm. Very pleasing to the senses. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellant scent and quality oil. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Good value.</li>
    <li> I got this for making a homemade dog deodorizing and flea repellant spray. Dog smells better, but he doesn&#x27;t like getting sprayed. :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as expected. Overly sweet and perfumy. Didn&#x27;t seem quite like pure essential oils to me.</li>
    <li> Once again, Edens Garden provides a quality oil.  This oil is potent and smells amazing.  The description of the oil matched the aroma.</li>
    <li> This synergy oil is very unique in its ability. I like how each oil evens the others out in this blend. Thinking of getting the 30ml next time with this one. The shipping was excellent as well as the packaging. I give Edens Garden 5 stars im loving their oils!</li>
    <li> We are a candle-burning family, but I ordered this essential oil when we bought a new humidifier because it had an aromatherapy feature. We were hooked at the first sniff. We will be ordering many more of these. I don&#x27;t know what the candle industry will do without our purchases! ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find myself using this Harmony blend very much in my diffuser, because I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just to see how it worked , I was very happy after I  used to it . I will order again I&#x27;m very pleased with the smell and it only takes a few drops .</li>
    <li> I am a little new to essential oil blends but have smelled enough in me time to know this is a winner. A great quality, price and excellent blend. I am using it for everything from cleaning to calming my self. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great but seems to disperse quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> These oils emit a strong scent that will last for days. Although due to the cost and size you would want to ration it&#x27;s use for special occasions.</li>
    <li> This one isn&#x27;t for me but I have others I really like.</li>
    <li> I have ordered essential oils from Edens Garden before and I will again and again. Their customer service as well as oils are outstanding!</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying everything about this company and its oils were great. I just was looking for something a little less herbal, woodsy smelling. It&#x27;s hard to pick a smell online. This was my bad choice, but I loved my Bergamont. I would buy from them again, just wasn&#x27;t in love with this pick. I do use it diluted in water in spray bottle and spritz it around the house and on the dog pillows. It isn&#x27;t flowery, so doesn&#x27;t seem to be headache inducing.</li>
    <li> Great oil, the aroma is wonderful and I use it in a burner or in my car and after shower over my body cream.</li>
    <li> Bought it to use for aromatherapy.  It is a nice basic smell Iuse to freshen the room in our water mister</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scent and I use it as a perfume and also in a lamp ring to scent the room.</li>
    <li> Having recently received my first order from Edens Garden, I am quite new to Essential Oils. That being said, I am pleasantly pleased with the quality and wonderful aroma of the oils. My package included the Harmony Synergy Blend and it is my favorite of the bunch. I absolutely plan to order again from Edens Garden in the very near future.</li>
    <li> I used 10 drops of this for a homemade cleaning product (1 cup vinegar, 1 cup alcohol, 1 cup of hot water and 2 drops of dishsoap), it makes my house clean and smelling wonderful. It has a soothing woody/lavender smell. I reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I love essential oils. This one is a really nice smell. I burn it at work... just a couple drops mixed in with water in an oil burner. If it&#x27;s on too long it can be strong. I was hoping for it to create a sense of harmony in my workplace but I guess it&#x27;s not that magical... :)</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a scent that would work well with unrefined Shea butter. This is it. Since shea butter has it&#x27;s own unique smell, mixing it with many other essential oils to hide the smell didn&#x27;t work. This blend was what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I put this blend in my ZaQ Allay Litemist and I&#x27;m in love. This blend is better than another essential oil blend from bath and body.  I have a wish list of many other blends and single oils. I&#x27;m quite impressed with value, price and service!</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than delivery date! Oil smells nice and helps create a relaxing atmosphere when diffused. I am going to be ordering more products from this company.</li>
    <li> Interesting, earthy scent. Arrived earlier than estimated in a padded envelope, wrapped in bubble wrap, with a nice essential oil pamplete accompanying :) very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Amazing oils !!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try others !!  I highly recommend Edens Garden !!!  Great products, fast shipping, great company values !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It blends well with my other oils. I like to put a drop on a cotton ball and place it in my pillow case, what a peaceful sleep!!!!</li>
    <li> was under the impression that all essential oils were overpowering and kind of stinky but I absolutly love the smell of this</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this essential oil -- my favorite scent (along with lavender).</li>
    <li> Calming and not over powering. Love it in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to make my own facial toner/spray.  It&#x27;s a very nice combination of essential oils that are great for sensitive skin.  We also use it for a room spray in our home.  Great pricing and delivery.</li>
