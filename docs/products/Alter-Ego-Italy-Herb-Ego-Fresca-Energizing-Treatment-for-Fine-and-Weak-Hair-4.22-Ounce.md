    <li> Nice product..good quality..fast shipping</li>
    <li> Stimulates my scalp notice the growth</li>
    <li> This feels sooo refreshing. My hair was falling out a lot and every time I washed it and combed it a lot of hair will come out. This has reduce the amount of hair falling and gives you a refreshing tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> I love it,  saw an improvement within a week.  Great stuff.  Will recommend to my friends and family.  Will continue to support this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for over two months and still haven&#x27;t seen any results.  Is it to soon to expect new growth of hair.  I just ordered two more bottles so I&#x27;ll give it a try for another two.</li>
    <li> It may need more time to work.</li>
    <li> this is great for your hair and help it To grow I recommend it to everyone who has a hair problems</li>
    <li> I love this product! Every time I run out I buy a new one because I have naturally thin hair it runs on my mother side of the family. It&#x27;s great especially when you do rollers in your hair to dry it straight. I usually just put it on my scalp and than rub it in. I have never heard of people putting it in there hair. Just rub it in you scalp and give it a few weeks you will see less fallout and will notice that you hair it stronger and growing faster.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My hair is growing back and is no longer thinning.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Really works it&#x27;s a must try!</li>
    <li> Makes your scalp and hair stronger and even grows hair. I love it, it&#x27;s great. Will recommend to anyone. Great investment!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon but I have this exact one. I was kind of skeptical when my hair stylist told me that it would grow my hair. I was thinking this lady just trying to sell me a dream &amp; trying to make a profit but, I bought it anyway and I am VERY happy that I did. She told me to put it on my scalp once a week but I am very impatient so I definitely didn&#x27;t listen to that. I put it on every night before wrapping my hair and going to bed and when I tell you this worked WONDERS!!! I&#x27;m not one of those people that is stingy about their secrets so whenever someone asks me what grew my hair so fast I just show them the picture of the bottle. I have been using this since September and My hair has grown at least 3 1/2 inches. I&#x27;m black &amp; I have always had really thick hair but my hair ALWAYS stopped at my shoulders. Now, my hair is bra strap length &amp; I&#x27;m loving it. My hair stylist actually sells it for $40 and I don&#x27;t mind paying for it through her, the quality is just that good &amp; I don&#x27;t have a problem with supporting my locals. I would recommend this product 150x!!!!! - Kristina D.</li>
    <li> Help with hair damage and breakage! It&#x27;s not beneficial for individuals with dry scalp since it contains alcohol! It&#x27;s really worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair grow faster than normal for some reason and helps keep my scalp flake-less. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*  (Same Day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alot of people say this product makes their hair dry. I can see how this product would. My solution is to literally put this product on your scalp to the best of your ability (easier if your hair is sectioned in rollers). Don&#x27;t massage it into your hair from root to tips. If I just massage this into my scalp, my new growth and scalp love this stuff. If you do put this product in from root to tip, make sure you use a very moisturizing leave in after or before your hair dries. That should help the drying out.</li>
    <li> Great Product. You can feel it working</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and everywhere I buy it, it&#x27;s so expensive. So happy I found it in Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> From the minute I used this the results were coming in instantly. I love it so much!!!! I am an African Amerix</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I noticed hair growing in within 3 weeks. I was amazed that it works that quickly. I wore braids that thinned my hair in the front. It has thickened up in less then a month.</li>
    <li> Have been used for years and I love it my hair is much healthier</li>
    <li> Ive used it twice and still experiencing a lot of shedding. I&#x27;m making some other changes like co washing and adding this  to see if there&#x27;s a difference. I tried the intensive one and had great results. I got this one because I&#x27;m a 49 year old afro Latina who is experiencing  thinning  hair and wanted to see if this helped. I use other the garlic deep conditioner as well. Will keep you posted on this one</li>
    <li> I love, love this product. I have very fine hair and I was experiencing shedding also. My Dominican hair dresser recommend this product.  Truth be told, this product is magic in a bottle. My hair is really growing fast. I was tempted to chop it off but not anymore, because of this product. It&#x27;s also cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair care product.</li>
    <li> great product I felt the stimulation in my scalp and afrer armonth I&#x27;ve been seeing great results</li>
