      <li>Not as great as the regular shampoo, but smells excellent.</li>
      <li>If you leave it on any longer than that it WILL turn your hair purple (or a nice lavender hue).  </li>

      <li>but they stopped manufacturing this effective product.  </li>
      <li>I used a John Frieda violet shampoo before, but Joico is in a class of it&#x27;s own when it comes to results.  </li>
      <li>This product is sulfate free (sold me right there), a yummy fragrance, and very potent in the most magnificent way.</li>
      <li>and so my hair pulls orange very, very easily.</li>
      <li>and I was able to work up a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>It also smells really nice, more floral than chemical.  </li>
      <li>good price for the real deal, beware of buying hair product online but not from these guys, its the good stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells good and also leaves my hair pretty nice</li>
      <li>I got it on sale at London drugs for 13.99 for the HUGE one w the pump!  </li>

      <li>love how it smells</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>

      <li>My boyfriend compliments me on my hair color more often now.</li>
      <li>This is a much better solution for me than using a toning shampoo every time I wash my hair.  </li>
      <li>Ive tried MANY products but this combo is SALON QUALITY</li>
      <li>Enjoy!  </li>
      <li>My barber recommended this Joico shampoo and said it would be better than Matrix.  </li>
      <li>so I am able to use it.  </li>
      <li>I do wish it had a bit more in the lather department and the moisture side, as well.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to use ArtTec violet shampoo, but is doesn&#x27;t seem to be made any more.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It made it more ashe tone.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>

      <li>smells good, didn&#x27;t do much, though</li>
      <li>love this shampoo, its great for keeping my hair from turning yellow!</li>
      <li>But it spreads easily through the hair</li>
      <li>I just used this shampoo on my highlighted hair and I have to say it works great at reducing brassiness and returning my blonde to a more ashy tone.</li>
      <li>and you can never tell how strong a toning shampoo will be.  </li>
      <li>My hair is highlighted on top and bottom and the top tends to get brassy first from the sun.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my blonde nice and not orange and my hair healthy!</li>
      <li>The shampoo works nicely but doesn&#x27;t have much lather</li>
      <li>All Joico products are fantastic</li>
      <li>I have Brazilian blowout straightened hair and this one is sulfate free</li>
      <li>I use this twice a week and my hair is free of dulling, yellowish hues.  </li>
      <li>I have tried 3 different brands of purple shampoo (the unite one which is good but very pricy and the Loreal one which its also good</li>
      <li>I did the research and this one had good marks for not giving the old lady lavender.</li>

    <li> Platinum is so beautiful when it is fresh and bright, and this shampoo will keep it looking that way in between! It lasts me forever. I do wish it had a bit more in the lather department and the moisture side, as well. My hair does feel a little dry after using it, however, it is nothing a little conditioner can&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;ve bought several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!  Use Born Blond MAXI    Wait a day then buy this!!  Use for 5 mins and u are PERFECT!  I suggest  for roots.. put hair back in a bun( already done stuff in bun) and coating already bleached hair w conditioner first so u dont go purple  Then add reg shampoo to this Joico Product .. Apply in shower.. Wait 5 mins  Add shampoo and rinse thouroughly!  Voila! Ultimate platinum!  Ive tried MANY products but this combo is SALON QUALITY oh amd then I finish w JOICO KPAK conditioner for 2 mins and    PERFECT PLATINUM! W a salon healthy feel!    No need to re dye w an ash colour this way  w this method!  FOR MED BROWN HAIR that was blonde when u were a kid  My hair is FINE  and really long but i have lots  My hair isnt even DRY !! And it was FRIED before ....  True story  Enjoy!  I got it on sale at London drugs for 13.99 for the HUGE one w the pump!  Will last me YEARS!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Absolutely worth the $ for light blonde hair.  Super blue pigment and definitely takes brass out.  Keeps hair soft.</li>
    <li> I do not dye my hair, but in the winter when my Irish skin is pale, my shade of strawberry blonde makes me look washed out.  So I bought this to &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; down the warmth of my strawberry blonde a bit!  And for that purpose it works marvelously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not great for the actual cleaning aspect of shampooing however, so I wash my hair with regular shampoo first, then use this (leaving it on 1-3 minutes), then condition my hair with regular conditioner.  As for frequency, I use this purple shampoo every other hair-washing.  It is not drying to my hair at all (my hair isn&#x27;t color/heat damaged to begin with though) and I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of the Matrix So Silver shampoo but they stopped manufacturing this effective product.  My barber recommended this Joico shampoo and said it would be better than Matrix.  Regrettably, the Joico shampoo turned my hair blue/purple.  It&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Also use their conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great! Definitely cancels out the yellow within one usage. I didn&#x27;t feel like this left my hair super dry, but I always follow up with a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol &#x27;Shimmer Lights&#x27;, John Frieda&#x27;s violet shampoo, and a few no-name brands as well. This one is deliciously thick and smells beautiful. It lathers on thick and requires slightly more of the product than other shampoos but it quickly neutralized the (minimal) amount of brassiness present on my color treated hair. A note to those who haven&#x27;t used this before: Unless your hair is a VERY ashy platinum or a grey/silver color, it&#x27;s recommended to use these types of shampoos 1-2 times a week to maintain the tonality of your dyed (or natural) color. Overuse will lead to excess ashiness and may dull, instead of enhance, your color.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I was using shimmer but this tones down the yellow and brassy color better then Shimmer Lights.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo I have ever tried. It makes my hair so nice and ashy even when I leave it in for only a minute (which is less than the minimum).</li>
    <li> Turned my hair to straw after only one shampoo and did NOTHING for the color. Steer clear.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t brassy yet! Been using this shampoo with my usual shampoo/conditioner routine for about a month, at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing.  It completely takes any brassiness out of my hair colour.  I use it about once every two weeks.  Make sure to only use a small amount and leave it on for only a minute or two.  If you leave it on any longer than that it WILL turn your hair purple (or a nice lavender hue).  Sometimes after using this I will shampoo with another product just to make sure all of the shampoo is washed out.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have gray hear and this keeps it from changing color. I use once a week.</li>
    <li> Good product but unfortunally it took a month and a half to arrive and it came all destroyed inside the package bag, all the shampoo outside the bottle. A mess.</li>
    <li> Other purple shampoos left my hair brittle and dry. This was just the opposite. Leaves a wonderful ashy shade that&#x27;s not too much. Great scent too!</li>
    <li> I have used numerous violet shampoos and they are very drying for your hair. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> I loved the old formula, but since using this formula for a handful of months now I absolutely hate it. It doesn&#x27;t ever feel like I wash or condition my hair. It feels as if I threw olive oil in my hair. I would not recommend this product, or purchase it again. The purple color is incredible, however, I can&#x27;t get past the nasty wax feeling it has left me with. I also have purple high lights now. I have platinum hair that I bleach every 4wks and this has left me very dissatisfied for a violet &#x27;shampoo&#x27; and &#x27;conditioner&#x27; more like a bottle of wax. YUCK!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo on a whim because the lady at the salon said it was amazing. True it did lighten the blonde highlight in my hair more than my previous shampoo, but that is not worth the fact that my hair never felt clean. I felt like I needed to use so much just so it would feel a little clean. I also had the conditioner, another poor choice.</li>
    <li> I used to use ArtTec violet shampoo, but is doesn&#x27;t seem to be made any more. This shampoo works well to take brassyness out of bleached/highlighted hair. Leave it in for at least 3 minutes. I have tried other brands and this is one of the better ones.</li>
    <li> I received the shipment with shampoo which had been opened and leaked all over the inside of the box. Even though it said it was a new item it had to have been used there was no protective seal on the bottle.and it looked old. Very unhappy!</li>
    <li> Was able to tone the orange out of my hair after a bad dye job!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel Wash and Treatment (at a cost of $28 and $30, respectively, for two 8 oz. bottles) and a slightly indigo-toned Blonde Brilliance conditioner that I picked up at Sally&#x27;s, and while both brands worked well enough, I will never buy anything but Joico again. After using it once (and with my own conditioner, rather than the Joico one paired with this shampoo), there is a shocking difference in the tone of my hair. I naturally have light brown hair with a lot of red in it and so my hair pulls orange very, very easily. This is the first shampoo that has gotten my hair to a truly white-blonde tone. I am amazed and can&#x27;t believe the money I wasted on the Kevin Murphy stuff, which dried my hair out anyway. I left it in for about 10 minutes (which is more than the bottle recommends) and I do have the slightest violet tint on some of my brightest highlights--while the tint is temporary, not to mention I kind of like it, stick to the directions on the bottle if you&#x27;re not into that look.</li>
    <li> It works and smells good.</li>
    <li> Took me a few washes with this to see some of the yellow fading from my hair, but it does work.  My hair was too brassy and this helped a bit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING! I had my hair highlighted two weeks ago and it ALWAYS pulls warm. This shampoo manages to take all the home highlight brassiness out! It smells great, very light and fruity and makes my frizz prone, thin naturally curly hair feel healthy. So happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> This stuff has kept my hair from going brassy!!! I love it!!! I only use it about once a week and it does wonders.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I need to use a basic shampoo first, so I am able to work this one into a really good lather - this trick really helps. I have been using this product for about 10 months, I use it about 2-3 times a week and leave it on for 3-5mins. I can really really notice the difference, no more brassiness! Just beautiful natural looking blonde hair! High recommend it.</li>
    <li> smells good, didn&#x27;t do much, though</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this shampoo.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It also helps tone down the yellow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking in the mirror in awe and elated shock at my now pretty, platinum hair. About 20 minutes ago, it was brassy, yellow, had some peachy strips, and I was in a quandary over adding another chemical to my hair. I did some research and saw that this little Joico shampoo was magical. Let me tell you, I&#x27;m a believer. All Joico products are fantastic so I shouldn&#x27;t be amazed, but look at me, all joyfully surprised over here! If you bleach your hair, or just highlight it, buy this in bulk. Put down that Shimmer Lights. This product is sulfate free (sold me right there), a yummy fragrance, and very potent in the most magnificent way. Read the directions! It says 3-5 minutes for a reason because that&#x27;s all it takes. Wet your hair, leave it on for 5 at most, rinse, look at your hair. If it&#x27;s not toned enough, I say doing it in one minute intervals. I&#x27;ve never even seen chemical toner work as well as this potion of the gods...oh yeah, it&#x27;s that heavenly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry, frizzy hair.  There truly is a difference in the quality of some cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Leave on for 5 minutes and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> The shampoo works nicely but doesn&#x27;t have much lather so I feel like I need to use a little more to get all of my hair. Also, the packaging is very poor. I have to store it upside down because it leaked and stained my white shower. Even being stored upside down, it still seeps out of the lid dripping down the bottle.</li>
    <li> No good for my hairs. Not cover yellow color.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, its great for keeping my hair from turning yellow!</li>
    <li> exactly as described and fast shipping. love how it smells</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on my silver/white hair color using this regularly.</li>
    <li> I quite like this purple shampoo.  I left it on for about 8 minutes and it toned most of the ugly golden tones out of my color treated blond hair.  It&#x27;s a very dark purple so it&#x27;s a bit off-putting at first.  But it spreads easily through the hair and I was able to work up a nice lather.  It also left my hair clean, which isn&#x27;t always the case with toning shampoos.  And it didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and tangled, although I did follow it with a Pureology conditioner (really good btw) that is very hydrating.  I think I probably could have left it on for a longer period of time, but I was hesitant because this was the first time I&#x27;d used it and you can never tell how strong a toning shampoo will be.  It also smells really nice, more floral than chemical.  The next time I use it, I think I&#x27;ll leave it on a bit longer.  I&#x27;m hoping that it will last through a regular shampooing so I won&#x27;t have to use it every time.  If it does, I&#x27;ll update this review to five stars!  It was a good buy and I think it&#x27;s priced pretty fairly.  It was much cheaper on Amazon than it was at Ulta.  I&#x27;m tempted to purchase the Joico purple conditioner too.  Maybe they&#x27;ll work even better together!  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and definitely recommend this shampoo for anyone struggling with unwanted golden tones in blond hair.  It worked really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The effects of this shampoo do not last through a regular shampoo.  I quite like my regular products (Pureology Perfect 4 Platinum and Living Proof Perfect Hair Day) and the way they make my hair look and feel healthy.  So rather than use this shampoo every time, I decided to try using a violet demi permanent toner.  Redken Shades EQ is awesome and the shade 9V worked perfectly.  It toned all of the ugly golden tones out of my hair, doing no damage and leaving my hair soft and glossy.  I left it in for 5 minutes and it lasts about 15-20 shampoos.  This is a much better solution for me than using a toning shampoo every time I wash my hair.  I can use my regular products (which are sulfate free and therefore color safe) which is a very good thing.  Using this toner was a very good decision and although I&#x27;ll keep Color Endure on hand, I really don&#x27;t need it very often.  In fact, I only use it when I&#x27;m due for a refresh of the toner and simply haven&#x27;t had time to get to do it.  If you&#x27;re tired of having to use this shampoo every time you wash your hair, then consider trying Shades EQ.  It was a great decision for me.I wash my hair.

    <li> I use the about once or twice a month to brighten up my dyed blond hair. It really does take the yellow dull color that happens to bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t lather well because it&#x27;s free of sodium lauryl sulfate (which is one of the reasons I love it); however, I just mix it with a little bit of regular shampoo. It takes the brasiness right out of my bleached hair. Be careful not to leave it in too long, because it can turn the lightest parts of your hair white, almost violet.</li>
    <li> I only have one problem with this product, and unfortunately it&#x27;s a big problem. Whenever I applied this to my hair, it would tone everything BUT MY ROOTS. I swear, no matter how hard I tried to douse my roots with this product, my roots just wouldn&#x27;t budge. I even left the product on for over 10 minutes and it turned my hair purple but my roots stayed yellow.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a very good product for everything but the roots; for that I would just save yourself the time and get an actual toner.</li>
    <li> Works great with my keratin complex treated blonde hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for YEARS, this is not the same product. It does work as a toner but it doesn&#x27;t Clean your hair; it still feels oily and dirty when I&#x27;m done washing. I will stick with paying extra at the salon.</li>
    <li> BEST PURPLE SHAMPOO! It&#x27;s DARK purple, smells amazing!  I used this on just bleached roots (end were white with a little brass to them) and it turned my hair grayish white! Followed by a shampoo &amp; conditioner, it knocked some of the gray out.  Recommend to anyone with blonde hair!</li>
    <li> I just used this shampoo on my highlighted hair and I have to say it works great at reducing brassiness and returning my blonde to a more ashy tone. I normally pull to a more golden tone after my hair gets highlighted and I love how this brings my highlights back to life!</li>
    <li> It it good but doesn&#x27;t do what I that it was going to</li>
    <li> I do no notice much difference.. other than it dries out my hair..</li>
    <li> ALWAYS GET THE SHAMPOO! IT IS STRONGER THAN THE CONDITIONER AND IT WORKS AFTER JUST ONE USE (LEAVE IT ON FOR AT LEAST 5 TO 10 MINUTES THE FIRST TIME)</li>
    <li> I have grey hair &amp; I&#x27;ve liked the Joico Color Endure Violet Shampoo before, suddenly it made my hair turn blue. From what I understand, the formula has changed.  I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever if you used a home color and it goes brassy.  The gold/brass is gone!</li>
    <li> Joico Color Endure Violet shampoo is really very good. It&#x27;s suppose to wash out the red and orange brassy tones in blonde hair. I tried it because my blonde hair looked brassy. It really washed out the brassy tones that were there before. I like the color of my hair now. It made it more ashe tone. looks incredible. The reason I gave it 4-stars is because it did not moisturize my hair like Joico shampoos usually does. It did do what it say.</li>
    <li> Works great. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all like other violet shampoos. Definitely worth getting. Quick shipping also</li>
    <li> Used this product a few times. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair. But i will say it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like shimmer lights did! This is not as harsh.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for my blonde highlights on my medium brown hair!  I have Brazilian blowout straightened hair and this one is sulfate free so I am able to use it.  I used it about once or twice a week.  My hair is highlighted on top and bottom and the top tends to get brassy first from the sun.  This does the trick.  Three minutes in the shower but make sure you use a nice conditioner at the end because it can be a little drying to the ends.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old bottle blond transitioning to grey. My natural gray is more white and alot of scalp was showing through, my  hairdresser suggested a violet shampoo. I did the research and this one had good marks for not giving the old lady lavender. I find it helps blend the demarkation line from the over processed blond that I was. It has also helped to soften the bleached out look of the processed parts of my hair. It does however leave your hair feeling dry so deep conditioning after using this product is a must.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lather, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Works great to take out brassy tones.  Be careful if your hair is very dry, it will absorb the shampoo very quickly and even have a purple tone.  Also, have a very moisturizing conditioner as the shampoo itself is very drying.  It does work though, everyone keeps asking me if I&#x27;ve had my hair lightened every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly to take the brassiness out of my daughter&#x27;s dyed blonde hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but found it to be slightly drying. Overall it works but I may looks to try other brands next time I need a purple shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had bleached my hair from black to go to blonde, but the bleach left my hair looking horrible like a carrot and it was horrible. I had use this shampoo to get that brassy looking color out or in my case the carrot color. It helped a lot.</li>
    <li> I have hair extensions and it seems whenever I go on vacation they turn orangey pink.  I am not sure if it is sunblock or the water and iron at my destinations, but it is frustrating.  I ordered this shampoo and literally within 2 shampoos, the orange was gone!  I didn&#x27;t wash up to the roots just in case it was harsh on the tip, but it worked fantastic.  I have had my extensions 1.5 years and this has been a life saver!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome. One of the best!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for colored hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying other purple shampoos that are highly recommended. This one works by far the best it helped my hair the first day and I can already tell a difference! It keeps my blonde nice and not orange and my hair healthy!</li>
    <li> I bought this to tone out the brassiness in my hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to get platinum white forever, and it just didn&#x27;t seem like it was possible. This product is a miracle if this is what you&#x27;re trying to achieve. It turned my pale bleach blonde into the prettiest snowy white, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It only took one shampoo of soaking for a few minutes, and bam! Any longer and you may have some issues. I&#x27;m not a fan of the conditioner, as its not heavy enough for my distressed locks, but I don&#x27;t think I could ever live without the shampoo. The BEST shampoo I could have ever hoped for. Can&#x27;t wait to make my husband use it on his natural gray. :)</li>
    <li> This does not work at all</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the brassiness in bleached hair.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp, will purchase again and again!  No regrets and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Well, my hair didn&#x27;t turn purple so that&#x27;s good but the roots I just touched up do look a little brassy.  I was afraid to leave it in too long.... Will try again and update if in fact the brassiness is lessened.</li>
    <li> Sulfate free, can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working because my blonde ombre looks less brassy (been using it every other day for 1 week). Smells good and also leaves my hair pretty nice (but that may be my conditioner).</li>
    <li> This shampoo did take away the brassiness of my box colored blonde hair however the tone was slightly gray.  I only left it on for 3 minutes.  I was going to return it but this seller won&#x27;t take returns. Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known that!</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo and Ive tried them all! The smell is much more pleasant than most others!</li>
    <li> This shampoo toned down the orange in my blonde highlighted hair. I use it about once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> This product takes gold tones out of platinum highlights very well.  I have a 7-level ash hair color with 10-level ash/platinum highlights.  It&#x27;s a combo that helps me perfectly blend in my grays and look stylish.  In a week or so, my hair turns yellowish.   The Joico Violet Shampoo is great.  It goes on evenly and washes out the yellow.  Love this product.  I used a John Frieda violet shampoo before, but Joico is in a class of it&#x27;s own when it comes to results.  And it doesn&#x27;t smell funny either!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and my hair is free of dulling, yellowish hues.  In between I use a moisturizing shampoo to keep my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Love it!</li>
    <li> It smells like candy which it&#x27;s a plus in my book. I have been getting my hair highlighted for a few months now, and it goes orange really easy. I have tried 3 different brands of purple shampoo (the unite one which is good but very pricy and the Loreal one which its also good but I don&#x27;t like the smell as much) and this one seems to work really well for my hair. It really does help the brazziness and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of moisture, in fact I feel like it moisturises my hair. The only reason why I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because I feel my hair doesn&#x27;t really get clean which is not ideal for my oily roots.</li>
    <li> Not as great as the regular shampoo, but smells excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually very surprised at how well this shampoo works. I use it once a week, sometimes twice, and my hair color is not brassy at all. My boyfriend compliments me on my hair color more often now.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it really helps keep the golden color out of my hair and keeps the blonde looking fresh and bright!!</li>
    <li> Great product and price! This took the brassy tone out of my platinum blonde hair after just one wash. I will definitely purchase this product once again!</li>
    <li> We have well water and I have tried other purple shampoos to offset the brassiness.  This one is by the far the most effective for my blonde hair</li>
    <li> I was surprised how quickly this worked. The first time I used it I left it on my hair for about five minutes, and when I rinsed it and saw my hair, it was completely toned! Now I use it about once every two weeks to keep the yellow out. Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! Smells lovely, has a deep violet and is ever so thick! I use this once a week, maybe twice in the summer (I wash my hair 3-4x a week). I went from a very deep red to blonde and once I got the blonde where I wanted it (although there was some yellow), this shampoo has kept it right in it&#x27;s place. Takes the yellow/peachy-ness out and leaves you with a very neutral/ashy blonde. Another thing is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out unlike \\&quot;Clairol Shimmer Lights\\&quot;, which smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s worth the few dollars you pay more to keep the moisture in your hair, and not smell like a dog&#x27;s flea shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! Do be sure to wash your face AFTER using this shampoo, it does have a tendency to make me break out along my hairline, but a nice salicylic cleanser used after this shampoo will keep those buggers at bay!</li>
    <li> good price for the real deal, beware of buying hair product online but not from these guys, its the good stuff.</li>
    <li> I used to dye my hair dark brown but no matter what undertone I chose, it would always fade to a ginger color that really looked bad against my skin tone and any dark clothing. So I&#x27;ve finally decided to grow it out but still, the color of my lengths still annoyed me so I decided to go ahead and order a purple shampoo (not knowing at ALL if it would be effective in toning my hair.) Turns out, it works! No, my hair isn&#x27;t suddenly the perfect ashy shade of brown, but after a few uses of using it as directed it was significantly less orange- enough so that I can wear black and navy again :P So for anyone considering using this shampoo (or any highly-recommended purple shampoo) for the same purpose, I would recommend trying it (however, I should mention I saw this same shampoo about 2 weeks after I received for half the price at TJ Maxx... boo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a lot of reviewers complain about the dry state this shampoo left their hair in, but you do have to realize it&#x27;s pretty much a clarifying shampoo- with the added effect of a toner- they make absolutely no claims to moisturizing effects on the bottle. Follow up with a rich conditioner, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
