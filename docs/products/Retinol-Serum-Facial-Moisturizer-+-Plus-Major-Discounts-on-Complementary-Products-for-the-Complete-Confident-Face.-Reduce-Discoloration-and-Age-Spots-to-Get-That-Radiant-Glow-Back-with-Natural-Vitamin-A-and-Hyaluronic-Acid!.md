<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tre Skin Retinol Cream is fabulous for sensitive skin!  I&#x27;ve used prescription retinol and it dried out my skin so much it was painful.  This works for me!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t typically used moisturizers before going to sleep, but this one is becoming part of the night-time routine. It leaves your face feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. My skin is very sensitive so I have to be careful when using facial scrubs and creams. This retinol moisturizer kept my face feeling very smooth and clear. I also spend a lot of time in the sun and this moisturizer has helped repair the sun damage on my face. I feel confident using this because I know the ingredients in True Skin Care are natural and good for my skin. Not only do I believe that, but I can also feel that they are good for my skin. I have used this product for about a month and will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and i noticed it has improved my skin the brown spots on my skin are fading and I spend time in the sun the sun  damage  on my face is improving I like  that it has a  pump so I only use a small amount compared to other creams I have been using in jars and I  dip  my fingers in  over and over use a big amount on my skin this moisturizer goes on my skin smooth it feels silky this is something I feels I can continue to use on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cream that has great results. I apply it daily and it is really improving my skin&#x27;s overall appearance. I have noticed less noticeable fine lines, especially around my eye area. This has a nice feel to the product itself, feels smooth and silky. I can feel a slight  tingling sensation when applied to my face. It feels really nice.  I have also noticed that it has really tightened and firmed my skin and made it more radiant looking. My skin was looking kind of worn and dull before using this, and now it looks so much better. It&#x27;s a very good product that works well and helps renew my skin. It also combats the dryness my skin tends to get, leaving it ultra hydrated. Very thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try at a discount in exchange for an honest product review, all opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to try this product after hearing great things about Retinol and its antioxidant beneifts.  I have been using my product for 9 days now and I am loving the differences I see.  I have always had problems with sensitive skin being dry/red and irritated, especially now because of my strenuous sweat sessions at the gym that have me constantly wiping my face.  I did not experience any red/irritated skin while using this product.  After my shower, I dab on a small amount all over my face and neck area.  The serum goes on smoothly and is light with no greasy feeling left behind.  I also like that this product is sold as a pump because I can get out only the amount I need and there is no contamination as opposed to an open jar.  My skin has sun damage spots/uneven tone/discoloration due to pregnancies and aging process.  I have seen my spots/discoloratio/uneven tone dimish while my pores are looking smaller in size. My facial and neck area are looking moisturized  and hydrated and firmer.  I have had people ask me what I am doing different since my skin has a radiant glow and hydrated and smooth.  I have let them know about this product from True Skin Care and where they can buy it for their skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my product in return for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with it. I have sensitive skin and often have a problem with similar products, but have had no problems with this one. It absorbs well but does not leave my face oily or cause dryness. My skin feels firmer but it&#x27;s hard to really tell at this point. It does make my face feel very smooth and soft. I will continue to use it and post updates if any thing changes. Also, you only need a small amount, as it spreads nicely and very evenly. I&#x27;m happy with it. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the product does not have the percent of retinal listed. I&#x27;m hoping this will be added in the future.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! After purchasing I received a personalized e-mail from the company with complete directions on how to use the product and also stated they would check back with me in a few days to see how it was working out for me.  I thought that was a great thing to do.  It was personal and the company showed that they actually cared about their products and how you liked them.  The packaging was great and shipping was fast!  The product itself is amazing!  It is made of very good quality!  I applied this as my moisturizer and I am very pleased.  I used the microdermabrasion as well before and it made my skin feel amazing!  I have now replaced my current skin care routine with these products.  I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I have received this item couple of days ago. the packing is nice and looks very luxurious. it is to soon for me to talk about the effectiveness of the serum. I will update you as soon as I get to a conclusion. pretty satisfied up to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this item at a reduced priced in exchange of review.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed by this! So I do not have bad acne but I do get breakouts every so often. My skin is combination, it is neither oily nor dry. However, it can get dried by certain products. When I break out, I go crazy using as many products as I can trying to clear the breakout. I wanted to test this product out and try it by itself and I&#x27;m really glad I did! It made my skin look brighter and definitely cleared up my acne! I will definitely purchase!</li>
    <li> I am an older male and have spent many years outdoors in the sun and my facial skin has become dry. (yes men care about their skin too!)  A friend suggested I try this product and it is great.  I still go out in the sun but after a shower a little moisturizer feels soothing and makes the tight, dry sensation disappear.  Highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and I have seen a big improvement in my skin firmness and hydration.  I was very pleased to see that the sun spot I had on my forehead has diminished after only a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> This serum is really good.  It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Bazinga, I have finally broken down and tried a product with Retinol.  I have been hesitant as my skin is sensitive.  Let&#x27;s just say I am over 60 and my face looks it.  I have been using this a few days now applying this before I go to bed and have had no skin irritation from this product.  I also feels safe using this product because it is made in the USA.  So far results have been positive.  My face doesn&#x27;t look as bad as it did prior to use.  I still have wrinkles but not as deep.  I will keep using product as the results so far have been positive.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post. I have no material connection to the brands, products, or services that I have mentioned. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no cosmetics expert, but I can say that I have had no negative reactions to anything this company produces. As one prone to dry skin and other irritation this is a must.</li>
    <li> The code just kept saying INVALID!</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old mom and have been noticing the signs of aging in my face recently. So I was excited to try out this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I really love it!  It feels very light and soft on my skin, which is much better than my previous lotion which felt heavy and oily. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I haven&#x27;t had as many breakouts, so that&#x27;s a definite plus! I even feel like my skin is a little bit tighter, so I&#x27;m hoping that will increase the longer I use it too. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Regular retinols continuously dry my skin out, but this is very moisturizing without being too oily.  My skin looks great and will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> Received this item in exchanged for my review. very light weight and love the feel of my face in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It makes your skin feel so good! I have honestly only used it once and LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! I believe this is one of my favorites !!I cannot wait to order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and The product itself feels really good. When applying it isn&#x27;t oily or watery or sticky. It&#x27;s a little silky. It went on well and absorbed into my skin with no problem. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell; good or bad. So I think it&#x27;s an ok product. The problem I had was with the acne. For some reason since starting this my skin has broke out so bad with acne. This is the only new product I&#x27;ve introduced to my regimen lately and my skin doesn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for m review.</li>
    <li> I love this serum it goes on very smooth and makes your skin feel&lt;br /&gt;clean and healthy right away.  I did see a firming affect right away, I&lt;br /&gt;feel confident that with continued use I will see a big difference in the&lt;br /&gt;reduction of my fine lines and sun damage that I have done to my face&lt;br /&gt;and neck.  Reviewed for amztrader.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this product works or not because I can&#x27;t keep it on my face long enough to tell. It smells awful. I tried to tough it out but ended up washing my face again.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> After a month of daily use, my skin looks and feels better than it has in years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky with what I put on my face because I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s irritated easily. I generally use Aveeno, but I&#x27;d heard about this new hyaluronic acid that&#x27;s being advertised everywhere and wanted to give it a try. The smell is really neutral, which is great- Because who wants something perfumy by their face? I also like being able to pump a small amount, versus having a jar that I have to stick my finger in, or having an applicator that gets easily clogged (like I notice with the Aveeno one). Its size and packaging would make it great for traveling, too.</li>
    <li> Nice product. This is a gift for someone and she couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out. Pretty fast shipment too.</li>
    <li> I love how this night moisturizer isn&#x27;t super thick and makes you skin feel great after your nightly wash. It&#x27;s hard to find a night moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, but this is one that finds that perfect balance of ingredients to make my skin feel healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> very good helped my scars a ton love it</li>
