### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Though i was impressed with the nail buffer, my curiosity led me to Amazon to research the price.  </li>
      <li>So then went looking for the best price and found it here.</li>
      <li>This company is the best, and you will not regret doing business with them.</li>
      <li>The cuticle oil is also great because it diminishes the need to push and clip your cuticles away.  </li>
      <li>I put lotion on after the oil and my hands feel great and look great.  </li>
      <li>This kit gave me 3 replacement buffers (4 sided) that work great.</li>
      <li>and it was great, too.  </li>
      <li>The buffing blocks are great, I&#x27;ve never used any others as good as these.</li>
      <li>My nails did not come out nearly as good as the way they did when a salesmen was trying to get me to buy this product in the mall.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be a great product for someone who has thicker nails than do I.</li>
      <li>and I have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as promised and does a wonderful job on my nails.</li>
      <li>So if you prefer to take care of your own nails rather than going to a salon (my preference) then this is what you want.</li>
      <li>The oil is nice though...</li>
      <li>This nail product is well worth the money to keep your nails looking great between manicures.</li>
      <li>Great product, makes taking care of your nails super easy.</li>
      <li>I ordered three more buffers and more oil came with them.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I just wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with the buffers.</li>
      <li>Much better deal that</li>
      <li>It makes them smooth and shiny, and with continued use, you will have strong and healthy nails.</li>
      <li>Thi seems to be the best deal on the buffing blocks, which is the only thing that everybody really wants!</li>
      <li>The nail buffer is just what they try to sell you in the malls and really does make your nails look nice.  </li>
      <li>The buffer was the main part of the set that I liked and I was needing a replacement.</li>
      <li>the original kit.    </li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>Your nails will look like you just got a manicure and be full of shine.</li>
      <li>I was exposed to this product at a local Mall by this persistant but gorgeous brunette.she demonstrated the product on me and convinced me to purchase a gift set.</li>
      <li>Love this line of products, have many different products and the smell of them and the way my skin smells and feels after I use them again!</li>
      <li>I got the product quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought one of these buffers at the mall a few years ago and it is great.  </li>
      <li>While my nails did look great, they became even thinner due to the filing and buffing and therefore they ripped much easier and were softer.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly like the buffers from the mall.</li>
      <li>Would absolutely buy again!</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product in a mall.  </li>
      <li>but my nails have been smooth, shiny and look as though I just applied a clear polish.</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t leave them in a hot car, the buffing material warps away from the block.</li>
      <li>Turns out the brunette had me pay $20.00 more for the same Seacret product I got here at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Imagine the look on my face when I realized I had certainly paid too much just to try these buffers.</li>
      <li>Since they are gifts I really hope they work well.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product - you will not be unhappy.</li>
      <li>I think I paid too much for this product.  </li>
      <li>This order came early and with extra goodies inside and my nails have never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited because they produced the same result.  </li>
      <li>Totally overrated - the multi-textural buffing pads only last for one use if you want to achieve that nice smooth, natural shine.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to help troubled nails.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
      <li>In essence, I got 4 new buffers plus the cuticle oil.</li>
      <li>I even got a forth set of new buffing surfaces that were not attached to a foam block.    </li>
      <li>Live and Learn.</li>
      <li>I had a very old Seacret buffing block and could not find it so just kept using the old one.</li>
      <li>I removed the old surfaces from my existing buffing block, peeled off the backing to expose the adhesive on the new set of buffing surfaces, and applied them to the old block.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this nail care product for people who are required to wash their hands frequently, but still like the looks of well cared for fingernails.</li>
      <li>I am very dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t notice earlier.</li>

    <li> If you have thin nails, this is NOT the product for you.  I have thin nails and thought this product would strengthen them.  While my nails did look great, they became even thinner due to the filing and buffing and therefore they ripped much easier and were softer.  I&#x27;m sure this would be a great product for someone who has thicker nails than do I.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these buffers at the mall a few years ago and it is great.  I bought another one from amazon.com year before last and it was great, too.  Both of these items had the Seacret brand name on the buffer itself.  I bought two of these to give as gifts.  However, when I got them they didn&#x27;t have the Seacret brand name or any other name on them, so I&#x27;m not sure I have purchased the same quality item.  For that reason I gave it 3 stars.  Since they are gifts I really hope they work well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to help troubled nails.  It makes them smooth and shiny, and with continued use, you will have strong and healthy nails.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product in a mall.  When the girl at the kiosk used the buffer on my nails, she said that they lasted for a year, and the nail that she buffed lasted weeks.  When I got these buffers and buffed my nail I was really excited because they produced the same result.  However, the results seemed to fade within the week, so I would have to re-buff.  The buffer itself only lasted a few weeks.  I guess I cant complain though, it was a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is exactly as promised and does a wonderful job on my nails. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This order came early and with extra goodies inside and my nails have never looked better.  You would be remiss to this from the manufacturer or another shipper.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at the claims of this product, but I found that it really does work.  I would recommend this nail care product for people who are required to wash their hands frequently, but still like the looks of well cared for fingernails.</li>
    <li> This product is Not All That!!  I was very disappointed in it.  My nails did not come out nearly as good as the way they did when a salesmen was trying to get me to buy this product in the mall.  I didn&#x27;t get the shine I had expected.  I think I paid too much for this product.  I went to my nearest beauty supply store, and they were selling a similar product for $1.99.  Imagine the look on my face when I realized I had certainly paid too much just to try these buffers. However, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the vendor I purchased them from.  I got the product quickly.  I just wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with the buffers. Oh well!!  Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> These are exactly like the buffers from the mall. I am so pleased with this purchase.Try these and your nails will thank you !!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  Your nails will look like you just got a manicure and be full of shine. The cuticle oil is also great because it diminishes the need to push and clip your cuticles away.  Wonderful product - you will not be unhappy.</li>
    <li> I was exposed to this product at a local Mall by this persistant but gorgeous brunette.she demonstrated the product on me and convinced me to purchase a gift set. Though i was impressed with the nail buffer, my curiosity led me to Amazon to research the price.  Turns out the brunette had me pay $20.00 more for the same Seacret product I got here at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had a very old Seacret buffing block and could not find it so just kept using the old one. I then realized (duh) that right on the Buffing block was the website. So then went looking for the best price and found it here. It arrived within 5 days and I have been very pleased. I bought the nail care kit and now keep my nails in shape and shine without dealing with the chemicals in polish. That is a big bonus for me. So if you prefer to take care of your own nails rather than going to a salon (my preference) then this is what you want.</li>
    <li> Deceiving advertising. I wanted the namebrand Seacret buffers but when I received my package today I realized only the cuticle oil is from Seacret. I am very dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t notice earlier. I&#x27;ve had other buffer brands before and they don&#x27;t work like Seacret.</li>
    <li> Thi seems to be the best deal on the buffing blocks, which is the only thing that everybody really wants! The buffing blocks are great, I&#x27;ve never used any others as good as these. Buy them! But don&#x27;t leave them in a hot car, the buffing material warps away from the block.</li>
    <li> My husband got me a kit for Christmas with the Kiwi lotion ,buffer, nail file and cuticle oil. Well I was skeptical but my nails have been smooth, shiny and look as though I just applied a clear polish. I ordered three more buffers and more oil came with them. This company is the best, and you will not regret doing business with them. There is nothing like this buffer. Please, keep making it!</li>
    <li> This nail product is well worth the money to keep your nails looking great between manicures. DO NOT pay those mall prices!</li>
    <li> Totally overrated - the multi-textural buffing pads only last for one use if you want to achieve that nice smooth, natural shine.  The oil is nice though...</li>
    <li> Found these at Amazon, for twice the quanity at less than half the price. Great product, makes taking care of your nails super easy. Makes your nails shiny and smooth,and lasts for a long time. Would absolutely buy again!</li>
    <li> I had tried these nail buffers as part of a pricey kit I bought at a mall kiosk.  The buffer was the main part of the set that I liked and I was needing a replacement. This kit gave me 3 replacement buffers (4 sided) that work great. I even got a forth set of new buffing surfaces that were not attached to a foam block.    I removed the old surfaces from my existing buffing block, peeled off the backing to expose the adhesive on the new set of buffing surfaces, and applied them to the old block. In essence, I got 4 new buffers plus the cuticle oil. Much better deal that the original kit.    I would definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and was shipped promtly and I would do business with this supplyer again.</li>
    <li> The nail buffer is just what they try to sell you in the malls and really does make your nails look nice.  The oil absorbs and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  I put lotion on after the oil and my hands feel great and look great.  The nail file is a little clunky for my tastes, but does work well for tough jobs.</li>
    <li> Love this line of products, have many different products and the smell of them and the way my skin smells and feels after I use them again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these. My fingernails are fragile and it is hard to get them to grow. My nails actually have some length and strength to them because of these.</li>
