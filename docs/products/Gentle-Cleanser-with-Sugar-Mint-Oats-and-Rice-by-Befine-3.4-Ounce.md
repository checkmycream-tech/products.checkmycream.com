### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was perfect.</li>
      <li>price was so good, I bought three!</li>
      <li>Cleans my skin of makeup and oils, smells great, and keeps my skin fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
      <li>Works great for my 50+ skin.</li>
      <li>Alone, both products work well for me, but together they are an AMAZING combo!</li>
      <li>I got a sample size and was able to make it foam out of the tube by holding it upright and pumping air into the formula from lightly squeezing and it was perfect!</li>
      <li>is one of my favorite cleansers!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This method works, but I loved the feel of the foam even more.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first, because it was so watery, but if you can get it to foam, it is incredible.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find some of the products at Amazon and at such a great price.</li>
      <li>Great value, smells lovely, and leaves my skin softer than the gentle detergent-free Kiehl&#x27;s I was using before.</li>
      <li>Befine is some of my favorite products for my skin...</li>
      <li>Atually made me break out more.</li>
      <li>I love this product line.  </li>
      <li>The wash is non drying, which is excellent, because I have dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love that the products are paraben and artificial-fragrance free.</li>
      <li>recently had the bright idea of storing it in the flidge and there&#x27;s nothing as refreshing as washing my face and feet with it in this summer heat!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too watery and not that easy to apply in the shower.</li>
      <li>I feel like this product easily replaces a toner.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>This may not be good for very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The one that I bought in a store was much thicker and had a nice odor.</li>
      <li>I like the light non soapy feel.</li>
      <li>What I like about the cleanser is the light foaminess, clean mild smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>This is really good for sensitive skin, overexposed to sun or a quick rinse to feel fresh.</li>
      <li>Every morning I have a good amount of oil on my face, and this cleanser definitely gets it off.</li>
      <li>and I have to pump the product like 10 to get a good amount when you should probably only have to pump like once or twice.</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>I also love how natural it is.</li>
      <li>I love this product, when it isn&#x27;t old and watery.  </li>
      <li>I love this entire product line!</li>
      <li>I first found Befine products about 8 years ago in Ohio drugstores; since then I can&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE and have started ordering online.</li>
      <li>I use Purity by Philosophy first to remove the bulk of my make up and follow up with this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up either like the first one I bought.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this facial wash!</li>
      <li>I really need to find a foaming cap for this bottle!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so refreshed, yet also soft and calm!</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous and feels like it&#x27;s really made naturally.</li>
      <li>I read a lot of a reviews on this product that were positive</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and when I found this...</li>
      <li>I can no longer find Be Fine products locally</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I really care for it.</li>
      <li>It seems gentle to my skin</li>
      <li>I used to get break-outs occasionally but using this cleanser morning and night has significantly reduced breakouts.</li>
      <li>Right now I just use 1 pump in my hands and rub them together really fast to create as much lather as possible.</li>
      <li>To use different cleansers on different parts of my face seems to be the magic trick for me.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin that gets dry really easily</li>
      <li>It takes off make up really well, which surprised me, since it was so watery.</li>
      <li>I usually use Befine products but this one is super watery and does not leave your face feeling clean at all.</li>
      <li>My skin has been softer, more even in tone with less breakouts since I have started using this!</li>
      <li>If I do get a blemish it is minor and clears up quickly.</li>
      <li>so I was unsure to try something new.  </li>
      <li>These ingredients are used in labs to irritate the skin of animals when testing new cosmetics.   </li>
      <li>Everything I&#x27;ve received has been top-quality or very nearly so.</li>
      <li>It certainly is gentle enough on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face, but after accidentally splashing a bit in my eye twice, it hurt so much (think minty acid) that I promptly threw it in the trash.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin to new products</li>
      <li>and before a cream cleanser (Ponds Luminous Cream Cleanser or Befine Pore Refiner) which sort of polishes things up.&lt;br /&gt;Together, the three products soften my skin and clear my pores.</li>
      <li>all natural.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it is just old???</li>
      <li>I was able to pour it onto my face brush but feel like I wasted 2 or 3 times the amount needed because it went down the drain.</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive, acne prone</li>

<li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with this product.</li>
<li> I have very little problem with serious acne, but the texture and quality of my skin is very sensitive.</li>
<li> though, it is actually a little harsh on my skin.</li>
<li> Never drying, even in the dead of winter.</li>
<li> Just a small amount removes make-up without drying out my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because it&#x27;s liquidy like water and smells like it&#x27;s old.</li>
<li> Something is wrong with this bottle.</li>
<li> Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Laureth sulfate are dangerous to our health.  </li>
<li> I must have gotten a bad batch because I have not had the product ever be this watery.  </li>
<li> See cosmetic safety data base for proof.  </li>
<li> The consistency is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of a reviews on this product that were positive but I don&#x27;t know if I really care for it. It seems gentle to my skin and I love that it&#x27;s natural but it&#x27;s too watery and not that easy to apply in the shower. I feel like it runs off my hands before I can even get it on my face and I have to pump the product like 10 to get a good amount when you should probably only have to pump like once or twice. I purchased it and now it&#x27;s almost gone!</li>
    <li> Every morning I have a good amount of oil on my face, and this cleanser definitely gets it off. I don&#x27;t know if I would call it \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; though, it is actually a little harsh on my skin. I still like it, but I use it less than my facial scrub now because it is so intense and makes my skin a little dry. I use the moisturizer from this line though, and that puts the moisture back in my face, to keep it from flaking, but be prepared. This may not be good for very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see that the main ingredients in this so called natural and \\&quot;Gentle\\&quot; face wash are industrial foaming agents created during WWII to clean the grease off the floors of the weapons manufacturing sites.  Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Laureth sulfate are dangerous to our health.  See cosmetic safety data base for proof.  DO not BUY!! These ingredients are used in labs to irritate the skin of animals when testing new cosmetics.   Check here for facts or just google the ingredient + dangers [...]</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite cleansers! I didn&#x27;t like it at first, because it was so watery, but if you can get it to foam, it is incredible. I really need to find a foaming cap for this bottle! I got a sample size and was able to make it foam out of the tube by holding it upright and pumping air into the formula from lightly squeezing and it was perfect! Right now I just use 1 pump in my hands and rub them together really fast to create as much lather as possible. This method works, but I loved the feel of the foam even more. The wash is non drying, which is excellent, because I have dry skin. It takes off make up really well, which surprised me, since it was so watery. It makes my skin feel so refreshed, yet also soft and calm! I use Purity by Philosophy first to remove the bulk of my make up and follow up with this. Alone, both products work well for me, but together they are an AMAZING combo! I feel like this product easily replaces a toner. I also love how natural it is. My skin has been softer, more even in tone with less breakouts since I have started using this! A+ for Befine! A+ for Amazon for offering at 1/2 price!</li>
    <li> Atually made me break out more. Ended up going to Dermatologist to fix my face.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser on my cheeks and a stronger exfoliating one on the T section of my face.  I am over 30 and I was dealing with a few pimples now and then, something new because as a teen I hardly ever got them.  You can imagine my frustration.  To use different cleansers on different parts of my face seems to be the magic trick for me.</li>
    <li> What I like about the cleanser is the light foaminess, clean mild smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. The consistency is terrible. I was able to pour it onto my face brush but feel like I wasted 2 or 3 times the amount needed because it went down the drain. It comes out just like water so you can&#x27;t help but lose some. Not practical.</li>
    <li> God forbid you ever get any of this cleanser in your eye. It stings like a mo&#x27; fo&#x27;. It certainly is gentle enough on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive face, but after accidentally splashing a bit in my eye twice, it hurt so much (think minty acid) that I promptly threw it in the trash. Will never repurchase and I am a big Befine fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with this product. It smells fabulous and feels like it&#x27;s really made naturally. I also have very sensitive skin that gets dry really easily and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to destroy my natural ph.&lt;br /&gt;I recently had the bright idea of storing it in the flidge and there&#x27;s nothing as refreshing as washing my face and feet with it in this summer heat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about four years. Just a small amount removes make-up without drying out my skin. I used to get break-outs occasionally but using this cleanser morning and night has significantly reduced breakouts. If I do get a blemish it is minor and clears up quickly. I can no longer find Be Fine products locally so I was happy to find some of the products at Amazon and at such a great price. Works great for my 50+ skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, when it isn&#x27;t old and watery.  I must have gotten a bad batch because I have not had the product ever be this watery.  Disappointed and looking for a place that might get more frequent shipments of the product.  Maybe it is just old???</li>
    <li> I love this product line.  There is no real scent to this product for those who are sensitive.  I have sensitive skin to new products so I was unsure to try something new.  I use it at night before bed time and it cleans thoroughly and removes my make up well.  I love this entire product line!</li>
    <li> I first found Befine products about 8 years ago in Ohio drugstores; since then I can&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE and have started ordering online. Everything I&#x27;ve received has been top-quality or very nearly so. I love that the products are paraben and artificial-fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This is really good for sensitive skin, overexposed to sun or a quick rinse to feel fresh. For some reason I don&#x27;t use it every day because I think it clogs my pores. But I use it after the gym or after a day at the pool. I like the light non soapy feel.</li>
    <li> Befine is some of my favorite products for my skin...all natural.  I have super sensitive skin and when I found this...I don&#x27;t use anything else! Love it!</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with this bottle. I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was perfect. This bottle smells like rust/metal.</li>
    <li> Love this facial wash! Cleans my skin of makeup and oils, smells great, and keeps my skin fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price was so good, I bought three!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because it&#x27;s liquidy like water and smells like it&#x27;s old. The one that I bought in a store was much thicker and had a nice odor. It doesn&#x27;t foam up either like the first one I bought.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order it again.&lt;br /&gt;By the way this is the second time you sent me this rating review and I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone from the company Befine.</li>
    <li> I have very little problem with serious acne, but the texture and quality of my skin is very sensitive. I used this cleanser after a exfoliating face wash (St.Ives face scrubs or Befine Exfoliating Cleanser) and before a cream cleanser (Ponds Luminous Cream Cleanser or Befine Pore Refiner) which sort of polishes things up.&lt;br /&gt;Together, the three products soften my skin and clear my pores.</li>
    <li> I first learned of this product through Birchbox and became instantly addicted. Great value, smells lovely, and leaves my skin softer than the gentle detergent-free Kiehl&#x27;s I was using before. Never drying, even in the dead of winter. I don&#x27;t mind the thinner formula at all, I am used to it now. A bottle lasts me ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it didn&#x27;t contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate, but it is free of parabens and artificial fragrance.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin softer than any face wash I have ever used and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this on a recommendation of a friend.  I will always use this product!  My skin loves this product</li>
    <li> I usually use Befine products but this one is super watery and does not leave your face feeling clean at all.</li>
