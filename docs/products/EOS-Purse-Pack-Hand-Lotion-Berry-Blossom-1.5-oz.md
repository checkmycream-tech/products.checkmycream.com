      <li>I bought this brand for the first time, it&#x27;s wonderful, the favor is super sweet</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and it does moisturise my hands and sink in quickly.</li>
      <li>year I fell in LOVE with this FAMILIAR scent and it&#x27;s my FAVORITE lotion/perfume/body wash when it was given to me as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift from my sweetie.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They were cheap, but i paid more for the shipping.</li>
      <li>But if you need a good moisturizing light hand lotion and a good smell (but don&#x27;t want to spray perfume), I definitely recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for a good product with No chemicals in it</li>
      <li>Im always looking for a compact and good hand cream to keep in my bag and at my desk at work and this one absolutely does the job.</li>

      <li>I know here are those who don&#x27;t like strong scented lotion.  </li>
      <li>Too Strong of a perfume smell.</li>

      <li>so I can go hours without needing to put on more, and it soaks into the skin quick.</li>
      <li>I love eos products - they smell really nice and sweet while still moisturizing really well.</li>
      <li>If you enjoy the EOS lip balms like I do, you&#x27;ll enjoy this product.</li>

      <li>You honestly don’t even need very much, and will spread on hands and arms all over quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very handy, doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small purse, but also contains smoothing &amp; great smelling lotion.</li>
      <li>This product came in its original packaging and had no signs of damaging.</li>
      <li>nourishing familiar feel that I was thinking of.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited for her to try the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love it so much, gave to all my friends and family for Christmas!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smell very well, but it too small</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this lotion &amp; the smell.  I also love the shape of the container because it&#x27;s so compact and fits well in my purse.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the cost.  I bought this one for about $7 but there were other different scents for a more reasonable price of $3 or $4.  This lotion is very small which makes it compact but less lotion so I wouldn&#x27;t spend $7 on it again.</li>
    <li> Im always looking for a compact and good hand cream to keep in my bag and at my desk at work and this one absolutely does the job. The lotion works great and the best part is, it isnt greasy on your hands. When I use it at work I need to quickly put the cream on and be able to continue working right away. I cant have a cream thats greasy or I have to wait till it absorbs. This does the job, my hands are smooth and not dry and I can continue whatever i was doing right away.I do think though that the price is a little high for the size of the product but I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My niece is happy with the lotion. The smell is soft, the lotion is handy, small and my niece can easily carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> As described EOS is excellent</li>
    <li> Love this lotion , any other lotion I use leaves a oily sticky feeling , but this lotion is the only one that I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel sticky or slippery ,oily or yucky . I would definately recomend this to anyone I know .</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotuon....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not purchased at Amazon, but I do buy it regularly. It make your hands soft without leaving them feel greasy..</li>
    <li> Nongreasy feel. But not enough for the cold season.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for the price and size to fit right where you need it. I also love the fact that it dose not leave a oily or rubbing against you skin feeling that Bath &amp; Body Works lotion gives, though has a great smell added with it!</li>
    <li> The packaging was janky as hell but the product itself seemed legit. I love eos products - they smell really nice and sweet while still moisturizing really well.</li>
    <li> NO BERRY-NOTHING-JERGENS BEATS THIS STUFF HANDS DOWN--------- EASTER IS COMING-DOES ANYONE GET THE SAME FEELINGS I DO-THE SHAPE-EGG FOR EXAMPLE-LITTLE GIRLS--SO NO  NOTHING-REMEMBER A  LIP GLOSS WAS ENOUGH.WITH A OF  MONEY,STUPID ADVISOR, EVEN DUMBER THAN ME FOR BUYING</li>
    <li> I got the product a day early but that&#x27;s the only plus. I do not at all like this and it&#x27;s not worth the money. I really like the EOS lip balms but this lotion doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and I didn&#x27;t think it was very moisturizing at all. After applying it I had to apply a different lotion because this did no good at all. Plus the size looks as though it would be convenient but it&#x27;s not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and honestly I probably will just trash it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it makes your hands so soft.</li>
    <li> This product came in its original packaging and had no signs of damaging. It smells great and leaves your skin soft and smooth. Also shipping was very fast and affordable</li>
    <li> I love this cream because I can through it in my bag and go. The scent is fresh and subtle. There is no greasy residue that is left behind, it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Too Strong of a perfume smell. Gave me a headache. Not recommended for  those sensitive to super strong perfume smells.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and as expected. No problems. This lotion is bad ass! Everything EOS i have used is awesome. I bought this for my wife but i stole it from her.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it smells good and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I found out about it when I asked my friend for lotion one day and she gave me this, as soon as I was done with it, I went straight to amazon and placed my order :) Its small enough where I can just pop it into my purse and gooo</li>
    <li> Very moisturing w/I being &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;!  Good product but too expensive!  Need to lower price and increase quantity if you want me as a regular customer.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. The lotion smells really nice. I just wish I bought a bigger size because I can&#x27;t get enough! I love it!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this lotion. It dried my hands out.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Decent price as well.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy the EOS lip balms like I do, you&#x27;ll enjoy this product. The lotion smells pleasant and  there is nothing i dislike about this product. The &amp;#34;Lightweight, fast absorbing and nongreasy&amp;#34; is accurate. I hate the feeling of sticky hands and this doesn&#x27;t give me that feeling. :)  I recommend this product~</li>
    <li> Hello this product is excellent and thank you, you accelerated access was very fast I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;  This product is excellent</li>
    <li> I love the lotion! Not only is the lotion great, but I absolutely love the container it comes in. It&#x27;s very handy, doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my small purse, but also contains smoothing &amp; great smelling lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments with this lotion so many times, it&#x27;s hard to live without.  It has an almost bubble-gum like scent, and I&#x27;ve had random people ask me what it is several time.  I know here are those who don&#x27;t like strong scented lotion.  Then this is not for you.  But if you need a good moisturizing light hand lotion and a good smell (but don&#x27;t want to spray perfume), I definitely recommend it.  I also like the case, since it&#x27;s flat, it goes well in your purse/bag or even makeup pouch.  It squeezes well too, so you don&#x27;t have to screw-open lids or role tubes.  Major plus for being in the more enviro-conscious natural line of product.</li>
    <li> They sent me five lotions and six lip balm balls. I and in love with the coconut milk one, and the blueberry acai lip balm ones, I haven’t seen them around much and never tried them before. The lotions the flower ones pink and blue ones smell so good. I like how the lotions last a long time on my skin so I can go hours without needing to put on more, and it soaks into the skin quick. You honestly don’t even need very much, and will spread on hands and arms all over quickly. The balm balls are fun, my kids think they’re actually balls it cracks me up. The lip balm goes on easy, lasts forever, and stays on the lips for hours, giving you tons of moisturizer for hours on end. The sell tons of flavors everywhere pretty much, but I noticed some stores have different ones over others, and the prices vary per stores.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion ever!  Love it so much, gave to all my friends and family for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Amazing and made my hands super soft. Also the lotion smells so amazingly super good. It is such a great product.</li>
    <li> just what I expected it to be. Thank you for the quick service.&lt;br /&gt;I just love these products. Also the lip gloss is great.</li>
    <li> From what I hear from my girls, they like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling &amp; works well. Keeps hands smooth. This was a gift for my daughter. It was on her list of things she really wanted.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size to carry anywhere!  Came quickly and it has a very soft smell!  Feels great on hands, not greasy!</li>
    <li> This Eos hand cream is so good to your skin.  I keep one in my purse and one in each bathroom!  Thank you so much for a good product with No chemicals in it</li>
    <li> My my favorite hand lotion so far. And they love the size it&#x27;s fit in all my bags. So I can take it every were with me ❤️</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of this product because I was so turned off by the scent. It is really strong and cloying. It is very flowers and perfumey with a hint of sweetness, I don&#x27;t get the berry component at all. I adore the idea of the packaging and am hoping to find a different scent that I like. I love this companies lip balms, so fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I got this in a store and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. The top broke off the second time I opened it, but if that happens you can still snap it back on or glue it. It made my hands nice and soft!</li>
    <li> I love all of the eos products. I enjoy using their lip balm and hand lotion. This is great for on the go cuz it soaks into your skin pretty fast and you don&#x27;t really have to worry about your hands getting real dry again. Also, it isn&#x27;t that expensive and it smells great! Hope this helps</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;very handy and Smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I highly Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. It works really well. It is very convenient to carry in my pocket or my purse. It arrived in a timely fashion and I will purchase again and I have.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this lotion and keeps it in her backpack for school.  Cute, perfect size and the lotion is good quality</li>
    <li> Love it, it leaves my hands really soft and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I first bought this lotion because I love their lipbalm, and because it&#x27;s priced really well. Needless to say, I fell in love with it! It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not watery, and it makes you feel silky and soft. I&#x27;m never found without this stuff in my purse now, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m sorry.  Most cheap lotion is a disappointment but this one will never let you down! Definitely a must buy, keep it in your purse, your backback, or wherever it needs to be to go everywhere with you!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, smells good. Easier fits in purse.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells great, doesn&#x27;t take up space in my bag, and is great!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone who uses lotion.  It has a nice aroma and feels soft and smooth on your hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand for the first time, it&#x27;s wonderful, the favor is super sweet, I like it a lot and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered them online because I couldnt find them elsewhere. They were cheap, but i paid more for the shipping. Now you can find them at target. The quality of the product is good, as any EOS product. The hand lotion smells weird, but it keeps your hands soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Love this as much as the lip balms. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product.  I  use their lip balms so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It has a nice fragrance to it and made my hands nice a smooth. If your very dry you may want a stronger lotion, but  for regular skin this was very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my cousin for her birthday and she loved it.  She has just about every EOS lip balm that they make so I was excited for her to try the lotion.  She loved it!  She loves anything pink and berry and EOS so it was the perfect finishing touch to her birthday gift.  The lotion smelled wonderful like berries and I didn&#x27;t think it was too strong like others had mentioned in their reviews.  The consistency was not too thick and not too thin and just right for rubbing into the skin.  The packaging was very unique and very useable on the go.  Overall I have not one complaint about this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it has a scent that isn&#x27;t over powering, it also keeps my usual chapped winter hands soft.</li>
    <li> Carry this around in my purse for when I wash my hands during the day.  Love the scent and no greasy after-film.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the perfect lotion for your car, desk, and handbag. It smalls great and is non greasy, I gave one to all my friends in their Christmas baskets. Stocking suffer approved!</li>
    <li> Really nice! The cap can be a little hard to flip open sometimes, but only a little. It smells really nice and it does moisturise my hands and sink in quickly. It&#x27;s the perfect size to take while travelling. I always keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> The lotion is thick, creamy, smells great, and is in the cutest container. You&#x27;ll love it. Great little gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> Worked good and smelled good :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands at work and it&#x27;s perfect for keeping in the car and the scent is great. It doesn&#x27;t take much to do it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> When I saw them in the store about a month ago, I thought the price wasn&#x27;t right for what I would get. I am very picky about my lotion and I knew I&#x27;d be upset if I bought this product and it was the sticky kind or just didn&#x27;t smell good on my skin long enough. So here is my evaluation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell -Loved it. It actually stayed on my skin for six hours strongly&lt;br /&gt;2. Feel - The lotion went on smoothly and it wasn&#x27;t too watery and it wasn&#x27;t too sticky. The drying in an instant is nice and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot in order for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;3. Product - the shape and size is perfect for my purse. Easy to find in large purses and small enough not to be a bother.&lt;br /&gt;4. Price - I&#x27;m still going to balk about the price because I&#x27;m a cheapskate, but I&#x27;d buy this in bulk than just one at a time which is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I was in the checkout line at the store when I first saw this lotion. I opened it just to take a whiff with no intentions of purchasing it what so ever. It smelled so good....amazingly good! A sweet, light, not overbearing, sexy scent that INSTANTLY made me think of another very FAMILIAR scent!!!&lt;br /&gt; Well then of course I HAD to try it and I was again VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! It was not too thick, not oily and not watery; it was PERFECT! It made my hands feel so soft and silky and smelled delicious and FAMILIAR! It absorbed quickly but the scent remained and my hands felt quenched, soft and silky. I am VERY picky about my lotions, my perfumes and chapsticks/lip glosses. After using this EOS Berry Blossom,  I was VERY impressed! I was also very excited that I found such an awesome product at such a low price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Several times now in this review I have mentioned that this scent smelled \\&quot;FAMILIAR.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when I got home I used it again to see if it really was seemingly identical to the FAMILIAR scent and nourishing familiar feel that I was thinking of.  Yes! Score! It sure did! It smelled &amp; felt nearly exactly like something very familiar to me! It smelled nearly identical to my favorite lotion/perfume/body wash that I keep in my house at all times!  (I buy them all at the same time when I run out)&lt;br /&gt;Last year I fell in LOVE with this FAMILIAR scent and it&#x27;s my FAVORITE lotion/perfume/body wash when it was given to me as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift from my sweetie.&lt;br /&gt;.... Ok, so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering by now WHAT this FAMILIAR scent that I keep comparing EOS to! Here goes.... It is from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, in their &#x27;Sexy Little Things&#x27; collection. The name of my favorite scent is called &#x27;Noir Tease.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x60;Tease&#x27; and &#x60;EOS Berry Blossom&#x27; are SO VERY SIMILAR!!!&lt;br /&gt;The EOS is WAAAAAAAAY cheaper, but it&#x27;s not cheap or poor quality. In fact, the quality and the smell are just barely different from &#x60;Tease.&#x27;  Every time I wear &#x60;Tease&#x27; I get a ton of compliments! I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it and many people have told me that it&#x27;s the best thing that they&#x27;ve ever smelled. All of my friends have gone to Victoria&#x27;s Secret and bought &#x60;Tease.&#x27; I can&#x27;t wait to tell them about EOS!&lt;br /&gt;I had my spouse smell it to see if he agreed with me and he did. He LOVES when I wear my VS Noir Tease!!!! It&#x27;s an instant turn-on for him. (;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really fantastic now to have a small, pocket sized lotion that smells amazing and softens my skin like no other. I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out or worry about using it sparingly like I do my Victoria&#x27;s Secret stuff, because it&#x27;s about $60 cheaper! The smell is about 1 notch different from the V.S. stuff. There is barely a difference between EOS and V.S. Tease. The ONLY thing that I would change about the EOS would be the container size; I wish it were larger. How can I complain though for such a quality product at such a low price!?  I&#x27;m going back tomorrow to purchase 5 more! 1 for both bathrooms, 1 for my nightstand next to my bed, and 2 for replacements for when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $3.45, you just can&#x27;t beat that. I recently started my own business and am in the process of contacting the distributor so that I can sell it from my store.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!liments!

    <li> Great on skin, smells good and no greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> Bought it for Christmas for my wife (admittedly at her request).  From what I can see, she seemed to like it well enough... :)</li>
    <li> It works great just like the chap sticks! Makes my hands really soft and smooth! Wish it was a bigger size.</li>
