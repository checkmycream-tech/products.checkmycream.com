      <li>Wonderful essential oil mixtures for all kinds of ailments.</li>
      <li>I found Fabulous Frannie after reading through many reviews, and ordered.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m more acquainted with the many uses for essential oils, I&#x27;m kinda wishing I had got the set that wasn&#x27;t pre-blended; so I could use them more often.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for such a great product that has helped me and my family improve our healthier lifestyle!</li>
      <li>and my muscles felt better after a good long soak!</li>
      <li>I love these oils, and this type of set so much!</li>
      <li>First of all I give Fabulous Frannie an A++++++ for customer service!</li>
      <li>Amazing service plus even better essential oils!</li>

      <li>so this set was a nice starting part!</li>
      <li>So far I have not tried any other oils but these but the smell great</li>
      <li>Wish I had bought individual scents rather than this, but it is okay for what it is.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2-7 days for shipping and hope I was still interested in the project or whatever I was doing with it when it got here.</li>
      <li>The oils came to me low and with label damage as one or more of them leaked during transit.  </li>

      <li>Thanks for fast shipping.</li>
      <li>so I really enjoy the mixed blends!</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.  </li>

      <li>The thieve&#x27;s oil is great during flu and cold season, it helps everyone from catching the other family member&#x27;s yuck.</li>
      <li>High quality oils.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely turned from the other company, and using Fabulous Frannie.</li>
      <li>Im pretty new to using essential oils</li>
      <li>I will never ever ever buy doTerra or Young Living oils again because they are WAY too overpriced.</li>
      <li>These are by far my favorite oils, have only used a few but</li>
      <li>I did tons of research and wanted to really give oils a try with my family, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford to get started with all the other brands.</li>
      <li>Have only used the cold one all smell good to me</li>
      <li>The blends are wonderful and 4 Thieves and Cold and Flu have been a life saver for me in the past month!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these oils! We have used them all in several different ways ( message, diffuser, bath) and have never been disappointed. I&#x27;ve even recommend to several others and they have fallen for them as well.</li>
    <li> The oils are fantastic! I really love this company and have been very pleased with the quality of these oils compared with other more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> It is nicely wrapped. Loved the smell of each of them except it does not have a description on each bottle like Eden&#x27;s Garden.</li>
    <li> These are great for trying blends. No one has better prices, or better oils.</li>
    <li> I love all these oils. I order from here and from Fabulous Frannies website!  I was so confused on what oils to buy and thought I had to go with a more expensive company. Other companies will say you can ingest our oils and I say NO WAY!  I&#x27;m so glad I went with this company.  LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Love this set! love to defuse the fresh air and happy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. None of them leaked or have leaked and they work well in our diffuser and topical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super new to the essential oil game so this set was a nice starting part! I chose to get this because they were preblended so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about looking up recipes. I&#x27;ve used a few of these, I really like the one called &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new with Aromatherapy but everything I&#x27;ve learned taught me these are some of the best and great price. I‘ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great oil set, no complaints with the quality. Have had these for 8 months and they are handy. Now that I&#x27;m more acquainted with the many uses for essential oils, I&#x27;m kinda wishing I had got the set that wasn&#x27;t pre-blended; so I could use them more often.

    <li> I am in love with these oils. I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I love these aromatherapy it is really amazing how well these work. I&#x27;m constantly using all the different oils!</li>
    <li> I bought another similar set of Fabulous Frannie oil sets that was fulfilled by Amazon. Prime shipping took almost a week, but that is Amazon&#x27;s issue, not Frannie&#x27;s. This time, I decided to expand on the other set, so I went directly through Frannie&#x27;s storefront and received this product in a few days. I love these oils. The blends are delicious smelling and I look forward to using them. We have battled colds and flus in this record bitter winter in the midwest, and by using these oils, both continuously in a tealight burner, and breathing them in directly in a steamer inhaler, I have overcome some serious bronchial and lung issues and am on the road to recovery. I believe in the healing ability of essential oils, and these blends are wonderful for all kinds of ailments. The price is fantastic - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> First of all I give Fabulous Frannie an A++++++ for customer service! Second Im pretty new to using essential oils so I really enjoy the mixed blends! These are by far my favorite oils, have only used a few but the ones I have used are wonderful! I live where the mosquitos are nasty and I used the bug away and I tell you its so much better than spraying that nasty spray on! I have also used the aches and pains and calm and anger in the bath tub, I am a runner and it was so relaxing and my muscles felt better after a good long soak! Highly recommend this product to anyone! Anxious to try the rest of them!</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged and high quality. The blends are unique and smell wonderful. I could not be happier with this set.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!! Amazing service plus even better essential oils! I love thr pricing too. You dont have to lose and arm or leg :)</li>
    <li> I love these oils, and this type of set so much! They are strong and effective! I will never ever ever buy doTerra or Young Living oils again because they are WAY too overpriced. These oils are perfect, very cost effective, and the shipping cost is tiny!!&lt;br /&gt;Please never stop making these oils, keep the price the same!! I will continue to order over and over :)</li>
    <li> This has the best scents! So glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> After using the mainstream expensive brands, I found myself in a financial burden, and HAD TO HAVE my oils as I use them daily, but couldn&#x27;t afford what I was using usually. I found Fabulous Frannie after reading through many reviews, and ordered. I CAN NOT say ENOUGH about this company. I am absolutely turned from the other company, and using Fabulous Frannie. Thank you for a quality yet affordable product. I can use my oils on a great budget, and keep my family healthy without using pharmaceutical companies! Amen!</li>
    <li> Love all the oils and are playing around with them and researching what they are good for.  Would like for the booklet that comes with them to be alittle more informative for the beginners like me.</li>
    <li> Love them. Thanks for fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love these! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of these yet, but they all look great. I think I am going to like the blends. Item came just as described.</li>
    <li> Wonderful way to get me through these winter days.</li>
    <li> Have only used the cold one all smell good to me</li>
    <li> Such an awesome set!!! Double the size bottles of the Young Living oils, 2 more bottles than the YL starter kit and $120 CHEAPER!!! Great quality oils! Very strong. I&#x27;ll continue to order!</li>
    <li> These smell great and work very well. I&#x27;ll be getting my diffuser soon and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Awesome essential oils.  They are just as good as the more expensive company!</li>
    <li> Nice starter set.  High quality oils.</li>
    <li> Oils have been growing popularity fast for the past coupe years. I did tons of research and wanted to really give oils a try with my family, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford to get started with all the other brands. I also just wanted to jump in and go, I didn&#x27;t want to build up my supply one by one. I found that amazing pack by Faboulous Frannie! I an so grateful I did! Getting the packs was the best idea ever! I would start something with oils, or see something on Facebook and almost always already had the oil on hand from buying the pack! I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2-7 days for shipping and hope I was still interested in the project or whatever I was doing with it when it got here. The oils have worked great! My biggest concern was if they were truly the oil without fillers or carrier oils added. I am very confident that these oils work great and aren&#x27;t mostly fillers! Thanks for such a great product that has helped me and my family improve our healthier lifestyle!</li>
    <li> The oils came to me low and with label damage as one or more of them leaked during transit.  Fabulous Frannie&#x27;s customer service was great and they are sending replacements.  I haven&#x27;t received them yet but trust that I&#x27;ll get them without issue.  The scents themselves seem slightly off to me.  I suppose it&#x27;s a you get what you pay for sort of thing.  Therefore, for the money, I think this a very decent set.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank when buying essential oils.</li>
    <li> Wonderful essential oil mixtures for all kinds of ailments. Fabulous Frannie makes good products and have excellent customer service to boot.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a novice or beginner with essential oils this would be a perfect place for you to start.</li>
    <li> I love my Baker&#x27;s Dozen Gift set!  Can&#x27;t wait to order more Essential Oils from Fabulous Frannie!  The blends are wonderful and 4 Thieves and Cold and Flu have been a life saver for me in the past month!  I made salt dough discs and have them hanging by my chair.  Depending on what I need, a drop on the back of the disc is all I need!</li>
    <li> All the bottles have the same scent.</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought individual scents rather than this, but it is okay for what it is.</li>
