      <li>I will be buying it again for sure!</li>
      <li>The consistency of the formula is great, no clumps and easy to apply without getting it</li>
      <li>I think if the formula was wetter, and if more came out on the brush, it could be really good.</li>

      <li>A very nice Mascara which goes on smoothly and is not &amp;#34;Clumpy&amp;#34;.  </li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>

      <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>: I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok as a product.</li>
      <li>how many times I curl them.</li>

      <li>I feel like I have more control with the shorter bristles.</li>
      <li>I love this waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>Is safe for contact lens.</li>
      <li>I love the brush, but I still get raccoon eyes with this product.</li>
      <li>Favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve subscribed to make sure I never run out.</li>
      <li>It feels like I was combing through each eye lash and was able to place the product evenly.</li>
      <li>My favorite waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I use this on top of another mascara, and found that it works wonders in adding more volume and separating out the lashes.  </li>
      <li>Even at the end of the day, my lashes looked lovely.</li>
      <li>4/20/13 - Just bought a tube at Walmart today and paid almost $2 more for it than it is selling at Amazon.</li>
      <li>thing I love about this mascara is that It doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>how many times I wiped the smudges off.  </li>
      <li>However, it makes them more curved, darker and also doesn&#x27;t leave all the lashes together, causing a beautiful natural looking lashes.</li>
      <li>bought it on amazon because the price was pretty good.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t give me a ton of volume or length, however, but it&#x27;s a pretty good price.</li>
      <li>Its worth trying, the price is good but the quality of the mascara itself doesn&#x27;t compete with the other wonderful Maybelline mascara.  </li>
      <li>May have been more effective in getting the full volumns lash if the mascara more fresh.</li>
      <li>Waterproof formula stays put but still removes easily with remover or vaseline.  </li>
      <li>Finding the waterproof version of this mascara isn&#x27;t always easy.  </li>
      <li>Adding two coats is easy &amp; my wife claims it never clumps.</li>
      <li>how well you clean off your eye makeup, but is sure lasts all day with no &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
      <li>Does not sting the eyes and is easy to remove before bed.</li>
      <li>But you can easily get 4 to 5 months out of a tube.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, no clumps, buildable, wears all day.</li>
      <li>I have small eyes with very light lashes, and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>I put 2-3 coats on them and they look great; I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my long lashes.</li>
      <li>The best for getting the little eyelashes at the corners.  </li>
      <li>I have very short lashes and this mini mascara worked great.</li>
      <li>I ordered this as Lash Discovery is the only mascara I use and thought it was a great buy.</li>
      <li>The mascara itself is great, but the brush is so tiny.</li>
      <li>I got this in waterproof to be used as a lower lash mascara and it looks fantastic on the lashes</li>
      <li>I am happy I got this in water proof because I don&#x27;t think the regular would have lasted.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I originally got this for my lower lashes after a friend revealed to me that you are in fact supposed to put mascara on your lower lashes.</li>
      <li>At first I was pleased with this because for me</li>
      <li>The small brush is so perfect to reach all the lash hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even waterproof, but it wears far better than this Maybelline product!</li>
      <li>The brush keeps clumps from happening and gives a nice clean, natural look.</li>
      <li>The tiny applicator is good for separating the lashes and it adds the tiniest bit of length.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So far so good.  This is my first experience with this mascara.  One thing I REALLY like is the &amp;#34;mini-brush&amp;#34;.  Gets to each and every lash--both upper and lower.  As far as the mascara itself, it&#x27;s one of the most difficult waterproof mascaras to remove I&#x27;ve ever used.  So, just be patient and use a good mascara remover.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara have used it for years! I like it because it&#x27;s good for in the corners of my lashes...I have long eye lashes and small eyes!</li>
    <li> A very nice Mascara which goes on smoothly and is not &amp;#34;Clumpy&amp;#34;.  Does not sting the eyes and is easy to remove before bed.</li>
    <li> Love the applicator brush on Lash Discovery:  it is thin and long, and I can get to lashes that I haven&#x27;t discovered since companies came out with the toilet-brush size applicators.  A tube may not last as long as other products, but I needed to change out tubes more often anyhow.  Thank you, thank you for making an applicator brush that doesn&#x27;t come at my eye like a semi truck.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara!  I love the small applicator brush because I can use it to get to the smallest of my eyelashes.  The mascara goes on well, lenghtens and thickens, and stays in place.  I love this mascara!</li>
    <li> It seemed to be dried out when it arrived.  Very hard to apply.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> About me: I have straight, short, stubborn lashes that refuse to stay curled no matter how many times I curl them. I usually wear glasses; contact lenses are only for special occasions/going out. Normally if I wore mascara while wearing glasses, my lashes would start drooping after 15 minutes and start brushing against my glasses, leaving streaks (yuck). I usually do not wear waterproof formulas because I always found them so difficult to remove. I have also tried the non-waterproof version of Maybelline New York Lash Discovery Mascara, which I found decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expectations: I was looking for an everyday, no-makeup-look mascara. I was not looking for a mascara that would give me intense volume or super lengthening. I&#x27;ve tried everything from high-end to drugstore mascaras and I&#x27;ve never found one that I loved so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts: I love this mascara. Absolutely LOVE. I adore the brush because it&#x27;s so small and gets every little lash. It defines every single lash and keeps them curled! The mascara kept my lashes curled the entire day and gave me the effect I wanted, which was a subtly enhancing look. It&#x27;s quite buildable, did not flake, or clump (granted, I wiped the wand a million times before applying the mascara). I could even use it on my lower lashes. Even at the end of the day, my lashes looked lovely. It&#x27;s fairly waterproof but still easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this if: you want an inexpensive mascara that defines your lashes and keeps them curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not get this if: you want lashes that go BAM! If you&#x27;re looking for drama, you won&#x27;t get it from this mascara.</li>
    <li> If you thought it will change ,you are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;first the slowest shipped i have never seen .it take over a week.&lt;br /&gt;the mascara almost dry ,can&#x27;t use at all .</li>
    <li> The mascara itself is great, but the brush is so tiny. Its great for those hard to reach lashes and lower lashes, but overall I wish the brush wasnt so tiny.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try a Maybeline Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;After Lancome&#x27;s new line of waterproof mascara failed me, I decided to try this cheaper mascara that received quite good reviews here...&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy and Flaky!&lt;br /&gt;Also, expect to loose tons of lashes while cleansing. (Even with your eye-makeup remover)&lt;br /&gt;Save your lashes.. Worst mascara I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very little mascara tube. It&#x27;s ok as a product. It&#x27;s good for bottom lashes, that&#x27;s all I use it for.  Not a thickening formula. Pretty thin and adds color to your lashes.</li>
    <li> THE SIZE OF THE BRUSH FOR THE BOTTOM LASHES IS PERFECT BUT THE THE CONSISTANCY OF THE MASCARA IS THICK AND DRY...HARDLY ANY COMES OFF THE BRUSH....USELESS.......I AM NOW DIPPING IT INTO MY OTHER MASCARA...I WON&#x27;T BUY IT AGAIN BUT I WILL USE THE BRUSH</li>
    <li> Finding the waterproof version of this mascara isn&#x27;t always easy.  The price is comparable to where I usually buy this but I liked not having to cross my fingers as I turned down the cosmetics aisle...</li>
    <li> I no longer have the long, lush lashes that I had before menopause, and I have found that the lengthening mascaras flake off quite quickly. This has the advantage that it lasts and lasts, plus the smaller brush makes it easy to apply to shorter lashes.</li>
    <li> it was okay, the brush is really small I thought it was a normal size Mascara but regardless it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This mascara offers very little coverage. I&#x27;ll try Clinique next and hope its better.</li>
    <li> Does not provide much volume so not so great for top lashes.  It&#x27;s absolute perfection for the lower lash line.  It offers much more control than a larger brush</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup junkie so I have to rely on other reviewers to find out good products. So after reading good reviews I decided to give it a try. And I should say that I am happy with it. It&#x27;s very lite on lashes &amp; lasts for a long time. The small brush works really well for me. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to wash it off. I use good quality makeup remover &amp; not cheap ones. My all other makeup cleans up right away with that remover except this mascara. I have to wash it 2 time to remove it. Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this strictly for use on my lower lashes, and the delicate wand size is perfect for putting mascara on all those tiny little lashes. Unfortunately, after a few hours I have black smudges under both eyes. Sure, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;water&amp;#34;-proof, but what difference does that make when a little facial oil or tears can dissolve it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Clinique lower-lash mascara, which has a similar tiny wand. It&#x27;s not even waterproof, but it wears far better than this Maybelline product! I still love the tiny wand, though (picture below compares this wand to a standard-size spoolie).</li>
    <li> Still use my old mascara.. Was disappointed. Had to apply like three times before I could even tell I was wearing mascara</li>
    <li> Gave me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Perfect lower lash mascara!</li>
    <li> a tiny little brush gives you terrific control. Adding two coats is easy &amp; my wife claims it never clumps. Is safe for contact lens. Comes in water proof or non water proof . My wife uses the  water proof. As a contact lens wearer she uses a new tube every 6 to 8 weeks. But you can easily get 4 to 5 months out of a tube. Inexpensive enough to promote good eye hygiene &amp; a product you can count on.</li>
    <li> I have Asian eyes, so mascara tends to be a bit harder to apply.  I use this to get the little corner hairs on upper and lower lashes, then i apply a regular mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t help lift or make lashes thicker, but helps with the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> At first I was pleased with this because for me (I have medium to long lashes) it added plenty of thickness and definition, as well as some length, in one or two coats. However, I am now searching for a new mascara because after using this for a little while, I realized it had problems. The worst one is that after a couple hours of wearing, the mascara melts into lines in the creases under my eyes, or just gets smudged on the outer corners. This happens without me touching, rubbing, moistening, or otherwise disturbing the mascara. I do not wear eyeliner, so I know it is the mascara doing the smudging. The other problem is that it occasionally gets into my eyes somehow (while wearing, not during application) and when it does, it hurts a lot. It causes a painful sensation that is a very intense mixture of itching and burning. I definitely will not buy this mascara again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the mini brush, it ensures that every lash gets mascara, however the waterproof formula is too difficult to remove. My regular cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove this mascara and so I purchased a Maybelline eye makeup remover, but this also doesn&#x27;t work. I remove the mascara at night, however in the morning when I try to apply new mascara, my lashes are very stiff and the mascara doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly because of the remnants of the mascara from the day before. Mascara that doesn&#x27;t budge can&#x27;t be good more delicate eyelashes, and I fear that continued use of this mascara will cause my lashes to break.</li>
    <li> But I am not sure this one was fresh.  It seemed dried out.  Still, best mascara in the world.  Reaches every lash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and this has been my favourite mascara since my 20s. It&#x27;s getting harder to find. The little tiny brush makes it easy to get every lash. I have tried more expensive brands and always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small mascara brush.  Well I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Really too tiny.  The mascara is probably fine - just difficult to apply with such a small brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking for the Ultra Lash Maybelline use to have.  I can no longer find it and was hoping this would do it for me.  The wand is thin and doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  I love Maybelline but am really disappointed I can&#x27;t fine the Ultra Lash in the White tube any longer.</li>
    <li> The reasons I prefer it over others may be the exact reasons it is not everyone&#x27;s favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It goes on cleanly - no clumps or bulkiness&lt;br /&gt;- Because it&#x27;s waterproof it doesn&#x27;t uncurl otherwise straight lashes that you just curled with an eyelash curler&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t flake off into my eyes during the day&lt;br /&gt;- The shorter brushes on the wand make the mascara a lot easier to apply to your lashes and avoid brushing onto your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive enough that you don&#x27;t mind replacing it every three months like you are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my lashes to be visible but look natural.  This mascara is not for Tammy Faye Bakers of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum 4/20/13 - Just bought a tube at Walmart today and paid almost $2 more for it than it is selling at Amazon.</li>
    <li> ladies i brought this item because i have next to no bottom lashes, the wand is small enough but the product is not even there. the wand is dry  and now i have an eye infection. i am seriously concidering suing Amazon, on secondary company, that is how bad the infection in my eye is. and i say eye i always make it a habit of not doing both eyes till i see how shadow,mascara and the such affects me. save your money ladies i&#x27;m sure there are other companies that have a better and safer product!!!!\&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON YOU AMAZON, THE PRODUCT WAS OUT OF DATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this but it really didn&#x27;t work for me.  The brush is small and can reach your smaller lashes but I still have better results using my regular mascarra.  If you wear mascara on your lower lashes then this is a good product for you.  I typically don&#x27;t but tried it with this product and.....I was looking very Tammy Faye Baker&#x27;ish.  Its worth trying, the price is good but the quality of the mascara itself doesn&#x27;t compete with the other wonderful Maybelline mascara.  I think it&#x27;s a better bet to just purchase this petite wand and used it with another type of mascara.</li>
    <li> The premise is you use this for your itsy-bitsy lower lashes.  I think it was a little dry coming out of the tube, but you can&#x27;t beat that tiny brush for little lashes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because if I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara on my lower lashes it transfers to my skin. The wand is great, I can get every little lash. The consistency of the formula is great, no clumps and easy to apply without getting it everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me is formula is NOT waterproof. Water resistant maybe...but hardly waterproof. I do not have excessively teary eyes but for me, this transfers to my undereye skin. It doesn&#x27;t make it smeary and dark black under there, but there is visible evidence of transfer after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched away from drugstore makeup many many moons ago and I kept being told by people and reviews that drugstore mascara is no different from Sephora/high-end (except much cheaper in price!) so I thought I would give it a shot. WRONG! Drugstore makeup is absolute crap. Also evidenced by a bunch of Milani lipsticks I bought that all the beauty blogs were raving about and the formula is sheit. (Drugstore nail polish is awesome though!) I would rather spend the money on a quality product that doesn&#x27;t transfer.  I do like the wand a lot though, maybe I will use the wand and dip it in a real waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> It was completely dry when I tried to use it (1 week after receiving it). Best mascara it still L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I liked the little brush.  It did a good job applying mascara to the bottom lashes and the inside and outside corners of my eyes.  I wear contacts and the mascara did not irritate my eyes or contacts.  Unfortunately the mascara smudged under my eyes within minutes after it was applied.  It continued to smudge all day long no matter how many times I wiped the smudges off.  I will not buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for about 15 years and have no complaints. I have a lot of lashes and it is hard to get the sides of my eyelashes without getting it everywhere, and this tiny brush works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different OTC mascara labels as well as expensive ones from department store brands and independent makeup vendors. After a very long search for the perfect mascara, I can finally say I found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; that is now my everyday go to mascara and I didn&#x27;t have to pay much for it at all! Let me tell you why Maybelline&#x27;s New York Lash Discovery works for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about this mascara is that It doesn&#x27;t clump. I can&#x27;t stand mascaras that clump up and leave marks around your eyes. Even the mascaras I paid double for tend to do this which can be frustrating. This also has a much smaller brush wand making this very easy on your hands for applying the mascara precisely to your inner lashes working out. I love this because it allows me to reach for the tiny lashes that are hard to reach with a thicker brush wand. Another thing I&#x27;d like to add is that it really makes my lashes appear to look longer! All I really need is one application to do the trick. Just curl your lashes and apply once. Some people like to reapply to make their lashes appear thicker and dramatic, but I like to keep things minimal especially for work. One last thing is that this does not have a strong chemical smell nor does it irritate my eyes. I&#x27;ve worn this 3 days in a row already and have not experienced anything negative about the product. This mascara works for me!</li>
    <li> The package arrived sealed and the product is not tempered.  However, after I opened it, it seems the product has been sitting somewhere for too long and it&#x27;s very dry - like the mascara that you&#x27;ve been using for a couple of month and it&#x27;s time to throw it away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is very good - very slim and good for sparse lashes!  I may have got a bad batch that&#x27;s been laying around for too long.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this for years, really great to get ALL lashes!</li>
    <li> I READ THE REVIEWS AND BOUGHT THIS ITEM.  I STILL USE IT MONTHS LATER.  IT DOES NOT WEIGH MY LASHES DOWN.  LUV IT! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love the brush, but I still get raccoon eyes with this product.</li>
    <li> My HG mascara!!! Please don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
    <li> Mascara in tube appears to be old, although it is useable.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara because it has a small brush.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara.  You don&#x27;t need a massive brush. The small brush works better than those other types.  Been using this for years.  Does need replacing somewhat often (every few months) due to the brush getting overloaded and my shed eyelashes sticking out.  But we all should replace makeup that often anyway right?  Great product, best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I got this in waterproof to be used as a lower lash mascara and it looks fantastic on the lashes but I find smudges under my eyes from after just a couple of hours?? Which is strange since everyone says this is so bulletproof. I will totally use this up and use the wand with another mascara once it&#x27;s done I&#x27;m just not a fan of the formula.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be good for lower lashes, but the brush is so small that it doesn&#x27;t really hold any mascara. It takes a long time just to get enough mascara on your lower lashes for them to show up at all, you have to keep going over and over the same area four or five times and I don&#x27;t even have super thin lashes. I ended up throwing it away. It was a great idea in theory, but just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Good lighter heaviness black mascara, and waterproof.  Only downside is it can leave small bits behind no matter how well you clean off your eye makeup, but is sure lasts all day with no &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
    <li> this is a good mascara with a great brush. You can get into the corners of your eyes very easy and you do not need to aply very much</li>
    <li> goes on kind of messy</li>
    <li> The small brush is so perfect to reach all the lash hair. I use it on myself and also with clients. It does not smudge (waterproof formula).</li>
    <li> My lashes are long, thick but unfortunately straight ¼  I only use the mascara to highlight them and keep them curled after using the curler on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Estee Lauder&amp;iexcl;¦s product for but a friend insisted this is just as good.  Estee&amp;iexcl;¦s mascara is $20+ for a new tube.  I figured I have only $5 to lose if this works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;iexcl;¦m impressed.  I really like this product.  I now own both the regular and waterproof.  No clumping or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe I&amp;iexcl;¦ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me.  The only negative is I really dislike the tiny, hard brush and prefer Estee&amp;iexcl;¦s brush but for this price I can definitely get past that.</li>
    <li> Just started using this but I really like it so far. I use it to give my lashes definition. The tiny applicator is good for separating the lashes and it adds the tiniest bit of length. This is not a dramatic mascara but perfect for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara for very thin, short and almost invisible eyelashes. The thin wand is perfect for short eyelashes. The only downfall is the tube drys out or runs out quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other mascaras. But, I keep buying it because I like the thin wand.</li>
    <li> is there even any product in this thing?  it has a very thin wand with almost nothing on it when pulled out of the container.  this is the first Maybelline product that I have not been happy with.  what were they thinking?</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for your bottom lashes. I gave this 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t lengthen or volumize my lashes as much as I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> Would have been good but mascara was thick and create lumps  ... I&#x27;m guessing it is old or possible out of date. I like the small brush. . May have been more effective in getting the full volumns lash if the mascara more fresh.</li>
    <li> This products aren&#x27;t available where I live, and i&#x27;ve been looking for them. I don&#x27;t have much to say, I love this, they are great, don&#x27;t leave lumps and a waterproof so, just great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara on my lower lashes for years. As an Asian, it is difficult to find a waterproof mascara that can be easily applied due to our eye shape and how close the lashes are to our skin. The short bristle length makes it much easier to NOT make mascara marks on the skin below the lashes.</li>
    <li> I needed a skinny brush since the lashes on one of my eyes don&#x27;t have any pigment.  The skinny brush helps me to get color close to the base of the lashes and the mascara lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, those I&#x27;ve tried a number much more expensive brands.  Waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smear  or&lt;br /&gt;smudge and leaves lashes long, accented but natural, not gloppy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this mascara a long, long time ago and hated it.  That was BEFORE I started doing my bottom lashes, however, and now that I am regularly applying mascara to my bottom lashes, I swear this mascara is a dream!  It separates and defines my bottom lashes without over saturating them with product.  I still use a different mascara for my upper lashes because this mascara does not give me the volume I want there, but for bottom lashes, just wow.</li>
    <li> Lash Discovery is a good quality mascara that covers the lashes well without leaving clumps. It truly is waterproof--tears don&#x27;t leave black puddles around your eyes. Tearing from allergies can really be a problem with mascara, but this mascara does not run. The best thing about this mascara is the brush. It is a narrower brush which enables me to get to the lashes at the corners of my eyes. I feel like I have more control with the shorter bristles. That&#x27;s another plus--the brush is not plastic--the brush is made of real bristles. This mascara has become my favorite, and I will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I have very short lashes and this mini mascara worked great.</li>
    <li> I have really short lashes, unfortunately, and this mascara wand is probably the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far for that, as the wand itself is small and can get to my short lashes without poking me in the eye or getting mascara all over. Didn&#x27;t give me a ton of volume or length, however, but it&#x27;s a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> It is ok not as good as I hoped it would be but I do like the smaller brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used this mascara before, and was annoyed to not be able to find it again, despite trying many stores in my area. It seems the trend lately is for over the top mascaras, but what if that&#x27;s not what you want? This one is perfect: good coverage, not clumpy or odd to apply, and gives a natural looking appearance that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;re gearing up to be in costume. Wears well, and is easy to remove with normal eye makeup removal products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Every so often I will buy another brand of so-called \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; mascara (I always like to be prepared!), but I am always disappointed in other mascaras! None of them are as waterproof as this one. The tiny brush gets all of my lashes and makes them look so long. My lashes are long on their own, but they are light brown with blonde tips so you can&#x27;t really see them well unless I put mascara on. I put 2-3 coats on them and they look great; I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my long lashes. And this mascara trumps all others! This is a staple in my makeup bag.  *Note: if you are looking to make your lashes look thicker, this probably isn&#x27;t the right product to use. If length and waterproof-ability is what you&#x27;re going for, look no further!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I usually start with this one after I curl my lashes. The waterproof factor helps keep the curl. I have pretty short and sparse lashes and this helps me get every little lash I have. I usually follow with a mascara that adds more volume, but this a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ised this before, so it was exactly what I expected. I like that it goes on thin. I like understated makeup , so this is the perfect waterproof mascara for me.</li>
    <li> it is a good product but does not make your lashes bigger. However, it makes them more curved, darker and also doesn&#x27;t leave all the lashes together, causing a beautiful natural looking lashes.</li>
    <li> I got this because I read online that it was really good for the price. But I was looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t uncurl my lashes when I apply it. I like to curl my lashes first and then apply the mascara so that the curler doesn&#x27;t get gross. But my curled lashes when to their original extremely straight positions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras through the years, but always come back to this one!  The smaller brush makes it easy to separate my lashes and prevent clumping.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on amazon because the price was pretty good. I threw it in with one of my orders because it seemed convenient. I&#x27;ve since made note of prices in stores and can get it at Walmart for a similar price, maybe less- although it&#x27;s really pennies we&#x27;re talking about.  Currently it goes for about $6.50 at Target.  If on sale at a drugstore, it could be less, especially if you happen to have a coupon.</li>
    <li> My favorite waterproof mascara.  The small brush really gets in to the corners .</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because of the thin wand and it doesn&#x27;t clump at all.  It covers each lash thoroughly and looks natural after application.  I definitely am going to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> No clumping and good coverage.  Stays on &#x27;til you take it off.  I&#x27;ve subscribed to make sure I never run out.</li>
    <li> this product might be waterproof if bought elsewhere. I purchased two. The mascara was too dry...as if it was really old, although I&#x27;d just opened it. What I could get on my lashes did last a bit longer than other mascara&#x27;s, but is deff not waterproof. It was really time consuming and tedious to get any color on my lashes as it was so dried out. Your results may be different if you purchase from a store. Both tubes were same; dry.</li>
    <li> Great if you have very fine lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this waterproof mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge.  It stays on until you take it off with facial cleanser and water.  You don&#x27;t need an oil-based eye make up remover to remove it. It is easy to apply and gets those tiny lashes that are hard to see thanks to the small applicator.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as Lash Discovery is the only mascara I use and thought it was a great buy. Once received I was disappointed as I only received 2 Lash Discovery and one other maybelline product I would never use. Wrote to seller and never heard back from.</li>
    <li> wish it really was smudge proof....</li>
    <li> I love this brand of mascara, and especially the size of the wand. I have small eyes with very light lashes, and this is perfect. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive, department store brands, and always go back to this. I haven&#x27;t found anything better. Doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes or pillows, but eye-make up remover takes it off well. The black is not too black, I&#x27;ve tried to dark brown, but it was too light.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara and brush that does not leave my lashes heavy and coated, and does not shed particles into my eyes!</li>
    <li> DO buy the waterproof. I use this little guy mostly for my bottom lashes, and that area gets the most oil/sweat as far as mascara goes, so yes, do go for the waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this since high school, I&#x27;m now a 20-something.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your eyes POP and because it&#x27;s so delicate compared to any other wand, you can really get to tiny areas and make such a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;As a tip, hold the wand inward to your face. Gently pull lid to the side to really expose the upper+inner lashes toward you more to apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;*** PLEASE NOTE: For those complaining about wand size. This is not made to replace your main mascara!!! Use this in addition to your thickening mascara to bring out the little hairs and really change your usual look.</li>
    <li> I use this on top of another mascara, and found that it works wonders in adding more volume and separating out the lashes.  Also, as I have found that I have a lot of allergies to eye makeup, this mascara does not make my eyes itch, and lasts all day since I am not constantly rubbing my eyes.</li>
    <li> But the product itself is a bit too dry and doesn&#x27;t give the lashes much volume or length... I will give it that it separates the lashes quite well though!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I was concerned when I saw the very thin brush but it really does help produce long lashes!</li>
    <li> the wand is very handsome especially for the lower lash line. but only very little product is coming out .even when you put on several coats you can hardly see a result .</li>
    <li> The brush itself it tiny (obviously), but the real problem I have with it is that there is practically no product that comes out on the brush. This means it takes me at least twice as long as usual to build up my lashes, and even then all I get is an extremely natural look. NO volume whatsoever, and if you apply it to your lower lashes you still can&#x27;t even see them. I&#x27;m all for the natural look normally, but this is just ridiculous. I think if the formula was wetter, and if more came out on the brush, it could be really good.</li>
    <li> I have very short lashes and small eyes.  This mini brush gets each lash coated thinly while lengthening and keeps lashes separated.  Waterproof formula stays put but still removes easily with remover or vaseline.  Can swim/cry in it too.  I&#x27;ve been using mainly this mascara for 7 years and when I try a different type, I am disappointed and quickly come back to this.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail of mascara! Love the small brush that gets every lash. No clumping and it stays put until you take it off.</li>
    <li> This is for detail and holding the lashes up before you apply a different coat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras. This one is perfect for me. The brush doesn&#x27;t hold a lot which is great for a subtle look. It&#x27;s also very forgiving, one can build up layers for night versus day. I hope Maybellline keeps making it because every time I find something I love it gets discontinued. Requires makeup remover. As long as they keep making it, my mascara search is over.</li>
    <li> This is the best bottom lash mascara.  The brush is small, so you can easily coat all those baby lashes on bottom or the inner corner lashes up top.  The formula runs on the drier side, which I personally prefer.  Not dry in a bad way, just not goopy like some formulas.  This adds definition, dark black color, and a little length.  This is not volumizing, which is fine for what it is generally used.  My tube would last a long time if I didnt feel unhygenic using it so long! I know you are supposed to replace mascara every three-ish months, but I used my last tube for about six before it ran a little to dry to use.  There was still plenty of product left... could have revived with eye drops but it was way past time to repurchase. I have used this product for about three years, so it is definitely a top-drawer staple and I keep repurchasing when needed.</li>
    <li> I have trouble controlling the thick brushes, and this is one of the better thin-brush mascaras I know about. I even use the brush in other tubes of mascara. Good deal for me!</li>
    <li> Similar to many of the negative reviews for this item sold by Amazon, the product I received was extremely dry and barely any mascara came off the brush. I was not able to use it. I bought this as an add-on item and seems like the product is old and dried out by the time it was shipped.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my lower lashes after a friend revealed to me that you are in fact supposed to put mascara on your lower lashes. who knew. anyway, the brush is terribly tiny, and i love it. it defines without clumping together, the small brush seems to coat each hair, not not 5 or 6 at a time. it&#x27;s a very natural look on upper lashes. nothing flashy, just enough enhancement to look GREAT!  on lower lashes it does just as well. defining your lashes without clumping or looking obvious.</li>
    <li> The best for getting the little eyelashes at the corners.  The brush keeps clumps from happening and gives a nice clean, natural look.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to apply and never clumps! I never get any streaks or runs and I wear it all day with only one application. I will be buying it again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have very short Asian straight lashes and this mascara seems to do the job.  It stays on and is not heavy that it weighs down the lashes.</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara. Easy to apply, no clumps, buildable, wears all day.</li>
    <li> If you like long, defined lashes, this is the mascara for you.  It has a tiny brush which allows for more precise application.  Although it&#x27;s waterproof, it removes pretty easily with soap &amp; water or even a good facial cleaning cloth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and, as with everything, found it reasonably priced on Amazon.</li>
    <li> As described.  Good service.</li>
    <li> This mascara is about the only one that does not smear and end up under my eyes. It goes on well and leave my lashes looking separated and soft, not clumpy. I find the skinny applicator very easy to use. The mascara is not too wet, so it doesn&#x27;t get all over my eyelids when I&#x27;m trying to apply it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I went swimming with this mascara on and it didn&#x27;t budge!</li>
    <li> I went through a period where my bottom eye lashes were very short and it was hard to put on mascara with the regular mascaras. I saw a review on this and decided to try it. I am happy I got this in water proof because I don&#x27;t think the regular would have lasted. Most regular mascaras end up flaking off in hours. The wand for this mascara is awesome. It feels like I was combing through each eye lash and was able to place the product evenly. It gives the lashes such a nice and long appearance.</li>
