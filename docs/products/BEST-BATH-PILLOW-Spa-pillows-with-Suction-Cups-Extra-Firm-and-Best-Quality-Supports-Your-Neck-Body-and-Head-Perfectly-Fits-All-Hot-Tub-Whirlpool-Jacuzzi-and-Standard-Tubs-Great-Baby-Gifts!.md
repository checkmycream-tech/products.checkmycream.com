<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very nice bath pillow! It is much better than the inflatable ones that end up in the trash after a few months because they won&#x27;t stay inflated. The suction cups are very strong, they don&#x27;t slide or move at all. I do make sure to actually take a towel and dry it off after use rather than letting it air dry.</li>
    <li> Love this bath pillow!  It fits the contour of my head and neck perfectly and the suction cups work great!  I live in the French Quarter in New Orleans and there is nothing like soaking in the tub on Sunday morning listening to the church bells from St. Louis Cathedral resting on this bath pillow...a slice of heaven! BTW...I&#x27;ve tried other pillows and this one is the best by far!</li>
    <li> This looks so luxurious online but it was a huge disappointment, and I threw it away after a couple of weeks. The first reason is that it doesn&#x27;t sit on the edge of my bath as shown in the picture. I don&#x27;t have enough of a lip on the back of the tub for it to rest, and putting it on the corner of the tub as shown in the photo is totally uncomfortable because you have to twist your neck. The suction cups fall out every time you try to move it, and they do snap back in, but it&#x27;s really tricky and time consuming. The biggest reason I would not recommend this product is that it is porous. It absorbs bath water, and you can&#x27;t ring it out because the material is too bulky and rubbery. So mine started to smell moldy after a few days. I was hoping this would be the perfect bath pillow, but for me, it was a Big Bummer!! :(</li>
    <li> The suction cups fell off and I gotta find a way to put them back into the holes for them (its not easy).  On the plus side, it works well just floating in the water with my head on it.. I actually took a couples naps in the tub using this. great!</li>
    <li> Just  the finishing touch our new jacuzzi  tub needed.</li>
    <li> The pillow seems very well-made and perfect for bathroom settings.  The suction cups work great and the pillow is comfy and water proof.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome bath pillow.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and makes taking bubble baths a true luxury!</li>
    <li> This pillow is so much nicer than other pillows I&#x27;ve had.  This is a solid pillow instead of a bath pillow that is essentially filled with air, as most bath pillows I&#x27;ve ever tried are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material makes it easy to clean and wipe off as well as is soft to the touch.  It&#x27;s super cozy to lie against and provides plenty of support for your head while enjoying a relaxing soak.  It truly is the nicest bath pillow I&#x27;ve personally ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**. Received at promo for review.</li>
    <li> I receved this pillow at a reduced cost to try out and then write a non-biased and non-paid review. I took a bath with this today as I have been ill and needed a nice relaxing bubble bath and this pillow is awesome! Is not one of those cheap, blow-up pillows that you see everywhere. This one is thick, solid plush and the suction cups work! Others have lost suction mid-bath but this one did not!! It made me relax and i was so comfy i fell asleep. The pillow is made very well too, so this will hold up for a very long time! Do not waste money on crappy blow up pillows when this will be the last bath pillow you will ever need! Truly happy customer right here!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable for one time but it absorbs water and is very difficult to squeeze out thus breeds bacteria. A bath pillow that absorbs water...go figure YUCK!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. When I tried to move the pillow, the suction came off and never worked the same. It also bothered me that it wasn&#x27;t the same white as my tub and didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> The suction cup easily comes out of the pillow. I am considering to return it.</li>
    <li> Confortable, but as soon as it was stuck to the tub, I tried to move it and the suction cups both popped off.  I cannot get them back in the holes, I have no idea how they got them in and the first place</li>
    <li> Not a fan,the pillow is rather firm and tends to hold moisture. I threw it out after one of the suction cups kept coming off. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely loving this bath pillow! I can see how much care it&#x27;s been placed, in creating this product. I look forward to many years of use!</li>
    <li> Fit the bill. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The auction cups did not stay on past the second use. Why bother?</li>
    <li> After a couple months of use, the suction cups both popped out and I can&#x27;t get them back in place.  Pillow is now useless, ugh.</li>
    <li> It has a purple cast to the white, a strong rubber smell and the suction cups pulled out.</li>
    <li> One suction cup came off immediately , leaving a big hole in the back of the cushion. Complete waste of money, returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Only problem is that it moves around a teeny tiny bit. Though in the pillow&#x27;s defense, I soak for a long time and I have a heavy head!  Otherwise it is perfectly shaped, super soft, doesn&#x27;t get icky or sweaty and is incredibly comfy!  You know how when you put a towel there, 99% of the time is falls into the tub.  This pillow fixes all those silly problems!  Love it!</li>
    <li> First off, shipping was prompt, however product simply didn&#x27;t deliver. I was excited to try my new pillow immediately, but quickly found that as others had stated, quality was poor. I placed pillow in my large soaking tub only to realize it wasn&#x27;t positioned where I would like it to be. I attempted to move it and the suction cups came out of the pillow. After trying to stuff back in for several minutes, I simply gave up. It is now boxed up to be returned once I return home.</li>
    <li> Suction cups come out easily and are difficult to put back in to the pillow. Pillow will soak up water.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this bath pillow. If you are use to the dollar store feel blow up air bath cushions, this one is very different and very firm! It is a non porous material so it will not soak up water and will not get mildew growth. It is a bean shape, and you can use it either way that is comfortable for you. Each person is different, and what may be comfortable for one, may not work for someone else. I was chosen to review this product and give my personal opinion of what I thought and how it worked for me. The suction cups work well, no slipping. Once you figure out the position you need, you will feel the difference in your neck and spine. I used this in my bathtub as well as outside in my hot tub! It&#x27;s fabulous! If you know someone who really enjoys their bath soaks or hot tub relaxation, then I would give this bath pillow/cushion a try! I&#x27;m sold on it. There&#x27;s a great coupon you can get for a buy one get one promotion. Share the experience! Also when you order you get a cool little ebook that has some extra secrets to get the most out of your relaxation time! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Very comfy! And it holds onto the tub very well. So glad we bought it!</li>
    <li> Finally a good bath tub pillows</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I can finally lay my head back and relax in the tub. Sticks on easily and super comfy.</li>
    <li> Wife loved the pillow. Very comfortable and durable.</li>
    <li> Terrible! I decided to splurge on this more expensive pillow and I really wish I had of paid more attention to the poor reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup came out about 5 minutes after I received it, before I even had a chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also extremely uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The pillow isn&#x27;t great. It has a strong odor that hasn&#x27;t gone away after 3 uses by my family and several attempts to clean it. It puts my neck into an awkward position.</li>
    <li> I purchased this pillow for a Friend that recently had surgery. Part of her recovery is multiple baths during the day. This was a perfect gift to help her enjoy her baths a little more. She is very satisfied with her spa pillow. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I thought it is more comfy but it is not</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Personally though, I&#x27;m not a fan of the &amp;#34;cool white&amp;#34; color. Would&#x27;ve preferred a warmer white.</li>
    <li> This head rest was pretty flimsy and not very comfortable. I stuck it on the bathtub and when I tried to move it to another location in the bathtub, the plastic suction part came off.</li>
    <li> My wife did not like it. Suction cups came out on first use and there is no shoulder support. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Pillow is OK, not great.  One of the suction cups came off 2nd time I used it.  The pillow has a smooth surface, but still absorbs a lot of water and becomes very heavy.  It is comfortable on my straight backed bathtub, but I dont think it will last long.  Certainly not $30 worth. I didn&#x27;t get the free E book that was promised.  I noticed other reviews said they got it in a separate email.......I didn&#x27;t. Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to contact the seller to ask about it. May 30,2015.....Threw this worthless, water-soaked stinky unusable falling apart piece of junk pillow in the trash.  Good riddance!</li>
    <li> Best bath pillow I have ever had. Really well molded and water does not leak in.</li>
    <li> Oh my Gosh!!!  This product is wonderful!  It doesn&#x27;t slip off the side of the tub, it dries/cleans easily, and it is comfortable!!!  What more could you look for to complete your relaxation and quiet time in the tub!!!  Just add some candles, a good book, a class of wine and some low playing jazz and it is perfection.</li>
    <li> I got this to try.  I take a bath every night and anything I can do to make it even better I jump on it.  When I got the chance to try out this bath pillow I was so excited.  I was heading to my mom’s in a few days and as a lot of you know I am in love with her bath room. All newly done with a Jacuzzi bath tub, and now a pillow woo hooo.  When I got there I used my new bath pillow and I was in love I could actually lay down and not have a sore neck I was so comfy I stayed in there for over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;  When I got out I was so sad my pillow had broken.  The suction cups came off and I immediately wrote to the company.  When they answered back I was smacking myself in the head.  The suction cups are removable.  I had no idea so I went back to the pillow and they just snapped right back in.  Now my mom was even more excited and decided that this was now her pillow to keep.  She always wanted one but did not want suction cups stuck to her new bath tub.  This was an awesome bath pillow not only comfortable to lie in the bath tub with, but dried very quickly and of course the removable suction cups.  I would totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great bath pillow. It is a perfect fit for my tub! The suction cups work great and it keeps the pillow in place so I can relax. I have had this pillow for three weeks and it is still in perfect condition. Other bath pillows I have tried would have been starting to fall apart by now but not this one, it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that comfortable.  I think that there are probably a lot of different alternatives out there that are cheaper and just as functional.</li>
    <li> Great addition, since it REALLY stays in place, wonderful!</li>
    <li> Ultra comfortable and the suction works well!</li>
    <li> This is a nice bath pillow. Its shape reminds me of a head rest on a car, but it is comfortable. I especially like that it does not require air, so it will not deflate on you and it keeps its shapes. So far the suction cups are staying put and I have not had any problem with it sliding.  It does the job just fine and I have been relaxing quite nicely. ;)</li>
    <li> I have to admit, when I first saw the actual product (once it was delivered) I was a little hesitant that it would actually be comfortable.  I was PLEASANTLY surprised.  This is not your typical &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; pillow and in fact should even be compared based off how this product is made and what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I wondered why the picture had the girl with the pillow on the top of the tub.  So the first thing I did was secure the pillow where we all would normally put a bath pillow.  Yeah, wasn&#x27;t working so much.  So I thought, okay well I will use it like the picture shows.  I cannot believe how comfortable that is.  And before you think I am talking frivously here, think about it.  When your head is upright,  you are not really relaxing...you are still using muscle to hold your head up in order to relax.  That still in turn uses your shoulders.  Think about soaking but with your neck\head slightly back, just back enough where you do not have to hold it up.  You can just let go, and doze.  I personally found it incredibly comfortable.  Which goes to show, don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover!  I thought it was very small at first sight.  It was a perfect size.  It wasn&#x27;t so big that it touched my shoulders, my head didn&#x27;t fall off the pillow, I just layed my head back and closed my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another great thing is how well it is made.  This is not the soft foam you get with your child&#x27;s toy.  This is extremely well made, durable but still soft enough for comfort.  When I moved it from the first position of the tub to the top of the top, the first thing I did was pull the suction plugs right off the product.  I thought oh great, I just broke it.  Nope...I just plugged them back in, they give you a little snap and you are good to go.  The holes that hold the suction plugs are reinforced, so there shouldn&#x27;t be any tearing or ripping for the life of the product.  If you pull one out, no biggie just pop it back in.  Great design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall fantastic product, glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> Heavy Duty Suction Cups do not work.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow! It really helps me relax in the bath. It is of great quality and is my new favorite thing. A great gift for mom this holiday season!</li>
    <li> What I like: the pillow is water proof and nice size. Suction cups work well to hold in place but not so strong you can&#x27;t scoot it around if you need to. Shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: the pillow is very hard. The internal foam would preferably be much softer. Almost wish I had gone with the blow up pillow.</li>
    <li> I unwrapped &amp; aired out the pillow as well as cleaning it off, as recommended by the seller, but a plastic-type odor has persisted for more than a week after I received it. I am hoping this will dissipate with use. I have been advised by the seller that this is what will happen. Otherwise, the pillow is very comfortable and appears to be all it is advertised to be. If not for the odor, I would give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> it gets so soaked, way overpriced and a total bummer for me.  Didn&#x27;t even give it to a friend.  In the garbage it went, my money too.  How could I send it back to amazon all whet and shrink wrap gone, etc, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Swissco Bath and spa pillow - about a third cheaper than this one, is far far better.  None of them are perfect when a bathtub is straight up and down.</li>
    <li> This pillow is quite uncomfortable for me. I previously had a more simple, flat pillow with a fold in it (one part laid on top of tub, one part in the tub) that was way more comfortable, but I wore it out and replaced it with this one.  I think most of the reason this pillow is so uncomfortable for me is because I have a DEEP soaking tub, so I can&#x27;t put the pillow on top of the tub (as pictured) and I must attach the pillow to the side of the tub... which is quite uncomfortable.    Also, the suction cups stick really well to the tub, but pull out of the pillow easily and are hard to get back in.    I disliked this pillow so much that I gave it away.</li>
    <li> This pillow smelled really bad right out of the box-- I let it sit for a few hours and then got into the bath where it immediately FELL APART. The white coating peeled off and dissolved into the bath water, the suction cups fell out of the really large holes that were supposed to contain them. I am livid that I spent $20 on this. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> this is a great product!  it is formed just right - soft but firm.  Comfortable.</li>
    <li> Suction cups broke after a week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of inflatable bath pillows in the past and they&#x27;ve never really lasted. This one is different. It&#x27;s made out of waterproof foam. It reminds me of the solid foam stress balls that you get from a vendor fair. It is nicely contoured &amp; offers nice support to your neck &amp; head. The suction cups grip the tub well.  I&#x27;ve used it in my garden tub &amp; plan to try it in my hot tub, too. This would be an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> Not as comfortable as I expected it to be...too hard and does not support my neck.</li>
    <li> This is a great Luxury Spa Bath Pillow it is made of waterproof foam and has suction cups.I was in desperate need of one of these and I was really excited to get this in.I received this during a promotional sale they had so I knew I had to get me one before it ended.I really like the size of it and it is perfectly sized for my head.I love to take baths but being a Mother with a toddler I don&#x27;t really have much me time lately.I also do not get time to spend 30minutes or more in the bathtub soaking up some essential oils either.So when I do get to take a nice relaxing bath this is a special treat for me.This works perfect for me in the bathroom but there was one problem I had was one of the suction cups popped off when I was repositioning it during my bath.It took me some elbow grease to get it back in so just keep in mind that if it does come off mine went back in &amp; since then has not came off.I do wish it was a little bit sturdier suction cup and that it would not pop off like that.But other than that I really enjoy the comort it gives me.I can actually lay my head back now &amp; have a nice cushion to support my head.Some of the cons of this would probably be that it works best in a tub that has a backrest.I tried it on the wall and for me it was not that comfortable.You can get a better experience using it with a tub with a backrest in my opinion.Mine has a back rest so I was able to enjoy it.I do not know if it would work well with a vertical backrest since I do not have one.I also would suggest drying this off and letting it air dry before using it again or storing it away to prevent it from molding.I also suggest not submerging this into water since water might collect where the suction cups are.But other than that I really enjoy using it and glad I finally got a pillow that provides me some support &amp; comfort while I get some time to relax.</li>
    <li> I  though this pillow would be great, but though it has a nice cushion it really is meant for a particular type of bathtub. Which, of course, I do not own. The bathtub in my house is older and right against the wall, I&#x27;ve tried several ways to make it comfortable to no avail. Great pillow given it works with your tub.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof after 1 month of use. Paid the high price of $29.99 for this because it says it is waterproof. I have read all the reviews and do not see anyone else complaining about the waterproof foam and being completely waterproof. I would exchange it, in case I got a defect pillow, but I am one day past the exchange/return limit. Put it in the dryer for 2 hours on high and I can still ring some water out of the pillow. I have had several bath pillows over the years and this was the best one so far, even at $29.99, except for not being waterproof.</li>
    <li> Before I even used the pillow I placed it on my bathtub, decided I wanted it somewhere else and went to move it, and both of the plastic suction cups came off! There were two large holes where the suction cups had been, and even though I put them back in place, there was still space for water to get into the pillow if it falls in the bathtub or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also disappointed that the pillow was SOOOOO rigid! It&#x27;s not flexible at all, which made it impossible to use in my bathtub, which has the wall right next to where my head is. In order for the pillow to lay in a comfortable position you would need at least 4-6 inches of space between your head and the wall, which my bathtub doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this bath pillow to Amazon as soon as possible!</li>
    <li> Bought this because we needed a pillow for our Jacuzzi at home.  I love the texture on this pillow as it has a slight memory foamish feel to it.  It&#x27;s relaxing to your head and shoulders.  The suction cup makes it so much easier to use and the texture of it is so easy to clean after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Must buy if you have a Jacuzzi or hot tub.</li>
    <li> This pillow is so comfy.  I always buy bath pillows this is by far the most comfortable one there is. It&#x27;s easy to latch on to the tub not too big and bulky. It&#x27;s easy to store away as well. I highly reccomend this bath pillow you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Not good don&#x27;t stick to tub</li>
    <li> So, I love baths, I can take them any time of day as long as I find the time...But I have never owned a bath pillow, just wanted to. It was always a chore trying to get comfortable and relax, even though I really love baths every once in a while. The Simply Essentials bath pillow is comfortable and easy to use. I found when I first tried to place it that it didn&#x27;t work well directly at the back of the tub, but slightly to the side it did and I didn&#x27;t have to lay weird or anything to use it. I liked that it laid back opposed to some that stand straight up. (I mean, can you really relax that way?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the pillow is placed the way it&#x27;s supposed to be it sits well and stays in place. I didn&#x27;t have to reposition it and it didn&#x27;t fall down between baths at all. I also really like that it&#x27;s white. I can paint my bathroom any color I want and it will go well. I was able to sit comfortably for a while and soak in the tub while using this pillow without any nasty neck kinks or getting my neck wet (that means dry hair!) I never worried about slipping or sliding into the tub because my head was well supported. This is definitely a great bath pillow for bath lovers. This pillow is also great to have a bucket under and rinse a child&#x27;s hair. I actually use my mop bucket to catch water that leaks past and have my daughter tilt her head back on the pillow with her hair over the back and rinse her hair that way to keep the soap out of her eyes. It works great!</li>
    <li> Not comfortable.  Not nice.</li>
    <li> First, I must say this is the Simply Essential’s Luxury Spa Bath Pillow is the nicest I have owned! My initial impression is that it is a little firmer than I expected. It turned out that was not a problem. The firmness of the pillow is actually quite supportive. It cradles the head nicely. The pillow can work from a variety of angles--so I suggest playing with it to see what works best in your tub. I have a history of neck and shoulder injuries that make relaxing in the tub not quite as relaxing as I hope. But this pillow helps a lot as it promotes good alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this bath pillow to anyone who is interested in a firm yet ergonomically friendly bath pillow. It had permanently replaced my old bath pillow. With the holiday season approaching, it is a great gift for anyone who likes to bathe or who needs a little relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free Luxury Spa Bath Pillow for review purposes. I have been using it for about three weeks as I like to thoroughly test anything before I post a review.</li>
    <li> Good quality for first look, will see after long term usage. Convenient and comfortable. Close to picture and met my expectations. Thanks for products.</li>
    <li> Hate this.  Was not comfortable.  Kept any way</li>
    <li> Suction cup came off on first use. I can re-insert it into the body of the pillow, but it eventually comes out every time.  Decent if you have the right kind of tub.</li>
    <li> I love relaxing in the bath. After a long day with the kids and the dogs, nothing speaks more to my soul than soaking quietly in the tub. Simply Essentials has the perfect prop for such a soak with it&#x27;s new Bath Pillow. It is constructed of soft polyurethane and can be used with or without suction cups that attach to hold the pillow stationary. I have used it with and without the suction cups and find that either method helps me relax while bathing. I have tried other bath pillows in the past, but none have been as luxurious as this pillow. It&#x27;s soft enough to relax on but not so soft that it goes flat. I really like it, so much in fact, that I&#x27;m going to include it with gift packages for my favorite women this Christmas. It will fit any bathtub and the company offers a 1 year risk free guarantee.</li>
    <li> This spa pillow was not as expected.  The little suction cups on the back came off every time we tried to move the pillow and then it was very hard to get them back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend unless you are going to leave them in one spot and not move them at all...</li>
    <li> This pillow is made from waterproof PU foam, is contoured, and can be used bean up or bean down to maximize comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the suctions cups on the back, it will hold firmly to your tub or wall. In my case I had to use it on my wall, because the tub where I currently live has a plastic liner (boo...thumbs down!). So, I attached it to my wall, bean up, and it was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so relaxing, and the pillow held firmly, so I didn&#x27;t have to readjust and interrupt my relaxation. I like that this pillow doesn&#x27;t absorb water, even if it falls in the tub, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it starting to stink from water settling in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I found was that when trying to remove the pillow, the suction cups hold so tightly that they will pop off the pillow. However, it is an easy fix, as you can pop them back into place with a little twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free as part of a review, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> The pillow is comfortable, but the suction cups ripped out the first time I used it. They are difficult to place back in, and tend to pop back out very easily anyways.</li>
    <li> Not match the color - white is not white - kinda bluish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this pillow is great, but when I received it in the mail it was in pieces.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  Very comfortable and stays where you put it.  It is both soft and waterproof - doesn&#x27;t absorb water and become heavy.  It has a strong odor when you first take it out of the packaging, but that quickly fades.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. The suction cups hold well and don&#x27;t move around and it&#x27;s incredibly comfortable! Took a boring bathtub and made it feel like a relaxing spa tub!</li>
    <li> My wife works hard. Accounting is mind work and it stresses you out at times. When we had a chance to review this bath pillow, she was happy to try it. She loves to come after a long day and take a hot bath. The pillow has suction cups that hold the pillow to your bathtub. Then you lie your head on the soft pillow. My wife loves the pillow because it is comfortable. It makes her want to fall asleep while taking her bath. You can even bring it with you on vacation. She used it in the hotel when we took a weekend trip to Orlando. Great pillow for those who love to take baths to relax.</li>
    <li> This looks so comfy and perfect, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s very hard, not soft and comfy, so your head isnt really comfortable. It&#x27;s too thick, even at the thin part, and so your head is sticking way up. It&#x27;s spongy, so if it gets wet, it&#x27;s like a giant hard sponge, the suction cups pop out easily, and I couldnt find a single position to put it in that was comfortable for any period of time.</li>
    <li> I love taking baths! However, it&#x27;s really hard to relax when you can&#x27;t get comfortable. I&#x27;m always wading up a towel to put under my head and then when it falls in a gets drenched I have a nice mess to deal with. Not my picture of &amp;#34;relaxing&amp;#34;. So when I was given the chance to review this item, I was super excited to oblige and for good reason! This pillow is amazing! It&#x27;s very well made, waterproof and extremely comfortable! It&#x27;s solid not flimsy or cheap like some things I have seen. I think these would make perfect gifts and will definitely be adding them to my list!</li>
    <li> I was happy to review this pillow because taking a long, hot bath in my whirlpool, is one of my favorite things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this pillow and the fact that the outside material is waterproof and not made out of a material that needs to dry out.  The old one that I had, had a cotton like cover which was soft but it always got wet and I would have to take it off and dry it out.  I love that I can just put this one in the tub and leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pillow is very comfortable and I like that the sides are built up a little.  It helps to keep my head and neck straight and in a very comfortable position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you place your pillow in your tub, it will NOT move.  The suction cups are awesome and held to my tub wonderfully.  It takes some pulling to get it off to position again but that&#x27;s ok in my book because I don&#x27;t want it moving once I have it where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a no risk 1 year guarantee with this product so you have everything to gain and nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I always look at the other reviews before purchasing.  I am a long term Amazon Shopper.  I have never returned anything in all the years I have been shopping on Amazon.  All the positive reviews!!  OK!!  I&#x27;m in.  I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter.  I was making her a spa basket for Christmas.  I used mine the first time and discovered this was the most uncomfortable bath pillow I have ever had.  I am a life long bubble bath taker.  I love to put my music on ~ light some candles and relax.  I couldn&#x27;t make it work at all.  I returned the first pillow to Amazon.  No problem.  $$ refunded.  Since I had already opened the package I kept mine and decided to try to make the best of it.  I used it a few times but in my tub I had to lay completely flat on the bottom of the tub for my head to feel comfortable.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and this pillow was not working for me.  The final straw was when I went to clean my tub ~ I removed the pillow from it&#x27;s resting place.  One of the suction cups pulled out and I was not able to even push it back in.  I&#x27;m not the strongest person in the world ~ constantly need my husband to open jars for me.  Although others seemed to love this pillow  I just don&#x27;t see the quality for the price charged.  I ordered another pillow (from Amazon) for $8.99 and love it!!</li>
    <li> When I first opened this product, the suction cup was so strong it came it stuck on my kitchen counter and I couldn&#x27;t get it off. It actually pulled out of the pillow. I thought that would mean it was cheaply made but to my surprise it went back into the foam/pillow with ease. It did have a funny plastic-like smell that was very strong but after washing it a few times and being in my tub that smell has faded. It&#x27;s stayed very well suctioned to my tub. It&#x27;s very comfy on your hear and neck. I really am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys taking relaxing baths for more neck and head support.</li>
    <li> i am really disappointed with this pillow.  it arrived two days ago and i have used it twice.  after the first use, the suction cup tore out of the pillow and i have been unable to get it back into the hole.  additionally, as others have stated, it is a terrible pillow if your bath tub is flesh with the wall.  this pillow is made for a free standing bath tub.  i tried, as the picture demonstrates, to put the pillow on the side of the bath tub to rest my head, and it is awkward and not comfortable.  on top of this, the pillow is not soft at all and it started to smell today (day two of using it).  it does get a couple of stars for the design.  i appreciate the ergonomics and think if i had a stand alone tub and maybe some waterproof crazy glue, i would like this pillow more.</li>
    <li> This pillow comes in a great size ....and I have used it a few times....the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it moved bc the suction wasn&#x27;t great ....but overall it is comfortable and a great size</li>
    <li> Great purchase - would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This  pillow is so comfortable. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really love this bath pillow. I am able to actually put my head back on the pillow and not a hard surface and the suction allows the pillow to stay in place even while wet. The pillow doesn&#x27;t attract dirt and is pretty big even for my big head lol. I recommend getting one just to help you relax it is sooo worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this spa pillow because it has suction cups to keep it in place and is made of foam and covered with waterproof material. It is easy to keep clean and most of all is comfortable. When I lay back and rest my head, the preformed contour for my neck and head is pecfect.</li>
    <li> The suction cup pulled out and the pillow filled with water.  Very unsanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow! It attaches well to the tub and supports my head. Being rather short, I appreciate having a way to rest my head that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like the pillow is going to &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; and allow me to slip.</li>
    <li> Complete failure to function.  I received the product (promptly delivered) A suction cup pulled out the first time I used it!  As noted elsewhere, it can not be replaced in its hole by hand.  Furthermore, there was not one single position I could find that was comfortable for more than 2-3 minutes.  This included rotating the pillow in every position and even trying it in the corner of the tub as pictured.  I am 5&amp;#34; 10&amp;#34; and it may be comfortable for very short or tall people but for me, this was a complete waste of the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this pillow. We&#x27;ve purchased several before, but the material and design made them mold quickly. This cleans easily and isn&#x27;t stuffed with cotton that can mold quickly. It is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt; The first time I took it off of the tub one suction cup came out, but my husband was able to press it back in. We haven&#x27;t had that problem since.</li>
    <li> sooooo soft and comfy, I have a super huge garden tub and this pillow makes relaxing in the tub soooo nice...</li>
    <li> My only reason for giving this product 4 stars is due to one of the suction cups coming off the pillow when removing it from the tub. I was able to easily stick it back on, but I have not had trouble with the other side.  The pillow dries well and does not collect mildew.  Unfortunately it did not work well in the tub I primarily use. If you have a garden tub that sits in the corner, it is difficult to get it to sit right. However it does work well for traditional tubs.</li>
    <li> I bought this pad for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. to protect my babies head while he is in his baby bath.&lt;br /&gt;2. to use for myself while bathing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package I noticed the pillow has a strong smell of off-gassing. After a week, it still smells, but not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the pillow behind my babies head in the tub and it does the trick. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my baby hitting his head on our tub walls when he kicks around in his baby tub. Unfortunately, when I took the pillow off, the suction cups came out. And every time I move the pillow the cups come out of their holes. There&#x27;s nothing to prevent the holes from tearing and there&#x27;s nothing to guide the suction cups back onto the pillow. Instead, I must squeeze the suction cups back into literal holes in the back of the pillow. Every time I use the pillow I have to fight with getting the suction cups back in. I am sure over time the holes will tear and the pillow will be absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my own use, the pillow is too bulky and the neck curvature is too narrow and I have a small head. It is quite uncomfortable. Plus since my tub already leans back and we have a little lip on the back of our tub, it can&#x27;t suction where i need it.  Instead, it slips around every time I move. It doesn&#x27;t quite work for my individual needs.</li>
    <li> I love this bath pillow! It is the best one I have experienced yet.  It is stable enough to stay put while feeling very comfortable.  In addition, it is ergonomically sound.  I used it for an hour with no back or neck aches.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Returned because of moldy odor.</li>
    <li> It is what it is...nothing &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with the product but not very comfortable,  very little give at all,  think of a nerf football only a little harder</li>
    <li> Not at all what i expected. It seems really small for a bath pillow and extremely hard.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it had great reviews but I am not happy with it.  It was very plush but absorbed water and I could not get all the moisture back out and it began to turn dark and is now growing black mold and smells bad so I will toss it out and replace it with a less expensive inflatable pillow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David F.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a bath pillow but for some reason I never got one. I am so glad I got this pillow. Usually I would try to roll up a towel or just not use a pillow at all and would be extremely uncomfortable the whole time. This thing is absolutely amazing. It keeps the bottom of my hair dry when it&#x27;s put in a ponytail. It sticks onto my tub very easily. It&#x27;s so comfortable to lay my head on I almost ended up falling asleep. It keeps my neck straight so I can actually enjoy a bath for longer than a few minutes. I have really bad back problems that already cause me pain when I&#x27;m trying to take a bath so this pillow really helps. The pillow attaches easily to the tub and comes off easily when you want it to. Wipes down nicely so you can keep it clean. This bath pillow is perfect and just what I have needed! *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This was a gift, no further review to offer.</li>
    <li> Suction cups popped out and cannot go back i n as the plastic has torn, item has partically discolored, and is hard against your head/neck.</li>
    <li> I like this pillow because I can use it when I take a bath.</li>
    <li> Pillow stays in place and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product!</li>
    <li> My GF asked for a bath pillow, and like I always do, I logged onto my Amazon account and looked for bath Pillows. Read the reviews for some greats ones for this Pillow and ordered it. She loves it, and is still thanking me for getting it for her. I does what it says, and so far no complaints. I would rec a mend it.</li>
    <li> Anti microbial material smells really weird, also isn&#x27;t comfortable in closed in shower tub.</li>
