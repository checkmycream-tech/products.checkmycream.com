      <li>I&#x27;m always pleased with the color.</li>
      <li>Make sure you wash out the henna under the water for about 10 minutes, it does take a lot of washing out.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this to dye my greying hair.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>approx 30% grey, the Henna Brown made my color look great !  </li>
      <li>all this is a Great Henna product that is simple and fast to use and produced a safe good quality hair color for me!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Easy  to use.</li>
      <li>After much research about Henna, and reading about how easy this product was to use, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I heard about Henna years ago, but was left with the impression that it was not that great of a product.  </li>
      <li>My hair is getting healthy again for the first time in years.  </li>
      <li>Make sure it ships from Henna Hut though, some imposters out there (learned the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;Their shampoos are absolutely incredible as well.</li>
      <li>I did an all over application the first time, and where I was the most gray (mostly the roots where no chemical color had been applied) it did come out very orange/copper.</li>
      <li>have paid upwards of 150.00 for professional highlights that did not look anywhere near as good as the henna !</li>
      <li>And it just so happened to be right before my oldest daughter&#x27;s wedding!</li>
      <li>Does not really color great but no skin reactions.</li>
      <li>After just one use, I found out just how true all the reviews I read about this product were.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like a head full of mud.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy and very forgiving!</li>
      <li>The brown henna is a perfect color for my hair and it gives my subtle reddish brown highlights.</li>
      <li>I decided to try it to cover brassy, grown out highlights and return my hair to a shade more true to my natural one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>About how it is all natural, vegan and safe for all body hair.</li>
      <li>I then wrap my head in a warm towel and go to work on my computer for several hours.  </li>
      <li>It allows me to continue covering my gray while also making my hair shinny and soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Over the years my hair has gotten more and more damaged due to processing and treatments to try and make my hair look thicker and fuller.  </li>
      <li>Not so when you choose the right brand and color.</li>
      <li>(that \\&quot;Bride of Frankenstein\\&quot; streak on the right side of my head!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(If it were, then everyone would be using it, right?)  </li>
      <li>so I just parted it there and hid the right side where it was orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that is mossy brown with streaks of grey if left to its own devices.  </li>
      <li>If you find that you need more, just add some more henna powder and a little bit of water into your existing mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I really wish I could find a chemical free color that REALLY covers gray.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using henna.</li>
      <li>The second time I buy this, I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re still pretty copper looking.</li>
      <li>will continue buying this; much better than regular dying products.</li>
      <li>This tended to make my beard appear more red than brown.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly blend with my Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;-DO NOT use the whole package at once!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly blend with my Chanel.  </li>
      <li>love this it is the only product that covers my gray hair!</li>
      <li>I should mention that this was my first time using Henna.</li>
      <li>The cost is better than regular hair dye products.</li>
      <li>I first did test strands the week before, so I knew what to expect.  </li>
      <li>Following the instructions carefully is key to getting good results.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that you cannot leave it on too long and damage your hair.  </li>
      <li>first application was very time consuming.</li>
      <li>It has given my hair a beautiful brown color, very thick and vibrant! \\&quot;</li>
      <li>I will say, my grey is covered better than with the chemical dyes, the color looks better, and also it is no longer dry or frizzy looking.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and extremely curly.  </li>
      <li>I so am happy to have the exact color I wanted and an unexpectedly dramatic improvement in texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable and Henna Hut has a variety of colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did not cover white hair so well and the result color is reddish light brown.</li>
      <li>I really like the color over all...</li>
      <li>It was very distressing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product does not worse the $10 dollars.</li>
      <li>And natural!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results I got from this product; it left my hair with a silky shine and even slightly thicker; not to mention the natural brown-looking color which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Make sure they are clean and paint it on and let them sit for an hr-depending on how dark you want it you can do it again the next day.</li>
      <li>You can, and I recommend, to add an essential oil with a sweet scent (about half an OZ, (15ml)) to the Henna mixture for better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used this brown then went burgundy and now thinking about deep red :)</li>
      <li>It had not taken particularly well to the highlighting process</li>
      <li>It rinsed out fairly easy compared to other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>completely re-do my whole head.  </li>
      <li>After leaving the hairdresser the last time feeling like I had been robbed, I vowed that I would no longer pay big bucks for my hair to look great for a few weeks and then start breaking off and falling out over time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product gave me even, natural looking coverage in about an hour!</li>
      <li>let it go completely gray (fat chance!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am giving it 5 stars even though I haven&#x27;t used it yet because it was delivered 3 days after I ordered it! AND it came with directions! They explain the correct way to prep your scalp or beard and what to expect if you have white/gray hair!</li>
    <li> This did literally nothing to my hair (brown) and I followed the directions to a T. My friend swears by this stuff but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the results I got from this product; it left my hair with a silky shine and even slightly thicker; not to mention the natural brown-looking color which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m glad that it didn&#x27;t stain my skin at all! Usually Henna product are associated with staining the skin and everything it touches... but this one did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also like to add a few useful tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT use the whole package at once! the package contains 100mg of Henna powder, which you mix with a cap &amp; 1/2 of warm water. But, 100mg is enough for two applications. So, use half of the package to 3/4 of a cup of water. If you find that you need more, just add some more henna powder and a little bit of water into your existing mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Henna product tends to smell a bit like a Holy Cow compost. You can, and I recommend, to add an essential oil with a sweet scent (about half an OZ, (15ml)) to the Henna mixture for better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend this product, if one is looking for a natural alternative to hair dyes.</li>
    <li> This product was not as tricky to mix as some of the other henna/herb natural hair dyes I&#x27;ve used so I was looking forward to trying it.  Unfortunately, my white/gray hair at my temples turned orange! It claims to cover gray but it doesn&#x27;t.  I followed the instructions to the tee but my brown hair now has orange streaks.  Since then, someone suggested to add coffee(liquid and grounds) to the henna to deepen the color.  I will try that soon, as I have enough to do another coloring. But I really wish I could find a chemical free color that REALLY covers gray.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is mossy brown with streaks of grey if left to its own devices.  Over the years my hair has gotten more and more damaged due to processing and treatments to try and make my hair look thicker and fuller.  I heard about Henna years ago, but was left with the impression that it was not that great of a product.  (If it were, then everyone would be using it, right?)  Well, apparently not.  After leaving the hairdresser the last time feeling like I had been robbed, I vowed that I would no longer pay big bucks for my hair to look great for a few weeks and then start breaking off and falling out over time.&lt;br /&gt;So, I researched the internet and came back to Henna.  I thought I would try it, I did, and I am not looking back.  I read about the orange tint problem that some people had trying to cover grey and I used coffee to mix the henna.  The key is to get it wet enough but not too wet so that it is dripping all over while it&#x27;s on your head.  It smells funny, but it is an earthy smell and not a toxic smell like traditional hair color.  I ordered this product and got 3 uses out of it.  My hair is getting healthy again for the first time in years.  Instead of stripping my hair, it seems to cover and protect it.  I can even grow my hair a little longer because less of it is falling out - leaving my hair to look stringy.&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair all over by dividing it in small strands and covering thoroughly, and then wrap my head in plastic wrap.  I add a bit back to the temple area where grey coverage is the most difficult.  I then wrap my head in a warm towel and go to work on my computer for several hours.  I leave the color on from 2-3 hours.  I love the fact that you cannot leave it on too long and damage your hair.  Sometimes it is a bit dark, but it washes out evenly over time and you are not left with ugly root with a straight line.  No wonder hair dressers do not want us to know about this stuff.  Then we will stop paying them tons of money for color and treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that this might not be for everyone, but for me it has saved me substantial amounts of time, money and hair loss!  Oh, and did I mention that my husband and son now tell me that my hair is so soft!or and treatments.

    <li> My hair is thick and it covered all of the gray and left my hair shiny. The cost is better than regular hair dye products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this henna (from hennahut.com as well) for a few years now, and wow my hair grows fast with it! It is different from regular hair dyes, you mix up the powder with water, and apply it to your hair in sections, the henna will look like a green paste (I got the brown, so the indigo is included in the henna). I leave it on my hair for about 2-3 hours, I have very few grays, and it does cover them. Make sure you wash out the henna under the water for about 10 minutes, it does take a lot of washing out. This product is worth the time and effort, and you will have great healthy hair that shines and is thicker.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 packets of Brown and 1 packet of Mahogany and mixed them all together. I have long hair and was afraid that one packet wouldn&#x27;t be enough... Plus, I wanted to keep my copper highlights and was afraid that just Brown would turn out mousy. I should mention that this was my first time using Henna. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair pretty regularly for the last 25 years... sometimes at the salon, but mostly at home using chemical \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; hair dyes. Since my hair has gotten increasingly gray, the chemical color wasn&#x27;t covering as well. Last year, in an attempt to cover it, I used a product for \\&quot;hard to cover gray\\&quot;. What a mistake! I had used the regular strength hair color in this brand without issue, but the extra strength hair color damaged my hair... I mean, REALLY damaged it! My hair was breaking off and falling out all over the place!! It also felt very rough and all the shine was gone. And it just so happened to be right before my oldest daughter&#x27;s wedding! It got so bad that I was shopping for wigs! It was very distressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took me 6 months to nurse my hair back to health, but it was much thinner than normal. I decided to try a non-permanent color thinking it would be gentler, but it was still a chemical and my hair started breaking off again. That&#x27;s when I decided that there would be no more chemical hair dyes put in my hair. Which left me two choices... let it go completely gray (fat chance!) or try Henna. And the rest is history. What they say about Henna being good for your hair is true. My hair is shinny and smooth again and feels great. I did an all over application the first time, and where I was the most gray (mostly the roots where no chemical color had been applied) it did come out very orange/copper. Luckily I have less gray on the left side of my head so I just parted it there and hid the right side where it was orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first application was very time consuming. I was trying not to make a mess, or dye my skin. I mixed it at about the consistency of yogurt and applied it with my gloved fingers. Then covered it with a disposable shower cap (I picked up a package of them at Sally&#x27;s) and then wrapped a hair towel around it and left it for 2 1/2 hours. I was a little difficult to rinse out. Kind of like trying to rinse mud out of your hair. The whole process took up the entire afternoon. The color continued to come out after I washed it each time for a couple of weeks and the color got on my white towels, but it comes out in the laundry. And there was no color transfer when it was dry... pillow cases and clothing showed no sign of color. I really like the color over all... dark brown with copper highlights. It&#x27;s just a little too orange where my hair is whitest (that \\&quot;Bride of Frankenstein\\&quot; streak on the right side of my head!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had plenty of Henna left after the first application, so when it was time to touch up the roots I got some ear covers (tiny disposable shower caps for your ears), a hair color applicator brush and mixing bowl (all from Sally&#x27;s) and mixed the Henna a little thinner (more like cheese sauce) with coffee instead of water. Applying it with a brush to just the roots was quick and easy and less messy. (TIP... if you apply a heavy hand cream on your face near your hairline, you won&#x27;t have to worry about it staining your skin.) I left the root application on for two hours and rinsed it out. The thinner mixture rinsed out easier and applying it to just the roots didn&#x27;t leave any visible line... it blended perfectly. All the new gray roots were covered, except a few spots on the grayer side of my head. They&#x27;re still pretty copper looking. Guess I&#x27;ll just leave it parted on the left for now &#x27;till I figure out what to do. Maybe I&#x27;ll try changing the ratio of Brown to Mahogany. That&#x27;s one of the great things about Henna... you don&#x27;t have to wait 6 weeks between colorings. I think I&#x27;ll also try the essential oil tip as well. Henna does smell a little \\&quot;barnyardy\\&quot;... and it sticks with you for a couple of days. Doesn&#x27;t exactly blend with my Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my hair!

    <li> \\&quot;OMG! Love this product. Goodbye hair dyes and hello HENNA! I have had a rough path with my hair. Having thyroid disease is terrible then on top of it going to salons and having hair destroyed with chemical hair dyes. I highly recommend this product!!! It has given my hair a beautiful brown color, very thick and vibrant! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna for about 3 or 4 months and I absoluetly love it.  I have a lot of grey around my hairline so I apply henna once a month.  The brown henna is a perfect color for my hair and it gives my subtle reddish brown highlights.</li>
    <li> I use this product to dye my eyebrows. Make sure they are clean and paint it on and let them sit for an hr-depending on how dark you want it you can do it again the next day. I am strawberry blonde and I like medium blonde/brown eyebrows so I use it  twice sometimes. No worry of burning your eyes! A half tsp and a tiny bit of water is all I need. Be careful not to get it outside of your brow line. Cheaper than going to the beauty shop! And natural!!!</li>
    <li> I have used henna and indigo separately to make brown hair dye, and this product was inferior to that. The color did not last or take as well as using two separate products. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Easy  to use. It&#x27;s effective and results in a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Love the Henna from Hennahut. Keeps my hair healthy and the color looks great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Henna about four or five months.  My hair is very fine and extremely curly.  Traditional hair dyes do not agree with my hair they left my hair feeling dry and brittle.  It does fade,  but that is okay,  I do an application approximately every four weeks and completely re-do my whole head.  That way there is never a line of demarcation that I used to get with traditional hair dyes.  It leaves my curls elongated and conditioned, not to mention my hair feels thicker.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is good but not perfect. It darkens hair but some grey/white hair remains; thus its effect is subtle.  Anyway, you can rest assured knowing that you are not putting a dangerous chemistry set on your head!  Following the instructions carefully is key to getting good results.</li>
    <li> I buy this color for my brother. He lost his girlfriend to cancer and has since made the move to an organic all natural lifestyle. I told him about Henna Hut henna. About how it is all natural, vegan and safe for all body hair. He has been using it ever since. The result is soft shiny hair without grey.Great product for men and women, for hair, beard and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the dye didn&#x27;t really work too well for dying my beard. I have to leave it on for hours to see any change in color</li>
    <li> Does not really color great but no skin reactions. price is ok. goes on nice. no play for mr gray!</li>
    <li> This tended to make my beard appear more red than brown.</li>
    <li> I used this brown then went burgundy and now thinking about deep red :) Make sure it ships from Henna Hut though, some imposters out there (learned the hard way).&lt;br /&gt;Their shampoos are absolutely incredible as well. Thank you Harvest Moon!</li>
    <li> This product does not worse the $10 dollars. The color does not stay on it and after couple hair washing the color is gone.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using henna. I decided to try it to cover brassy, grown out highlights and return my hair to a shade more true to my natural one. WOW! This product gave me even, natural looking coverage in about an hour! I also couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture with just one use. I have fine hair that tends to be a bit delicate. It had not taken particularly well to the highlighting process and I still had some split ends and dullness. This product helped a lot with both! I so am happy to have the exact color I wanted and an unexpectedly dramatic improvement in texture. I am a permanent customer! No more chemical dyes and expensive salon treatments for me. FIVE STARS</li>
    <li> love this it is the only product that covers my gray hair!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. After I started having problems with my hair breaking, weak and looking dry and frizzy, even though I conditioned every other day, my daughter recommended this product. I was a bit leery of trying it, but had to do something. A few reviews I read mentioned the product turned the grey hair orange. One tip I read regarding this was to add coffee. So, not wanting to take a chance I did add coffee. It does take longer than chemical hair dyes and it takes 24-48 hours for the final result of what the color will be.  I first did test strands the week before, so I knew what to expect.  I will say, my grey is covered better than with the chemical dyes, the color looks better, and also it is no longer dry or frizzy looking. It has shine, appears and feels stronger than before using the product.  I am sold on the Henna. It is better for hair than the chemical dyes and I will definitely be using this from now on.  Fantastic product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. No chemicals. It does however stain my skin a bit. But better than just for men. It takes a good 25 min min. To change color but its best to do this 12 hours before thats the drawback. But it works great.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. My only hope for alternative to chemical dye. It did not cover white hair so well and the result color is reddish light brown.</li>
    <li> love the no chemicals</li>
    <li> The second time I buy this, I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying this; much better than regular dying products.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Brown Henna Hair Dye and I had enough for two applications as my hair is only about chin length. The color looks natural and blends in well with my natural darkish hair. Hair is softer and healthier after washing it out. The only small drawback is that the color does tend to fade little by little with each wash--if you had previously lightened your hair. Even so, my hair seems to grow a lot quicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it&#x27;s very ideal for those of us who want to dye our hair without sacrificing our health. It&#x27;s also very affordable and Henna Hut has a variety of colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 4.5/5 Stars</li>
    <li> I had to use the brown twice and still it&#x27;s very red.  So, I&#x27;m not completely enthralled with it.  Next time I will try the dark brown and hope a lot of the red will go away.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I don&#x27;t remember if I tried the dark brown or not but I&#x27;ve tried several Henna brands and always feel like I&#x27;m taking a chance.  The best one  I&#x27;ve found in dark brown is the Khadi brand which comes from India.  I&#x27;m always pleased with the color.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried this henna, and proud of myself too! I have always been scared to try henna as I assumed my hair would turn orange or red. Not so when you choose the right brand and color. If you don&#x27;t want to go red, you don&#x27;t have to with henna - it&#x27;s an option. I just store any leftover mixture in a cool, dry place and pull it out when I want to touch up my grey. It&#x27;s so easy and very forgiving! Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this to dye my greying hair. the smell takes a little getting used to at first. think about wet leaves - that&#x27;s what it smells like to me. and it&#x27;s like a head full of mud. but afterwards, the color is wonderful, and i will never go back to chemicals</li>
    <li> After much research about Henna, and reading about how easy this product was to use, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  My hair had started to become brittle from over-drying and over-coloring.  Even though I always went to a salon, the damage was starting to show.  After just one use, I found out just how true all the reviews I read about this product were.  My hair was shinier and softer!  I&#x27;ve ordered different color samples to experiment with, and will definitely be a long term customer!</li>
    <li> I have brown hair approx 30% grey, the Henna Brown made my color look great !  The lighter hairs will have a golden highlighted look to them,  the overall color is still a natural looking brown with red undertones that come out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I have paid upwards of 150.00 for professional highlights that did not look anywhere near as good as the henna ! I will never go back to using  chemical dyes</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my long hair. One pkg covered all but the tail of my hair. (which has no need for henna, yet)&lt;br /&gt;I have hard to cover gray this product covered well. This product was not coating or protective like other hennas I have used. It rinsed out fairly easy compared to other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not last as long as other hair henna&#x27;s I have used. The brown color was good. The color was missing the layers and depth that I am used to getting with other henna hair products I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this product again in the brown, wait three weeks then apply a layer of Ancient Sunrise from another supplier.&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a Great Henna product that is simple and fast to use and produced a safe good quality hair color for me!&lt;br /&gt;This product was very easy and quick to apply with nice brown color!</li>
