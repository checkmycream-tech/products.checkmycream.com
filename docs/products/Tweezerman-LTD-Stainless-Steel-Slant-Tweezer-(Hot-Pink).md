      <li>Tweezerman offers free re-sharpening, which is good since they do need this service every few months, and since you have to mail them away for several weeks you&#x27;ll want to have an extra pair you can sub in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The tweezers do great and feel great in your hand.</li>
    <li> Expensive but good quality and so you&#x27;ll replace less often</li>
    <li> Very disappointed... These tweezers are loose and do not grasp well. I&#x27;ve had much better for 1/3 of the price.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever made. No complaints. They hold up well and are great for traveling. Very precise.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers in the house, they always go missing due to popularity, though!  Grabs hair very well, for those tedious plucking sessions.</li>
    <li> Good tweezers AND would buy again. I recommend them. Price is good too. My daughter got me on to them!</li>
    <li> they work really great. They make it possible to get those impossible hairs Everywhere on your face.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman LTD are the best tweezer I have ever purchased -- they last a very long time and they are the most accurate for tweezing I have ever been so lucky to find -- I have purchased many and these are definitely my favorite brand of tweezer ever -- they are simply the best!</li>
    <li> Best eyebrows tweezers ever used. Allows perfect grasp of unwanted hair follicles. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome.  They will pluck very fine hairs and larger ones with ease.  I did buy a flat credit card style sharpener to keep these really sharp.</li>
    <li> I use tweezers quite a bit, and I promise you that every pair needs sharpening at some point.  They just don&#x27;t keep their grip forever, although this pair is holding up longer than they usually do.</li>
    <li> purrfect little tweezer..does the job..one must be gentle when using item as it is rather sharp.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and just as described.  I lost my last pair and Tweezerman is the only brand that will do.</li>
    <li> Work like a charm and the company offers free sharpening. I have three pairs and I will be sending one out for sharpening soon (my first time doing this). I recommend getting bright colors because they are easier find- don&#x27;t ever want to lose these babies because they aren&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> Have been using tweezerman tweezers for years and wouldn&#x27;t but any other kind. It took trying many other disappointing brands before I found the best and I can&#x27;t imagine finding a better product. Not only are they easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;So you can easily remove even the most difficult hairs, but the company re sharpens your tweezers indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;They are a little pricer than a lot of drugstore brands but you get what you pay for. In the long run you save money because they last much longer and when they are re sharpened they are like new again.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever used!!! I will never purchase another brand!  Amazon best price delivery wonderful!</li>
    <li> These are maybe my 5th pair of Tweezerman slant-tip tweezers (because they get lost, not because they break). It may seem implausible there can be such huge qualitative differences in such a simple item, but cheaper tweezers just don&#x27;t compare. The Tweezermans (I especially like the enamel-covered versions, which I find slightly easier to grip than the plain steel ones) are weighted well, are the right length (so your hand won&#x27;t cramp, and so you can maneuver the tweezers to the precise angle you need), and are just the right degree of flexibility (neither too hard to squeeze, nor too loose). Tweezerman offers free re-sharpening, which is good since they do need this service every few months, and since you have to mail them away for several weeks you&#x27;ll want to have an extra pair you can sub in. So buy two, try not to misplace them too often, and do ship them off to keep them sharp. It&#x27;s well worth the effort for a superior tweezing experience. Your brows will be grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: recently bought the [[ASIN:B0001WP1J2 DMT D3F 3-Inch Dia-Sharp Sharpener Credit Card Sized Fine]] and love the Tweezermans even more now! To be honest, mailing them away for sharpening was a hassle, but this little sharpener \\&quot;card\\&quot; allows you to do it yourself in literally seconds. It&#x27;s a small investment to always have sharp tweezers.</li>
    <li> These are the very BEST tweezers ever made.  I realize they are a bit expensive, but worth every cent.  I have tried other brands and these are the easiest to use and have the most precision.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; tweezer and I&#x27;m surprised how well made it is... very happy.</li>
    <li> As long as you replace them on a regular basis (I replace my tweezers maybe twice a year and they get a LOT of use!), you will have great looking brows and no randoms ever again!  I would not even think of buying a different brand of tweezer. EVER.</li>
    <li> Really good! Grabs those little guys and out they go.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for?? I am a cosmotologist, and these are a fine piece of equipment!!!I love tweezerman products!</li>
    <li> I was frustrated with the tweezers in the store and someone told me about Tweezerman and I would recommend them to anyone.  Great tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have been on a long search for the tweezers that can grip the tiniest and finest hair.  I finally found them.  At first I thought the tweezers I would want would have a scored interior at the tip to grip the tiny hair so I didn&#x27;t think these would work.  I WAS WRONG!  I read the reviews and thought it over for a few weeks before purchasing them as I am a $1.00 store girl.  I am glad I spent the money for these tweezers.  Thank you to the previous people leaving their accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice to first time use:  Be very careful and cautious until you get used to their strength or you may end up pulling hair and skin.  Ouch.</li>
    <li> As stated, I borrowed my friend&#x27;s while in  Singapore and came straight he and ordered a pair. Razor sharp and great grip!</li>
    <li> I have bought many tweezers in the past.  Yes these are a little pricy, but they are really amazing and do the job!</li>
    <li> This Italian-American woman swears by her Tweezerman! Always gets the root and the only tweezer that can be resurfaced for free by the manufacturer. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Flimsy and clumsy to use.  Revlon way better.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers. Ever. Purchased two! One for me and one for mom. Love, love, love!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a tweezer that works the way it&#x27;s supposed to!  Mary had a little lamb, with fleece as white as snow.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is the best and the only tweezer I&#x27;ve used for countless years. I love the hot pink color.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have used. I bought these to replace an old pair that finally after about 5 years didn&#x27;t work so well anymore. These are great.</li>
    <li> I expected more. These are not as good as my revlon tweezers. They cut the hair rather that pull it. I bought two pairs and still go back to my Revlon pair.</li>
    <li> wifes purchase....she likes it</li>
    <li> While the Tweezerman tweezers are good, the tips aren&#x27;t quite as thin &amp; precise as the gold Hoffritz tweezers I had before &amp; lost. They get the job done though, &amp; are WAY above the standard run of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why the hot pink Tweezerman LTD should be any different than some of the others, but they are. Nothing else picks the tiniest hairs with the grip of these. Don&#x27;t waste your time on the pretty green or purple. Stick with the classics (plus, the color looks far more red in person).</li>
    <li> Item was as described and very nice.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love the color. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman has earned its reputation with rock solid product. I love that this come in colors. Having a hot pink set means never finding my tweezers on his side of the sink. You know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic cover to protect the is long gone but it was nice while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I bought these (in Target) without checking the price tag when I realised on vacation that I&#x27;d forgotten to bring mine. I was horrified when I realised how much they cost - but they are so worth it. I used to use two pairs of tweezers: one sharp to grab all the little eyebrow hairs in the middle, and one blunt because the sharp ones tended to pinch my skin if I used them further along my eyelids. These perform both functions - they are painless, accurate, easy to use, altogether brilliant. I will only ever buy Tweezerman from now on.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased Tweezerman brand because they make the BEST tweezers!  I love them -- the slant feature provides a good angle and they grab even my finest eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase my tweezers from Amazon I got mine at my local pro store. As a licensed esthetician who does a lot of waxing, good tweezers are a MUST!! As a long-time buyer of cheap tweezers I regret not buying these sooner!!! These are perfect!! They grab the hair from the root the first time instead of just breaking it causing you to have to retweeze repeatedly. The fact that you receive free sharpening FOR LIFE I&#x27;m definitely buying a few more pairs!!! FEEL THE DIFFERENCE AND INVEST PEOPLE:)</li>
    <li> the very best tweezers</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace a pair I lost, and also as a stocking stuffer for my daughter. Will never use another brand these are awesome. Enjoy the pink color as well.</li>
    <li> These have got to be the best tweezers I have ever used, really.  They can grab the smallest of hairs.  I will be ordering these again.  I loved the bright colors.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described. I love Tweezerman so no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this tweezer. Works amazing and pink!! Couldn&#x27;t be cuter!! Worth the money. It is great quality and not so much money.</li>
    <li> These are mini tweezers not the full size I returned them.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers for eyebrows and slivers.</li>
    <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used....wish I &#x27;d had heard of them sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of these in 1988 and they lasted until this year.  I love these tweezers and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;For the past 5 years, I have used many types of tweezers (usually around $10). This pair of tweezers is so much better and definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago, I finally got fed up with having to dig out the short eyebrow hairs and being unable to grasp the fine hairs at all.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to invest in a nice pair of tweezers for the first time. I will NEVER GO BACK!!! These are magical!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt no pain when removing multiple little hairs at once. (I didn&#x27;t even notice I grabbed them until I saw them on the tweezers!)&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, I said MULTIPLE hairs. It only took me a couple minutes to do my eyebrows, whereas it usually takes me 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows haven&#x27;t looked this good since I got them waxed 7 years ago. (Every time since then, waxing has caused breakouts, so I now rely on tweezers and my mediocre tweezing skills.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy another pair of these, and the mini version, but that would be an expensive tweezer-buying-splurge!</li>
    <li> work great easy to remover wild hairs. even the small ones</li>
    <li> Come on!  These are pink.  Pink is a very feminine color.  Who is this alleged tweezer man?  Why would a man use pink tweezers?  Boo!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers you will ever use, definitely worth the money.  Be sure to read info and keep that plastic cap on when not in use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry it took me so long to discover the Tweezerman brand  I have disposed of all of my manicure tools made by other manufacturers and replaced them with Tweezerman products.  The tweezer sides fit together tightly and smoothly, just as they should, making their use so easy and so efficient.  My highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> When I first used the tweezers I thought they were crap since there was not any pain associated with the plucking.  But once I looked at the tip and saw all the little hairs I had removed I knew they were the little miracle I had hoped for....these little things are wonderful. I lost my other pair of tweezerman tweezers so this time I upgraded to the LTD. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was worth the extra $5 bucks to upgrade.</li>
    <li> Precision tweezers...and pink. What&#x27;s not to like? If you want good tweezers...buy Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab as well as I expected it to.</li>
