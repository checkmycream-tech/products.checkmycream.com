      <li>I bought this T3 Featherweight Deluxe on Dec 1st 2012 as a gift for a friend whose Bday was coming up in March of 2013</li>
      <li>the velcro cord wrap is handy for storage.</li>

      <li>This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far.</li>
      <li>Diffuser is perfect for my short curly/wavy hair, tournaline dryer give hair a nice shine.  </li>

      <li>I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  </li>
      <li>If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you&#x27;ve ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store.</li>

      <li>Really quit and happy</li>
      <li>Truly frizz free!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased.  I love how they are lightweight yet powerful at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great hair dyer easy to use and several heat settings. There are also a cool shot that&#x27;s easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I really very much liked this hair dryer while it lasted, which was about 6 months.  If I had written the review earlier, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars.  But, suddenly, the high speed fan stopped working, the low speed works, but it&#x27;s hotter than it was (which scares me a little).  It gets such great reviews, both on Amazon and Consumer Reports.  But why did it die so soon?  My previous cheep hair dryers have always lasted for years!  Now the best Amazon can offer is approx. 50% refund if I send it back since the 30-day return policy is past.</li>
    <li> I bought this T3 Featherweight Deluxe on Dec 1st 2012 as a gift for a friend whose Bday was coming up in March of 2013 (if I see something I like for a friend, I get regardless of how early it is).  She rec&#x27;d this dryer for her Bday as planned.  Yesterday I got a call from her to tell me that, now, 3 months later the dryer has stopped working!!  The motor runs for a minute or two and then reduces to a blowdryer with zero drying capabilities.  A hair stylist friend of mine told me that the T3 was off the market for a while because of so many issues, but is now available again as they have taken there factory elsewhere and are producing a better product now.  I can&#x27;t help but think, &amp;#34;How is it this dryer was available during the off market period?&amp;#34; Was Beautycorner selling their backstock of bogus dryers??  Very disappointed - all the way around.  So now my friend has a dryer that does&#x27;t work after 3 months of use and I&#x27;m stuck with a product that I cannot return because the 30 days are up. I wiould not recommend buying this blowdryer unless you know it is the NEWLY manufactured product.</li>
    <li> I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don&#x27;t know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped.</li>
    <li> T3 makes the best hair dryers. This is my third T3 dryer...the first I had for 4yrs it only broke after being dropped for the tenth time, the second I had for 2yrs it shorted out on vacation in Cuba (no fault of the dryers just my own stupidity, they are made well &amp; to last) and this third T3 I&#x27;ve had for 1yr. I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair &amp; used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz &amp; it looks shiny after and they last forever. The concentrated nozzle is great for smooth looks and I love the diffuser for beachy waves. Invest in this dryer and you won&#x27;t be sorry, just don&#x27;t take it on vacation &amp; it will last for years and years.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with the product itself.  However, I was quite disappointed after speaking to the T3 company about the warrantee, as they have stated they do not accept warrantees from Amazon.  This can be a problem!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer. It is super lightweight and dries your hair superfast. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair poofy it actually helps smooth my hair. It is an investment but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> As a African-American high schooler, I can say that this hair dryer does not work for my type of hair. My hair is fine but curly and has lots of volume. After 30 minutes of fooling around with this hair dryer, I reverted back to the one I spent $40 on. It dries my hair in 20 minutes which is fine with me. I am so glad I didsn&#x27;t pay for this dryer and only won it in a magazine contest.</li>
    <li> I was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser, You see I had one for 20 years, and it finally blew up, I had loved it so much I had to find another one, I was so happy with my purchase. I use it about 10 to 15 times a day, I am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment. Thank you for my dryer.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a powerful blow  dryer with high heat for my wavy hair , but I was dissapointed how weak the blower was and not as hot as you would expect a $250 blow dryer would be.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you sacrifice performance over featherweight .</li>
    <li> I like the hairdryer, but am disappointed in the purchase. It was labeled as new, but when I got it I noticed that the filter already had quite a bit of lint buildup and there were little, cut hairs stuck to the velcro cord wrap. I got the feeling that maybe this item had been used in a salon. It looked \\&quot;pretty new\\&quot;, so perhaps it was used as a demo. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; description was therefore misleading.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Works really well on my curly, fine, tough-to-manage hair. I&#x27;ve heard these burn out a lot but I&#x27;ve now had it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer, but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get my frizzy hair smooth.  I appreciate the gentle drying so it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and it did leave my hair soft, but I need something super hot to really get my hair straight and smooth.  (Just bought the Jibere Palladium and am keeping it, for what it&#x27;s worth.)</li>
    <li> I purchased my T3 about six-months ago and it has worked perfectly. When I first purchased the hair dryer I thought that it was going to have some unique type of drying mechanism. The box notes that it uses crystals and some other features to provide the user with a special drying experience. However, when you look inside you see what appears to be the same heating coils and design present on almost any other hair dryer. I&#x27;m not disputing the marketing claims but the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; technology will not be visually apparent. The other thing that struck me was this is not a super powered dryer. Having paid over $200 I think I expected something no less than a wind tunnel experience when I turned it on. At first it seemed underpowered and I was slightly disappointed. I am still giving this hair dryer five stars due to its other features.    Pros:    Well-designed: The dryer features an easy to remove rear cover with a completely detachable screen. I really like this feature as it makes it very easy to clean. On other dryers that feature removable rear covers the screens can not be removed and the plastic outlets usually prevent proper cleaning. On the T3 the screen is flat and easy to clean. An extra screen was also included. The dryer also has two small rubber bumpers affixed to the sides. The bumpers are actually useful because they prevent the dryer and or your walls from being damaged in case of accidental contact.      Quiet: Probably the quietest dryer I have ever owned.     Full heat setting is very hot: This dryer puts out a serious amount of heat which dries hair fast. What it lacks in power it makes up for in heat.    Light: Weighs very little compared to other dryers.     Plenty of settings: Comes with 6 settings. Hi-Med-low Hot-mild-warm (uses symbols)and cool.     Subjective: I was told that my hair looked better after I started using it. (This could be due to plenty of other reasons)     Cons    Very pricey: It is far more expensive than most other dryers.Will not blow you away: If your expecting a great deal of blowing power based on the price you will be disappointed.      Warranty games: I&#x27;ve read that some people have had warranty issues. I waited to fill out the warranty card before noticing that you needed to have saved the box to get the serial number of the product. Having already disposed of the box I was out of luck this made me a little angry.    Overall impression: Over six-months after purchase despite the cons noted above I am very happy with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant buying this hairdryer because of the price but it was absolutely worth every penny. I have very thick and coarse hair which usually takes a while to dry and then straighten. With the T3, if I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want to take time to style my hair, I can get it completely dry in 5 minutes. If I&#x27;m using the round brush to style it, it takes around 20 minutes. Either senario, my hair looks great and I haven&#x27;t needed to use my straightener since it arrived.    On another note, my boyfriend did make a comment that it&#x27;s not as noisy as my old hairdryer so that&#x27;s a plus for the guys too.</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer.  It seems to dry hair faster, and I like that it came with a good diffuser.  However, I sent in my warranty, and was told by the manufacturer that I did not buy from an authorized seller, so they will not warranty it or even guarantee its authenticity.  I will hope for the best.  Even though I saved $100 buying it from this company, it still cost over $100.</li>
    <li> this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers. it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer on the market. It makes my hair smooth and shiny every time I use it.  Well worth the investment! I had my last T3 for ten years.  Buying on Amazon saved me a lot of money.  The same exact dryer sells for $250 at the beauty supply store a few blocks from my house. I bought the same unit for nearly 50% less on Amazon.  A giant thumbs up!!![[ASIN:B003837V8A T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer, 2.9-Pound]]</li>
    <li> I love my T3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer.  I had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it... so I started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the T3.  I can&#x27;t believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now.  Truly frizz free!  It is very light weight and easy to use.  I actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new T3, and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it,lol.  It really made me value my new dryer.  My hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways I used to use to style.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair dryer! It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth with no frizz. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer worked well until about a month later. The engine seemed to have broken, there low and high settings are now both very low. Do not recommend. I contacted T3 they offered to replace it for $50. I ended up just buying a new dryer that wasn&#x27;t a T3</li>
    <li> ver light weight and easy to carry;&lt;br /&gt;fast to dry and style the hair, make the hair much easier to handle;&lt;br /&gt;if it&#x27;s authentic one, T3 provide 2 years warranty and service. But this should do purchase with authoruzed the dealer which  you can find the list fromT3 web.&lt;br /&gt;one word, very enjoiable to style the hair using this hair drier!</li>
    <li> LOVE*LOVE this hair dryer.. lightweight, great size, easy to switch settings and a long cord that is a must so it reaches easily since my outlet in the bathroom is not convenient. Don&#x27;t hesitate getting this one... it will last you a long time... so worth the $ as I have gone thru too many cheap hair dryers in years past that would have paid for this 2X&#x27;s over. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I had severely damaged hair due to coloring, highlighting and flatironing.  I saw that this blowdryer was supposed to dry hair faster and condition it as well with the trick ions .Very disappointed in this dryer for the money!! Not faster by any means, actually it blows slower and cooler and takes longer than my Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply brand which is far less money. Don&#x27;t take the advertising bait, don&#x27;t purchase this dryer ladies and gents.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what its supposed to. Perfectly dries your hair in no time!&lt;br /&gt;Fast and furious ,no frizz love it</li>
    <li> I have medium-short hair and am a guy, and I love this thing. This thing dries my hair in 2-5 minutes, and it literally is lighter than my shaver.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was great for about 30 days, now as soon as I turn it on the power vanishes in about 10 seconds. And because I didn&#x27;t fill out the stupid warranty I&#x27;m stuck with a $90 hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t work, will never buy something like this over the internet again!</li>
    <li> well first off the amazon product description is wayyy off it weighs less than a pound wich is very important for a stylist like me every other hair dryer is too heavy .once you own one of the t3 blowdryers you wont want to go back.....another thing is that people complain  about  the air not being strong or hot enough what they dont know is that t3 uses a way different technology than your regular  blow dryer you can purchase at walmart give the t3 a try and its well worth it i love mine :). p.s if its just for personal use i suggest the featherweight if its for pro use i suggest the luxe just because of the different heat settings and functions since your dealing with a variety of people</li>
    <li> My business partner was going to buy this product online from a reputable seller. I suggested that he first take a look on Amazon because the pricing is almost always better. I do most of my shopping on Amazon and I have never had a single bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He bought this dryer for his wife as a Mother&#x27;s Day present and when his wife tried to get a warranty, she was told that this was a knockoff product! Amazon is having them contact the seller to resolve this but obviously something is quite wrong here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item states that it&#x27;s a T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer and NOWHERE does it mention that it isn&#x27;t the original manufacturer. I&#x27;d steer clear of these guys!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this T3 Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer in June 2013.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very pleased with the drying ability but now only four months later&lt;br /&gt;the blower on the dryer stopped working.  I have sent two e-mails to the supplier thru Amazon requesting another dryer to replace this one but to date I have had no response.&lt;br /&gt;I am an senior citizen with short hair who uses a dryer approximately three times weekly. I would not recommend this dryer to anyone.[[ASIN:B003837V8A T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer, 2.9-Pound]]</li>
    <li> This is really a great hair dryer. I love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat.  WOuld not trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> I love love love!!!! this hair dryer need I say more,and it is very light compare to my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I used to spend six hours doing my girls&#x27; naturally coily and kinky hair. Drying time has now been cut to an average if five minutes, which in turns means a styling time of two hours total on the girls. This dryer gave me my weekends back. Only down side is that the ones I&#x27;ve had go out after roughly two years. I&#x27;m on my third t3 since 2011.</li>
    <li> I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to use, does a great job! Would recommend to anyone who needs to use a diffuser on their hair.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008N3HXTW T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer]]  I have been a T3 Micro customer for 8 years and in that time have gone through at least 4 of their hair dryers.  Why can&#x27;t they make a product for home use that actually lasts?  My most recent purchase was the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Dryer.  It only worked 6 months before I began noticing that the HOT setting was beginning to blow only WARM air.  Progressively this has gotten worse -- and now my hair ends up being very frizzy rather than the usually smooth look I got when the dryer was new.  I&#x27;m so frustrated!  Yes, I am aware I can ship it back to T3 for repair or replacement (as I have done before with other dryers) but their turnaround time is sometimes 2-3 months!  NOT ACCEPTABLE T3!</li>
    <li> It is a good dryer - not an amazing one, but good - but note that you do not benefit from T3&#x27;s warranty if you buy this dryer from Amazon. Mine quit after one year, which is, in my view, an unreasonable product life for such an expensive hair dryer. There was nothing to be done. T3 will not replace the dryer because I bought it from Amazon and not from an approved retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a $40 Conair, which really does work about as well.  If there is a difference between them, it is small, and not worth $100-$200 more.  And so far, the Conair has lasted longer than the T3 did.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer it is super quiet and produces great heat. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight dryer. Dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you, even in a busy salon.</li>
    <li> Really works well.  One if the best hair dryers I have owned.  Definitely a great deal since they are $300.00 retail</li>
    <li> Highly efficient, good heat settings and cool shot feature.  Diffuser is perfect for my short curly/wavy hair, tournaline dryer give hair a nice shine.  Have use T3 tourmaline dryer for 10 years now and wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for a year and a half. I absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last few months it would stop and then start while I was trying to dry my hair. I contacted t3 and they told me to send it to them. I was planning on it until today when it started smoking where the cord attaches to the dryer! I turned it off so quick and tried not to electrocute myself. Sure, I could pay to ship it and give the company $15 to ship it back but I don&#x27;t want another fire hazard! I spent way too much on this dryer to have it break after only a year and a half. Never again.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer!  I had no idea that there was such a big difference in hairdryers, but let me tell you, there is.  I had a Ceramic heated Conair hairdryer.  While visiting family, I had to borrow a hairdryer because I forgot to pack mine.  The way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing.  It looked so smooth and shiny.  Not the norm when using my Conair.  I looked at the name brand and took note right away.  So glad I was able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.......................it only lasted 6 months. :(  for the price is not worth it.  Now I have to figure out how I can get a replacement from the manufacturer.  I&#x27;ve been told by COOM they cannot do anything for me, therefore I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER order anything they sell.  Also I will warn all my friends and family through social media to be aware of anything that&#x27;s sold by COOM.</li>
    <li> I know this is expensive, but I feel it is worth the money.  I had a T3 for 8 years and found it to be superior to other hairdryers.  When it finally gave out, I once again checked reports and T3 came out on top.  So now I am enjoying my second one.  Whenever house guests borrow it, they comment on how wonderful it is.  It really does dry my hair faster than other dryers.  I have small hands and found it to be lighter and easier to handle.  My ONLY concern is that the company does not guarantee it if you buy it from Amazon.  However, I read that Amazon will stand behind it.  I never had problems with my last one which worked for 8 years.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light, but powerful.  It dries my hair quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Yes, I was tricked into leaving a good review so that I would qualify for a replacement if the hair dryer broke within 2 years.  Now that I&#x27;ve had a while to use it, I found out it&#x27;s JUNK, COUNTERFEIT, BOGUS, FAKE, GARBAGE, etc.  It is definitely not a genuine T3 hair dryer!  I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.  Convenience will mean nothing if the products are worthless.  If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you&#x27;ve ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store.</li>
    <li> Holy Cow - have I hit the jackpot!  Quick drying time with amazingly shiny finish - I LOVE this hair dryer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, curly hair that takes forever and a day to dry.  I use a ton of product and still usually have little &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hairs everywhere . . . well - that ALL changed with this magic hair dryer.  The texture of my hair is totally different - my hair looks very healthy and shiny - thank you!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I saw the difference with my hair. My hair was softer and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;But I still find it expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from MEGA DEALS STORE.  It was broken upon opening the pkg.  They sent me a new one.  The motor burned out shortly thereafter.  So they sent me a new one again. Now about 1.5 years later, another motor has burned out. It&#x27;s not like I even use it every day! I contacted them once again and they will not return my emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a T3 before that I purchased directly from the T3 website.  It lasted 5+ years with no problems. There&#x27;s no way that the T3 I purchased from MEGA DEALS STORE is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them the benefit of the doubt twice, but I should have followed my instinct.  If the price is too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer...but a friend of mine highly recommended it..so I gave it a go.  From my frist drying experience I noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It is super quiet...did dry my hair faster, with less force and no tangling!  I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  I got a load of compliments that first day!  Worth the cash!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight with lots of settings. Extra long cord a plus and the velcro cord wrap is handy for storage. Really love the diffuser.</li>
    <li> Great dryer; better price...good buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer thinking it was going to revolutionize my morning ritual. Yeah, I was wrong. It dried my hair slower than any other hair dryer I have ever had and left my hair frizzy every. single. time. Then it died not 6 months after I got it, which was actually a total relief because I ended up spending $30 on the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, the orange Conair Infiniti Pro. Save your money &amp; check out that one instead, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought the T3 4 months ago, and it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  Very little power and it stopped working after 4 months of use.  Going to try the Chi Pro now.</li>
    <li> Product is light as advertised but does not seem as strong as it should be.  The first I received came apart as it was missing 2 screws, but Amazon was great and stood behind product and sent another out immediately.  That one is fine.  Love the T3 feather weight.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this blow dryer. I can tell my hair feels softer when I use it, BUT after 3 months the high switch stopped working. I emailed the company and to my AMAZEMENT they sent me a replacement dryer, no questions asked! I would purchase it again!!</li>
    <li> I thought the wattage was suppose to be 2000, it was less powerful than my 1875 Conair, and its 6 years old.  Quite the dissapointment.  Also my hair looked more dried out and frizzy using this than my Conair.  Not worth the money, will return for a cheaper Conair model.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever owned.  Hair has stayed in better condition with this hair dryer.  Like that it is lightweight and has variable heat and speeds.</li>
    <li> If this is not an authentic, genuine T3 product that I am able to register and validate warranty protection, I will be returning this hairdryer. Will let you all know....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Like others have already said, this is an awesome hair dryer. Yes, it&#x27;s very pricey, but the results are so worth it. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I like to dry it wavy (I have a lot of natural wave to my hair). I&#x27;m very careful about the strength of airflow from a diffuser (P.S., the diffuser is also great!), because if it&#x27;s too strong it&#x27;ll blow the waves into puffballs. I got to play around with this dryer at an ULTA store, and I thought it was perfect! It&#x27;s given me \\&quot;Disney Princess-worthy\\&quot; waves! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to those who say the speed is too low, I haven&#x27;t found it to be a problem to drying my hair - in fact, my drying time seems shorter (haven&#x27;t been able to time it yet, though). Features like the tourmaline and the ceramic create a much better overall \\&quot;heat\\&quot; (I&#x27;m not a stylist, I can&#x27;t tell you how it works :), so don&#x27;t let that deter you from trying it.</li>
    <li> I love the light weight aspect of this product (that is the one star part of this review) and it worked well until it didn&#x27;t, (3 TIMES!) Before you read on, I must state that I use this dryer for a maximum of 10 minutes 3 times per week, not exactly heavy lifting... I had this piece of loveliness for 4 months before it died. The seller sent another to replace it, and then it died again 5 months later and this time time the seller did not want to send a replacement until I reminded them and forwarded them their own email stating there would be a 2 year warrantee on the dryer. Soooooo, I received another a few months ago and guess what... the dryer died again in a smelly, smokey manner as it did the 2 times before and I see the seller does not sell this product anymore. I can&#x27;t say I blame the seller for not having this hunk of junk for sale anymore but I guess I need to go buy a different blow dryer. So that is my sad story.</li>
    <li> After 2 months of daily use, I can now report what an excellent hair dryer this is.  Quietest that I have ever experienced.  Heat control is outstanding - important for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE_  It died almost 6 months to the day.  Manufacturer would not replace even though I had the Amazon receipt and was willing to return old one and pay shipping.</li>
    <li> It works great, just as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had T3 products before...my last T3 hair dryer lasted 3 years and change. I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer 4months ago and another one for a gift 3 months ago.  These hairdryers are expensive!  I only use mine 2x/week and the other day, IT WAS ON FIRE!  I contacted the seller and they will not accept this hairdryer back because I missed 90 days.  Everyone should know that these hairdryers are only meant to last 90 days or less???  Terrible customer service.  If you&#x27;re going to spend this money on a hairdryer, buy from Target/Sephora where you have recourse when it CATCHES ON FIRE!!!!</li>
    <li> I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn&#x27;t give 0 stars. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot;. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> I battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. Twice I have used it to blow out my hair and my thin, fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener, NO fly aways.  When I decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly, I was hesitant because my Conair would leave my hair super frizzy.  Not with the T3, I had beautiful curls, frizz-free.  Don&#x27;t let the lighter air flow throw you, this little baby has lots of drying power.  Great size, lightweight, and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping I got a faulty model of this dryer - that&#x27;s how horrible it was.&lt;br /&gt;I own two other T3 products - the straightener and curling wand - and love them both. So I assume the T3 dryer would be another great purchase. It is THE WORST hair dryer I have ever used. The $25 dryers at walmart are better than this.&lt;br /&gt;It had absolutely no power, no noticeable heat control and actually damaged my hair. It would overheat within minutes and I&#x27;d have to take a break so I didn&#x27;t become completely sweaty!&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, hopefully I got a bad item, but if not, this is a horrible waste of money. I returned mine and expect a full refund.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. It states it dries your hair 70% faster, but I don&#x27;t find this to be true. Also the switches are in a very awkward place and I often turn them off by accident while using the dryer.</li>
    <li> The T3 dryer works great.  Drys your hair in a matter of minutes.  Gives your hair shine and limits frizzies.</li>
    <li> The heat that comes out of it makes your hair very soft and nice. I loved almost everything about it, the only thing I&#x27;d like to add is that they could have made the diffuser a litter deeper so that it graps hair better. Other than that it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> This dumb dryer was underused and it overheated. When I bought it only good reviews were to be found. Now I see plenty of dissatisfied customer reviews. Well I can add mine to all of theirs. Don&#x27;t but this dryer. A cheap dryer I&#x27;ve had since a teenager still works and this one broke after 10 months of use at maybe 2 mins of use per day. My husband used it and he doesn&#x27;t have long hair.... Very disappointed in this product. Seller would not take it back.</li>
    <li> Bought this t3 in dec 2013 from treelogic, it came with a note if we gave it a good rating, treelogic would give us an extended 2 year warrentyit burned up in two months, they sent us another one it lasted six weeks, they sent one more, burned up in two weeks. I requested a refund, they responded, &amp;#34;sorry it&#x27;s past the warrenty period&amp;#34;. I believe it is a knock off for $119 drier should last much longer. This is a fraud, Amazon should help me and they should remove Treelogic from their marketplace..</li>
    <li> I loved this dryer for the first 4 months that it worked.  I attempted to resolve the problem with T3; however was told that it was sold by a non-authorized dealer and said that the serial number on the dryer did not match anything that was made by them.  When I returned the product through Amazon I was charged a $15 restocking fee...VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> ANY T3 product purchased on Amazon is NOT recognized by the company (i.e. manufacturer warranty NOT honored). I tried to register my product and found that my serial number was already registered... I contacted the company and was told that neither Amazon nor the reseller are authorized resellers for T3. This could mean a number of things... Nevertheless, I love this dryer, which seems to work extremely well. I decided to take my chances with this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of the T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe, which is about half the price of one from the manufacturer or an authorized reseller.</li>
    <li> Love this blowdryer. It is a bit louder than my Chi Nano and isn&#x27;t as powerful but it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the drying time. Also I would love for it to have a stand but no biggie :)</li>
    <li> Working as a hairdresser I have never had a better dryer than the t3! very lightweight which is perfect for long days at the salon. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after years of using an obnoxiously loud dryer with two speeds, too slow and too fast. I love this thing. It mellows my hair routine and only takes about half as long to get my hair dry. Plus I don&#x27;t have to go over it again with an iron to get it reasonably straight. I only wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to replace old blowy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing! It&#x27;s light weight makes it easier to use. It dryers your hair super fast! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had another T3 that died after years of use. I received my new drier expeditiously and don&#x27;t want to be without it. Great service and great product.</li>
    <li> Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer</li>
    <li> This dryer is not featherweight like it says in the name.  It weighs about the same as the one I was already using.  My hair does not dry any faster and is not made any smoother than it was with my old dryer.  It&#x27;s not bad, just ordinary.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve had one before and it crapped out after about three years but I got another one because it is well worth the price!I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer for my wife. She loves how quickly it works and leaves her hair feeling soft, and not static-free. It was a pre-Christmas gift, and here in Michigan the air is pretty dry this time of year, so I am officially impressed. There must be something to the whole ionic ceramic tourmaline thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the minuscule clear rubber pieces in the handle dropped off when she took this dryer out of the box. It&#x27;s not a critical component, but I hope it&#x27;s not an indication of the dryers build quality and expected longevity. Given how the much less expensive, shortly lived, noisy, less effective dryers she has had in the past have been, I&#x27;m not too concerned though.</li>
    <li> Drys my hair in half the time of my old one. Pretty light weight for its size. Nice long cord.</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 starts if it lasted longer than 2-3 years.  This is my third T3 and the reason I keep purchasing is because I have yet to find another dryer that is as effective and lightweight.  The first one lasted 3 years and the second one 2.  Amazon has the best pricing and is definitely worth it.  My hair is very thick and mid length.  It takes about 5 minutes less time to dry my hair compared to others, plus it reduces the frizz considerably.</li>
    <li> The dryer was advertised as being much lighter than other models and I can&#x27;t honestly say I have seen any difference in weight. I like using the dryer as it has several settings that help dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output. While this dryer is quiet and lightweight, it did not have any more power than the $20 dryer I was using before. I could not find any wattage/power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual. I am returning it so I cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my T3 Hair Dryer!! I have not been disappointed yet with this brand. It is a powerful hairdryer that cuts my drying time in half without leaving my hair  feeling dry and damaged. I highly recommend this product for your next hair dryer purchase.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well at all. My 19 dollar Conair works better than this.  I made contact with T3 on their website, they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system.</li>
    <li> I would order with them again for sure. Package arrived in a timely fashion. Love the product. Professional correspondence with them.</li>
    <li> Quiet hairdryer but wish it had more power so my hair would dry faster!</li>
    <li> I had the hair dryer stored away to use when the remodeling was done in my bathroom i would say at least 8 months. I did not even use it 6 times and it just died. I was heart broken. Had i known i would not have stored it away, I would have used it right away. :(</li>
    <li> Very light weight, and is not too hot on hair, gets the job done! Very happy with this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about this dryer so I finally invested in it.  I find it hot but not very powerful...however compared to the other hair dryers I have owned this one is much better.  Was just expecting a little more ump!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can&#x27;t believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn&#x27;t spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mum and myself for Christmas... Didn&#x27;t even last until the New Year and broke after two lousy uses. Biggest waste of $250 I&#x27;ve ever spent</li>
    <li> I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn&#x27;t smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn&#x27;t worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer a few months ago and just recently tried to register the product on the T3 website. It did not recognize the code from the box, which was a 16 digit code. The website asks for a 12 or 14 digit code. Also, the code taped on the dryer cord is different than the one on the box. Products generally should have a warranty card and instructions inside, this one did not have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake or not, it seems to work pretty good. It&#x27;s quieter than the last hairdryer I had and seems to dry my hair quicker.</li>
    <li> This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said \\&quot;they&#x27;d bend the rules\\&quot; and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an \\&quot;authorized seller\\&quot; and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don&#x27;t trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer overheats and blew out in six months. As I only used it once a week, I find it appalling that they can get away selling such a substandard product.</li>
    <li> Overall, very pleased with my purchase.  The diffuser stays on, which was a problem with my previous dryer (so much so that my little dog has learned to sit outside the bathroom when the hairdryer is on since the previous diffuser constantly jumped off and attacked him).  What I like most about this hair dryer is that it is quiet....really quiet...a big plus!  I think my only dislike is that the on/off is above the heat setting.  Where you naturally hold it your thumb is closest to the heat setting, so every time I go to shut it off I hit the temp instead.  Sure I will get used to it, but is something that should be fixed in future models.</li>
    <li> After about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound.  When I disassembled it, I could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound.  Had I not seen this, the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user.  There has been no recall so all the products are suspect.  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews for this hairdryer and was super excited to try it out. Sadly, I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. While it gets the job done (i.e. dries my hair), I did not notice any substantial reduction in drying time. Nor did my hair become shinier from the tourmaline. I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it dies, but will not repurchase as a $40 conair dryer works just as well.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by this product and will not buy a T3 again.  This product barely lasted a little over one year before it died.  I have short hair so the lack of longevity was not caused by over use of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Very light and drys fast! Really quit and happy I bought this T3 hair dryer you will be happy to !!</li>
    <li> Great for at home or salon used! I gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I saw the T3 featherweight hair dryer featured on one of the morning shows.  \\&quot;Lightweight\\&quot;  \\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair\\&quot; - \\&quot;I&#x27;m in!\\&quot;  I have had the dryer for less than 6 months and the motor has already burnt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies (and gentlemen), this hair dryer is a featherweight because it doesn&#x27;t have much power and the motor is less than optimal.  I would go back to my $30 Conair anyday after spending over $100 on this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and purchase good hair produces!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was great (at first)!  It was time to be a grown up and upgrade my hair dryer.  My hair dresser suggested this one.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on Amazon, saying how it stopped working.  And the dryer began having problems for people after 6 months.  That couldn&#x27;t happen to me.&lt;br /&gt;Well....mine stopped working in less than a month!  Completely malfunctioned, and I don&#x27;t use it everyday!  I might use it 3 times a week at best.  So, that means...I only used it roughly about 9 times!  The problems I am having is...Setting low just stopped working completely.  So, I put it on high. Then on high it would blow/sound more like it was on low.  Good Luck with the cool shot, because that doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Oh, and now there is a burnt smell.  It is dangerous.  So, I let it sit overnight.  Maybe it need to take a break....turn it on this morning.  No air is blowing, but you can hear the motor inside of it turning.  That is dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get it.  I should have listened to my fellow reviewers.  Very disappointed.  Hopefully they will replace it.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as expected. I have purchased several of these dryers from amazon and I have been pleased with all of them.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn&#x27;t fry it. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest blow dryer I have ever owned. The air flow work perfect it&#x27;s all around a very nice blow dryer</li>
    <li> Below was my original review. It is 2 3/4 years later and I am revising and it has stopped working after 2 3/4 years. While I LOVED the dryer when it was working properly, it now has an electrical burning smell when I use it, and I&#x27;ve stopped using it because I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to catch fire. Also, within the first year, the cord wrap developed a tear, which I patched with electrical tape. I asked my stylist if her expensive dryers last three years and she said they do but with constant use day after day. I am going to attempt to return this for another, but after reading the reviews, I&#x27;m not terribly optimistic. If I can get a replacement, I will be happy to have it working again because I did love it. We shall see... I&#x27;ll update one way or another.  I really like this hair dryer! Once you get used to it not blowing as ferociously as the cheaper hair dryers, you&#x27;ll appreciate that it&#x27;s just as effective, if not more so.  I use the diffuser too, and am really glad that I decided to go with this product, rather than buy another drug store cheapie!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is the lightest and quietest I&#x27;ve ever used.  In fact, my husband now wants one of his own!</li>
    <li> This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far. I&#x27;m very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn&#x27;t think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!</li>
    <li> I used it every day for 4months, and then, suddenly the engine failed and it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
    <li> Again like the other people that had bad experience - i bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter 2013.  She lives out of state.  Because she had a dryer that worked fine she didn&#x27;t take it.  This Christmas when she was home she used it and really liked it so she took it back to Boston with her and today I get a text that it stopped working.  So it lasted 2 months.  Will never buy one of the T3 again!</li>
    <li> Bought this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; in January. Use the dryer less than twice a week and the motor died on me today. I tried contacting the seller and discovered they have removed themselves from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot from Amazon; this is my first disappointment in a seller.</li>
    <li> I love it, my hair is so shiny! it dries faster and I love the attachments, I use the diffuser for my curly hair and the other for my daughters&#x27; straight hair, all around great product.</li>
    <li> Definitely does not compare to my $20 conair travel dryer. The amount of air coming out of the dryer is pitiful. I think I could blow hot air harder. The accessories, while nice, feel cheap. I put the diffuser on to dry my hair and was pretty certain that I had broken the flimsy plastic in the removal process.&lt;br /&gt;Received this product for Christmas. When attempting to register with T3, I was immediately notified that it was not a real product and to contact Amazon for a refund especially since they are not authorized dealers of T3 products. Refund was received.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don&#x27;t function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn&#x27;t detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the queen of blow dryers. It is lightweight, has the perfect amount of heat, and yet doesn&#x27;t feel damaging. I especially love the diffuser attachment that comes with it.</li>
    <li> It did not last long, broke after a couple of months, but it&#x27;s probably the way I used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer and less than two weeks after the six month return time was up, it quit working and the company will not replace it.  I never knew hairdryers were disposable.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the t3 featherweight Luxe dryer from a retail store. It lasted about 9 months. I contacted the company but because I didnt register the product, I had to pay another $55 to ship it off. 6 weeks later, I received a newer t3 2i model, but it didnt include any of the extra accessories that my first one did, including the diffuser which I use everyday!! Called the company back...and instead of just sending me a diffuser, they tell me that I have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model. In other words, another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that I need. So...by the time I purchase a new diffuser for $30 and pay the $55 for a replacement, I could just have bought a brand new RELIABLE chi or something. Don&#x27;t buy the t3. It&#x27;s more trouble than its worth!!! You can get a cheap one and it will be of the same quality.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel any different than before and is not smooth at the ends as promised.  Also, cool button goes off on it&#x27;s own and stays on forever, therefore blowing mostly cold air the entire time.  Not impressed and going to return.</li>
    <li> This dryer was purchased last summer and safely stored while we moved. I pulled it out this January, and the low setting has already stopped working, while the high setting barely pushes out any air.  I&#x27;m now convinced this was a fake, and am sorely disappointed. Amazon is always our first stop for purchases such as these, and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with their customer service... I have a request for a refund in, and we&#x27;ll see how this resolves.</li>
    <li> My current blow dryer (Chi nano) was causing some shoulder problems because I blow dry hair all day long, so I started shopping around for a new one. Needless to say, when I found an article about the newest and lightest blow dryer around I needed to see for myself. When it came in, I brought it to work immediately. Not only is it light, it&#x27;s also quiet and gets hot enough to smooth the hair but not so hot to burn it. I am so happy I made this purchase!!!</li>
