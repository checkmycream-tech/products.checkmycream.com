<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So happy to be able to find this on Amazon.  Cannot find any other lotion/creme that works as well.</li>
    <li> I was developing cracks on my fingers and hands--I ordered Zim&#x27;s hand cream after trying all kinds of hand creams and wearing gloves to do everything---after just one use I could feel a difference and after a week the cracks were healed--I rub Zim&#x27;s every night on my hands and so far they have stayed healed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t leak this time and was wrapped in plastic, in case it did.  We live in a high altitude and sometimes creams and other items will burst. This is the only creme that will heal my cracked cuticles that I get from the extreme dry air in CO.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;y find it around here, so the 3 tubes will get us through the winter and beyond. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> My husband works in grease and solvents all day.  As a result, his finger tips become very dry and crack. The discomfort even makes buttoning his shirts a hassel. This product does not eliminate the problem completely, but surely helps enough to  soften the skin and heals may of the cracks on his fingers tips</li>
    <li> Before ordering this, I compared the ingredients with those of my current tube of Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme which is almost empty.  I was delighted that the ingredients were the same except for the last one.  But the tube I received had many different ingredients!  It smells the same, but I really won&#x27;t know how effective it is until next winter.  I consider my current tube to be &amp;#34;finger glue&amp;#34; to aid my cracked fingertips in the winter.  It would be nice if the product I had received was the one I had ordered.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t always find locally, but who cares with these good prices and free shipping. One of the few products that actually work and doesn&#x27;t contain (as far as I know) any petroleum based products.</li>
    <li> My hands are extremely dry, crack and bleed all the time; someone had told me this stuff was like magic, so I tried it- it was not.  Hands still crack &amp; bleed without any relief.</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s Crack heals everything. GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> This is great for dry cracked hands. I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
    <li> My fingers always crack &amp; bleed in the winter time, and I&#x27;ve always used Zims Crack Cream, but this year, I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I bought it here.  Still hasn&#x27;t let me down, heals the cracks overnight.</li>
    <li> This cream really works!  Winter dryness and finger skin cracks just heal up--truly amazing!  I would recommend it to anyone suffering from dry hands in the winter or anytime.</li>
    <li> Purchased for someone else -- who loves it.</li>
    <li> With an unusual smell and sort of strange feel, I wasn&#x27;t that excited about this Zim&#x27;s cream the first time I used it, but after a few applications, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my over-worked hands and feet felt and looked. My husband drives for UPS, so his hands really take a beating, especially in winter. He uses Zim&#x27;s and swears it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps his fingers from cracking and bleeding from the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have a scar on my foot from past surgery and I live most of the time in sandals.  This creme keeps my skin soft and my scar pliable without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This worked perfect for my cracked skin in the cold bitter winter months. I highly recommend it if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It moisturizes and cures splits splits in the skin in 2 or 3 days.  It rubs in quickly, without leaving my hands sticky.</li>
    <li> I was told by a friend at church about the creme. It works wonderfully! So thrilled he suggested it for me!</li>
    <li> This is the cream that I use during the day for the deep, wide open cracks on my thumbs in the cold weather.  It it absorbed into my skin in just a few minutes.  It&#x27;s the only remedy I have found to help to heal serious thumb cracks more quickly!  Highly recommend to everyone who suffers with this problem.  Price is great!  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Best out there for the problem.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product for very dry hands.  It is smooth, smells great and works very fast.  My hands get very dry, especially during the winter time.

    <li> I had used this product up in the midwest many winters ago. Moved down south and find that you cannot locate this product anywhere. Voila ... Amazon! Got my old favorite back in just a matter of a couple days. A little overpriced but does the job.</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve found for cracked skin on my fingers, caused by the winter months.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  I have dysphrotic eczema on my hands.  They regularly crack and split, which becomes painful.  Although Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream smells great, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hands, only made them sting.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Working mans hands respond well!</li>
    <li> this is the best creme i have found to heal cracked fingers and heels...it is so painful i have looked for years for something to hear especially cracked fingers. it is cooling and soothing. best buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme Creamy Daytime Formula in the past and I looked in several stores in my area and they did not carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Found it on line and I love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Earlier shipments were creamy and easy to apply. This last batch is very watery but seems to be just as effective.</li>
    <li> Very effective cream that absorbs quickly into the skin and has instant benefits for rough dry skin.  A little goes a long way.</li>

    <li> Softens dry cracked skin overnight and keeps soft when applied on a regular basis. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine cream but I don&#x27;t notice it did anything another cream doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not as thick as I&#x27;d have expected, either.  Yet, I don&#x27;t use it every day.  Perhaps if I used it religiously daily, it would be all that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Cracked&amp;#34; up to be.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my ridiculously dry winter legs but unfortunely I couldnt handle the smell. Very like evergreen smelling to me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great !</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Have been using it for years.  Smells better than all the other &amp;#34;flowery&#x27; odors of the other products I have used.</li>
