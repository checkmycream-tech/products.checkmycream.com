<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my fine hair feel thick and full of body. Love it!</li>
    <li> love it. light weight but makes my hair so much fuller looking.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin long hair.  I use this in my damp towel dried hair in the morning and blow dry upside down or with a round brush and my hair has texture and volume all day.  I really love this product and hope it sticks around.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually have much luck with styling products, my hair is stick straight and thick. I don&#x27;t invest in high-end salon products because i can&#x27;t get them to work the same way that my hair stylist does. But one day there was a 3 for $10 sale at my local store and I picked up this product, along with some others in the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. That&#x27;s all I can say! It made a huge difference when used properly! Just follow the directions; put the mousse in shampooed, damp hair and blow dry upside down with a round brush. My hair looks totally voluminous and has tons of body! I love it!</li>
    <li> I must be doing something wrong because I was not lucky enough to have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/oily hair that must be washed daily. So after my shower, I applied a squirt of mousse to my hair and dried upside down. However, it just ended up being flat flat. Almost like I had to wash it again. Finally, I ended up putting my hair in a pony tail for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have unruly unmanageable hair. I find it difficult to use any product without it turning oily. For me this product did not really do it for me. I plan on giving it another shot and I&#x27;m going to try to use less then the squirt I used earlier. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just that I used too much.</li>
    <li> This product does what it advertises; it gave my hair some body.... but it also left it feeling greasy. I switched to the Nexus volumizing mousse and won&#x27;t ever go back - it gives my hair body without the greasy feeling that comes with this product.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair great, long-lasting body and smells great.. Great price, too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This mouse is wonderful.  I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and it does the trick.  Keeps my hair full of body all day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best mousse for curly hair. I have searched long and hard for a brand that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This mousse is recommended for straight hair, but I have wavy hair and it is excellent. My wavy hair is very heavy, so it weighs it down at the roots, causing a &amp;#34;triangle hair&amp;#34; effect, where the roots are flat and the rest of my hair is wavy. Not cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply about an egg sized amount just to my roots, around my crown area. I just massage it in to damp roots, and then I apply different curling products to the rest of my hair. I let everything air dry. It will be crunchy if you apply too much mousse, so be careful. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t cause a ton of build up in my hair, and there is great volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this with a blow dryer on days I want to straighten my hair and I want volume at my roots. I apply it to my damp roots, as I would do when wearing my hair curly, but after this, I take a round brush and blow dry my hair. There is significantly more volume (that stays) when I use the mousse as opposed to going productless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable, smells great, and it works whether you blow dry or air dry.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mousses that claim to volumize but this one actually works on my fine hair. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I have terribly thinking hair.  This product gives it the extra body it needs to look like I&#x27;m trying to cover bald spots</li>
    <li> * This provided good volume to my normal/dry med-thick med-length hair  * Recommend it for others to try  * A great buy for the price</li>
    <li> Adds body and volume to fine hair.  Happy with product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It gives your hair a lot of extra body without making it hard. I have thin blonde hair that tends to go flat 10 minutes after blow drying, but this stuff keeps my hair looking nice all day. Several of my friends noticed how nice my hair looked after using this mousse, and they are currently ordering a bottle for themselves! The price is great for the quality product that you get. I&#x27;ve bought products that were a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as nice of a job.</li>

    <li> Good product great price! goes on light not sticky at all so much better than hair spray I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I expected. I thought it would give some volume to my thin hair but I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Cheaper hair spray works better.</li>
