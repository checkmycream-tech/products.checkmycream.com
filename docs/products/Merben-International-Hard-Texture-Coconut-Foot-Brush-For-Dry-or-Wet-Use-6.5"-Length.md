      <li>Makes you feel clean, clean, clean!</li>
      <li>Love it for the whole body!</li>

      <li>This brush does a great job at removing dirt embedded in my rough heels.</li>
      <li>Works great on feet and other calloused areas.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and leaves them soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is WONDERFUL for when your feet itch for no clear reason (you don&#x27;t have athlete&#x27;s foot) - just a weird nerve-type itch - you can really get a good scratch!  </li>
      <li>The product itself is very nice, except that the wooden handle developed a crack after about one month.  </li>
      <li>Nicely made, sturdy, and  quick to dry.</li>
      <li>I like the size, good for feet as well as any other part of the body.  </li>
      <li>The right size and coarseness for scrubbing feet.</li>
      <li>This would be good for those with limited ability to bend over, because at almost a foot it extends your reach but not so much that it is unwieldy.  </li>
      <li>I find the size really workable for me and the firmness exactly what I need to get my feet clean</li>
      <li>And even though I&#x27;ve been using another body brush daily for months; you should have seen the dead skin fly when I started on my ankles with THIS brush!  </li>
      <li>It works quickly, is natural and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Feels nice on the feet and gets rid of the dry skin.</li>
      <li>Being an avid gardener, I needed a sturdy brush for clean-up.</li>
      <li>I garden, and this brush really helps remove garden dirt where i don&#x27;t want it!</li>
      <li>The product arrived on time and it exactly at pictured.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush.</li>
      <li>Holds up even in hot water.  </li>
      <li>good stiff brush, just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for many years and it finally mildewed so much that I couldn&#x27;t save it.  </li>
      <li>For sensitive users though the softer texture when wet may be good.  </li>
      <li>It is great on my dry skin, and it leaves my feet soft and smooth, not like a pumice stone, which makes my skin feel rough.</li>
      <li>This brush is a good size for small areas of your body or for scrubbing feet.  </li>
      <li>Really does make your feet super soft!</li>
      <li>brush is strong enough for use to stimulate circulation and improved exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again, and recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>they would make one with a slightly longer handle for reaching my back more easily, I would be the first to buy it.</li>
      <li>I used a brush like this years ago to gently exfoliate my underarms.</li>
      <li>It would take much patience to use it on your whole body.</li>
      <li>Really does the job.</li>
      <li>It does work really well as intended, as a nail/foot brush.</li>
      <li>I am very ticklish and this didn&#x27;t irritate me at all.  </li>
      <li>It is really stiff and I find it feels great especially with Dr. Bronners peppermint soap.</li>
      <li>I love it, except that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have a brush that is a little more rough.</li>
      <li>Very nice, super stiff little brush.  </li>
      <li>It is inexpensive, but high quality.  </li>
      <li>Really nice and hard brush for the feet.</li>
      <li>I have been using it to get dead skin off my feet and love it.</li>
      <li>its not hard as described for foot scrub..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered it, and it looks like it will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>It is STIFF and I love it.  </li>
      <li>This brush is a well-made, high end product that remains stiff and odor free.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin this is not the body brush for you.</li>
      <li>I bought a brush to use in the shower as a body brush and it was way too soft.</li>
      <li>I might try a rubber band or bicycle tube cut to size, but it really should not be necessary for a well-designed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I simply use this little foot brush each evening in the shower and my heels are clean again.  </li>
      <li>I find it just a bit hard to hold onto the thing while I&#x27;m scrubbing away, and a bit more wood would go a long way towards alleviating that issue.</li>
      <li>never had such soft skin</li>
      <li>I initially bought this brush for my old, crusty heels</li>
      <li>These are not easy to find, but worth the effort.</li>
      <li>However, it loses quite a bit of stability when wet so may be better suited for dry brushing.  </li>

<li> Small circular motions, focused on fleshy areas of the body-where  cellulite tends to accumlate;)-will gradually return your flesh to a smooth state, in combination with proper diet, H2O hydration, exercise, moisturizing and massage...sounds complicated, but really a very simple and quick routine can be established that reveals results that others will notice, too.  </li>
<li> It is a FABULOUS body brush for dry brushing-- as long as you stay away from delicate areas.</li>
<li> I am 55 years old, spent 20 years in the Army wearing combat boots, and my feet have taken a beating!</li>
<li> Dry brushing works well for stimulating and smoothing soles of feet.</li>
<li> then switch to another softer brush for dry brushing rest of body.</li>
<li> I use this for the feet section of my dry brushing routine.</li>
<li> and I leave it in the bathtub when it probably should be hanging to dry.  </li>
<li> so well dry</li>
<li> Plus I will use this to dry brush also.</li>
<li> Hadn&#x27;t shed a single bristle.</li>
<li> I travel to Hawaii frequently and my heels would be black after a few days of wearing flip flops.  </li>
<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the bristles were just a little bit stiffer.</li>
<li> Warning to those with sensitive skin - they&#x27;re not kidding when they describe this brush as Hard Texture.</li>

    <li> I purchased this product to use as part of a regimen for lyphatic cleansing and blood circulation. The product arrived on time and it exactly at pictured. I am very satisfied and would highly recommend to those who practice skin brushing for circulation. Good quality!</li>
    <li> I bought a brush to use in the shower as a body brush and it was way too soft. This brush is perfect, though maybe not for everyone. It is really stiff and I find it feels great especially with Dr. Bronners peppermint soap. If you have sensitive skin this is not the body brush for you. It does work really well as intended, as a nail/foot brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, but often forget to use it before I bathe.  It is inexpensive, but high quality.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered it, and it looks like it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  Needed something really firm and have tried everything...love this brush...will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Dry brushing works well for stimulating and smoothing soles of feet. I use up to ankles then switch to another softer brush for dry brushing rest of body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for many years and it finally mildewed so much that I couldn&#x27;t save it.  This one is fabulous also.  I love the way it scrubs my feet and gets them very clean even if they are cracked and calloused.  The instructions included with it advised to hang it outside the shower so it will not mildew.  Duh! Wish I&#x27;d thought of that sooner!  The only problem I have with it is the hanging loop is too short.</li>
    <li> This brush is smaller than expected (actual size of the brush part is 4.5 x 2.5 inches) but does have the hard texture as advertised.  However, it loses quite a bit of stability when wet so may be better suited for dry brushing.  For sensitive users though the softer texture when wet may be good.  This brush is a good size for small areas of your body or for scrubbing feet.  It would take much patience to use it on your whole body.</li>
    <li> Now that summer is here, this is the item to use. It is a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try and stay away from chemicals, and this foot brush allows me to exfoliate without any other product.  It works quickly, is natural and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Makes you feel clean, clean, clean!</li>
    <li> This is the best for feet.  Easy to use and leaves them soft and smooth.  Would buy another one in a second.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush. Works great on feet and other calloused areas. I would have gone 5 star on this review if the wooden part was just a bit larger. I find it just a bit hard to hold onto the thing while I&#x27;m scrubbing away, and a bit more wood would go a long way towards alleviating that issue.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! I am 55 years old, spent 20 years in the Army wearing combat boots, and my feet have taken a beating! I initially bought this brush for my old, crusty heels but now I use it all over my feet, especially my toes. What a difference!  My heels are crust free 😁  I am a female, BTW and now I can wear cute sandals without being embarrassed about my feet. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the bristles were just a little bit stiffer. Overall, a great foot brush!</li>
    <li> its not hard as described for foot scrub..</li>
    <li> The product itself is very nice, except that the wooden handle developed a crack after about one month.  So far, it still works, but I&#x27;m assuming the crack will only get worse over time unless I do something to stop it.  Possibly glue, although it would have to handle water and humidity.  I might try a rubber band or bicycle tube cut to size, but it really should not be necessary for a well-designed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is a danger of using wood instead of plastic or other material.</li>
    <li> This brush was a little harder than expected, but, it didn&#x27;t hurt, which was a shocker.  I am very ticklish and this didn&#x27;t irritate me at all.  During the summer I will use this every day to keep my feet looking sandal-ready.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a week, and I can already see the difference in my feet.  Dry dead skin is a thing of the past.      Warning to those with sensitive skin - they&#x27;re not kidding when they describe this brush as Hard Texture.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.  The right size and coarseness for scrubbing feet.</li>
    <li> Very nice, super stiff little brush.  I like the size, good for feet as well as any other part of the body.  I would recomment.</li>
    <li> This brush does a great job at removing dirt embedded in my rough heels. However, I was hoping it would help in removing the dead skin and make my feet smoother. Maybe it was wishful thinking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you are looking for clean feet, then this does the job! If you were looking for significant exfoliation, it might not be your best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi, I read about people using this brush for use on the body for lymphatic massage or something like that. I tried rubbing it on the tops of my feet and yowza! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I prefer those exfoliating washcloths you can buy from a Japanese or Korean market.</li>
    <li> works okay but I&#x27;m not expecting it to last because of the wooden handle and I leave it in the bathtub when it probably should be hanging to dry.  Feels nice on the feet and gets rid of the dry skin.</li>
    <li> Being an avid gardener, I needed a sturdy brush for clean-up. Even through shoes, socks, and gloves, the dirt gets through. I wouldn&#x27;t be without one of these. Nicely made, sturdy, and  quick to dry.</li>
    <li> never had such soft skin</li>
    <li> Love it, love it! This is the second one of these brushes I have owned. It is great on my dry skin, and it leaves my feet soft and smooth, not like a pumice stone, which makes my skin feel rough. I garden, and this brush really helps remove garden dirt where i don&#x27;t want it! These are not easy to find, but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> This is WONDERFUL for when your feet itch for no clear reason (you don&#x27;t have athlete&#x27;s foot) - just a weird nerve-type itch - you can really get a good scratch!  I wanted a VERY stiff brush and this is it!!!!  It is GREAT dry brush for before tub, WONDERFUL within the tube, and EXCELLENT after the tub for any straggling skin that needs exfoliated.  I use it on other parts (legs and &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; arms) and my butt; just don&#x27;t press as hard.  I am going to order more of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love it for the whole body!</li>
    <li> I use this brush all over my body, although it is advertised for the feet.  Small circular motions, focused on fleshy areas of the body-where  cellulite tends to accumlate;)-will gradually return your flesh to a smooth state, in combination with proper diet, H2O hydration, exercise, moisturizing and massage...sounds complicated, but really a very simple and quick routine can be established that reveals results that others will notice, too.  This brush is a well-made, high end product that remains stiff and odor free.</li>
    <li> good stiff brush, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this for the feet section of my dry brushing routine. I love it, except that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have a brush that is a little more rough.</li>
    <li> Really does make your feet super soft! Was going to use it wet but it works so well dry I have been using it to get dead skin off my feet and love it.</li>
    <li> This brush is nicely shaped for feet and toes. The bristles are firm and sturdy. I recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Very stiff brush perfect for the &amp;#34;thick skinned&amp;#34; areas of your body.  Great for exfoliating.  Fits well in my small, girlish hands.</li>
    <li> Really nice and hard brush for the feet. I find the size really workable for me and the firmness exactly what I need to get my feet clean ( I like going about my yard barefoot).  I&#x27;ve had it for many month now, everything is staying in one piece and I have no complains.</li>
    <li> Feels really great on my feet</li>
    <li> I used a brush like this years ago to gently exfoliate my underarms. I have always had little bumps and didn&#x27;t realize it could be razor burn and/or ingrown hairs. I&#x27;m glad I thought to look on amazon! I can tell a difference within a week. Plus I will use this to dry brush also.</li>
    <li> I travel to Hawaii frequently and my heels would be black after a few days of wearing flip flops.  Now I simply use this little foot brush each evening in the shower and my heels are clean again.  Perfect amound of stiffness for my feet.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how handy this would be. It won&#x27;t do the work of a pumice on the roughest feet but it will help maintain already smooth feet.  This little brush is great for all parts of your foot it slips between the toes, feels great on the bottom and smooths the top if used gently.  I think that it has been cleaning up the dead skin and my cuticles on my toenails too.  This would be good for those with limited ability to bend over, because at almost a foot it extends your reach but not so much that it is unwieldy.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Holds up even in hot water.  The fibers do not crush as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is strong enough for use to stimulate circulation and improved exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again, and recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would make one with a slightly longer handle for reaching my back more easily, I would be the first to buy it.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower with a little body wash for my feet. Perfect abrasive for soles. Hadn&#x27;t shed a single bristle.</li>
    <li> The world&#x27;s best foot brush!  Love it!  Just the right hardness/stiffness, but not brutal on the feet. Would order it again and again.</li>
    <li> This is more than just a foot brush!  It is a FABULOUS body brush for dry brushing-- as long as you stay away from delicate areas. And even though I&#x27;ve been using another body brush daily for months; you should have seen the dead skin fly when I started on my ankles with THIS brush!  LOVE.THIS. BRUSH.  Bet you could use it wet, too.  It is STIFF and I love it.  Really does the job.</li>
