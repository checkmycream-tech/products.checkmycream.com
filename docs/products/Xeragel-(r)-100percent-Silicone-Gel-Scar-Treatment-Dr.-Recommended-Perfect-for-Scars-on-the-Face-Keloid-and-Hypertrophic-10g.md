      <li>Great Scar Gel.</li>
      <li>Product also arrived very quickly and was perfectly packaged.</li>
      <li>Very good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good</li>
      <li>good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good</li>
      <li>Recommended by a friend who was really pleased.</li>
      <li>I have not used it because I don&#x27;t know for sure what I got.</li>
      <li>I had my nose pierced several months ago, and hypertrophic scar tissue (which is not a permanent kind of scar) started building up around the stud.</li>
      <li>I would have returned it but used it a second time to be sure.</li>
      <li>worked so much better than other products I used, flatten the scar, hardly noticeable, great product</li>
      <li>To soon to really notice, but I think it  is looking less better.</li>
      <li>I purchased this along with the scar away serum, the scar away is more expensive but is silky smooth and glides right on.  </li>
      <li>My advice go to the Scaraway which is more expensive but is a better product.</li>
      <li>but now my piercing looks completely normal.</li>
      <li>And I can still see that the scarring that was right above the piercing is gone now.</li>
      <li>i order a new xeragel and when i got it  it was a used one ,no seal was on the tube</li>
      <li>Helps keep scar soft while healing.</li>
      <li>In short, this product worked wonders, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has hypertrophic scarring that they are trying to address.</li>
      <li>Another con is that each tube only lasts a week, as the whole of my scar was about 15 inches</li>
      <li>The old saying  ...</li>
      <li>I tried remedying it with saline soaking and chamomile, but it continued to worsen until the scar tissue completely covered my stud (which was very tiny).</li>
      <li>I finally replaced the stud with a larger one, which helped hide/press down on the scarring, and I also purchased this gel, as I had read some peer-reviewed research about the effectiveness of pure silicone gel on hypertrophic scarring.</li>

<li> This product is very sticky and hard to try.  </li>
<li> Within a few days of using it, the scarring had almost disappeared completely.</li>
<li> It takes a long time to dry</li>
<li> It works but doesnt dry like other brands</li>
<li> The gel was hard as if it was old .i did not want to waste my time sending it back.</li>
<li> Its a total waste of money in my opinion.</li>
<li> CONS, It IS STICKY, and does not really dry, al least in the breasts, as they tend to sweat, and you cannot leave the scar without putting clothes over it all day long, obvioulsy.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so tacky that it sticks to everything other than the scar.</li>
<li> I guess, beeing a typical Inverted T scar from that type of surgery.</li>
<li> The little box it came in has no security seal &amp; is opened.</li>
<li> I tried using it a few times but eventually threw it to the side because of the stickiness.</li>
<li> It is also very difficult to remove .The only place where it says 100% silicone is a sticker applied separately to the box.</li>
<li> Half the cost expensive of the scar gel sold at plastic surgeons office.</li>
<li> The product is not a good one in my estimation.</li>
<li> The Xeragel is sticky and goopy and is very hard to apply.</li>
<li> In my case the scar is behind breast and below the underarm area.</li>

    <li> I may not have used this enough (apply several times a day per the instructions).. I still have a scar from a burn.</li>

    <li> Great Scar Gel. Helps keep scar soft while healing. Minimizes scar. Half the cost expensive of the scar gel sold at plastic surgeons office.</li>
    <li> Xeragel worked as promised on my scars resulting from burns. It helped to lessen the redness and diminish the size of the scar. Product also arrived very quickly and was perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> Who knows if the gel would work...it&#x27;s so tacky that it sticks to everything other than the scar. Doesn&#x27;t stay on area well at all!!! I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had my nose pierced several months ago, and hypertrophic scar tissue (which is not a permanent kind of scar) started building up around the stud. I tried remedying it with saline soaking and chamomile, but it continued to worsen until the scar tissue completely covered my stud (which was very tiny). I finally replaced the stud with a larger one, which helped hide/press down on the scarring, and I also purchased this gel, as I had read some peer-reviewed research about the effectiveness of pure silicone gel on hypertrophic scarring. Within a few days of using it, the scarring had almost disappeared completely. Granted, some of the scar tissue may still be &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; by the stud—and I don&#x27;t know if it would worsen if I put a tiny stud in again—but now my piercing looks completely normal. And I can still see that the scarring that was right above the piercing is gone now. In short, this product worked wonders, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has hypertrophic scarring that they are trying to address.</li>
    <li> The little box it came in has no security seal &amp; is opened. Inside, the tube also has no seal whatsoever. I have not used it because I don&#x27;t know for sure what I got. The 2 star is for delivery as promised.</li>
    <li> It works but doesnt dry like other brands</li>
    <li> I have used XERAGEL for a  month. PROS, I think it does work. My scar from a breast surgery HAS dimished. CONS, It IS STICKY, and does not really dry, al least in the breasts, as they tend to sweat, and you cannot leave the scar without putting clothes over it all day long, obvioulsy. Maybe in a face scar it could be different. Another con is that each tube only lasts a week, as the whole of my scar was about 15 inches I guess, beeing a typical Inverted T scar from that type of surgery.</li>
    <li> after using about 1 month , my scar become not as visible as before</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all it was greasy and messes up clothing,sheets anything it touches</li>
    <li> This product is very sticky and hard to try.  I tried using it a few times but eventually threw it to the side because of the stickiness.</li>

    <li> The gel was hard as if it was old .i did not want to waste my time sending it back. The old saying  ... U get what u pay for. I can get the product in Walgreens .</li>
    <li> i order a new xeragel and when i got it  it was a used one ,no seal was on the tube it feel like nothing in the tube .totally ripped off</li>
    <li> worked so much better than other products I used, flatten the scar, hardly noticeable, great product</li>
    <li> The product is not a good one in my estimation. It takes a long time to dry so if you cannot hold your arms up for 20 min then you will have problem of smearing and spreading to your arms or whatever touches it. In my case the scar is behind breast and below the underarm area. I would have returned it but used it a second time to be sure. All I got out of this product was sticky arms and sticky side of breast. Its a total waste of money in my opinion.</li>
