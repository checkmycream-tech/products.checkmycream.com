    <li> The dermatologist recommended this product to me when I was a child.  It is a great product for oil control and acne.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product is good; but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s too dark for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they discontinued the Light version of it.  After using this for a long time, your skin does dry up a bit.</li>
    <li> Great product. Sorry to learn that it is being discontinued!</li>
    <li> Sorry this product is, basically, off the market.  It works medicinally to clear up acne and is a great cover-up, too.</li>
    <li> This was perfect - just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This works very well. Would recommend it to anyone that may need to cover up a blemish.</li>
    <li> I use it to prevent my adult acne and It works I even use it underneath my make up  I would def reccomend</li>
    <li> I have never had acne until menopause and it is so itchy I scratch in my sleep leaving my face blotchy and in pain, I have tried so many products and nothing has helped, the liquidate arrived late yesterday I put it on right away :-) this is amazing stuff it has already started healing and the itching stopped, it is 4:05 am and my face feels great.</li>
    <li> Good coverage for my ongoing adult acne! It smells funky, however, especially when I go to rinse my face at night (sulphur smell)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this daily, just when I am going to important events or have a really bad breakout.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin, this is for you !&lt;br /&gt;Finally a make up that won&#x27;t make my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily looking like regular makeup !</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  Covers and conceals beautifully without and greasy feel.  Even for severe acne.  I always keep it on hand when something &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; up.  Thanks for having it available so easily as it is not in stores near me.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this medicated cosmetic cream for years and we have found it increasingly more difficult to find in local pharmacies and increasingly more expensive.  Buying on Amazon saves us 30% off the retail pharmacy price.  It is a superior product for treatment of breakouts.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and the product is still as good. Good for acne prone/oily skin!</li>
    <li> fresh .  I love this product . Thank you. It is hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I use this for two things.  For those infrequent red, won&#x27;t dry up &amp; go away acne spots.  Pile some of this stuff on at night and the blemish is almost gone by the next day.  It is also a very good heavy duty cover makeup.  It would probably even cover burn scars.  A bottle lasts a long time.  Good stuff.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my oily skin problem.  It is pleasant to use-soaks up the oil-without hurting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is a superior product and anyone with oily skin can benefit from its use.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon verified purchase.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other over the counter product for occasional spottiness, and the medium color actually blends quite well into most foundation colors. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Has the consistency and color of calamine lotion and drys to the same kind of finish. As a &#x27;makeup&#x27; it failed, looking more like a mask and I had to cover it with additional foundation to make  it look more normal. I didn&#x27;t try to use the included color adjuster drops because I disliked the consistency regardless of the color.  Additionally, it did absolutely nothing for my acne. Neither calmned breakout nor prevented additional comedones. May help someone, but did nothing for me regardless if worn alone or covered over.</li>
    <li> I only use this stuff at night to protect and help my face! I love it! I think it really helps</li>
    <li> Works as a make-up while fighting acne blemishes!</li>
    <li> I have used this make-up for years, and it still helps keep my skin clear.  Liquimat works on keeping my oily skin under control.</li>
