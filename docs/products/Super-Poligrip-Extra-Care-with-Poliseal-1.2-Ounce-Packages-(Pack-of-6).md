      <li>This is the very best holding denture cream I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product</li>
      <li>very good price for this product if you need it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent control, when applying, much better hold than the original product, shared with a roommate</li>
      <li>and she liked it better also.</li>
      <li>I would like to order more</li>
      <li>They look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; but squeeze it and most of the space is sans adhesive.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe for won.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>The product is fine.</li>
      <li>This was not for me, but the person who used it said that the tubes are full of air.  </li>
      <li>(;-))</li>
      <li>To much squid safety relations.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Always works better than any other product</li>
      <li>It is more expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>The normal size tube is about double the contents of these mini 1.2 ounce tubes.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look smaller in the pictures, but the bottom line is, you are paying close to what I normally pay at the store for a full-sized 2.4 ounce tube and getting half as much product.  </li>

    <li> I would like to order more</li>
    <li> Excellent control, when applying, much better hold than the original product, shared with a roommate and she liked it better also.</li>
    <li> Works like is supposed  to</li>
    <li> This was not for me, but the person who used it said that the tubes are full of air.  They look like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; but squeeze it and most of the space is sans adhesive.  I&#x27;d opt to either get it in a local store or look further as the price is no bargain if you&#x27;re not getting product.</li>
    <li> This is the very best holding denture cream I have ever used. It is more expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> YOU SENT ME WRONG ONE. WAITING FOR A RETURN LABEL TO RETURN TO YOU. THIS IS MY 2ND REQUEST.  THANK YOU. I WANTED GUM CARE (NEWEST ONE)</li>
    <li> very good price for this product if you need it.  It hold your dentures in place and does not allow food to get under the dentures.</li>
    <li> Have had trouble finding this in stores and this is the only one my husband will use.  Wish you also had the bigger tubes so will be looking for those sometime soon.  I purchased 2 packages (12 tubes).</li>
    <li> Lesson learned....ck the size of the item, much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Just half volumes.&lt;br /&gt;On a plaint.  It&#x27;s safe for won.&lt;br /&gt;4 pack.  To much squid safety relations.&lt;br /&gt;Just t weird.  (;-))</li>
    <li> The product is fine. I wish I would have paid attention to the small print, though. The normal size tube is about double the contents of these mini 1.2 ounce tubes. They don&#x27;t look smaller in the pictures, but the bottom line is, you are paying close to what I normally pay at the store for a full-sized 2.4 ounce tube and getting half as much product.  I think it&#x27;s a ripoff --- BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Works as well as these things ever do.  Forget worrying about ooze use plenty and you will get a firmer hold.  Would recommend.  Buying it this way saves money over the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Saved me as I could find none here!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Used fixodnt before and than switched due to zinc I product, Went back to Fixodent without zinc but not as goo hold as poligrip swill sta with the poligrip</li>
    <li> pay attention to the amount. This is an excellent product but I didn&#x27;t notice the small size of the tubes. I will next time. Still cant find the bigger tube on here</li>
    <li> TUBES ARE SIZED ADVERTISED BUT MUCH SMALLER THAN WHAT IS SOLD IN STORES.</li>
    <li> A very bad deal. My fault for not checking size. The ones in the stores are 2.4 ounce for even less. A scam</li>
    <li> since zinc was removed these don&#x27;t adhere as long as they used to</li>
    <li> Tubes too small for the price.  I get larger size in my commissary for the same price.  Otherwise the services were excellent.</li>
    <li> Purchased product for mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Always works better than any other product</li>
