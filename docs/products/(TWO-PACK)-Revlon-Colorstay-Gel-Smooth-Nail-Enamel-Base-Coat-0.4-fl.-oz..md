    <li> Fabulous stuff!!!! I went to nail shop for 20 years...had Acrylics.. My nail were in rough shape.. This gives a smooth nail bed.. Hard nail .. Polishes great! Lasts for over a week or 2 no prob.. My natural nail is grown out now looks great.. But I use this so my nails don&#x27;t break and polish lasts without chips.. Cost is next to nothing compared to nail shop and it&#x27;s as easy as polishing nails.. Love this!</li>

    <li> Simply the best base coat I&#x27;ve used and worth every penny.  Works perfect for me; provides a smooth, buildable base on my less-than-perfect nails that wears like iron.  A shame it&#x27;s been discontinued; will continue to purchase from Amazon as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
