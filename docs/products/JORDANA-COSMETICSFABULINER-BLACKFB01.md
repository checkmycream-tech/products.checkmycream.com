      <li>I really love this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>easy to apply, is buildable and the color and consistancy are great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>

      <li>Great for really cheap eyeliner, but there are many better drugstore-level liners out there for slightly more $</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is actually pretty great considering it&#x27;s from a very cheap brand.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t put the color on very smoothly...</li>
      <li>a fine pen works good and his on smooth</li>
      <li>This is a FABULOUS product, but do not buy from this vendor!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also thicker than my finer eyeliner for me to cover more area with one pass.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for more than a decade now...</li>
      <li>with  this  liner,  it&#x27;s  fabulous!</li>
      <li>Im sold and hooked on Jordana now :)</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>My favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this liner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably buy again to replace the one I have, but I will keep looking for a better quality eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Love this &#x27;marker&#x27; type of applicator and the long-wearing formula.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner, it is very good quality, looks beautiful, not cheap, easy to apply, officially one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>it is a very good product, fixed well,the color is good not leave it in the water i like very much.</li>
      <li>It ran out kind of quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is easy to use and it looks like liquid. :)</li>
      <li>Other than that awesome buy:)</li>
      <li>, only thing that is good is the brush sturdiness !</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It smudges easily with any type of moisture, sweat included, and will run.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on</li>
      <li>Now this liner is so cool I was gonna give it to my daughter but feel in love with this</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>The color looks super watery, almost like drawing with a magic marker.</li>
      <li>First, it is very easy to use, as it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>goes on smooth and does not smear</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like pencils, the line just isn&#x27;t as smooth for me.</li>
      <li>My only critique is that it wipes away pretty easily with any moisture/water, so maybe a waterproof version would be ideal.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this years ago in Walgreens at the cosmetics counter for 1.99..  </li>
      <li>This liner lasts all month for me it doesn&#x27;t dry out in the pen and for the price its great quality.</li>
      <li>Very nice felt tip and sharp.</li>
      <li>I normally use one of the drugstore brand liquid liner pens but thought another brand might be even better; this one was</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more of thing!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It goes on so easily compared to normal liquid liner!</li>
      <li>Well worth it though.</li>
      <li>you want to look awake and fresh but not done-</li>
      <li>I used to use Almay for sensitive eyes, but this one has a better fine line control, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, great black color, doesn&#x27;t smear!!!</li>
      <li>It looks great on one eye and not so much on the other.</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re really wanting a good felt tip liquid eyeliner, try Maybelline Master Precise By Eye Studio in Black</li>
      <li>pen part feels good in my hand but the part that draws the line on the lid was thick and did not make a fine line</li>
      <li>I love how sharp and easy to handle the tip is.</li>
      <li>The line goes on very straight without bleeding out anywhere</li>
      <li>pretty much like a sharpie for your eye (but not permanent in any way!)</li>
      <li>Only wish I&#x27;d bought more than 1 then.</li>
      <li>I LOVE my Urban Decay 24/7 waterproof liquid eyeliner but its almost $20</li>
      <li>I was able use only twice.</li>
      <li>It applies on very well, and doesn&#x27;t smear or streak!  </li>
      <li>Great color and very long lasting!</li>
      <li>It would probably be great for people with less sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s self is nice, but the tip is sharp.</li>
      <li>Also I suggest storing it with the felt top down so that the brush will remain moist and full of product.</li>
      <li>ive been using it ever since i got it and its amazing just one streak and its a matte black.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s easy to draw on since the tip is thicker, but I have to go over it a couple of times to get a solid line</li>
      <li>So all in all, I would buy Jordana again because it&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy to apply, and stays on well enough.</li>
      <li>I ordered this jordana eye liner only to receive L.A girl fine line liquid eyeliner...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It ran out kind of quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t really stay on too well.  I bought gel liner on Ebay for $.99 that is more effective.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> No intense color. Was dried out when I got it. Very nice felt tip and sharp. If you get it when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s probably fine.</li>
    <li> The color looks super watery, almost like drawing with a magic marker.</li>
    <li> Great for really cheap eyeliner, but there are many better drugstore-level liners out there for slightly more $</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is a FABULOUS product, but do not buy from this vendor! Walgreens sells this eyeliner in black and brown at their cosmetic counter for $1.99.</li>
    <li> The liner it&#x27;s self is nice, but the tip is sharp. So, don&#x27;t poke your eye out!</li>
    <li> Awful and I bought two! :( No color payoff at all, It comes out gray instead of black.</li>
    <li> The tip does not release any color. It&#x27;s very difficult to work with and when you can get the color out it does not stay on for more than a few minutes.  Very poor product.</li>
    <li> I like this liner, although it does have its cons as well as pros. First, it is very easy to use, as it glides on easily. It has more staying power than some other felt tip liners I&#x27;ve tried, but not as much as others. By the end of a long day, most of it is still in place, but it&#x27;s a little blurry--not raccoon eyes, however. But as another reviewer pointed out, it is not water-proof so does not have the staying power that some liners have. That said, it&#x27;s easier to remove than liners that are waterproof/semi-permanent. Overall, I like it about the same as NYX felt tip liner, although the two liners are very different. After a long time period, NYX tends to flake off a bit, whereas Jordana blurs/runs. It&#x27;s much easier to use than NYX, but I think (on me, anyway) NYX stays on a little better. I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, so I don&#x27;t know how long the Jordana will last. NYX doesn&#x27;t last that long, and tends to try out more quickly than other brands. My favorite felt tip liner is Pump Up--which is semi-permanent and very difficult to find--because it stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t flake or blur, and the container lasts a long time. But because it&#x27;s semi-permanent, it&#x27;s harder to remove (Neutrogena oil-free eye make-up remover works OK). So all in all, I would buy Jordana again because it&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy to apply, and stays on well enough.</li>
    <li> I loooooooooooove black eyeliner. Thick black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;And this is great.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Has a felt tip.&lt;br /&gt;That started pointy then fat.&lt;br /&gt;Buuuuuut.... its not a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;And thats what I like it liquid eyeliners...</li>
    <li> easy to apply, is buildable and the color and consistancy are great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on. Wish it was waterproof.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s easy to draw on since the tip is thicker, but I have to go over it a couple of times to get a solid line, I feel it&#x27;s a little watery, I normally wear it on my casual makeup days.</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a really good liquid eyeliner and I had hoped to have it in this pen, but nope. I am terrible at applying liquid eyeliner,let me get that out of the way now. I love the longevity of a good one, so I keep trying. I have found gel liners have worked best, the drugstore kind that come with a baby brush applicator. The idea of a felt tip like pen always draws me in though, because I cannot seem to draw a proper line on my eyes, it seemed to make sense to use. I think I have finally given up though in using this liner. I hadn&#x27;t got halfway through my first application and it had already dried up. Any girl knows that scraping a dry liner across your eye is almost as bad as stepping on a piece of glass barefoot.....It hurt and I threw it away immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would recommend Loreal gel liner. Any CVS or Walgreens sells it. $10 and you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> I really like this liner. The tip is firm enough for me to draw along my eyelid. It&#x27;s also thicker than my finer eyeliner for me to cover more area with one pass. Then I use my finer eyeliner for the wing or finer details that I want.  It stays on all day without smearing.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this after getting some for her 17th birthday. Only wish I&#x27;d bought more than 1 then. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I really love this eyeliner! its very easy to hold and apply. I bought it online because I thought that It was not sold in stores but it is and its also cheaper at the drugstore</li>
    <li> So this liner works  initially and is very dark so great for dramatic looks. However if you have watery eyes, then look for something waterproof instead. It smudges easily with any type of moisture, sweat included, and will run. Also I suggest storing it with the felt top down so that the brush will remain moist and full of product. Otherwise the tip will dry out. It&#x27;s good overall, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest having this in your travel makeup bag due to the fact that you really should store felt tip down. I&#x27;d probably buy again to replace the one I have, but I will keep looking for a better quality eyeliner. Good luck!</li>
    <li> All in all it&#x27;s a good liner. It does the job quite smoothly, the color sticks and stays the entire day.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this liner, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t last at all. The liner fades off the edges of my eyes almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I ordered this jordana eye liner only to receive L.A girl fine line liquid eyeliner... Didn&#x27;t even recieve what I ordered waste of money</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this on a night out or a date. But it&#x27;s perfect for work. It looks great on one eye and not so much on the other. Won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> it is a very good product, fixed well,the color is good not leave it in the water i like very much. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Now this liner is so cool I was gonna give it to my daughter but feel in love with this it&#x27;s like a fine pen works good and his on smooth</li>
    <li> NOT a high quality eyeliner. You get what you pay for! Does not make a bold or sharp line.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyeliner occasionally for over 2 year.  The ink is still very liquid, and the brush is fine enough.  It&#x27;s a great buy to me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Eyeliner doesn&#x27;t work very well for the first couple days, but store it upside down and it&#x27;ll be fine. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all dried out !!!!!!&amp;#62;:/ only used it once , only thing that is good is the brush sturdiness !</li>
    <li> waiting so long for this item to arrive, opened it only to find it was dry and did not work&lt;br /&gt;so disappointing):</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like pencils, the line just isn&#x27;t as smooth for me. This is easy to use and it looks like liquid. :)</li>
    <li> It was too Dry. I was able use only twice.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, it is very good quality, looks beautiful, not cheap, easy to apply, officially one of my favorites. The only thing is when I laugh my eyes always tear up and that washes away or smears the wing of my eyeliner so I have to reapply throughout the day. Wither way I love this eyeliner I just wish they would make a waterproof version.</li>
    <li> I was reading reviews online and im super unhappy with this product. As soon as i put it on it wasnt very dark at all. Almost like a dry erase marker. Every time i went over the previous line it would mess it all up. You get what you pay for. I LOVE my Urban Decay 24/7 waterproof liquid eyeliner but its almost $20 so I was hoping to try this as a cheaper alternative. Looks like ill be forking over that $20 after all. Well worth it though.</li>
    <li> The colors hardly shows up and when you try to redraw it it just wipes off.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay for long. Disappears from the eye making it look messy. Will not recommend. Don&#x27;t go by the price. I would rather recommend masterpiece by Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product, I bought it after reading good comments. While trying to use it I found that it smudges to the point it&#x27;s unwearable, is difficult to put on and only went on in small amounts before I had to let it rest upside down to get any more out. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the make up wipe.</li>
    <li> I love how sharp and easy to handle the tip is. Great color and very long lasting! I&#x27;ve used for 12hrs+ without any smudges!</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t what i ordered :( in the pic it was what i wanted but i received a different model</li>
    <li> Very bad product ... Although its easy to apply and look pretty black at the bigining... But after 10 min ... You will see it spread all over your eyelid and under eyes so u will look like having dark circles... And u will just want to wash your face ....</li>
    <li> When I got this product (a year ago), I was amazed! This eyeliner took a while to run out and was definitely worth my money (I paid overall $12 for this, shipping included). Although, someone said the seller to this isn&#x27;t great. I can&#x27;t comment on that because I bought this off of someone else....</li>
    <li> Very easy to work with and does not smudge.</li>
    <li> It glides on so smoothly and looks great. :)&lt;br /&gt;It is nice for anyone who isn&#x27;t quite comfortable with liquid eyeliner because of its thin felt tip.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the product, but it seems like it is wayyyyy over priced on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If u want a great eyeliner this is great, but I suggest that you check out drugstores/target as this can be easily found their for around 3 dollars. :)</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Very convient since I&#x27;m an on the go kinda of person( mom of 3). I just  wish the black color came out darker with one application. I have to reapply about 2-3 strokes to darken it. Other than that awesome buy:)</li>
    <li> I loved the eyeliner. It is easy to apply and looks great!. They color stays on for a long time and is easy to remove without irritation.</li>
    <li> I liked this, it worked quite well. But, I only got to use it twice because the stiffness of the applicator hurt my eyelid. It would probably be great for people with less sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> It looks nice when you put it on but aftee some hrs your eyes will look all messy. Disappointed. I saw this product in a YouTube makeup tutorial and Carli who recommended I got all the makeup for that tutorial and so far this is the only one that disappointed me.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from a Sephora rep when I was looking for a liquid-based eyeliner that wasn&#x27;t an expensive &#x27;premiere&#x27; brand, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed! It glides on in a perfectly smooth line, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s great for tightlining on those days you want to look awake and fresh but not done-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much like a sharpie for your eye (but not permanent in any way!) My only critique is that it wipes away pretty easily with any moisture/water, so maybe a waterproof version would be ideal. Otherwise it&#x27;s a GREAT product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I was deeply disappointed with this product-- it was completely dried out and barely would go on.</li>
    <li> Not the best pigment payout, but does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eyeliner. It goes on so easily compared to normal liquid liner! It  actually lasts all day, as well. I will definitely be ordering more of thing!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this liner.  It applies on very well, and doesn&#x27;t smear or streak!  And the best part, is&lt;br /&gt;that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot for a quality product.  I keep one in my cosmetic bag as well as in my&lt;br /&gt;purse....I highly recommend this liner!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this years ago in Walgreens at the cosmetics counter for 1.99..  When it ran out, it was impossible to find, because Walgreens didn&#x27;t restock!!!  I bought the Revlon one, and it sucked.. the black went on as a faded grey. yuck.  So I bought this one online, and I know I paid a little extra, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  They last for a very long time, and goes on dark black and very smooth.  The line goes on very straight without bleeding out anywhere you don&#x27;t put it.  Truely a very good value for a little-known product!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who also orders it from Amazon.  It goes on very smooth and lasts all day.  It also does not smudge.  I highly recommend it as it is good quality and a great value.</li>
    <li> Very  nice, I  used it and is preside,  I&#x27;m very  satisfied  with  this  liner,  it&#x27;s  fabulous! I  recommend this  liner.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way it wears it takes forever to really get it on just right so no i don&#x27;t recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> This is officially my all time favorite liquid eyeliner! I used to use Almay for sensitive eyes, but this one has a better fine line control, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, great black color, doesn&#x27;t smear!!! Im sold and hooked on Jordana now :)</li>
    <li> This came dry and wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Even when I made the tip wet it was useless. Go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The tip in all the ones I ordered are hard for some reason.  But I do like the product.  Thank you for sending it promptly.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t really like this. It&#x27;s easy to put on and I love that it&#x27;s not really flexible so it doesn&#x27;t move all around when you&#x27;re applying it, but it&#x27;s not dark enough like others. BUT when I tried going over my wing again, it just took some of the application off and just screwed up my make-up. It&#x27;s definitely not worth what they&#x27;re pricing it. If you&#x27;re really wanting a good felt tip liquid eyeliner, try Maybelline Master Precise By Eye Studio in Black and it works like a charm. Not a big fan of Jordana.</li>
    <li> Received eyeliner, didn&#x27;t glide on black actually didn&#x27;t glide on at all. Waste of money and time. I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for more than a decade now...</li>
    <li> Good for the price. goes on smooth and does not smear</li>
    <li> Gives you precision, AND a thick line. Stays on for a while, not too hard to remove.</li>
    <li> It is the best liner i have used yet. ive been using it ever since i got it and its amazing just one streak and its a matte black. Usually my eyeliners need to build up but with this its just one streak and youre done.</li>
    <li> As expected for the price range. Nothing special, but a great practice liquid liner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is actually pretty great considering it&#x27;s from a very cheap brand. Although I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other products from this brand, I do love this eyeliner. :)</li>
    <li> I normally use one of the drugstore brand liquid liner pens but thought another brand might be even better; this one was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen part feels good in my hand but the part that draws the line on the lid was thick and did not make a fine line-you can only make a wide line with this pen.  It also doesn&#x27;t put the color on very smoothly...it skips...it makes the line look broken and you have to go back several times to fill in the tiny breaks to make an even looking line-not what one expects from a liquid liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this one up but won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this eye liner!!!! i use this on a daily basis for my cat eye. the tip is nice and pointy it is a felt tip but it keeps its shape. i use 001 black and it is dark black. it does not flake and its stays on all day for me! i like how its not bulky it fits in my purse like a normal pen. it goes on smooth without irritation and i don&#x27;t have to press hard and the make up distributes nicely. its also fast drying on the lid i don&#x27;t have to fan my eyes  for them to dry. This liner lasts all month for me it doesn&#x27;t dry out in the pen and for the price its great quality.</li>
    <li> Love this &#x27;marker&#x27; type of applicator and the long-wearing formula.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with an eye for a bargain. I will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
