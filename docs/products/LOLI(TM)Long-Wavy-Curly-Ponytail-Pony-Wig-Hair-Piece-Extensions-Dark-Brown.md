      <li>nice for costume use...off color :?</li>
      <li>Love love love this, and it matches my hair, everyone loved it and didn&#x27;t even no it wasn&#x27;t my hair.</li>

      <li>I love it looks really nice</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I am going to get more from this company</li>
      <li>its ok.</li>
      <li>Even wore it as a braid :)</li>
      <li>Color received was not even close to &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34;  it was more reddish color.  </li>
      <li>Its way to light!</li>
      <li>I just love the curls.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look as full, but nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great quality hair/wig piece that I was able to attach to an existing costume wig with no trouble.</li>
      <li>this method proved to work just fine, however It was a hassle...</li>
      <li>They tend to turn into rat nests to quick!</li>
      <li>The product was very beautiful just like the picture but its more of a light golden brown than dark brown.</li>
      <li>One star is for accurate delivery date.</li>
      <li>cheap made.  </li>
      <li>It looked real in my hair and kept its curls nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great piece, especially when you don&#x27;t have alot of time to do your hair...</li>
      <li>I guess if its cheap thats what you get</li>
      <li>In love right now....</li>
      <li>Product was different from the Color shown and not the length given but had it been it would have been very nice</li>
      <li>Contact seller first to make sure of color before purchasing</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price I paid for it.</li>
      <li>quality seemed ok but could not use because color was so far off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing i have a red tint to my hair, but after conditioning it so many times, the brown came out and it was completely red</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;d be okay though with better fastening, but I doubt I&#x27;ll use it for such an energetic sport in the future.</li>
      <li>I didnt think it was gonna look exactly like the pic.</li>
      <li>It is really pretty .I</li>
      <li>Be aware though that this is a heavier hair piece, and make sure you take extra precautions when using it.</li>
      <li>Pretty thou.  </li>
      <li>I did straighten it for a different look but wasn&#x27;t able to curl it afterwards...</li>
      <li>soft, shiny, look real on head, inexpensive, easy to put on.</li>
      <li>The hair does feel like real hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really look real but</li>
      <li>, Very displeased...</li>
      <li>It blends right in and feels natural.</li>
      <li>The hair itself was soft, looks real, and the color was great, but it was a little too thin and the net thing underneath kind of makes it stick out.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and very shiny.</li>
      <li>not shiny its soft and feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>GREAT QUALITY, LOOKS EXPENSIVE,</li>
      <li>It will definitely need extra support but other than that it looked gorgeous.</li>
      <li>The curls bounce right back....</li>
      <li>and I was surprised to see</li>
      <li>My natural hair is longer.</li>
      <li>I work outside in the hot sun, so they last asbout 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>daughter&#x27;s hair, the hair piece has a bit more of a reddish tint to it, but it worked well enough and it&#x27;s hard to tell from colors anyways when you buy online.</li>
      <li>Heat is bad news, but great deal.</li>
      <li>This ponytail extension was actually much nicer than I originally expected.</li>
      <li>the only thing is that it look red in the light :/</li>
      <li>The color was not dark brown but a red color.</li>
      <li>The hair was much shorter than picture and the color was lighter than my dark brown hair.</li>
      <li>But being that my hair is thin and fine, it will add volume to it.</li>
      <li>I like the style of it and the color matches really good with mine, so overall its not that bad.</li>

<li> (it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
<li> and of course, the color was not dark brown, it as dark maroon...</li>
<li> n let air dry.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less hair than in the picture, I tried to use the ponytail but its not enough hair on the track.</li>
<li> I thought it was going to be almost black, and obviously its shiney but who needs like hair shinier than the sun!?</li>
<li> I just wish these pieces would keep their beauty and last a little longer.</li>
<li> I received my ponytail in the mail and it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
<li> Shorter than expected.  </li>
<li> not what I had expected</li>
<li> so be careful if you are expecting dark brown.</li>
<li> I may keep it to add on to some other hair or wig</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed because for the price it should be of better quality.</li>
<li> Now im gonna have to dye the ponytail dark brown.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t match my dark brown hair at all.</li>
<li> I thought it would be a tad bit darker, as my daughter has dark brown almost black hair and needed it for a performance.</li>
<li> Wore this for the  Princess Half Marathon.</li>
<li> I thought it to be a little heavy.</li>
<li> You will need bobby pins because they are not secure.</li>
<li> A few  days ago, I wrote a negative feedback on this item.</li>
<li> Also, It arrived late.</li>

    <li> Worked great for me. It will definitely need extra support but other than that it looked gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Dave&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great quality hair/wig piece that I was able to attach to an existing costume wig with no trouble. It blends right in and feels natural.</li>
    <li> These take along time to arrive, but they are so fairly priced, I have ordered 8 of them. The color is wrong wrong, it is black with a maroon, rasberry color. I am using them to grow my hair back. I work outside in the hot sun, so they last asbout 2 weeks. Do not sleep in them. Heat is bad news, but great deal. You will need bobby pins because they are not secure.</li>
    <li> The curls would be perfect if they didnt tangle easy, but after 2 wears i noticed significant tangling and frizziness. i started putting a TON detangling spray in it, brushing it out (it&#x27;s pretty thick so this isnt a problem with losing hair) and then braiding it to set until I wear the next time. this method proved to work just fine, however It was a hassle...and of course, the color was not dark brown, it as dark maroon...It&#x27;s a good thing i have a red tint to my hair, but after conditioning it so many times, the brown came out and it was completely red so I could no longer wear it. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Its way to light! I thought it was going to be almost black, and obviously its shiney but who needs like hair shinier than the sun!?</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, LOOKS EXPENSIVE, BEYONG EXPECTATIONS, VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING, I WOULD CONTINUE TO BUY THIS AGAIN......300% RECOMMEND IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I received my ponytail in the mail and it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It&#x27;s less hair than in the picture, I tried to use the ponytail but its not enough hair on the track. I&#x27;m disappointed because for the price it should be of better quality. I may keep it to add on to some other hair or wig but I can&#x27;t use it alone. I will not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This ponytail extension was actually much nicer than I originally expected. The hair is soft and very shiny. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect match to&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair, the hair piece has a bit more of a reddish tint to it, but it worked well enough and it&#x27;s hard to tell from colors anyways when you buy online. Be aware though that this is a heavier hair piece, and make sure you take extra precautions when using it. I just slid it into my daughter&#x27;s pony tail and tied it with the ribbon and it fell out while she was cheerleading. I think it&#x27;d be okay though with better fastening, but I doubt I&#x27;ll use it for such an energetic sport in the future.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good hair piece. It doesn&#x27;t really look real but its ok. I like the style of it and the color matches really good with mine, so overall its not that bad.</li>
    <li> I got this piece today and I was surprised to see&lt;br /&gt;the quality of it. It is really pretty .I took off the pony&lt;br /&gt;tail string and added 3 clips from Sallys.it snaps in&lt;br /&gt;tight and to my own hair.The color is perfect. I bought&lt;br /&gt;many hair pieces and I love this one the best.The price&lt;br /&gt;is Perfect ! I am going to get more from this company&lt;br /&gt;Its not shiny its soft and feels like real hair.TY</li>
    <li> WRONG COLOR!!!, Very displeased... One star is for accurate delivery date. That&#x27;s all... I picked the color (1B) that matched my hair...but I was sent the wrong color.</li>
    <li> The hair itself was soft, looks real, and the color was great, but it was a little too thin and the net thing underneath kind of makes it stick out.</li>
    <li> Like the texter and curls. But mad that it didnt come in the color it said \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; it came out in \\&quot; red auburn\\&quot;. Now im gonna have to dye the ponytail dark brown. Contact seller first to make sure of color before purchasing but then again u get what u pay for.....</li>
    <li> Oh my god. I love it. I didnt think it was gonna look exactly like the pic. In love right now....</li>
    <li> This is the best thing if ur having a bad hair day.!!!!!!! Looks real.the curls hold. And if it gets dirty u can wash w shampoo shake it out n let air dry. The curls bounce right back....don&#x27;t brush it tho...it kinda messes it up</li>
    <li> I love it looks really nice</li>
    <li> nice for costume use...off color :?</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT the only thing is that it look red in the light :/ but so I won&#x27;t like people will like it</li>
    <li> It took over a month to be delivered,  probably because it came from overseas.  The hair was much shorter than picture and the color was lighter than my dark brown hair. And kinda overly shiny. But texture was nice and it stayed put and still looks cute.</li>
    <li> I actually loved this! It looked real in my hair and kept its curls nicely. I did straighten it for a different look but wasn&#x27;t able to curl it afterwards... Even wore it as a braid :)</li>
    <li> Color received was not even close to &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34;  it was more reddish color.  quality seemed ok but could not use because color was so far off.</li>
    <li> The product was very beautiful just like the picture but its more of a light golden brown than dark brown. Also, It arrived late.</li>
    <li> cheap made.  Color doesn&#x27;t match what said</li>
    <li> A few  days ago, I wrote a negative feedback on this item. I would like to amend that. It is not a suppliers fault that it does not arrive on time, especially if it comes from China and has to go through customs. My product finally arrived. The package was in perfect condition. Opened up the product to find that it is not quite long enough for me. My natural hair is longer. But being that my hair is thin and fine, it will add volume to it. So all in all I am happy with that. Was real easy to put on. There is a clip at the top for a perfect fit then a tie that goes under you own ponytail. . The hair does feel like real hair. I just love the curls.  I sprayed leave in conditioner on it so, the curls will stay in tack. I thought it to be a little heavy. You can actually feel the weight of it. Not bad for the price I paid for it. Just a little disappointment that it was not longer, for what is showed in the picture.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS GOOD.. HAIR FEELS NICE. JUST WISH THE PONYTAIL WAS FULLER</li>
    <li> Shorter than expected.  Pretty thou.  Shipped from China and it took forever to get here.</li>
    <li> soft, shiny, look real on head, inexpensive, easy to put on. LOVE it! It is wavy. would by this brand again if there are different hair styles.</li>
    <li> Product was different from the Color shown and not the length given but had it been it would have been very nice which is a shame</li>
    <li> not what I had expected but it works</li>
    <li> Love love love this, and it matches my hair, everyone loved it and didn&#x27;t even no it wasn&#x27;t my hair. I had to tell them, and they asked where I got it from, I told them Amazon.😊</li>
    <li> my daughter just loves it</li>
    <li> This is no good.its thin and feel like paper. I guess if its cheap thats what you get</li>
    <li> The color was not dark brown but a red color. It doesn&#x27;t match my dark brown hair at all. very disappointed. I received the hair with a bright auburn color....so be careful if you are expecting dark brown.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a tad bit darker, as my daughter has dark brown almost black hair and needed it for a performance. The difference wasn&#x27;t noticeable and the hair piece looks great!!</li>
    <li> Wore this for the  Princess Half Marathon. People thought it was my own hair and commented on how nicely my curls stayed in tact.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great piece, especially when you don&#x27;t have alot of time to do your hair... Just brush your hair, put it in a ponytail, add hair piece and go!! I keep it simple!!  I just wish these pieces would keep their beauty and last a little longer. They tend to turn into rat nests to quick!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as full, but nice.</li>
