      <li>I am SO glad I believed her and bought a tub.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff- use it all over-</li>
      <li>love love love.</li>
      <li>Never have I found a better moisturizer</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products to help my rosacea and nothing seems to work.</li>
      <li>But its not awful by any means..</li>
      <li>Cant wait to get mine in the mail! :)</li>
      <li>I just Love this product.</li>
      <li>Glad it worked for some</li>
      <li>On the real, this stuff does NOT smell so great.</li>
      <li>Ok, I have Rosacea .  </li>
      <li>Mostly around the mouth.  </li>
      <li>I emptied out a lip tube and filled that baby up with this gem!  </li>
      <li>It wreaks havoc on my skin, and this stabilized it when nothing a top dermatology department in Boston, Ma gave me could.  </li>
      <li>Massage in and wipe clean with a warm wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of natural products and this is number 1 for sure!!</li>
      <li>A good doctor will thank you and pass the good news on to his/her other patients.</li>
      <li>In the morning I was delighted to see all of the red bumps greatly diminished (much to my surprise).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this product on my face, after washing with the facial bar just before bed, I have seen a great improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.  </li>
      <li>Though it is more thick like a body butter, but it awesome.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to see that it has helped many other people, but I&#x27;m not a fan.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from a very rare autoimmune disease called eosinophilic fascitiis.  </li>
      <li>I was able to afford all of them being that they are also very reasonable on the price.  </li>
      <li>I was excited and started using it as a day and night moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this multitasking product, thanks!</li>
      <li>The lady who was there was super friendly and helpful.</li>
      <li>I was even asked if I was pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I put is on my dog sore pads and it healed quickly.</li>
      <li>It does not absorb quickly at all if that is a concern of yours.</li>
      <li>I felt I could safely reduce the applications, I began using it only at night with cotton gloves, and so far so good.  </li>
      <li>I saw this at my local farmers market, decided to try it and fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>My 11 yr old daughter and I both love masking with this..grabbing popcorn and watching an episode of our fav show.</li>
      <li>I love supporting local businesses, especially when their products are this amazing!</li>
      <li>it smells a bit funky but it gets absorbed right into your skin so it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just happy that I finally found raw, organic beauty products that give amazing results.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>Only problem is my dog who I&#x27;m pretty sure has OCD, likes to lick it off my legs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an affordable, natural, cruelty free product.  </li>
      <li>I first started using Hemp360 Skin Repair about 3 weeks ago.  </li>
      <li>I so enjoy it&#x27;s texture not to mention how soft it makes my skin.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>I have followed the same routine for one week now and each morning my face is better than the day before.</li>
      <li>Broke my leg and the first time I put this lotion on over night it took a lot of the bruising and swelling out of my leg</li>
      <li>WOW!!!!</li>
      <li>This cream is very thick, has many high quality ingredients, and is certainly a good buy for the amount that you get.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Really works!</li>
    <li> Cleared up my red and painful face . Buy it it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. made pimples dissapear</li>
    <li> So far so good. We really like this product, it cleared up a skin rash on my husband&#x27;s face. We had tried ointments and cleansers from the dermatologist to no avail. It has also helped with the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms. It hasn&#x27;t cured it, but my skin is noticeably smoother. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, a little bit definitely goes a long way. I would say the consistency feels more like a grainy salve as opposed to a lotion, it takes a little bit of time to get used to. I will definitely reorder as needed.</li>
    <li> It did not stop the itching i get from psoriasis. I dont just have dry skin i have psoriasis, and most products dont work well for me. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> This is a serious product that heals dryness. I also recommend this: [...]  it&#x27;s a vegan scrub made from edible plant roots. It makes the skin glow glow glow!</li>
    <li> I have been using this, along with the other products from this company, for at least a year - maybe more. I am fortunate enough to live near their location and get to pick up what I need from the farmer&#x27;s market but I am happy to see they are on Amazon should I need to order online. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product on my face, after washing with the facial bar just before bed, I have seen a great improvement in my skin. (I also wash in the morning, followed by the facial moisturizer.) In my mid-30&#x27;s, I still get the occasional breakout and this helps keep those at bay. I once purchased a container of it that was very grainy. I re-read the ingredients and realized it was likely going to just take a little warming of the product. Sure enough, that fixed it and one container has lasted me at least 4 months. I use only a pea size amount as a little bit goes a very long way. I have also applied it to skin irritations (slight sunburn; dry hands from horse care) with great success.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Cleared up my daughter&#x27;s eczema on her legs after we tried literally every conventional and holistic thing on the market.  The other positive reviewers I agree with.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Awesome products. Cant wait to get mine in the mail! :)</li>
    <li> Broke my leg and the first time I put this lotion on over night it took a lot of the bruising and swelling out of my leg this was two weeks after I broke it I still use it about everyday to keep my leg moist and help with bruising! This is a great product</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to help my rosacea and nothing seems to work. I started to get the red bumps that look like acne on my nose and cheeks and had to do something so I gave this a try. Before bed I washed my face and put this on. It was a little gritty but that went away as I gently rubbed it on my face. It did remain a little greasy all night but not enough to bother me and not enough to leave grease stains on my pillow case even though I am a side sleeper. The scent is greenish but not very strong. In the morning I was delighted to see all of the red bumps greatly diminished (much to my surprise). I have followed the same routine for one week now and each morning my face is better than the day before. My face is now a pale pink with no bumps. I hope that this continues to work as I am so tired of trying to cover up the rosacea. I will post again as I continue to use this. It is now the end of May and I am soooooo happy with this product. My rosacea has finally been conquered so much that I don&#x27;t worry if I don&#x27;t put cover up on it right away. I can actually go out with just sunscreen on my face. I can&#x27;t believe it after so many years of suffering with it. I just Love this product.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT- I USE IT EVERYDAY ON MY FACE AS A MOISTURIZER. MY SISTER HAS USED IT ON HER PSORIASIS AND CELARED IT UP.  I HAVE TOLD SEVERAL FRIENDS ABOUT IT, AND THEY USE IT NOW.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff- use it all over- has helped with the damage I created by tanning in my youth. Feels great... Now my skin craves it - it feels dry without it. What a wonderful product- customer for life - : ))</li>
    <li> I am a 54 year old male that lives in Los Angeles. I get eczema on both of my arms that seems to be activated by sweat. I used to use a coal tar ointment and it helped for a while, but not lately, It&#x27;s been a hot and humid summer in Los Angeles, and I&#x27;m a pretty active guy. My doctor prescribed a steroid cream and it didn&#x27;t work. I was getting really frustrated, and the itching was driving me CRAZY. That&#x27;s when I read a bunch of reviews on Amazon about Hemp360 Skin Repair Raw Lotion. I received a jar and began to apply it every time I start to itch. Only 5 days later and my eczema is almost completely gone! This is truly an amazing product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I suffer from a very rare autoimmune disease called eosinophilic fascitiis.  It wreaks havoc on my skin, and this stabilized it when nothing a top dermatology department in Boston, Ma gave me could.  If you have simple common skin disorders I think you will be very happy with this.  My brother had eczema and this got rid of it over night.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mud! I so enjoy it&#x27;s texture not to mention how soft it makes my skin. I usually get a &amp;#34;you&#x27;re skin is glowing&amp;#34; comment after using it. My 11 yr old daughter and I both love masking with this..grabbing popcorn and watching an episode of our fav show. It&#x27;s just really good!</li>
    <li> great stuff!  helps a lot!  my acne has cleared up and helps with psoriasis</li>
    <li> I found this product in the farmers market down in Austin, TX. The lady who was there was super friendly and helpful. I enjoy using this product since I have such sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and body. At 64, my skin is so dry my face, neck and chest break out in hives without Skin Repair. I also use it in the evening to take off makeup. Massage in and wipe clean with a warm wash cloth.</li>
    <li> I first started using Hemp360 Skin Repair about 3 weeks ago.  I had eczema on my foot and had spent a fortune on products to relieve the itching and clear the redness.  After just one application of the skin repair lotion, I could see and feel the difference!  In a week and a half, the eczema had completely cleared up!  I started using it on my face and I am amazed at the result!  Almost immediately, I could see the difference around my eyes and in the overall look and feel of my skin!!  I am a true believer and only wish I had found your products sooner!  I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Although this lotion is too thick for daily wear, it is amazing and nourishing for my skin to wear as part of my nightly skin routine. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. This lotion has helped keep breakouts at bay.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible! It is a miracle remedy for eczema. My husband and kids have used it and it has literally wiped out their skin problems. I have tried a lot of natural products and this is number 1 for sure!!</li>
    <li> I saw this at my local farmers market, decided to try it and fell in love with it! I use it all over my body, its very nourishing and moisturizing. I love it after a day out in the sun, haven&#x27;t peeled yet!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I use this lotion at night on my face and everywhere else during the day. Penetrates deeper than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great Value! Hemp 360 Raw Skin Repair is like magic, in my opinion. I put is on my dog sore pads and it healed quickly. I put it on my dry knees and elbows before bedtime and it soften them quickly. It does not absorb quickly at all if that is a concern of yours. It feels great on my face at bedtime too. A little goes a LONG way... I got the Sample kit first and them purchase just this Skin Repair because I was so impressed.</li>
    <li> Doctors are taking note! I healed a completely separated heel with this wonderful stuff. I was told by a nurse that it wouldn&#x27;t work but after one use, overnight, I could see the skin coming together. Continued use for a few weeks softened the calloused skin and healed it totally. The surgeon and nurses wrote down the name of the product because they were amazed at what it did. We avoided surgery! I also use it on my 91 year old mother and her skin looks great! Never have I found a better moisturizer and I learned what the skin will do for itself if nourished properly. Love it! Only problem is my dog who I&#x27;m pretty sure has OCD, likes to lick it off my legs. I think he would eat a whole jar if he could.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! I have been using this for a couple months now and absolutely love what it has don&#x27;t for my skin !!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 2 years and will not change anytime soon, I have noticed a complete difference to my face I used to use a very well know brand moisturizer for years, but have since stopped altogether and been using this product. Had a very bad rash/itch on my shin Doctor told me to use olive oil or whatever I had did and didn&#x27;t work, started using this product gone in one week and has never come back!  I&#x27;m sold on this stuff and will never change!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Though it is more thick like a body butter, but it awesome.  I have applied to ALL areas of my body when they feel irritated and it has worked wonders.  I apply it to my face a few times a week to keep it from getting dry during the winter months.  Would for sure recommend this to anyone that is looking for a really good moisturizer....especially for heels and elbows too.  Overall great product.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is super awesome. Extremely raw and organic, also cruelty free and I really like the smell. I have eczema and it works awesome on my skin</li>
    <li> Great Lotion! I had a little psoriasis under my eyes and around my nose. I used it for about a week and the psoriasis was almost gone. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> So I was told to try a creme with vitamin K for the redness in my face. I had came across this and read the reviews about how well it worked with Rosacea and I thought yeah that&#x27;s what I need. Well the lotion does go a long way and leaves the skin smooth but has zero affect on the redness. I tried it for 2 months and its no better than it was when I started. Glad it worked for some but it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> I was receiving hormone treatment and it gave my face patchy areas of dry rough skin.  Mostly around the mouth.  I had already been using the wonderful soaps, lemongrass being my favorite when I decided to try the lotions.  I was able to afford all of them being that they are also very reasonable on the price.  So I tried the Skin Repair Lotion on my face.  I was amazed at the results in a day.  I was excited and started using it as a day and night moisturizer.  My skin healed within a week and had a glow after the second.  I was even asked if I was pregnant.  Really!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough on these products.  I&#x27;m just happy that I finally found raw, organic beauty products that give amazing results. As the saying goes, &amp;#34;if you can&#x27;t eat it, don&#x27;t put it on your skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> this is amazing stuff, love it, will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Coach Carla&lt;br /&gt;www.feelingrevived.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hemp Skin Repair for a few months now, and while it does moisturize quite well  it has not &amp;#34;reversed&amp;#34; my mild dermatitis or reduced minor swelling from the accompanying agitation. While disappointed with that, I would recommend trying it nonetheless. This cream is very thick, has many high quality ingredients, and is certainly a good buy for the amount that you get. Deducting 2 stars only because it didn&#x27;t fulfill my intended use.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have Rosacea .  I have been using this for 6wks now, and I have to admit, it is working.....I can see a definite improvement on my face (cheek area)...I am now starting it on my spider veins on my thighs....I&#x27;m hooked....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year now, and I just found another use for this wonderful Hemp....Cold-sores............yep, as soon as my lip starts to tingle like the beginnings of a cold sore, I put this on, and twice now,  it has prevented a sore from ballooning up!  I emptied out a lip tube and filled that baby up with this gem!  If you suffer from cold sores....use this stuff...it works for me!</li>
    <li> love this stuff!! it smells a bit funky but it gets absorbed right into your skin so it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I usually get terrible razor burn and i used some of this after i shaved and nothing!!! it was awesome.  a little does go a long way though.  i also get terrible dry skin around my mouth from retain-a and again...nothing after using this stuff.  its a god send. love love love.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for Psoriasis, used it religiously for over a month and saw no results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for irritated and dry skin.  I used to use Mary Kay for years and stopped when I got educated about all the chemicals, etc.  I&#x27;ve been searching for an affordable, natural, cruelty free product.  This moisturizer is amazing.  I use it on rough patches and dry hands as well as my face.  It absorbs completely and keeps my skin hydrated. It feels so rich, and a tiny bit goes a LONG way.  One of the loveliest luxuries I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Repair Lotion for about a year.  It worked great on my son&#x27;s eczema and I use it to stop the chafing we get from swimming at the beach.  And you can&#x27;t beat it as a year-round moisturizer.  It&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way, but there are so many applications.  Thanks, HEMP360, for making such a terrific product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year! I use it on my face at night, on sunburn, and for an all over perfect moisturizer! I have even used it on my hair for a deep leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Oh, my, this lotion is just amazing! From the first day that I applied it to my face, I could see the rosacea calming down. I have been wearing it for 4 days straight, and already I can feel and SEE a difference. I decided to also apply it to my 3 year old. He suffers from a very itchy form of Eczema. His arms and legs are always full of scratch marks from where he is scratching so hard. The same day we received it, we applied it to his arms and legs. WOW!!!! Seriously, He is no longer itching and for the first time in a LONG time, he isn&#x27;t scratching! This lotion is Godsent.&lt;br /&gt;They are not kidding when they say a little goes a long way. I use a pea size scoop for my face and neck and about a nickel size scoop for each of my son&#x27;s legs. I am sold on this miracle lotion and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Just a little goes a long way and it just melts into you skin.  I&#x27;m beginning to use it daily on my cuticles as I do a lot of garden work and it&#x27;s making my hands look like I do nothing all day!</li>
    <li> Update:  I bought my second jar of Hemp360 because it does what its makers say it does.  It&#x27;s completely abated the problem I was having with psoriasis on my hands.  First I used it multiple times a day and the healing began.  When it had progressed well enough I felt I could safely reduce the applications, I began using it only at night with cotton gloves, and so far so good.  The bad breakouts of swelling, callouses, and pain are now a thing of the past.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone tired seeing doctors who prescribe steroids repeatedly and have no idea what is happening to their patient&#x27;s skin.  I&#x27;d also recommend once you have used it and are satisfied, see your doctor and take a jar of Hemp360 with you. Show him/her what an effective medicine looks like.  A good doctor will thank you and pass the good news on to his/her other patients. ~~~ Only been using this product for 2 days - psoriasis on fingers, very painful - and already the redness, swelling, and callusing are reduced such that my hands look near normal for the first time in three months.</li>
    <li> This works great! I used it when I broke out in hives and was really itchy. It stopped the itching and my hives were gone when I woke up!</li>
    <li> It softens my skin and helps improve my complexion .</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive so i was nervous when ordering this but ive been using it about a week and a half now and it is amazing! It obsorbs into your skin and makes your skin feel instantly better, sort of oily but perfect to put in before bed.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin, and I assumed a lotion that looks as thick as this one would be horrible for me. But, the sales representative at my local farmer&#x27;s market assured me it would work well for my skin type. I am SO glad I believed her and bought a tub. I ended up getting the sample size in with an acne-prone skin set, and I could not be happier with my purchase. I recently suffered a bought of hives brought on by some unknown allergic reaction, and this is the only stuff that will stop the itching, other than over the counter anti-histamines that make me sleep all day. I just wish I had put it on before I went to the emergency room for the hives! I could have saved a good amount of money. This lotion is in a whole other universe than any other skin product I have used before. I hope they always continue making it. I love supporting local businesses, especially when their products are this amazing!</li>
    <li> Ok I put this stuff on my hands elbows and feet the other night and in just a few hours, my skin felt like NEW! On the real, this stuff does NOT smell so great. But its not awful by any means..just natural I suppose. I could see this stuff being my new wonder balm! Hands, feet, cuticles, lip balm, dry skin spots, elbows, knees, heels, tips of your hair. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  I know it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; lotion, but the texture was very grainy and as much as I want fragrance-free products, I did not like the smell of this product.  Also, it felt very heavy and greasy on my hands and then I started to feel some irritation from the product.  I&#x27;m happy to see that it has helped many other people, but I&#x27;m not a fan.  I&#x27;m giving two stars for effort.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My daughter got me this lotion to apply to the areas of my skin that were treated with radiation. It&#x27;s very soothing and helped with the cracked skin surface and itching.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this multitasking product, thanks!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Hemp 360 has other organic ingredients in it that caused skin irritation, so I don&#x27;t use it for the purpose I purchased it, but on other areas of my body and it works very well.</li>
