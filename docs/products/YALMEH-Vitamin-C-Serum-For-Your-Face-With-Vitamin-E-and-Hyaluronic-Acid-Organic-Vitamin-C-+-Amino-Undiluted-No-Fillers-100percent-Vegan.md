<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This specific serum has absolutely no scent to it. This is a great feature for any one who hates scented products. Once applied, the serum absorbs into the skin very quickly and once dry my face wasn&#x27;t left with a sticky or oily feeling. The serum leaves the skin feeling refreshed and could be used alone although I like to follow all serums with a decent moisturizer. I do wish the serum was a little thicker but that&#x27;s just my personal preference. I have a hard time controlling products that are on the thinner side.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, this serum does add some moisture back into my skin. I suffer from dry skin and since adding products like this one to my routine I can honestly say I no longer have that problem (at least not on my face). My face hasn&#x27;t felt as soft as it does now since I was a little girl. A serum like this one is most definitely a great addition to your skin care regimen no matter what your age. It is never too early to begin preparing for your future. While I did receive a complimentary product for testing purposes, all my opinions are always completely honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin. Helps boost your skin and makes it brighter</li>
    <li> I am trying to do the best I can with what I&#x27;ve got!  This is my first purchase and so far so good.  I only use 2 drops as the serum goes a long way.  I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I do rely on reviews to make decisions when purchasing many products. Which is why I felt it necessary to share my own personal experience with this product. It is an awesome serum. It delivers everything that it promises. My skin began to brighten, and did not appear as dull. It did not leave my face tight or dry. What&#x27;s really funny (not so much) is that I ran out, and prior to... had ordered a different hyaluronic acid with raving reviews. To my dissatisfaction, it did nothing for my skin, and my skin was back to ground zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, needless to say... I have reordered the Yalmeh brand and will definitely reorder again and again!!! If your skin has lost it glow, or... if like me you suffer from occasional acne breakouts, this serum is great for lightening acne scars and smoothing out your skins texture and tone. As well, tea tree cleansers are a great product to use to fight the breakouts.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t  see any difference...</li>
    <li> I think these products are good,.. but nothing spectacular. I did not see any real changes or improvements. Fast shipping, and great customer follow-up though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for several weeks now. I have noticed a difference in the firmness of my throat and jaw line and my skin feels softer. I have also been using the Vitamin C Moisturizer which I love. So, I don&#x27;t know if it is this product alone or the combination of both. Reviews can sometimes be deceiving since it is most certain that if someone goes from using no products to starting a regimen like this there would be a noticeable change. I have been using Mary Kay and Bio Elements for quite sometime and wanted to try something new. I am very impressed that I have seen a difference already!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any change. I&#x27;ll try it one more month. Maybe I need a miracle. Peg</li>
    <li> So far haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference but I am still using it  We will see in another month if I see some difference in my skin</li>
    <li> So far So good. Ive been using for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I use it until the last drop! NOTHING!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serums from various sources and this one is noticeably better than most in my opinion. Really hydrates and gives my face a natural(?) looking glow/sheen. I moisturize after with either &amp;#34;Yalmeh&amp;#34; &amp;#34;day/night cream&amp;#34; or the new &amp;#34;Yalmeh&amp;#34; lotion I can&#x27;t remember the name of just now, depending.........</li>
    <li> I love this product make my skin even tone ,bright .I highly recommend...</li>
    <li> Just started using this and can only say at this time that it is very light and easy to apply. I&#x27;m looking forward to great results based on the ingredients! And it&#x27;s made in America!!! Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little more than a week now and I have noticed a little difference in how my skin feels and looks. Easy to use and dries quickly so you can apply a moisturizer without waiting long.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I noticed a change in my skin within 3 weeks.... i actually use this whole product line and I&#x27;m completely happy! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a good review. It feels good going on. I&#x27;m sure the long term effect will be good.  I&#x27;m about 3 weeks invested and i&#x27;m64 and I do see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good Vitamin C serum for a while that is a serum, that Vitamin C is listed on as its 5 main ingredients - (some other products advertise on their label as Vitamin C but then it&#x27;s listed in the ingredients WAY near the bottom of the list), didn&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; a leg and will soak into the skin - not lay on top then you feel like it&#x27;s a mask. This product didn&#x27;t disappoint especially for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the way my skin just soaks it up and it does feel really nice although I do wish it was a bit thicker. Nice VERY LIGHT scent which I appreciate since I hate using a product on my face and the scent is so overbearing no matter how little I may use its scent molecules are STUCK up my nose and that&#x27;s all I smell the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars but I am waiting to see how it works in the long run. So far so good...!</li>
    <li> Yalmeh makes a line of high quality, great working products and their Vitamin C Serum is of no exception! I use it morning and night after washing and toning my face and it has really made a difference. My skin is more radiant and clear and I have seen where it has brightened my face and evened my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about three days I started to see a real difference in my face. Sun marks I had gotten in the face virtually disappeared as did some old scars I got as a kid/teen. It claims it will clear the free radicals in the skin and it really keeps it&#x27;s word. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I absolutely love that this serum is gluten free and vegan friendly, so it&#x27;s great for just about anyone. I am excited to see how well it works in a few years when generally wrinkles will start to appear. (or not I hope!) It is effective and affordable and I plan to use this serum for years to come!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, reasonable pricing, inbelievably good follow up by company!  Highly recommend this product. I am 69 years old with significant sun damaged skin. I&#x27;ve used Yalmeh Serum C for 2 weeks; results are very subtle but apparent already. I ordered a bottle for my 49 yr old daughter also--so far, so good!  Try this; it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love, love how this Vit. C serum feels on my face.  I can definitely tell the difference after using it more than a week!  I really love it!  Go ahead and try it.  You&#x27;ll love thus serum and you will be able to tell the difference on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very good vitamin C serum. I have been using this for almost 2 months and I am pleased w/ the results. My complexion is smooth, firm and bright. I use it on my face, neck and chest aftershower when my skin is still a bit damp. I drop as small an amount as I think I can get away with.  I used a little more when I first began using it, but now use less because i use daily so don&#x27;t need as much. great.</li>
    <li> I had allergy reaction.</li>
    <li> I have used a ton of Vitamin c serums and they usually feel pretty similar. This is a pretty good one. It doesn&#x27;t have any weird chemical smells and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky or stiff. I haven&#x27;t used it too long so I will update this in 3 or 4 weeks once the bottle is done to assess if there is a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you.  It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. My wife got rid of a wart with Vitamin C Serum. She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it. She&#x27;s had it so long, she has no idea where she got it in the first place. Vitamin C Serum is doing wonders for her skin. I&#x27;m wondering if it works on boils, which I am going to try today to see what the results will be. This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned. It won&#x27;t make you younger, but it will make your skin look younger. Update-Day two of using Vitamin C Serum on my two boils&#x3D;the pain is gone and some of the swelling has stopped. I will continue to use it to see if this product will actually take boils away. This product is easy to use and if doesn&#x27;t work, you get your money back, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Its a good serum. It&#x27;s very refreshing and good moisturizer. I like how it feels. I&#x27;m so pleased with this vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Excellent and really great on my face. I been using this for a 3 weeks now and looking forward to reorder:-)</li>
    <li> I like it, prefer the smell over skinceuticals, makes my face feel a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> After applying it... after few minutes, my skin is too dry but I&#x27;ll still use it and just use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty Sam for the money out there my son who is 37 years old in one week has noticed traffic improvements in my skin and I am 58 years old he wants me to order him some I&#x27;ve tried many Sam&#x27;s but this one is definitely a keeper the night cream is not as expected I would wish it was more moisturizing it seems to be a little drying but I highly recommend the serum</li>
    <li> Love this one. Noticed the difference in my skin texture. Good stuff.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! I really love it. Also very fast and neat delivery.</li>
    <li> All the ingredients is great for your face, keeps it somewhat tight...</li>
    <li> This is the best serum!  After applying to my face, neck and chest, I&#x27;ve added the remaining to the tops of my hands.  The age spots on my hands are diminishing!  The other day, I was at a bingo game with my 34 year old daughter, and she was introducing me to some of the women there, they were so surprised to find out I was her mom!  I was smiling ear to ear!  Yalmeh is a great product.  I apply the Yalmeh Serum first, wait for it to dry, then apply the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since mid January and I have not noticed any difference in my skin or the tone of my skin. I was really hoping that this would work as advertised or at least as some people reviewed it. This is why I waited so long to write my review because I wanted to give it all the time. Did absolutely NOTHING for me.</li>
    <li> Tightens my skin without drying it, and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use in combination with my favorite face moisturizers and it seems to do a good job of keeping my skin soft and maybe helps the wrinkles some.</li>
    <li> Yalmeh sent me some of their Vitamin C Serum to test out for my blog, GlamRiver so I have been using it for a few weeks now.  Not only has it helped lighten up a few of my dark spots but it has also helped diminish the look of some of my fine lines.  My skin also feels much more hydrated!  Great product that I can recommend to all of my readers!!  Thanks Yalmeh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be 31 in just a few short weeks! AH!! Of course, I&#x27;m looking for ways to reduce the aging process... I have found that adding a vitamin C serum to my daily skin routine, like Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum, is instrumental.  I used this serum for nearly a month every morning and my skin felt so great afterwards. I always layer it with a moisturizer on top, so that the stickiness goes away. I love it! I received this promotionally for review. All opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the texture of this product and how healthy my skin look throughout the day.  I use mine as a night time regimen with the Moisturizer by Yalmeh.  I also use the eye product with aloe vera.  My lifetime products forever.  Please never stop making these for people that love to pamper and take care of the skin.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoyed this product and will continue to use it until it is gone. It is used third in a routine-line of facial products from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, the smoothness, and the wonderful smell of oranges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn my face, my face does not get warm, nor does it break out from this product. I use it on my face, neck chest, shoulders, backs of my hands and tops of my arms (where the sun hits them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: A+</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an anti aging serum that heals and reduces wrinkles, this is the eye care product for you. That is actually the best thing about Yalmeh’s vitamin C and E serum. This eye product actually improves your appearance, as it heals your skin and in the process, improves your overall skin health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many women, or men, who might have sun spots they want removed, this is the product for you, this will refine your skins texture and if you are like me and not a fan of anything gluten, this anti-aging eye serum is gluten free too. This also has no filers, is plant based and not tested on animals. Oh, and if you would prefer to buy American made products, like I do, this eye serum is Made in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always nice to find that perfect anti-aging eye serum product you can use forever and know what the ingredients are, how it was made and where it was made.</li>
    <li> This is the second Yalmeh product I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use. I will say that using this serum with the Yalmeh Phytoceramides really increased the effectiveness of both products. They work exceptionally well together. My skin looks much younger and I&#x27;ve even started to go without foundation for the first time in years! Remember Yalmeh doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so it&#x27;s not only a good product, it&#x27;s a feel-good product.</li>
    <li> i wrote to you once before.  i do not kinow if you receivced my e-mail.  i was VERY impressed that you would e-mail me directly.  I am very happy with your product.  i will continue to use it and i wish nothing but total success for you and your company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now, and my skin has noticeably changed for the better.  Within two days, my skin was already feeling smoother and looking better.  I noticed my skin tone looked better. I didn&#x27;t have any blemishes (got one recently but that&#x27;s a hormonal issue).  I can&#x27;t say I noticed the disappearance of lines and wrinkles but I have only used this a couple of weeks. I love the feel of this product on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to work into my face and neck. I had good skin before this product, but I seem to have even better skin now. Certainly the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is a reallly nice Vitamin C &amp; E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid. My skin really liked this product, it feels nice on the skin, it has improved my skin texture and has helped to diminish my fine lines. I have a full review on http://beautybymitchypoo.com</li>
    <li> This serum does seem to make my skin smoother to the touch and it is non-irritating. I have been using it for about a month and have yet to notice any decrease in dark spots, under eye circles etc...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change but this does make my face feel soft and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> Face feels good after application.  Not certain yet if it&#x27;s assisting with age spots or wrinkles.  May need to use it longer than 2-3 wks. to tell.</li>
    <li> I like this Vitamin C Serum. I have recently  (ok.. the last almost 6 months) have been reviewing a lot of serums and skincare. I like this one. It&#x27;s not thick or heavy. It&#x27;s light and glides easily over the skin. Quickly absorbed. My skin is looking better. The color &amp; texture is a bit better. It does take a while. It never happens over night (unless it&#x27;s overnight  with more time commitment.. like 2-3 months) . Realize that skin turns over every 28 days. This serum will help speed up the turnover rate which is a plus particularly if you are looking to regain texture and color, removed or clear acne scars.  It will take a while but in the end you will start noticing some changes and  you should keep using it.&lt;br /&gt; Nice product. Good bottle (darker brown to prevent oxidation&gt; Do close it tightly! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for skincare this quickly. I like to see some additional improvement. They asked me to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.. I bought this product for myself. I was not given any gratis product for the review. That said, I would not do any review differently. I have been doing beauty reviews for over 15 years online: my  reputation is important and if it&#x27;s not a good product I would say so. For the  ingredients in this product and the price tag, this product is a seriously good deal</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t break out from this!!!  I have used several other brands and I seem to break out from many of them. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t tell too much yet. I use Retin-A on a regular basis and my skin already has pretty good texture so I may not see too many results but I like the fact I am putting on antioxidants.  There is no burning or tingling (is that good or bad?).  Yalmeh has very good customer service.  I ordered 2 bottles and they came broken.  They sent me 2 more the next day!</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for a few weeks and there is a definite improved difference in the texture of my skin.  Fine wrinkles have filled in which makes me look and feel better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> A very good product , thanks very much for the good quality and a very good customer service :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for a few weeks to review this serum, as I wanted to see if it truly made a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m happy to report that after about 3 weeks use, mostly just applying it once a day, I can see a difference in my skin. My skin not only feels smoother and firmer, but it looks better. My facial coloring is more even and the texture of it is better.&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;m editing my review simply to add that I have sensitive skin and this has not bothered it at all.</li>
    <li> This company has amazing products. I am currently using two of their moisturizers and this serum. I noticed some good results after 2 weeks. Not a miracle cream but defiantly an improvement in my skins appearance and texture for sure. I am looking forward to seeing what longer time use will bring. T</li>
    <li> I love all of my Yalmeh products! They take such care in what they do that it is really easy to trust them. My current fave is their Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum, probably because it is so useful! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to  expect from this product, but it ended up having a lot to offer;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum makes my skin really, really, really soft because it contains the highest form of active available Vitamin C and E as well as hyaluronic acid to encourage softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My skintone has evened out with Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum because it fades sun spots and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I LoVe getting carded all the time because now with the reduction of lines and wrinkles, including micro wrinkles, on my face and neck Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum has made me look years younger! I&#x27;m confident it will help to prevent wrinkle formation in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my first contact with Yalmeh products was through a sample I loved it so much I agreed to write a review about it. In fact, I love their products so mu that I will be a life-long cusomer now. The best thing about Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum is that does not just make improvement, it also defends your beauty against time! This combination of health and beauty is unstoppable!</li>
    <li> Not sure why? But my chin area had stayed broken out since day using product. Used it for one for week now. Will discontinue using. And see if my face clears up.in a few days.will due a followup review in a wk</li>
    <li> This product seem to do what it advertised. very good&lt;br /&gt;BJ</li>
    <li> Will not buy again, it is sticky and it feels like you have a film of plastic over your face..Don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> This serum is a part of my daily skincare regimen, as it works wonders on my dry and sensitive skin. I love its anti aging properties as well and the results that I get from using this product has got me hooked! I am in my mid-thirties and I want to take care of my skin as best as I can, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about fine lines and wrinkles any time soon. So far, using this serum has been working like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services that I use personally and believe will be good for consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I am currently in love with my Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum! Since lately these serums have become a new addition for me, I use them in the morning after my shower, through out the day and I reapply right before bed. Its amazing how good my skin feels after each use and even more encouraging knowing that I&#x27;m reinforcing my skin with an anti aging skin care product. Plus its packed with an added bonus, &amp;#34;Vitamin C!&amp;#34; Besides if you just read the list of benefits from using the Yalmeh Vitamin C Serum you&#x27;d fall in love with this product too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Plant based ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Pure, no fillers&lt;br /&gt;-Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;-Vegan&lt;br /&gt;-Made in the U.S.A&lt;br /&gt;-FDA Registered&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;-Hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;-Fades sun spots and discoloration&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces future wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Creates smooth, supple and glowing skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this product is amazing it does so much for your skin by improving your appearance and protecting your skin from future damage!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and works with the lotion and cleanser even better.</li>
    <li> I will not purchase this product again. Did nothing it was like putting water on my face.</li>
    <li> Works on wrinkles good but only temporarily</li>
    <li> I just use everyday because I believe it works.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and it will really show a difference in your skin. You won&#x27;t have to use much but make sure your generously apply it to your face and neck. This is made with the best ingredients and comes from a wonderful company! Pair with Yalmeh&#x27;s moisturizing cream and you&#x27;ve got the best combination since peanut butter and jelly!</li>
