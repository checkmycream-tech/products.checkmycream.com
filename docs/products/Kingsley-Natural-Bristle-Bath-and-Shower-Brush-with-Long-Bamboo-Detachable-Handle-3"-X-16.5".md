      <li>The handle length is great, and the bristles sturdy.</li>
      <li>It does feel great in use.</li>
      <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if the handle were a good bit longer, and curved toward the bristles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure It would work great as a shower brush</li>

      <li>I love this brush!</li>
      <li>Nice brush.  </li>
      <li>The brush comes off and can be used without the handle, which is nice.</li>

      <li>I also love that the handle is detachable.</li>
      <li>Outstanding customer service.</li>
      <li>I love it it doesn&#x27;t rotten for being in the shower</li>
      <li>TOO EASILY....</li>
      <li>The detachable handle makes getting every area with the brush easy and no stress on your arms to do it.</li>
      <li>Unless you enjoy splinters, don&#x27;t try to remove the handle or use the strap.</li>
      <li>It was great while it lasted, particularly as a hand-held body brush.</li>
      <li>but the brush still has what looks like a full compliment of bristles</li>

      <li>BUT IT COMES LOOSE FROM THE HANDLE VERY EASILY...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last forever but for the time it does,&lt;br /&gt;it works just fine.</li>
      <li>seller shipped so fast,  I received the brush in 2 days from order.</li>
      <li>The bristles are uniformly cut and dense and work very well to exfoliate the skin.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient that the brush head can be removed from the handle.</li>
      <li>The handle could be a good six to eight inches longer, and a curve would help less flexible folks reach the middle of their back with this brush.</li>
      <li>Bristles haven&#x27;t shed far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but for the money it is a good value.</li>
      <li>It slides right back in place though, and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
      <li>and it helps getting the hard places to clean like my back</li>

    <li> Bristles were smashed........still works</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a hand held bath brush. I wasn&#x27;t sure if ordering one would be a good idea, but he is satisfied with the quality and happy it has a removable handle.  He has used it several weeks and it seems to be holding up well for the price I paid. Can&#x27;t be a good bargin! I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another for myself.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Stays on the handle when you want it too, even under brisk brushing.  Bristles haven&#x27;t shed far as I can tell.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but for the money it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for dry brushing as well as in the shower for a week. My last brush came apart, so hopefully this holds together well. I do feel like the bristles are a bit rough. Overall the size and shape is nice though.</li>
    <li> Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought that the brush was supposed to detach so you could use the strap over your hand without the long handle. If it is detachable, I will need &amp;#34;superman&amp;#34; to come detach it for me. I have tried til I thought I would pull a muscle somewhere. The only thing left would be to use a flat head screwdriver and a hammer..... and that I refuse to do!!</li>
    <li> I like THE BRUSH BUT IT COMES LOOSE FROM THE HANDLE VERY EASILY...TOO EASILY....IT FALLS OFF A LOT. EVEN WHEN ITS JUST HANGING THERE....MAYBE WE HAVE A DEFECTIVE ONE :(....</li>
    <li> The handle could be a good six to eight inches longer, and a curve would help less flexible folks reach the middle of their back with this brush. The bristles have been coming out after just a couple of weeks but the brush still has what looks like a full compliment of bristles so maybe these were just loose/clippings from the manufacturing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up having to superglue the brush to the handle because it kept slipping out if I applied any pressure at all. But a few drops of superglue have done the trick and it&#x27;s usable now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if the handle were a good bit longer, and curved toward the bristles. Otherwise, does the job.</li>
    <li> two chunks of bristles fell off in the first usage.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s just the brush head cracked after one use, so it slips off of the handle everytime now. Oh well, I only paid 5 bucks for it, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Unless you enjoy splinters, don&#x27;t try to remove the handle or use the strap.</li>
    <li> Just like the one I used as a kid. Handle fer reaching those head placed and handle comes off to make a hand brush.  Outstanding customer service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to use for a dry brushing skin care regimen. The handle length is great, and the bristles sturdy. It does feel great in use. The brush comes off and can be used without the handle, which is nice. Fits great in the hand. Only downside is that the brush occasionally comes loose from the handle and will fall off. It slides right back in place though, and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
    <li> great brush...use it every day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this brush several times. It doesn&#x27;t last forever but for the time it does,&lt;br /&gt;it works just fine. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the money. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to scrub their&lt;br /&gt;back in the shower!</li>
    <li> Seems lightweight, but for the price a value!</li>
    <li> The brush has been great for lymphatic massage. I found that even with my limited mobility, I did not need the handle.</li>
    <li> Bristles a bit stiff and handle could be a little longer.</li>
    <li> I love it it doesn&#x27;t rotten for being in the shower and it helps getting the hard places to clean like my back and it helps really get rid of dead skin and dirt</li>
    <li> Works beautifully and gets the job done. The detachable handle makes getting every area with the brush easy and no stress on your arms to do it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for aruveydic dry brushing. It is perfect! The quality is excellent. It is very convenient that the brush head can be removed from the handle. The bristles are uniformly cut and dense and work very well to exfoliate the skin. It is everything I wanted and expected of this brush. I&#x27;m sure It would work great as a shower brush also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped so fast,  I received the brush in 2 days from order.</li>
    <li> Bristles seem to rot too quickly. It was great while it lasted, particularly as a hand-held body brush.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I also love that the handle is detachable.</li>
    <li> Head of brush comes off very easily. Other than that, it works well.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush and, unlike the last brush I had, the handle has remained attached to the brush.</li>
    <li> Almost as a back scratch from my wife.  Almost.</li>
