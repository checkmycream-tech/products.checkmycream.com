<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My toes have started to get mishapened and crooked because of arthritis. This causes them to hurt.  I have found by straightening them with these spacers helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these on several occasions and they always arrive quickly and well packaged.  They are very effective in restoring the distribution of pressure onto the toes from the side of the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work very well.</li>
    <li> I have a bunion on one foot and there are some shoes that I absolutely cannot wear (without a great deal of pain) without use of a toe spreader.  These little miracles straighten my big toe somewhat and I can wear any shoe comfortably.  Note though:  I don&#x27;t wear high heels, so don&#x27;t know if these would help in that case.</li>
    <li> So helpful, and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> my husband foujnd these to be pliable and gently on his feet while skiing and recommends these over any other brand</li>
    <li> pretty good. fall off wh</li>
    <li> After surgery on 2 tendons due to an accidental cut in my right foot, my tendons wound up shortened, and my big toe wound up angled in toward the second toe.  I&#x27;ve worn one of these to separate the two toes for close to a year now, preventing a resulting bunion from going any further (a little too late - another case of a doctor&#x27;s failure to follow up or inform), and also relieving the strained feeling I had in several parts of my foot.</li>
    <li> these did not wok for me.  I have a toe that is repositioning itself into the dreaded hammertoe (third toe), but these gel inserts were not firm enough to hold the toe in place.</li>
    <li> Just slipped right between my toes unless I had shoes on.  Preferred to buy one that wrapped around my toe for more security.</li>
    <li> Good. The gel is very comfortable. Wash clean with just water each night. I wish they were a little more substantial around the middle, but that may be a personal preference.</li>
    <li> This product may work fine for someone else, but it was too moist and kept my toe from healing</li>
    <li> PERFECT! Just as described</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for using between the big toe and second toe, and you&#x27;ll never know it is there.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The product and the quick delivery were excellent as always.</li>
    <li> One end has a crease in it. I have found that if you place the creased end down when you insert this between the toes, after a while that end can fold at the crease, allowing the spreader to come out during rigorous exercise. So, I have recently been placing the creased end up, and have not had any further problems with it staying in place.&lt;br /&gt;These are great, BTW.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great service.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wearing dress shoes that squeezed my toes together!  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> My only wish is that these would be firmer.  I have one I got from a store that I like better for this reason</li>
    <li> nice and soft and feels fine between toes - stays in place with a sock over my foot</li>
    <li> works well and feels comfortable</li>
    <li> These toe spacers are great, very comfortable and stay put undery shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to a bunion sufferer any day!</li>
    <li> Helps me with the pain in my bunion</li>
    <li> Very helpful. I only use 2 of them for 1 foot. I got the large size, I wear a size 9 woman&#x27;s shoe, &amp; use it for the big toe &amp; toe next to it. I use it inside loose fitting shoes during the day.</li>
    <li> I have not tried all the different permutations of toe separators, but I was completely knocked out of closed toe shoes by Morton&#x27;s Neuroma.  Couldn&#x27;t do anything athletic with shoes on.  Started gaining weight.  Now I am back on my bike, just went skiing, and am thinking about soccer and running again but haven&#x27;t quite ventured there.  But I was heading for surgery until these little miracle workers showed up.  Amazing difference.</li>
    <li> these are small enough to wear in my shoes&lt;br /&gt;so small they can easily be lost though&lt;br /&gt;gel is very soft</li>
    <li> Nice and comfortable.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST to try if you&#x27;re developing bunions and want to veer away from medical/surgical intervention as long as possible.</li>
    <li> Just What The Doctor Ordered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the exact ones that my surgeon provided......almost instant relief of bunion pain...excellent product</li>
    <li> simple... they work!! I am on my feet with these lovely bunions sometimes 12-14hr days. If it weren&#x27;t for the toe separators I would be in even more pain</li>
    <li> These are useful in a  daily regimen  but can easily be misplaced so i am looking further for a better tool</li>
    <li> These are absolutely useless and they do not stay in place. Do yourself a favor and save your money for a better product.</li>
    <li> I would prefer a choice of sizes, which you have offered in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Keep an eye on them, since they&#x27;re clear they can &#x27;disappear.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great product but are all the same size....which the description says but is not what the picture shows.  I was expecting 4 different sizes and unfortunately the medium is too big.  I have a size 12 foot but need the spacer between my 3rd and 4th toes.</li>
    <li> They seemed perfect, but when I wore them, they slipped out of place .  I even tried them with knee hi stockings thinking that would help, but it didn&#x27;t , so I am not able to use them</li>
    <li> These worked well.  Quite comfortable.  Stayed in place with socks on.  Gave one to a relative with crossover toe.</li>
    <li> 4 for the price of one! They&#x27;re soft and feel great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These things are a perfect fit. And they keep your toes separated and keep them from turning under. Very satisfied with this product and will purchase them again as needed</li>
    <li> I just got a bunion, bunion hurts, I used this. In 20 minutes pain went from 9 out 10 to 6 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;wore it between my toes while wearing socks over night. Pain went down to 2 out of 10. I will continue wearing over night.</li>
    <li> Soft, malleable, easy to put in and extract and they work(though I would like to see em a little thicker). Have helped with bunion and toe joint pain. I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m wearing em. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past so was well aware of its&#x27; effectiveness. Using these gel cushions makes it possible to walk without pain from my bunion. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now. I love them. They have totally help elevate my bunion pain. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I have bought other brands and they were not as comfortable as these... I can wear them in my shoes and don&#x27;t even feel them.</li>
    <li> These wok perfectly to keep my big toe from curling over my second toe.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month.  Immediately made my feet feel better. Too soon to tell if it is straightening my big toe</li>
    <li> Grea price, quality of the material see it right away from the moment you see outside from the package, it&#x27;s great price and fast deliver time.</li>
    <li> Since a bunion has pushed my big toe into the others, I am only comfortable walking using a toe spreader. It has  saved me from surgery.</li>
    <li> I had bunion surgery.  It helps me keep my big toes in alignment.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My daughters used to have this for their point/toe ballet shoes.  When my mother-in-law showed me her toe problems.  I ordered this for her to try for her toe problems.  She said they worked great but since it is clear color so she lost them all the time and can not find them.  I ordered 2 pair each time every couple of months.  I wish they make different colors.</li>
    <li> I got these to try and help alleviate the pain I experience from having a bunion. When I wear shoes I know are particularly irritating to it, I pop one of these in between my big and second toes.  I experience significantly less pain throughout the day when I&#x27;m wearing one of these and after a few minutes I don&#x27;t even notice its there.</li>
    <li> These things save my life! I got bunion surgery four years ago and whenever pain arises ,these things fix everything!</li>
    <li> These are a great product for those who have trouble with their toes overlapping.  I fine them to be very comfortable; you do not even know that you have them between your toes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for mom whose 2nd toe of her left foot just overlaps the big toe because of the bunion that she rarely wears an open toe sandal or shoe. I wanted to get my mom something to help her condition without using some kind of contraption. Yet, my mom has to use at least 2 of these toe spreader. to even slightly keep the toe in place.</li>
    <li> too big for my toes and hurts when I wear it</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I was very unimpressed with these.  Packaging was fine, shipping was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a foot or toe health guru. A month ago I saw that my 4 non-big-toes on each foot were slightly bent away from my big toes. So I wanted to try these to see if I could put some stress on them to &amp;#34;straighten them out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-pack contains 4 items of exactly the same size.  From the picture, or perhaps from my imagination, I thought the 4 would be of varying sizes, as the space between your 2 smallest toes doesn&#x27;t require as big of a spacer than say the space between your big and 2nd biggest toes. So I was somewhat disappointed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toe spacers fit OK in socks. They are made of some rubber-like material, somewhat firm but squishy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the first 2 days and haven&#x27;t touched them since.  Don&#x27;t feel like they are doing the trick for me.</li>
    <li> Just great  for foot comfort. I&#x27;ll order these again when my foot pain acts up. And, they don&#x27;t seem to wear out!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what my foot doctor recommended after surgery.  They work great and I really miss them when I forget to wear them.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Wife says: Will buy again</li>
    <li> Make walking less painful.  I love these.</li>
    <li> They do what I need them to do.  Each pair lasts a few months and they are as comfortable as they can be - so chaffing and no marks.</li>
    <li> This product works well but after wearing it about 10 times I&#x27;m not yet sure how long it will last as it appears as if the edges are already fraying a bit.</li>
    <li> Really comfy and I think it&#x27;s going to be effective.  These are a lot softer than I imagined.  After wearing them for some time, that&#x27;s exactly what you want.  The change should be gradual and the spreaders should be comfortable enough that you don&#x27;t mind having them in all day.  Highly recommended to anyone who has toe issues.</li>
    <li> I bought these to help with a bunion arthritis pain.  They have been a tremendous help.  I have much less pain in my foot at the end of a day wearing them.</li>
    <li> OK - why hasn&#x27;t your podiatrist or PT or knee surgeon or whatever told you about this product? Because they can&#x27;t make any $$ on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago my Vietnamese manicurist told me to get these because my 2nd toe was crossing over my big toe on both feet. (She also told me to wear shoes with a bigger toe box.) At the time I had a lot of knee pain - to the extent that I had to take a cane when we went on vacation. I tried one of these one night when I went to bed - on my right foot, because that was the worst. Woke up at 2 a.m. with a sharp pain in my knee. What was it? My leg trying to re-align! I&#x27;ve been using these almost every day ever since. I switch feet most days, and sometimes can&#x27;t stand it (and remove it) after about 5 pm.(Just annoyingly &amp;#34;present&amp;#34;.)  But guess what? NO MORE KNEE PAIN! (I&#x27;ve also switched to Orthaheel/Vionic shoes and sole inserts to address pronation - another reason for knee pain.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some $$$. For the cost of a couple of co-pays under the new and vastly unimproved ACA, you will be able to avoid knee surgery, reduce your pain and increase your mobility - and all for just a few bucks! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I still have my cane. It&#x27;s in the trunk of my car and I can&#x27;t recall the last time I needed or used it. :)</li>
    <li> I gave one of my original gel toe spreaders to a friend and she is HOOKED!  I use mine for a &amp;#34;botched&amp;#34; bunionectomy—my big toe curves inward and this is so comfortable and helps train my toe to go straighter.  Glad Amazon carries them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for feet with bunions. I put these on at night time. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. Relieves pain. By morning, you are good to go for another busy day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but I wish I didn&#x27;t buy.  It&#x27;s hard to keep it in place when you have to move all the time.  Ideal if you wear shoes all the time.</li>
    <li> Help keep my toes from rubbing callouses on each other.</li>
    <li> These squishy little fellows fit between my big toe and 2 nd toe just fine and don&#x27;t require any other device to be held in place. Much more comfortable now that the toes don&#x27;t collide with eachother. I wear this for walking, exercise, everyday etc. Best price in town as well</li>
    <li> As expected, but after many uses gel&lt;br /&gt;Begins to fall apart.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Too soft.</li>
    <li> These work great when you have a bunion.</li>
    <li> These are nice to wear with sandals because they are almost &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; when I wear stockings.  They are comfortable, but do not separate my toes as well as other products that are more visible.</li>
    <li> I broke my toe a couple of years ago and it healed with a bunion pushing it into the second toe. I&#x27;d been walking in shoes with pain ever since. Here&#x27;s a simple cheap effective solution and I AM NOW WALKING PAIN FREE. I am so happy I found this product. They&#x27;re easy to clean. They stay in place well with socks. If a bent toe is causing a corn or ingrown toenail, try this product. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I misunderstood &amp; thought this product was going to be 4 spacers ranging from a large to a small size the way the photo showed - I didn&#x27;t realize that the image was showing different sizes - so I had been anticipating being able to use the larger and smaller for my big and little toe.  That was my bad, and they aren&#x27;t going to work for me the way I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.  If you DID understand, these are great.  The medium size is the perfect size for between my big &amp; second toe - I wear a 7 12 and have wide feet.  Very comfy, but also isn&#x27;t too big or too small - it creates space but not TOO much space, so you can still wear shoes comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-star rating is simply because while it&#x27;s great, the size really is only great for between my big &amp; second toes, so the other 2 spacers are simply extras - I need a different size as the medium is a little too large for the rest of my toes.</li>
    <li> Product received did not match the picture.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> great product, keeps the toes separated and cushioned</li>
    <li> I am a runner &amp; use these to keep my feet nice &amp; purdy.</li>
    <li> The toe spreaders are fine, but too large for my foot.</li>
    <li> Soft, comfortable, and stays in place.  Great item as can be worn with all closed toe shoes and even some sandals.  Keeps big toe from impacting adjacent toes and works on slowing the bunion process.  I would suggest trying this product to improve foot health.</li>
    <li> The fit well and separate my wife&#x27;s toes very comfortably.</li>
    <li> These are great and WAY less expensive than in the store. They&#x27;re really soft and make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Great spacers. They wear well and wash up very easy.</li>
    <li> These toe separators literally saved me from foot surgery this year.  I has a large toe silicone joint replacement twol years ago. It helped my big toe, but the unintended consequence (which my podiatrist did not tell me about) was that it put all the weight bearing pressure on my second toe, causing it to push down and pierce my metatarsal plate.  The bottom of the ball of my foot was really painful and my second toe was starting to cross over my large toe.  Not good!  So I was scheduled for surgery (with an orthopedic foot specialist) to have it repaired - mending the tear and shortening my second toe, with a 6 week recovery on a knee walker!  Ughhh!  While I was debating within myself about the operation I happened to see these on Amazon, ordered them and began wearing it on my bad foot full time with my Teva sandals and Merrell boots - they both have a lot of cushion in the forefoot area.  I thought they would at least keep my toes straight!  But as the weeks went by, my foot pain dramatically improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later, my surgeon cancelled my operation because my foot was doing so well.  Amazing!  I still have some numbness and a bit of pain at night, but nothing compared to the trauma of surgery - where the docs tell you if you get 80% improvement, you&#x27;re really lucky~  I&#x27;m very thankful and blessed.</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c I thought it&#x27;s 4 packs as it&#x27;s said. Usually, toe spreader comes with 2cts per pack so I thought it&#x27;s total 8counts if it&#x27;s 4 packs. That was totally misleading. It was 4 counts not 4 packs! Plus, it didn&#x27;t even come as sealed package instead was inside of ziplock bag. Worse, the medium size is too big for size 6 woman feet. Should have ordered regular 2cts per pack in small size. I really want to send these back for return. The product otherwise very soft. Would have been nice if size fits. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I found that the part that goes between the toes was too small, and the outer bulges were too big.  It compressed even more with wear, which made the bulges even bigger.  No way that I could wear it inside shoes.  Best cure for bunions is wear very wide shoes and go barefoot when you can :-D  this gel is not the answer.</li>
    <li> great to keep big toe separated and straight and hopefully prevent a bunion. So far it has done the job.</li>
    <li> Fits well and good price.</li>
    <li> Shipping was extremely fast &amp; the product is amazing for those of us with bunions and hammer toes!! Best product I&#x27;ve found for my bunions.</li>
    <li> Works well as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great for big toe bunions. These toe spreaders straighten out my big toe and really cut down on my pain. I wear toe spreaders with both thick and thin socks, in oxford shoes, running shoes, and boots. Very comfortable! No blisters, even when I&#x27;m running for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, a great product. Really cuts down on the frequency and severity of my stupid bunion pain. P.S. Getting old sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Ive been wearing these toe spreaders almost every day for the last five months (purhcased first pair in August). They are extremely comfortable to wear with my work oxfords and my running shoes. The best part: I&#x27;ve noted a dramatic decrease in my toe pain since I started wearing them. I subsequently bought four more packs of these toe spreaders. Considering them as stocking stuffers - so to speak - for other bunion sufferers. Excellent product and I highly recommend to anyone troubled by big toe bunion pain. These are especially useful if you are just *starting* to feel bunion pain. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these.</li>
    <li> These toe spreaders lose their shape very quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with them and therefore won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of surgery but these relieved pain near toe joints and bunions almost immediately, and continue to help. I wear them everyday. Love them!</li>
    <li> They are very soft and better than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I bought these because my last pair of toe spreaders started falling apart. With Pedifix&#x27;s Gel Smart Visco-gel toe spreaders I have had no problems!</li>
    <li> Helps with aligning my big toe</li>
    <li> The product may work for some but I am post major foot surgery and my toes (1st and 2nd) are colliding with each other in a serious way.  They provide the separation but the moisture is trapped and cause additional problems.  Overall they work well but not for a high sweat/moisture environment.</li>
    <li> A Stroke of Genius In Design!  Have an Arthritic Condition in my Big Toe...All Was Well But As A Result of the Condition my Big Toe Turned-In Causing abrasion and Soreness To The Adjoining Toe. As I Though About This I Found This Solution!  Believe Me When I Say It Works!  Sometimes Simplicity is Monumental.  It All Made Sense But The Genius Is In The Execution.  The Shape Is Self-Retaining, With Socks On They Stay in Place. The Material Is Fantastic!  I Say it Is Like A \\&quot;Gummy Bear\\&quot; But Softer!  If You Have A Condition Where A Toe Impinges Upon Another, THEN GET THESE!  It is Truly Nice That they Come in A Pack Of Four Which Means They Will Last A Long Time.</li>
    <li> no these were all too big for the little toe...&lt;br /&gt;did not gradate as shown in illustration.&lt;br /&gt;did not seem right to return after breaking the seal and actuall cutting one to see if it could be used..</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I only use it at night while sleeping and wear a sock to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> These work very well keeping my toes separated.  Big toes are turning in because of bunions.  I highly recommend these.  My greyhound likes to eat them.</li>
    <li> I have read several of the reviews, however I noticed no sweating with these gel toe separators. They fit very comfortable and my shoes seem to not hurt as much. I like them and for the money, they&#x27;re great. Thanks</li>
    <li> The size medium is too large for use between the third and fourth toes to relieve Morton&#x27;s Neuroma.  I had a local supplier and I thought medium was the right size, but evidently small is the right size.  These and wide toe boxes and socks that aren&#x27;t too tight have helped me manage my neuroma.</li>
    <li> does the job but larger would help</li>
    <li> I am using these following bunion surgery and they work exceedingly well in making me walk correctly.</li>
    <li> Good in theory, but doesn&#x27;t perform the needed function. It does not stay in place and does not control the second toe from curving up and over the big toe (toe crossing).</li>
    <li> just enough to spread my bunioned big toe and provide a proper footfall for a healthy walk</li>
    <li> they are all the same size, clear, and work&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s exactly what you would expect&lt;br /&gt;i use them when around the house, wearing them in shoes would be a tight fit</li>
    <li> These were bought for my partner due to his having bunions, hammertoe, and a couple other problems.  These toe spacers that were recommended by his physiotherapist are impossible to find anyplace locally, just at the physio, and they want a small fortune for them!  These are a great product, extremely durable, great price, service, shipping.  All around a great deal!</li>
    <li> what I got looked nothing like this and did not work</li>
    <li> Works well, and lasts a couple of months, at least</li>
    <li> This was the 3rd type of toe spreader I&#x27;ve tried to help with Morton&#x27;s neuroma.&lt;br /&gt;First was too small.&lt;br /&gt;Second, too big.&lt;br /&gt;These are just right.</li>
    <li> The art is to manage to pull off your sock without pulling off the toe piece.</li>
    <li> I have spent too much money trying to find something that works. Its amazing how much pain a crooked toe can cause. These do the trick! I do have pretty large feet that may be a factor for someone at the other end of the scale there.</li>
    <li> Very nice and comfortable. Fits well into my shoes.</li>
    <li> Great. Much needed and received in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> Feel great and very helpful for separating toes that tend to crowd each other.</li>
    <li> This is the same product my doctor gave me after I had bunion surgery</li>
    <li> Wearing this little thing is comfortable!  IT has stopped toes from rubbing together making sores.  Even my ankle feels better as I was apparently walking strangely due to discomfort in the foot.  And it seems the hammer toes that were developing are starting to straighten out!  Fingers crossed on that.  Try it!  It&#x27;s made a huge difference to me. :)</li>
    <li> This is a must when you need it</li>
    <li> These work!  I was skeptical but the only downside is that they bounce off hardwood floors and are hard to find!</li>
    <li> very good have used them before</li>
    <li> They did not help relieve bunion pain and did not stay in place.</li>
