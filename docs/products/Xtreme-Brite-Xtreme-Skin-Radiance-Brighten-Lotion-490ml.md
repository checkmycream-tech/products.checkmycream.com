### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it is great!!</li>
      <li>but if you need something to brighten your skin tone and smoothen the texture of the skin, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer and it smells go too.</li>
      <li>but I turned a burned color that wasn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
      <li>However , I did have some who said my skin looks good</li>
      <li>I like their gel way better!</li>
      <li>Lotion works great but the packaging is not user friendly.</li>
      <li>This is very moisturizing, smells great, and is definitely good for eradicating unevenness.</li>
      <li>But love the smell and how it feels on your skin.</li>
      <li>I love my skin.</li>
      <li>OK product can turn your nails color as well so watch this stuff on your nails or under your nails.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s making me darker than my own complexion which is light brown.</li>
      <li>It has a very pretty aroma!</li>
      <li>Would give -5 star if option available</li>
      <li>I was always light</li>
      <li>But I will be purchasing it again, it is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t good for actual moisturizing</li>
      <li>a light color person so it really work on me</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>The natural acids give your skin a fantastic glow after using it consistently over an extended period of time.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty decent and we think it adds to our brightening process.</li>
      <li>Did not see any changes in skin tone, even after using the whole bottle and using it twice a day.  </li>
      <li>The lotion does not work as fast as the gel.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin very well and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>After using about 4 bottles of this I am back to my original shade.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a little more than a month.</li>
      <li>I used a full bottle and noticed nothing different than what I would have with a regular lotion.</li>
      <li>I saw a significant difference in about 2 weeks with consistent use at least once per day.</li>
      <li>i was surprised when i got the lotion because it came in a big bottle.</li>
      <li>This is not a bleaching lotion per say because it&#x27;s action is much slower than a typical bleaching cream.</li>

    <li> Would give -5 star if option available</li>
    <li> This product is so expensive and a complete waste of my money. I have been using it for a little more than a month. I still have a tiny bit left. I saw no improvement at all on any part of my body. not recommended.</li>
    <li> When I recieve this product the head  was broken. I had to replace it in order to get out the lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this with the other two products for about month and have noticed that the dark spots on my face are lightening up.</li>
    <li> This will always be the one for me&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t make you brite it just tone you skin&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a light color person so it really work on me</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the hype behind this product. I used a full bottle and noticed nothing different than what I would have with a regular lotion. On the upside, it is moisturizing but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I order this for my niece so I have no comment.</li>
    <li> The lotion is not a good moisturizer. Very thick and takes time to brighten. If you are looking for a non sticky lotion, then do not buy this</li>
    <li> My shin burned when I went to college in a sunny area with all the commuting and bike riding. I was always light but I turned a burned color that wasn&#x27;t very nice. After using about 4 bottles of this I am back to my original shade. I love my skin. I am almost addicted to this.</li>
    <li> Not as expected.  It doesn&#x27;t turn your color of your skin.  But love the smell and how it feels on your skin. Apply very thinly,  because it is very thick.</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing, smells great, and is definitely good for eradicating unevenness. I saw a difference within a week of use.</li>
    <li> Lotion works great but the packaging is not user friendly. It&#x27;s in an aluminum can with a pump that has been broken each time I&#x27;ve purchased the product. Shipping has improved but the ump was still broken.</li>
    <li> smells terrible. I just throw it&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t even put it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells like pesticide.  I however decided to give this  product  a try. For a month and a half  I applied this on my abdominal area (stretch marks)  saw no change whatsoever , the results definitely did not outweigh the smell.  So I am tossing this product never to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are for the faint of smell I do NOT RECOMMEND .</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin, but it is gradual.  The lotion does not work as fast as the gel.  I will continue to purchase the gel.</li>
    <li> I got this product my hands had black pigment . I did not see any difference . However , I did have some who said my skin looks good</li>
    <li> Although my bottle arrived with a broken spout, I still use it as a day lotion.  It isn&#x27;t good for actual moisturizing so I&#x27;d recommend including a glycerin with the lotion.  It smells pretty decent and we think it adds to our brightening process.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle usually I didn&#x27;t use it that often because it worked within less than a few  days...this last bottle I bought though is not working and it&#x27;s making me darker than my own complexion which is light brown. I&#x27;ll never buy this again heaven knows what they put in it.</li>
    <li> Did not see any changes in skin tone, even after using the whole bottle and using it twice a day.  This will leave a freakish pinkish hue on your skin after you apply it.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this lotion long enough to see if it does work, I just could not bear the scent! I felt like throwing up each time I used it. I ended up giving the lotion to my mom after 1 week of using it. I like their gel way better!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for about a month as my daily lotion just to brighten my skin and it is great!! It is a great moisturizer and it smells go too. I saw a significant difference in about 2 weeks with consistent use at least once per day. I traveled with it in my carry on bag going to Louisiana for business and TSA took it away because it made my carry one too heavy with the rest of my stuff in it. But I will be purchasing it again, it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> OK product can turn your nails color as well so watch this stuff on your nails or under your nails.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast. i was surprised when i got the lotion because it came in a big bottle. Definitely worth the price. I used the gel before and it worked for me so i want to try and use the lotion for the body. Will continue doing business with CBS express in the future!</li>
    <li> This is not a bleaching lotion per say because it&#x27;s action is much slower than a typical bleaching cream. This slowly fades spots but keeps the skin it&#x27;s tone. The natural acids give your skin a fantastic glow after using it consistently over an extended period of time. It has a very pretty aroma! It absorbs into the skin very well and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily or greasy. Your skin will just glow like you&#x27;ve put on some baby oil but it won&#x27;t feel slippery. If you&#x27;re expecting a heavy duty bleaching agent, this won&#x27;t satisfy you but if you need something to brighten your skin tone and smoothen the texture of the skin, this is a great product.</li>
