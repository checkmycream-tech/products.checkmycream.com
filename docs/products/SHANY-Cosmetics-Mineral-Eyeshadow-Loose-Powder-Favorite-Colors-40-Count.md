      <li>Love love love!!</li>

      <li>to many orange colors in this make up kit ......</li>
      <li>but in reality it&#x27;s the perfect size for storing on the go, especially for a makeup artist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love!! Got these about two years ago and i haven&#x27;t stop using them since.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hated this makeup because this makeup was considerably flat after advertising it was a glitter, mineral make up</li>
    <li> Oh my I luv shany this is the best makeup ever</li>
    <li> All of the colors are very nice and pretty. I only bought this to make my own nail polish and my color options are ENDLESS. I am very satisfied with these colors.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but has a lot of the similar ones. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a Mineral Eye shadow that I have used before But just the same it had beautiful colors</li>
    <li> loooove! very intense pigments and everything shipped undamaged and timely</li>
    <li> colors are vivid as shown but dont war well-not even using petroleum jelly underneath.</li>
    <li> I have always used Mac products but NOW I have switched to shany cosmetics! I can&#x27;t believe I used to pay soooo much for the same products! Highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m your number one fan. Please bring more products!</li>
    <li> I love these colors, they are all so vibrant and concentrated, a little really goes a long way.  I especially appreciate that Shany provides 100% mineral wear.  THe price was great and if you love make-up, do yourself a favor and get this set, you will be so pleased</li>
    <li> I am a very big fan of mineral makeup and loves that I could get all of these colors for such a great price! I would absolutely buy these again. Don&#x27;t be surprised when you see the small containers but like many of the other reviewers said they are full to the brim.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter, she&#x27;s a model. She loves it .. great colors..</li>
    <li> I love the colors, I use with nail gels.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended the Shany 100% Mineral Eye Shadow Eye Shades set and I figured I would give it a try. I did love all the bright colors. I first tried a bright purple. It went on neatly, didn&#x27;t smudge, or crease and it looked great. I got compliments all day about the color and people asking where I got it.    I had to go to a luncheon with my husband for his job, so I tried a subtler, soft shade of pink. It looked great and I felt beautiful. Again, I got many compliments about the pretty color of my eyeshadow. It was definitely a boost to my ego!   It&#x27;s also very easy to take off, just a quick swipe with an eye makeup remover pad. It&#x27;s definitely great for convenience, since I am a mother to three girls. So it goes on quickly and can be taken off quickly. I haven&#x27;t tried out all the colors yet, but I&#x27;m definitely enjoying picking out which colors I want to try on next.    My oldest daughter who is a teenager has commented that she loves the eyeshadow on me and has hinted that this is something she would like for her birthday gift. So I will be buying this for her for her birthday and knowing that she&#x27;ll love it. This is definitely perfect eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> I needed vibrant colors for photo shoots and when I saw these I thought I would give them a try! I am so happy with this product the colors are amazing! It is what I was looking for. I also love that I can stack them together so they are not taking up so much space in my makeup kit, but if I only want to bring a few with me then I can do that too. Shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> Great variety!! Safe ingredients...</li>
    <li> Who ever said that this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave any fall out must be dreaming. This stuff falls all over my face. I put my brush in then have to tap off the powder in my sink and then I look at the brush and none of the powder is there. So then I have to dip it in again. I have tried it with wet brushes and dry. I do love them though. I just wish the fall out wasn&#x27;t so horrible. Also a lot of the colors are so close in color. I can&#x27;t tell you how many purples, greens, and pinks I have. Anyhow they are fun eyeshadows. I suggest putting your foundation on after you use these that way you don&#x27;t mess your make up up. I do recommend this for those looking for fun colors.</li>
    <li> The colors are great fun. They stay on and with the proper brush you can apply as little or much as you want.  The only con I can report is that many of the colors are very close in the shade.  But, I don&#x27;t mind.  They are fun.</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as bright as the pictures in fact most are pastels but there are a few bright shades. The picture attached makes the colors look a little bit bright than it is because of the flash but for the most part this picture is accurate! The apply nicely in sure a white base or even a wet brush would make these colors POP</li>
    <li> I wasted my money I got this for a present and it was broken just a mess Smh disappoint</li>
    <li> Well ever since i saw the picture of them on this site I knew I had to have them. Although I did buy them on Ebay for $5 less, lol.&lt;br /&gt;They are the brightest most amazing colors ever! The size of there packaging was a bit smaller than i had hoped but when I opened it they were packed full  to the very top! the diameter of them is about one inch each which in overall when you think about it, for 40 it is like $1.50 each which is actually a GREAT price! I recommend these for anyone who loves to use bright colors, the yellow really POPS (they all really do) which i love because i never came across a yellow that does.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see how many colors were there and how nice they were. I had to use a nice primer to make it stay, but it really works nice. I was also able to add primer to my daughters face and do face painting and it turned out nice. The colors are very true. Thank you. I will purchase from your company in the future.</li>
    <li> I was eyeing other loose pigments here on Amazon and I am glad I settled on the Shany Brand. I am very satisfied with my purchase. All of the colors are brightly pigmented and very beautiful. I had absolutly no fall out with this pigment. I did use an eye lid primer though. (Physcian&#x27;s Formula Talc Free Mineral Correcting Primer) I would reorder this product again, although it will probably be a very long time because there is a lot in this set. I have tried about 6 of the colors in this set and love all of them. It would be awesome if they came out with a set of neutral toned pigments too. I am going to be on the lookout.</li>
    <li> BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! SO WORTH IT!! WILL LAST YOU SO LONG! DEFINITELY SHOULD BE APART OF ANY MUA KIT! GREAT QUALITY</li>
    <li> I believe this is an excellent product....I will be using it for makeup application in stage shows that I am apart of.</li>
    <li> Second set we&#x27;ve bought!  The colors are amazing wet or dry.  Wet your brush for intense color we also use primer to help the color last all day.</li>
    <li> I never bought this makeup before.  I decided to give it a try, because it is a kick butt price.  the colors that came in my pack were a 40 count and every other color was similar to another.  For example #1 and #2 were slightly different, but very close to the same shade and so, although you get 40 colors, 20 are significantly different.  I did get a lot of fall out using this and that is why I talk about the quality and the powder isn&#x27;t as great as other mica&#x27;s I have bought.  It was definitely worth a try though and would be an absolutely great gift for someone starting a collection or just trying mica&#x27;s as a teenager.  I will still use these and experiment, but I have other prefrences.</li>
    <li> what a fun product!! worth the money, I recommend these. Use them with water, use them with a setting spray, can be layerd over glitter adhesive  for a thicker application. I am very sensitive to makeup, and I had no reaction. great quality. Can be used as blush and lipstick crème or powder. I like the powder look. it stays on for hours, and only takes one swipe for reapplication..</li>
    <li> There are plenty of eyeshadow&#x27;s to choose from in this package, however I have found that most of them don&#x27;t possess a great pigment.  Thus leaving me only giving it 3 stars only because they are giving a larger quantity for the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again though.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love makeup and was hesitant to buy this because one review referred to it as the quality of dollar tree makeup. I decided to purchase it anyways because it&#x27;s such a good price. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It has beautiful colors and they&#x27;re easy to blend. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These eyeshadows are AMAZING! Exactly what I was looking for! The colors are beautiful and very vibriant. This set contains pretty much every color you can think of and its a great price for the amount you get. Definitely going to buy more when I run out! I recommend this to anyone who wants loose pigment eyeshadow for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> They are amazingly pigmented and they are vibrant! I love them. The only complaint that I have is that they are so pigmented that they died my eyelids pink when I used the magenta. But I suppose its better then not being pigmented. I love them!</li>
    <li> Perfect colors! Very Beautiful and worth it!</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and lasts all day. Not a lot of fall out. Great product!</li>
    <li> i would recommend it to anyone. definitely a five star in my book. First time buying this brand and it wont be the last time. Extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Luna</li>
    <li> Love these colors! Bright and so worth it!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture. All 40 colors &amp; they are numbered on the bottom. The colors have a small hint of shimmer. I use eye shadow primer with these, the colors come out vibrant &amp; the exact color. When u add water, they work great as eyeliner or for body art. I&#x27;m a makeup artist &amp; have tried lots of brands, I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not natural or 100% mineral!!  The ingredients on the box say clearly that these contain parabens and artificial food colorings!  It is unlawful and deceitful to say that this product is 100% mineral when the first ingredient is talc, the 4th is methylparabens, and the list ends with FD&amp;C Red 40, FD&amp;C Yellow 5 and FD&amp;C Blue 1.  Absolutely NOTHING about the above listed ingredients is mineral or 100% pure and natural.</li>
    <li> The colors that are shown on the picture such as the browns, oranges, green or royal blues were not included.  It appears that I was sent only pink and yellows pastel colors not the vibrant colors and some of the eye shadows appear to be the same.  One of the powders was open and it waist in the box, that was messy to clean up.  I&#x27;m a little disappointment in the colors I received, I am a makeup artist and these colors were purchased to test them before I used them on my clients, or recommended them.  The containers are also small, I was expecting larger containers with more powder.  I will not send them back, it isn&#x27;t worth the 29.00 (including shipment).</li>
    <li> The colors that are shown online are not even close to what you&#x27;re going to get. Every color in the box was pastel and you don&#x27;t get very much in each container. I used them for a Comin Con and they don&#x27;t stay in place for more than an hour. I was able to use the pigments to make dye for synthetic hair, but thats about all they are good for...</li>
    <li> These colors are all gorgeous and have a slight shimmer to all of them which makes them even better! They seem to be very vesatile, and you can make it as thick and bold or soft and subtle as you like without caking or clumping! I was nervous about trying these at first because I usually shop much more expensive brands, but I wanted to give these a try and I must say they are worth more than what you will pay! They are very small but are completely filled to the brim so you have plenty in every color. I also like the fact they are smaller because I can throw them into my makeup case without worrying about them all fitting. They are also stackable if you only need certain colors to take with you. This helps save on space in your purse! MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I really liked the product. The colors are vibrant and they last. I love all the colors especially the reds!</li>
    <li> great colors and quality</li>
    <li> Great colors to add to my collection</li>
    <li> I of course read the reviews on this before I made my purchase..It has great reviews already, But for the price I was willing to take the chance anyways. They look a bit bigger in the picture, Each container is about quarter sized. They are FILLED to the top, so you definitely get your moneys worth. ( I purchased mine for $39.97) so that puts them about a dollar a piece for color. The colors are amazing, they have a great range. Just be careful when you take the lids off or you will spill some. All in all I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Great for a gift idea. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. I used mineral shadows from a popular company  it wanted to try these.  Yes, some of the colors are similar but out of 40, most I could use so it was worth it for the price.  Don&#x27;t let the bright colors scare you. They look good on your skin.</li>
    <li> The colors are OK.  This was not what I was expecting at all.  I don&#x27;t use them much to be honest.</li>
    <li> Colors are bold and bright in containers but  when you put it on even with eye shadow primer these are not bright on your eyes. Not what I was looking for at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist who&#x27;s always looking for affordable products and finding a product that performs just as well as,  if not better than the high end brands is always a great feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard a few things about SHANY via Youtube and IMATS (International Makeup Artist Trade Show) but I&#x27;m the type of person than needs to see products in person of read an extensive review before buying, problem is this awesome brand isn&#x27;t that well known among consumers so there weren&#x27;t many resources for reviews so I  was a little hesitant to purchase at first but I&#x27;m SO GLAD I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first sight the containers seem very small but in reality it&#x27;s the perfect size for storing on the go, especially for a makeup artist. Be careful when taking them out of the box because some of the caps on mine weren&#x27;t screwed all the way on. The colors aren&#x27;t as bright as the company pictures (I kind of figured that would be the case) but they are still INSANELY GORGEOUS and SO PIGMENTED, you only need a small amount so I&#x27;m ok with the size. I also like that you can twist them together to stack them but honestly they come packed to the BRIM with product so it&#x27;ll be a while before I can even do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY PLEASED with this purchase and think it was worth every penny. I&#x27;ve already used a few shades on set of a photo shoot and the results were PHENOMENAL. Now, if only they sold each color individual so I can replace them one by one instead of buying a whole new set, I&#x27;d be a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!i use these everyday for every occasion a def must buy easy to put on and easy to take off def worth every Penney</li>
    <li> I love the color and the richness of the eyeshadow. I love the differant colors and use them all. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, needed, and expected! Great colors &amp; they mix well, also. I also like how compact they are, so I can fit them in my purse.</li>
    <li> I like it very much...the only problem is, the colors are to similar. ..should have many other colors...but in general I&#x27;m satisfied and happy with it...good price and good makeup. Love the red and the yellow.</li>
    <li> i was going to give it to my sister who like me love makeup, but when they came and i open the box i just love the colors everything about them. then i just keep them.:)</li>
    <li> You receive a lot of product. Good color payoff. The colors are very beautiful and pigmented. The containers are stackable. Product doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space</li>
    <li> Very fun colors and killer for the price. These would be amazing for nail polish and lip gloss and I will probably use them for that but I bought them for costume makeup for my models and the pinks stain and there is pretty heavy fall out. I havent seriously put them to the test yet, and I will. If my opinion changes I will update this.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented colours, just what I was looking for. Which there was a white in this and more variety between glitter, pastels and regular eyeshadows. The little containers are filled to the max so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. You don&#x27;t even need to use much to acheive the look you&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I actually use these mica powders in my art as powdered pigments and they are great! They are matte with a bit of shimmer, but not glittery at all. Nice and thick too for this application.</li>
    <li> Although the colors are not as bold in the picture in my opinion but they look good. Just messy so I close the lid as soon as I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
    <li> This is my first shany purchase, I absolutely adore these shadows! I have been hunting a highly pigmented shadow set and I&#x27;m hooked! I was pursuaded to buy this particular set based on reviews. I see more shany purchases in my future. These shadows go on with no problem and stay put ALL day. My only issue was the wonderful colors all over my bathroom counter when I was done, lesson learned, be more careful or it will go everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best deals I&#x27;ve come across. Before I purchased it, I read some of the reviews and it seems to me it costed much more than what I paid for a lot of people and they still thought it was an excellent deal. This was great news for me because te quality isn&#x27;t always guaranteed for something at 25$. Immediately I was won over because I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of mineral eye shadow for a while now and everything was a bit to pricey for my budget. The package came in a timely manner and each eye shadow cartridge was actually larger than I had thought it would be which was a definite bonus. There is a bunch of powder in each cartridge so it&#x27;s sure to last for years and the colors are all very brights. There are also quite a few natural tones for those who don&#x27;t like wearing bright colors though so it really provides a color range for whatever look you are going for. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied and will probably buy more in a few years if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> I picked this set because I read reviews of other shadow sets and wanted to make sure there was good non chalky color. As well, I paid attn to the amount of shadow provided. I thought this was a great set for the money. My 17 year old loves doing her eyes with all the colors. Some shadows may be better quality but you would pay an arm and a leg for this many. And some are FAR worse quality...if you have ever bought shadow that is like talcum powder, it is very disappointing. These are NOT that kind of low quality.</li>
    <li> I just received these earlier today and I cannot rave enough about the selection of colors in a mineral eyeshadow! I know, I know, the price is steep- but you won&#x27;t regret buying this eye sparkle one bit! When I opened the box I was a bit miffed that it looked like I paid a lot for such a small amount of powder but upon further review the little containers are packed to the brim (like some of the other reviewers said)! There is the option of taking the lids off and stacking the containers since they each have threaded bottoms that screws onto the one above, but honestly you&#x27;d have to be so careful with how full they are that you&#x27;re better off just leaving them as is. I have NEVER bought a cosmetic this expensive before and I kept hesitating whether I should or not but I will not ever regret this purchase. I will probably not run out of eye shadow for at least 20 years (I&#x27;m not exxagerating) with the amount that comes in this package. I have also decided that since the stock photo doesn&#x27;t nearly do these eyesparkles justice that I&#x27;d upload a few of my own for you to view when deciding whether or not to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I love love love color on my big brown eyes, always have, but have never worn a frog or kelly green before seeing the greens in this package. For whatever reason the greens and the yellow popped out at me and I had to instantly try one on. The powder is very fine and consistent, goes on smoothly and rich in color, does not cake. And best of all, it didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive eye when I got a bit of powder in it! I put some kelly green and bright purple on my five year old daughter too and it also didn&#x27;t bother her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best of all- it&#x27;s made in AMERICA!</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful. Finally have red, that is actually a red and not some muted tone of it! I bought this to be able to try some new shadow ideas. After using a few colors today I am super excited to try more.</li>
    <li> I have had fun playing with the different pigments and looks.  They are a great set if you wanna get a lot of bright colors for reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> there chgeap little girl make-up. And there just ugly colors, not at all like the pictures. The way its packaged everything, don&#x27;t buy. Go for NYX.</li>
    <li> I think mine was used even though i ordered a new one which btw isnt cool i dont even want to use it i&#x27;m a germ a phobe i dont share my stuff. so i only use colors that look like they have never been touch... also colors are brighter in pictures that irl (in real life)</li>
    <li> I just got mine today and I can already tell I&#x27;m going to love it I am a huge fan of bright and colorful eye-shadow because its so much fun and makes me feel like a rock star I&#x27;ve always been a very bold person so the bold coloring is perfect for me. I admit I haven&#x27;t tried this set yet but I&#x27;ve got a set of the SHANY glitter eye-shadow and I&#x27;m loving it I can&#x27;t wait to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After reading a couple reviews specifically one that claims this product is falsely advertising its self I would like to clarify some things because it seems research has not been done properly on the ingredients in this particular item they are in fact naturally occurring and completely safe for use as long as you aren&#x27;t snorting the stuff by the container in particular I would like to point out the ingredients that this review claimed to be as \\&quot;not natural\\&quot; first was Talc which is an extremely soft rock that is found in many different colors in many places on earth that Talcum powder is entirely made out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See this site for more information on the Mineral Talc:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another was Methylparaban which is a naturally occurring plant mineral found in blueberries and other fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info here:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last being FD&amp;C dyes these dyes are used in cosmetics for the specific reason that they are in fact natural and are found in almost all make up if your trying to avoid these I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll have to swear off make up entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again more information can be found on this site:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear I did do the research of my own volition no one is paying me... Unfortunately... Anyway please don&#x27;t write this product off just because of one nasty review from an uninformed customer it really is a great product.</li>
    <li> The colors were not the colors on the picture. they were not as vibrant as I expected either. They were really different than what was advertised so be careful.</li>
    <li> Great selection of color. The loose mineral powder goes on smoothly and the color can be adjusted by the amount of pressure you apply. Love &#x27;em. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I so LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this eye shadow!!! Highly recommended!!! I Will for sure be ordering again!! beautiful colors!!! I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this product by the bright beautiful colors pictured. The colors are not as brilliant and pigmented as I hoped. Unless you use a very good eye shadow primer for these shadows to adhere to, the product wont apply smoothly and will appear very chalky and dull. I don&#x27;t completely hate them as I know what to do to get the colors to pop as I want them to, but the quality really leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed that it was &amp;#34;so&amp;#34; shimmery, but good pigment.</li>
    <li> Love the colors! And they stay on wonderfully with a primer.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> good colors, alot of colors the same though :(</li>
    <li> Great products! High pigment Color goes on smooth and lasts long. Definately wanting more in the very near future.  Id recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these... I bought these about two years ago and haven&#x27;t even used one color fully. Each individual eyeshadow is still about half full.. lots of compliments, many people think my eyeshadow looks like I use MAC!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person, but I ordered this because I wanted to try loose eyeshadow. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but when I opened the box I was amazed at the assortment and vibrant colors of the product. The eyeshadows look much better in real life than in the picture, and I plan to use these pretty often. They don&#x27;t come in very big containers, but I expect that they&#x27;ll last a few months, maybe even a year or more. Definitely plan on ordering more from the company.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I love matching my makeup with my outfits and this was perfect for just that ... Now I have every color I need to match my outfits... Only problem I have is it being so powdery it gets on my cheeks and eyelashes sometimes... Wished it would&#x27;ve came with a brush</li>
    <li> oh this is very pretty, it was a little hard to stack as the bottles were so full, but it was a lot of fun to play with.</li>
    <li> I love the colors.  They are very bright and i get compliments all the time at work because i have a shade to match every outfit</li>
    <li> I WAS looking for some glitter eyeshadow BUT This company MUST have a typo or something 9,9999.00 for some dang eyeshadow, YEAH RIGHT (PASS)</li>
    <li> This is great product. I research and compare pricing before I make a purchase. Since I purchased this item I have enjoyed the use and the price was exceptional.</li>
    <li> Love it! Little to no fall out.</li>
    <li> The colors are so vibrant and last all day...even in this dreadful Georgia heat and humidity.  There are so many colors in this palate you can find a hue to match any outfit.  Historically I&#x27;ve had to mix other brands colors to get the right shade, but not with this.  I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that the actual colors of the product are nothing like in the picture! The picture features bright, vibrant, heavily pigmented hues. The product is noticeably less pigmented in the container, and this becomes even more apparent when applied to skin. It is as if you took what&#x27;s featured in the picture and diluted the color with water. Very disappointing, but the price should have tipped me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, as there are better shadows out there that live up to their promise, but they don&#x27;t accept returns! I plan on using a wet brush to apply it, and hopefully I can get a more pigmented look (I might as well get something out of this, since I won&#x27;t be getting my money back). However, I will not be ordering anything else from the SHANY brand. It&#x27;s sketchy that they don&#x27;t accept returns and if this product is any indication of the brand&#x27;s overall quality, I shudder to think of how cheap and ineffective their other items are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is boldly pigmented (like what is shown in the picture of this product), go with another brand (Makeup Forever, Nars, and Kryolan all come to mind). Those that have their heart set on a rich color - that is, quality over quantity - would do well to shell out a little more for a brand that is of a higher caliber (rather than getting stuck with literally forty pods of shadow that look dull, faded, and lifeless).</li>
    <li> I soooo loved these shadows...as well as my friends whom used it every night we were getting ready to go out on our vacation.  Will order again and give away for their Christmas gift! Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pigmented!! Colors are wonderful and although the pots are small they are packed full of the product! Very well worth my money since I&#x27;m a MUA!!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about ordering this much eyeshadow from a company I have never heard of. It took me a few days before I actually decided to go ahead and purchase this!!! And I am not disappointed at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the reviews, good and bad before purchasing. My only concern was the &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; of the pictures here on Amazon. I was hoping they would be more of a pastel based. A few had said they were. While they are no where NEAR dull, they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;clown bright&amp;#34; which is a good thing!!! I have taken a picture myself, and if I could figure out how to upload it, I would!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a feeling these will last me a very long time, but I might just order more to make sure I have plenty in the future, just in case they get discontinued as all good colors do!! In fact, I might even order a set for my best friend, as I feel ALL women should own these!!</li>
    <li> to many orange colors in this make up kit ......I would tells friends if they do not like orange don&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> Love them but must apply primer first.</li>
