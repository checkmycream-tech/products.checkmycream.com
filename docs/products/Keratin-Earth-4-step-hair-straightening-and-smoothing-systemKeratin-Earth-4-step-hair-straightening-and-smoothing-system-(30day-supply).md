### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Product is amazing!!</li>
      <li>, they have an awesome product called Versaplex Infusion that you can use in your own shampoo</li>
      <li>Looked good after process</li>
      <li>Trust me easy and I am still in shock!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this as a good, cost effective, time efficient alternative to overpriced salon services anyday.</li>
      <li>So easy to use!</li>
      <li>but I felt confident since I have had keratin treatments before.</li>
      <li>I like the way it makes my hair feel, much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love your hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow the directions to the letter.</li>
      <li>The more you use it the better your hair gets.</li>
      <li>Make sure you wash it all out of your hair.</li>
      <li>also love that it is formaldehyde free and smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>I just used some of the step 3 as a leave in conditioner and it was fine.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and in the summer I get the frizzes</li>
      <li>People please don&#x27;t use this even if you get it for free .</li>
      <li>However, for those who want less frizz and more manageability, this product is great.</li>
      <li>Def worth trying!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect your hair to be bone straight, though but much more relaxed and improved.</li>
      <li>the first three days my hair was silky and smooth...</li>
      <li>I have been using the products for a few months now and am really happy ;)...</li>
      <li>I have had frizzy and dry hair all my life and this is amazing.</li>
      <li>I like it very much</li>
      <li>Keratin earth was super easy to use and it didn&#x27;t give me that pin straight hair everyday which I love, because sometimes i just want to have wavy</li>
      <li>First attempt over 50% frizz removed</li>
      <li>No weird chemical smell</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly...</li>
      <li>It is my opinion that three days of smooth hair is not worth the many months it will now take for my hair to repair</li>
      <li>Does not remove frizz completely on first attempt.</li>
      <li>however the first few days my hair looked and felt better although not freeze free just a bit silky.</li>
      <li>and yes at first your hair is pin straight.  </li>
      <li>Still if you&#x27;re new to using keratin do the test first!</li>
      <li>Easy to do with my short hair; maybe not for those with flowing tresses.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to wash my hair and dry it and leave the house!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting pin straight hair</li>
      <li>but so much cheaper</li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in manageability.</li>
      <li>After I washed my hair instead of it being really curly</li>
      <li>they look so puffy with so much frizz</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get your hair pin straight like a salon</li>
      <li>My hair is so much easier to manage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The next two days my hair was pretty straight.</li>
      <li>normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
      <li>It works quite well and was easy to apply although you need several hours for the entire process.</li>
      <li>Even when I blow dry my bangs and they look ok 2 seconds later</li>
      <li>I live in Texas</li>
      <li>the record I used the flat iron in medium and passed 2 times which I normally use it on a higher setting</li>
      <li>My hair was straight  the day I did it, washed hair and it was back to frizzy.</li>
      <li>But then went back to really curly.</li>
      <li>The shampoo also has sulfate in which helps stripping the hair of its natural oils and dirt.</li>
      <li>I would pay 3 times as much to get my hair back!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair, so don&#x27;t expect straight unless you use it in conjunction with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>I went for my regular haircut about ten days after using it and the first thing my hairdresser said when she touched my hair was &#x27;what did you do to your hair&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I decided to use it in medium and pass it only twice as opposed to 3 or 4 times like I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and gives me the frizz control I am looking for in the summertime with no ridiculous 72 hour downtime of not getting hair wet, sweating, being able to pull into a pony or even tuck behind the ears for crying out loud!</li>
      <li>Keratin gives just the tiny bit of smoothing my naturally curly hair needs.</li>
      <li>I would not such this product for women with natural hair.</li>
      <li>I have African American natural hair.</li>
      <li>I washed my hair and noticed that I had more than &#x27;alot&#x27; of broken uneven ends and the texture of my hair was different and much drier.</li>
      <li>No flat iron!</li>

<li> I regret using this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why there is a disclosure stating that their product does not cause broken hair, but rather could be a result from the heat of ironing because they want to blame it on the heat!!!&lt;br</li>
<li> The step 2 stinks.</li>
<li> but since the product had a burnt smell I was afraid</li>
<li> The rest of the products didnt smell so bad.</li>
<li> that now I don&#x27;t even know if I would have to cut :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yane</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is amazing!! I have never been able to wash my hair and dry it and leave the house! I have had frizzy and dry hair all my life and this is amazing. Trust me easy and I am still in shock!! Try it!! No flat iron!</li>
    <li> Salons in my area charge about $150 for a keratin blowout which lasts about 6-8 weeks and $400 (not including tipping) for a keratin treatment that lasts 3-6 months. Ouch! Enter Keratin Earth which I found online by accident. I paid $60 for approx 2-3 treatments each lasting between 4-6 weeks. It was easy to use and gives me the frizz control I am looking for in the summertime with no ridiculous 72 hour downtime of not getting hair wet, sweating, being able to pull into a pony or even tuck behind the ears for crying out loud! It&#x27;s practically a no brainer! Just make sure you follow the directions to the letter. I did not do the strand test but I felt confident since I have had keratin treatments before. Still if you&#x27;re new to using keratin do the test first! Also, try not to wash your hair everyday. Two to three times a week will help the treatment last as long as possible. Finally, you are supposed to continue using the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the product for the duration of the treatment but you can use any styling product you want. I would recommend this as a good, cost effective, time efficient alternative to overpriced salon services anyday.</li>
    <li> Keratin gives just the tiny bit of smoothing my naturally curly hair needs. I&#x27;ve used it for over two years and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. It doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair, so don&#x27;t expect straight unless you use it in conjunction with a flat iron. However, for those who want less frizz and more manageability, this product is great. Make sure you wash it all out of your hair. Easy to do with my short hair; maybe not for those with flowing tresses.</li>
    <li> It works quite well and was easy to apply although you need several hours for the entire process. I applied it on color treated hair and it actually improved the condition of my hair. It&#x27;s been about four weeks and it still is straightening. Don&#x27;t expect your hair to be bone straight, though but much more relaxed and improved.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. I like it very much I have fine curly hair and in the summer I get the frizzes so I use it in the summer and in the winter I give my hair a break. Also I can do this myself, my hair is short so I get 3 times usage from it&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again, use as recommended.</li>
    <li> This product dried my hair and gave me split ends. I lost a lot of hair during the step two treatment because the shampoo matted my hair. The next two days my hair was pretty straight. After I washed my hair instead of it being really curly it was wavy. But then went back to really curly. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
    <li> Did not make a difference on my hair or my friends,different hair types. Looked good after process but once you get to the next day, not good.</li>
    <li> Dried my scalp and did not relax my hair much.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, wavy/curly hair.  I live in Texas so it tends to frizz.  I purchased this lit after seeing it on the Today show.  I followed the directions to the tee and yes at first your hair is pin straight.  I used a flat iron with a 375 degree setting.  I waited a few days to wash my hair, as soon as it dried I could notice a very MINIMAL relaxed curl, I would still need to flat iron it.  I also use a hair dryer with ions so that helps with the frizz.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  I&#x27;m going to try the more expensive keratin treatment and see how that works.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting pin straight hair but I did expect it to be straighter than it was.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly...the first three days my hair was silky and smooth...it seemed to have &#x27;worked&#x27;.  I washed my hair and noticed that I had more than &#x27;alot&#x27; of broken uneven ends and the texture of my hair was different and much drier. I went for my regular haircut about ten days after using it and the first thing my hairdresser said when she touched my hair was &#x27;what did you do to your hair&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to anyone!!  It is my opinion that three days of smooth hair is not worth the many months it will now take for my hair to repair itself.&lt;br /&gt;PS....they have a disclosure with the product that says that their product does not cause broken hair, but rather could be a result from the heat of ironing.  I have been using an iron on my hair for about ten years now my hair and it has never been broken like this...therefore I can only conclude that it is their product....it is the only thing I have done &#x27;different&#x27; to it.&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy and use this product, remember, you have been warned....I hope someone learns from my mistake.</li>
    <li> Does not remove frizz completely on first attempt. The more you use it the better your hair gets. First attempt over 50% frizz removed but I could still see se flyaways. Also made my face breakout a little</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and the product smelled like it was burning my hair however the first few days my hair looked and felt better although not freeze free just a bit silky. When I was my hair my nightmare begun. My hair was highlighter treated but not damaged now my hair looks fried, dry, dull and so hard to the touch. I regret using this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why there is a disclosure stating that their product does not cause broken hair, but rather could be a result from the heat of ironing because they want to blame it on the heat!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I used the flat iron in medium and passed 2 times which I normally use it on a higher setting but since the product had a burnt smell I was afraid so I decided to use it in medium and pass it only twice as opposed to 3 or 4 times like I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I don&#x27;t want anyone else to go thru this with this product. I don&#x27;t care about the $ but for my hair that now I don&#x27;t even know if I would have to cut :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy and use this product, remember, you have been warned....I hope someone learns from my mistake.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I like the way it makes my hair feel, much more manageable.  I do recommend this.  You&#x27;ll love your hair.</li>
    <li> This product did not DO what they say on the video.  My hair was straight  the day I did it, washed hair and it was back to frizzy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Keratin earth was super easy to use and it didn&#x27;t give me that pin straight hair everyday which I love, because sometimes i just want to have wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is formaldehyde free and smells pretty good. I know some reviews say that hair feels a little drier than normal but when I called customer service they explained that it was just the deep cleansing of the hair from the shampoo which preps the hair to accept the treatment. I just used some of the step 3 as a leave in conditioner and it was fine. My hair is so much easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, they have an awesome product called Versaplex Infusion that you can use in your own shampoo so I use that from time to time instead of the shampoo in the kit. I have been using the products for a few months now and am really happy ;)...I also have color treated hair and I notice that my color is staying fresher longer. Def worth trying!</li>
    <li> So easy to use! Doesn&#x27;t get your hair pin straight like a salon but so much cheaper and you can wash your hair the very next day! The only bad part is you have to use their shampoo and conditioner. I think is a healthier way to go 😄. No weird chemical smell</li>
    <li> I have African American natural hair. I tried this as an alternative to Dominican Blow out and Silk press. The step 2 stinks. It smells like Nair hair remover lotion b/c of the chemicals. The rest of the products didnt smell so bad. The shampoo also has sulfate in which helps stripping the hair of its natural oils and dirt. What was I thinking?! After the conditioning step my I noticed my curl pattern was a lot looser. But my hair was sooo dry and brittle. I tried putting moisturizer on it and oil. It&#x27;s still dry. It didnt help with the frizz either. I also notice a little stinging when I washed out step 2. Almost similar to a perm. I also felt it when I washed out the mask. Step 3. This product should not be called Earth anything. I also noticed some of my edges fell out! To telling what other damage I may have. I have just been wearing my hair in an up do. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in manageability. I would not such this product for women with natural hair. I think they have a lot of work to do with this product.</li>
    <li> You ruins my hair! OMG I am so upset. My hair looks and feels so dry and hard. Even when I blow dry my bangs and they look ok 2 seconds later they look so puffy with so much frizz that all I can do is brush them back and use a hold spray. My hair was never this way. I have washed it 4 times already hoping this goes away and nothing. frustration and disappointment is all I can feel right now. People please don&#x27;t use this even if you get it for free . I would pay 3 times as much to get my hair back!</li>
