      <li>and they should have been secured better.</li>
      <li>The scent is ok for a guy - not too feminine.</li>
      <li>have been pleased with this product from the moment it came into my home.</li>
      <li>I love all dove products.</li>
      <li>In love with dove my favorite soap.</li>
      <li>Pretty good moisturizing body wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not one of those strong &amp;#34;headaches causing&amp;#34; smells, either.</li>
      <li>I made a purchase here on Amazon and needed to add something to my cart to get the free shipping</li>
      <li>But this product leaves my face feeling moisturized without being greasy, clean without being coated with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend for sure.</li>
      <li>Great for keeping skin soft and moisturized compared to regular soaps.</li>

      <li>This is an added bonus for those who try to stick to a tight budget and get the most for their money!</li>
      <li>I am not new to Dove products - I have used them for many years,</li>
      <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion afterwards that I normally would!</li>
      <li>/&gt;See the original list if ingredients on the 1st attached photo and the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; almost-no-moisture list on the 2nd photo.</li>
      <li>This is an added bonus for those who try to stick to a tight budget and get the most for their money!entire body.</li>
      <li>I step out and dry off, feeling clean and with no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s honestly worth the extra buck.</li>
      <li>Normally, I like dove products</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;The third bonus to using this product is how gentle it is on my face!</li>
      <li>AND my skin feels so soft!</li>
      <li>They make your skin and hair so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And now, keeping with the numeration process I seem to have started, the fourth and final thing I noticed using the Dove Body Wash is that I do not seem to have to use as much of it as I would another body wash.</li>
      <li>The old version had Glycerin as the 2nd ingredient which meant it had a lot of it.</li>

<li> The old version had Glycerin as the 2nd ingredient which meant it had a lot of it.</li>

<li> Other soaps seem to require a second or even a third squirt.</li>
<li> was buying this only because of glycerin being the second ingredient and used it after swimming to reduce itching due to chlorinated water.</li>
<li> Other soaps seem to require a second or even a third squirt.</li>
<li> This was worth the purchase but 2 bottles were broken.</li>
<li> Other products, even when they advertise the opposite, leave my face with that dry feeling that feels like my skin is being stretched.</li>
<li> I try to be cheap and buy the less expensive products, but always go back to Dove.</li>
<li> Like the product seems to help with the dry skin problem.</li>
<li> A small squirt on my scrubby or washcloth seems to lather up plenty enough to wash the entire body.</li>
<li> I do not use body washes very often because they sometimes are hard to rinse off the skin, leaving a greasy feel behind that makes you feel like you have not rinsed everything completely.</li>
<li> Although not much difference in results from this compared with Dove bar soap.</li>
<li> I have now moved one of the bottles down to the guest bathroom until it is needed</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m big on subtle and pleasing scents).</li>
<li> Now glycerin is the 10th ingredient which means it has a small amount of it.</li>

    <li> The scent is ok for a guy - not too feminine. Great for keeping skin soft and moisturized compared to regular soaps. Although not much difference in results from this compared with Dove bar soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I watched a  commercial of this and saw how quickly it lathered and how thick the lather was, and just had to try it!  Well, I am so glad I did because it is just as the commercial depicted. Plus I don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion afterwards that I normally would!</li>
    <li> great helps with moisture</li>
    <li> I love anything dove!</li>
    <li> I just love dove in general. I try to be cheap and buy the less expensive products, but always go back to Dove. It&#x27;s honestly worth the extra buck. It just feels amazing on my skin and helps improve dryness and rough patches. Also smells amazing (I&#x27;m big on subtle and pleasing scents).</li>
    <li> This is a scam since Dove changed the formula. The old version had Glycerin as the 2nd ingredient which meant it had a lot of it. Now glycerin is the 10th ingredient which means it has a small amount of it. Also, soja/sunflower oil moved from 4th to 8th ingredient. Dove reduced the mousturizing ingreadients to basically nothing. I don&#x27;t understand how dare they calling it &amp;#34;deep moisture&amp;#34; after they changed the formula. Now it is just a regular body wash, nothing moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this only because of glycerin being the second ingredient and used it after swimming to reduce itching due to chlorinated water. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the original list if ingredients on the 1st attached photo and the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; almost-no-moisture list on the 2nd photo.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash!</li>
    <li> Nice Body Wash. Def will reorder.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive skin this a great product to use.</li>
    <li> Like the product seems to help with the dry skin problem. If nothing else it does leave your skin softer.</li>
    <li> Good Product, came as described, good seller.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love all dove products. They make your skin and hair so soft. Would highly recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> This body was does not lather.  Normally, I like dove products</li>
    <li> really good shampoo for the body.</li>
    <li> love this body wash, good price too.</li>
    <li> This was worth the purchase but 2 bottles were broken. It was not packet properly...&lt;br /&gt;I order multiple bottles and they should have been secured better.</li>
    <li> In love with dove my favorite soap.</li>
    <li> Keeps my itchy skin from itching.  Amazon has a good price</li>
    <li> Pretty good moisturizing body wash. Does not feel oily or greasy. Leaves no residue on the body or the tub.</li>
    <li> I am not new to Dove products - I have used them for many years, But, I had never tried the body wash. I made a purchase here on Amazon and needed to add something to my cart to get the free shipping so I searched for something in the needed price range and chose this. I have been super happy about that choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with this product from the moment it came into my home. I placed both bottles in the upstairs bathroom and the very first thing I noticed was the awesome smell eminating from the room after about two hours! Mmmm! It&#x27;s not one of those strong &amp;#34;headaches causing&amp;#34; smells, either. It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell that is inviting and easy on the sinuses. I have now moved one of the bottles down to the guest bathroom until it is needed upstairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed is how the Dove Body Wash made my skin feel. I do not use body washes very often because they sometimes are hard to rinse off the skin, leaving a greasy feel behind that makes you feel like you have not rinsed everything completely. But that is not the case here. After each shower I have not once had to do that &amp;#34;extra rinse&amp;#34; to remove the soap. I step out and dry off, feeling clean and with no greasy residue. AND my skin feels so soft! Even my elbows, which I have to pay extra attention to, feel softer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third bonus to using this product is how gentle it is on my face! Other products, even when they advertise the opposite, leave my face with that dry feeling that feels like my skin is being stretched. But this product leaves my face feeling moisturized without being greasy, clean without being coated with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, keeping with the numeration process I seem to have started, the fourth and final thing I noticed using the Dove Body Wash is that I do not seem to have to use as much of it as I would another body wash.
