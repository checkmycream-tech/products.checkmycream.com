      <li>Softens my beard and keeps the skin nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The beard oil works fine for its purpose, but man does it smell like potpourri!  </li>
      <li>It lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite scent, but it came in the buy one get one package with the Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>It seemed it would have an island smell to it more Hawaiin.</li>
      <li>Grave Before Shave is in my opinion one of the top oils out there.</li>
      <li>I have several GBS scents, but this one is incredible!</li>
      <li>More on the floral, lavender-ish side (to me anyways).</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite scent of all of the GBS products.</li>
      <li>I love this product, every time I wear it is get lots of compliments</li>
      <li>The quality is top notch.</li>
      <li>Too strong a scent for me.</li>
      <li>Received a fantastic deal from GBS as well...</li>
      <li>Seems to leave a light residue that helps keep the hairs in place after brushing/shaping.  </li>
      <li>great packaging (!)</li>
      <li>I bought this through a buy one Bay Rum scent and get this one free.</li>
      <li>I have all of their fragrances and this is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>Hunter carries a lightly tropical scent but has a very fresh scent and reminds me of fresh squeezed tropical juice and the Caribbean air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ideal for everyday.</li>
      <li>This beard oil keeps my beard nice and soft, however, the scent is horrid.</li>
      <li>Like the sweet smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light smell that definitely reminds me of the beach.</li>
      <li>It fades quickly too, it sticks around an hour or two.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Smells super fresh and</li>
      <li>Gained a LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR CERTAIN!</li>
      <li>but not crazy about the product itself.</li>
      <li>Instead it&#x27;s straight sweet tropical fruit, nothing else.  </li>
      <li>I tried the bay rum and liked the smell from the bottle but after wearing it all day at work, I couldn&#x27;t get home fast enough to wash it out.</li>
      <li>Second time buying from second flavor, love them both and will keep buying!  </li>
      <li>All of the GBS products I&#x27;ve tried are very high quality.</li>
      <li>Very wearable.</li>
      <li>No dude I know wants to smell like Piña Colada.</li>
      <li>Very oily...  </li>
      <li>I would like to see if there are other products they sell that smell more manly, but after purchasing this and bay rum I&#x27;m scared to take another chance on this company.</li>
      <li>I previously had the O.G. scent which I really enjoyed</li>
      <li>Not as strong or long lasting as the Bay Rum scent.  </li>
      <li>Overall they work pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, but not very manly either.  </li>
      <li>Far exceeded my expectations the long dropper is very helpful with application and the scent</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my new favorite scent. I have several GBS scents, but this one is incredible! The wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite scent of all of the GBS products. However, it is still very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Ideal for everyday.</li>
    <li> Probably the best scented beard oil I&#x27;ve ever used. Received a fantastic deal from GBS as well... I hope you guys make a beard balm of the same scent!</li>
    <li> Smells super fresh and oh so clean!!!! These guys sure know how to make a beard just that much better!!!</li>
    <li> This beard oil keeps my beard nice and soft, however, the scent is horrid. No dude I know wants to smell like Piña Colada. Way too fruity!!! I will try the un-scented beard oil and throw this out!</li>
    <li> This is awesome beard oil!!!</li>
    <li> This is their best scent to date! I have all of their fragrances and this is my new favorite! I&#x27;ve read reviews saying how girly this smells to them and how the bay rum is their go to fragrance. I tried the bay rum and liked the smell from the bottle but after wearing it all day at work, I couldn&#x27;t get home fast enough to wash it out. I was actually getting a headache from the smell. Too strong a scent for me. Well, everyone&#x27;s different and every scent isn&#x27;t going to work for every person. However, Fisticuffs makes terrific products. I&#x27;ve tried different brands, but always return to Fisticuffs.</li>
    <li> Great Product I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the smells not so good, it smells like I&#x27;m spraying on my girlfriends hairspray</li>
    <li> This oil works great and smells even better</li>
    <li> I got this to try along with the Bay Rum scent.  Overall they work pretty well.  I have a course beard with lots of split ends and broken hairs giving it an untamed look.  The oil softens the hairs a bit and I have a lot less split ends.  Seems to leave a light residue that helps keep the hairs in place after brushing/shaping.  I do use at least twice as much as the directions say.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason for the 3 stars: the scent.  From the description and reviews I was expecting an aquatic cologne type scent.  Instead it&#x27;s straight sweet tropical fruit, nothing else.  Not unpleasant, but not very manly either.  My fiance says it smells &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  Not as strong or long lasting as the Bay Rum scent.  Won&#x27;t be ordering this scent again.  Probably will reorder Bay Rum and might try Gentlemen&#x27;s Blend.</li>
    <li> Ordered this last week and received it in two days!! I previously had the O.G. scent which I really enjoyed but this one is even better! Definitely will be a constant in my beard oil rotation.</li>
    <li> As with all Grave Before Shave beard oils this product is an excellent source of nourishment for your beard and for your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head Hunter carries a lightly tropical scent but has a very fresh scent and reminds me of fresh squeezed tropical juice and the Caribbean air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite must have for any beard growers collection.</li>
    <li> Works just the same as the Gentleman&#x27;s Blend, except the scent is tropically manly goodness for your chin sweater.</li>
    <li> I love this product, every time I wear it is get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Smells like delicious, tropical drink. Softens my beard and keeps the skin nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations the long dropper is very helpful with application and the scent last  through out the day longer then some of the other oils I have used</li>
    <li> Head Hunter has a pretty subtle mix of pineapple and mango scent to it (and maybe a hint of bubblegum?). Doesn&#x27;t linger, but not exactly what I want to smell in my beard.</li>
    <li> Smells great and conditions the skin under my beard. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my beard for almost 2 years now but I went my fist year without knowing about oils and balms.</li>
    <li> Great product, great shipping time (normal) and great professionalism.</li>
    <li> Softens beard. And smells kinda like juicy fruit gum. A subtle tropical scent. Very good</li>
    <li> Greatest in the WORLD!  I love this stuff!  Second time buying from second flavor, love them both and will keep buying!  Best thing I have put in my beard!  Gained a LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR CERTAIN!</li>
    <li> I bought this through a buy one Bay Rum scent and get this one free. It&#x27;s a nice light smell that definitely reminds me of the beach. The quality is top notch.

    <li> Grave Before Shave is in my opinion one of the top oils out there. This flavor is not what I expected from the label. It seemed it would have an island smell to it more Hawaiin. That being said it smells really good! It has apricot oil in it and I smell that a lot. Very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Very oily...  great packaging (!) but not crazy about the product itself.</li>
    <li> The beard oil works fine for its purpose, but man does it smell like potpourri!  I always ask people if they like the smell of beard oils I get and this one got bad reviews.  I would like to see if there are other products they sell that smell more manly, but after purchasing this and bay rum I&#x27;m scared to take another chance on this company.</li>
    <li> This Scent took me to a Deserted Island and turned me into a savage Head Hunter!!!! My Girlfriend loves it she said it turned my beard softer. She was not a fan of beards either It turned her into one.</li>
    <li> Scent was not nearly as strong as some of the reviews suggest. It fades quickly too, it sticks around an hour or two. All of the GBS products I&#x27;ve tried are very high quality. This is not my favorite scent, but it came in the buy one get one package with the Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Like the sweet smell. It lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> The scent on this is a little hard to pin down. More on the floral, lavender-ish side (to me anyways). Very wearable. Unobtrusive. GREAT STUFF.</li>
