<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was sad e realize that this was not the real thing. It seemed like it worked but since it is not real Kerastase brand, who really knows what it is.</li>
    <li> Thick, wavy hair.  Love this,  best product I have ever used on my hair. Helps with frizzy &amp; makes hair shine!  Highly recommend &amp; will always buy!</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair</li>
    <li> Nice product. Got what I expected. Expensive but worth it. I like this larger size because this way I&#x27;m not feeling the inclination to ration and just use how much I actually need.</li>
    <li> So I love love love this serum. Let me start by saying I am a true product junkie. I have tried every serum out there and nothing I repeat NOTHING can compare to this. I have 3c/4a hair that is completely natural but in the winter I straighten my hair. So I washed my hair, conditioned it and sectioned it off. I put the serum on each section this serum already had a silky feel to it. I then blow dried my hair an d kinda got scared because it looked dry. I pulled out my trusty ghd and I only had to pass the flat iron through one time. By this time I am completely in awe because it usually takes me and hour and a half to do everything, how about this time it only took me 35 mins.My hair feels like silk the bounce is outrageous and I know this product carries a hefty price tag but trust me your hair will love you for it. I will purchase this again as it is now my holy grail serum!!!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a hairdresser and as I like the Kerastase range I thought it was going to be an essential part of my hair regime.  Sadly I have to say I was very underwhelmed - my hair is long fine and highlighted so it can get dry on the ends.  I try to let it air dry where possible .  The Kerastase Elixir really did very little and my hair did not look or feel any different - if anything it made the ends look dryer!  I will continue to use it as it is too expensive to waste to see if my hair does change but I have the feeling it will have just been an expensive mistake</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading many of the reviews.  I permed my hair right after my daughter was born for the ease factor of not having to fix it.  After a couple of months I got tired of it.  I chemically straightened and colored it.  To say the least, my hair was fried!  I had tried many other products but nothing was helping with the dry look, split/broken ends, and fly aways.  Within one use of this product I could tell a huge difference!  Even my husband said my hair looked better.  I put this on right after I wash my hair and little more for shine after I have blow dried and flat ironed my hair.  I have now been using Kerastase for about a month and am still in awe of the job it does.  This product is above Biosilk or any product like it.  You will not be sorry you purchased it.</li>
    <li> Finally found something good.  Is not cheap but last long. It&#x27;s worth!  I have dry and long hair and is so hard to keep it beautiful without going to salon. This product just help me on my everyday need!I recommend .</li>
    <li> This outstanding hair product does not weigh your hair down.  Eliminates dryness, frizziness and gives shine.  I tried other brands and they were too heavy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this product more than 3 stars. I&#x27;ve being using Kerastase for over 15 years and just recently heard of it. It is not better than Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Serum, which costs at least $12 less and is much better. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I know it is a good product (as all Kerastase stuff), I just didn&#x27;t see the benefits - and because it smells good.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product - it is expensive but worth it. I love the feel of it and you only need a small drop, everytime.</li>
    <li> Although this product is a bit expensive it&#x27;s worth every dime of the money spent. It smooths my hair like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Kerastase products and have always used the Oleo Relax. After reading the reviews for KÉRASTASE ELIXIR ULTIME I decided to give it a try. While expensive, it only takes a small amount,the results are amazing and it has a wonderful scent!&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without it - Kerastase does it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
    <li> After years of being a blonde my hair was starting to feel the effects (dry, hair breakage etc) My hairdresser recommended Kerastase Oil for my hair, I was rather cynical  about it but thought I&#x27;d give it a go anyway......wow. My hair feels like silk after use and this is coming from someone who has very thick hair with years of peroxide damage, still it feels fantastic and smooth after drying. Previously I would dry my hair and due to the thickness of my hair it would end up like a haystack on my head. Pricey but honestly worth every penny. Smells beautiful as well. Top buy!</li>
    <li> ***SEE UPDATED REVIEW AFTER ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle product. I don&#x27;t say that lightly. Having tried hundreds of hair products, this is THE ONLY ONE that I have reserved the word miracle for.  Go look through my reviews... I&#x27;m a pretty tough reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read about this product in a women&#x27;s magazine, but did not buy because of the price. But someone bought this for me, and am I glad they did. My hair has made a 360 degree turnaround. People are asking what I have done to my hair --- it looks that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy, color treated hair that is prone to frizz. My hair is a bit longer than shoulder length.  This product manages my hair, makes it tame and GLISTEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not come with instructions, which I find puzzling. So I went to the Kerastase website to figure out how to use. You can use this product many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a pre-treatment: apply to hair before shampoo&lt;br /&gt;After shampoo, while hair is damp,  as a style aid&lt;br /&gt;After blowout to add some glisteny shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump about two to three nice size pumps and apply to my hair about 15 minutes before shampoo. Then I shampoo and condition. On towel dried hair I apply some Kerastase (about the size of a quarter). I blow-out my hair and like the straight look, so I then apply some Jonathan Product straightening creme. Blow my hair, sometimes follow up with hot rollers. Then I take one pump of Kerastase and rub it in my hands letting the heat in my hands soften it. Then I work it through my ends. Voila! No frizz, all shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Moroccan oil -- this is worlds better. It also has a lighter, better fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this when I&#x27;m done with the bottle. It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; UPDATED REVIEW - JULY 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still on the same bottle of Kerastase 18 months later.  I was using 2-3 pumps,. but my hairdresser told me that was too much. I now use one pump and thatworks great. I only apply to the lower half of my head -- not the scalp. I have color treated hair, about five inches longer than shoulder length. I also have a professional Keratin treatment, so I no longer have to use straightening or other products. Just wash, condition, Kerastase and go :)</li>
    <li> This product has help my hair so much! I have fine, blonde highlighted hair and it was getting really fragile. I use this when I get out of the shower and whenever my hair feels dried out. Smells amazing and my hair has improved so much!</li>
    <li> Bought this product bec. of all the great reviews.  Expected my hair to be shiny and silky but in the end it just felt a little softer.  My husband didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  There are cheaper oils out there.  If you are looking for a great hair product buy the nexxus promend line.  Gets rid of split ends and makes your hair smoother and silkier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love..the best hair oil ever!!!    I used this as a pre-shampoo treatment, before I rollerset my hair, and then before I flat iron my hair...silky, silky, silky!!!!    Will be buying again!!!</li>
    <li> this is a nice easy to use non greasy conditioning hair oil. i love it because its not just for styling its actually a hair treatment. so you know its doing something good long term for the condition of your hair. i wear my hair naturally curly and sometimes i straighten it. it leaves my hair soft conditioned healthy looking and soft everytime i use it. love it and would recommend this to everyone i know.</li>
    <li> I loved it and it was much cheaper then buying it at a salon. I will definitely buy it through here again.</li>
    <li> for the money definitely not. i like these products but this one didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. i have other serums that cost less that work better than this one. maybe a different choice would have been better for me, as i do like this line a lot, but if i am going to spend this much money i want the product to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product and delivery. Thank you</li>
    <li> The best hair product on the market. It eliminates fizziness and works as a de-tangler too.</li>
    <li> As good as everyone said it would be!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product after using it for the first time last night. I have never had a serum deliver immediate, dramatic results or do the things this one does...I feel like this is the rescue my hair has been waiting for and has saved it&#x27;s life! I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of serum and nothing even comes remotely close to this one. I naturally have curly, thick/coarse, dry hair that&#x27;s almost to the middle of my back on top of that I always blow-dry and straighten too because it&#x27;s so out of control when it&#x27;s curly. Such an arduous, time consuming task. Gets annoying and old real fast. So you can imagine the abuse I put my poor hair through. This stuff makes it possible for my hair to look healthy and be manageable at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve coupled this serum with my Bain Satin 2 shampoo and Oleo Relax Slim Masque (I use it as a conditioner more) and I apply the Elixir to my slightly damp, towel-dried hair...before I blow-dry to offer some protection, a little after to tame my frizziness and just a bit after I straighten to make it soft, lightweight, shiny and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave it greasy at all! The smell is so yummy! It&#x27;s almost like perfume and I love the fact that it does linger around because then I know I smell good no matter where I go. It normally takes me 40-45 minutes to straighten my hair because it&#x27;s so stubborn, but nope, not anymore. Not with this stuff I don&#x27;t have to spend that kind of time. It was such a breeze to do my hair last night and I actually enjoyed doing so because I could see the transformation right before my eyes. I went from being a dry and frizzy puffball to straight, sleek and shiny. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with Kerastase that I practically gave all of my other non-Kerastase hair products to one of my girlfriends because I know I won&#x27;t be using anything else. I&#x27;ve already ordered some Ciment Thermique, Ciment Anti-Usure, Fibre Architecte (super excited about this one) and Nectar Thermique because I want to slowly but surely start reconstructing my hair to being healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WORTH EVERY FREAKING PENNY. YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED. IT&#x27;S SILK IN A BOTTLE &lt;3</li>
    <li> It is expensive but it lasts a long time.  The product makes it easy to style my hair and my hair has shine.</li>
    <li> All it took was my hairdresser to smooth a drop of this onto my hair to send me straight to the counter to buy some (even when I had a full bottle of MoroccanOil at home). My hair felt like silk. I let my boyfriend feel it and he was floored (dare I say turned on) by the silkiness. And he&#x27;s not one to give compliments just because I solicited them. Here&#x27;s the low down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It can be used several ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Pre-wash to remove impurities.&lt;br /&gt; -Pre-blow dry or flat iron as a heat protector&lt;br /&gt; -Post-dry/flat iron to smooth, soften and shine&lt;br /&gt; -As a hot oil treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The dispenser -- it twists to open and close, to prevent leaks/spills and pumps out small dabs of product, the perfect amount (unlike MorocconOil, which spills out wastefully)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It smells good. I&#x27;m not in love with the smell, but my hairdresser and sister-in-law went ga-ga for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t discolor blonde hair (at least, I haven&#x27;t noticed it has. MoroccanOil seems to make my hair brassy if I don&#x27;t clarify the build-up out periodically)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The consistency is more lightweight that MoroccanOil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I think it&#x27;s actually improving the condition of my hair. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You get A LOT of versatility for the cost. It may seem expensive at first, but a little goes a long way and the dispenser/performance are FAR superior to the comparable-in-cost MoroccanOil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Like MoroccanOil, I have to be really careful to keep this product from touching my face -- for fear of zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now without hesitation. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed (especially if you are a BioSilk or MorroconOil user). Or, if you&#x27;re a MorocconOil devotee, please buy my bottle off of me. I will never use it again now that I&#x27;ve found this. Not to knock that product (I know I have)... it&#x27;s just that I thought it was miraculous until Elixir Ultime came along, and for the price, you&#x27;re much better off going with this than the MoroccanOil and its wasteful packaging. BioSilk, decent stuff, but it pales in comparison to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My hair is BKT&#x27;d (it&#x27;s naturally curly) past shoulder-length, highlighted ash blonde, dry as heck, has tons of fly-aways (but you&#x27;d never know it thanks to Elixir Ultime).ales in comparison to this.    Note: My hair is BKT&#x27;d (it&#x27;s naturally curly) past shoulder-length, highlighted ash blonde, dry as heck, has tons of fly-aways (but you&#x27;d never know it thanks to Elixir Ultime).</li>
    <li> this is the best hair oil ever    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED    the fragrance smells like a perfume , more than a hair oil    it feels sooo light that it will leave your hair feeling incredible, it&#x27;ll never make ur scalp hot or feels annoying   Although it didn&#x27;t soften my Hair at all coz I have an unruly hair which is impossible to manage without a hair dryer . It made no difference to me except the quality for this product was excellent</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on other reviews and have had positive experiences with some of the Kerastase products in the past, but have been not overly impressed with others.  This is without doubt simply the best product I have used - EVER.  I had a horrible color service done a year ago and have suffered serious breakage, damage, dryness...all in all, horrible looking and feeling hair.  I have tried EVERYTHING to make it tolerable as it grows out.  I used this, and the from first use, I have shiny, bouncy, youthful hair.  It feels like silk, but holds the style.  I have light blonde hair and as a result, no \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products really do much, although I keep trying.  This one makes my hair shine like the hair of my 2 year old daughter.  I know I may sound overzellous here, but if anyone other there has ever experienced a bad color or perm and have had to suffer with severely damaged hair, you understand how it feels to finally have nice hair again - this has accomplished what no other product has even come close to.  I highly recommend this - even for the higher price, it is worth it.  I used pre-shampoo, pre-blow dry and slightly as a finisher.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair has never felt so soft. This stuff is like pure hair gold! and smells amazing</li>
    <li> OK, I had such an amazing experience with this stuff I had to post here!!  So my stylist sold me this stuff (for $60) about a year ago.  I used it once last year and for some reason it didnt work the way I wanted it to.  So I went back to the Oleo Relax Serum which is much lighter.  Well about a month ago one night my hair was feeling insanely dry.  So I went into my bathroom cabinet and pulled out this Ultime Elixir.  I literally SLATHERED about 20 pumps of it onto my dry (not wet) hair.  My hair looked like a crazy oil slick!  But then some kind of weird miracle happened...it totally absorbed into my hair!!!!!  Like it was gone, just absorbed after about an hour.  I was in shock!  I thought it was going to sit on my hair and then the next morning I would have to really shampoo to get it out.  But by the next morning I was just left with beautiful, conditioned hair...I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN HAVE TO WASH IT!  It lasted for three days like this and then I washed.  So if you are struggling with crazy dry hair, try this.  Pump a TON, I mean a lot, into your dry hair and then watch what happens...:)  You wont be disappointed.  This stuff is worth every single penny!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after getting really good results from the dupe at Sally&#x27;s called Kera Pro.  I am very happy with the serum, it helps with detangling and smoothing and it smells sooo good!  Not sure about it being worth $50, I am glad I have it so I can move on to the next best thing.  Since it was so expensive, I will rotate it with the Kera Pro elixir so that it lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> The product itself is really good but one of the sellers I placed my order from is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please pay attention to the product you received!! The product I received the first time came with burnt mark on the number that was later printed on the bottle so you will not be able to see them.  Worried this might be an expired goods, I returned the bottle to the seller though I was told by the seller there is nothing wrong with the existence of the burnt mark. I bought the bottle the 2nd time from a different seller, everything looks fine this time, no sign of erasing the number. So please pay attention to the product you received.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a splurge. LOVE it. I have LONG, thick hair and only use a small amount on my hair. It leaves my hair soft, smooth and smelling great! A great product worth the price b/c I know that not only does it work as promised, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is by far the Best price for a great product! I will be getting all my kerastase from amazon</li>
    <li> I read about this product on Pinterest (yes, I&#x27;m addicted) and thought it sounded amazing. Then I read the reviews here and decided to go ahead and splurge. I am so glad that I did. I use it as a pretreat before shampooing(my highlites just sparkle now)and also before I style my hair. My hair is foiled and has been seeming to get thinner and thinner for years. After just using this for a couple weeks my hair feels and looks thicker and has so much bounce! I have not had hair this healthy in years! I also use it on my days off for shampooing by putting a small amount in my hair and then rinsing it out, then I style as usual. I don&#x27;t have bad hair days anymore!! I just can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
    <li> I was looking for conditioning oil for my hair and read the review of this product online and decided to buy it.  I am not disappointed at all; the product has delivered and I am quite pleased with it.  Kerastase products have always been my favorites.  I will definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is my first review and I just had to post one for this product.  All I can say is WOW.  If you are second guessing spending the extra money don&#x27;t.  I wish I would of found out about this product along time ago then I could of saved the money I spent on all the other products that I purchased.  My hair dried so much smoother, shiner and I felt like I just walked out of the salon.  I used it on towel dried hair just one pump and my gosh what a difference.  GREAT Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Moroccan Oil girl.  I wanted to try this but it was too heavy for my hair.  I do love it as a hot oil treatment before shampooing.  The price is on the expensive side for a hot oil treatment though, but that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> This product is over prized and over rated. I would not recommend it for people with curly dry hair. Its to expensive and does not deliver. Dont waste your money.[[ASIN:B004530AB2 KÉRASTASE ELIXIR ULTIME</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It really has helped improve the condition of my hair, and has lasted a really long time!  I use it pretty liberally.  My hair is dry and porous, and it absorbs well.  It&#x27;s never made my hair look greasy (but nothing really does in my hair).  The scent is light and neither good or bad, but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I&#x27;ve also recently used morrocan oil, which didn&#x27;t work as well as this, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. But it isnt a miracle. I think it is too expensive. They should make sample sizes too.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift after I was so impressed with it at the salon.  It makes my hair so soft and full, and it only requires a few drops at each application- hair is not weighed down, and the bottle lasts forever!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and I thought it was brilliant. When I asked how much it was and he told me I must admit I was pretty shocked so looked on here to see if I could get it cheaper, but to no avail. I blew caution to the wind and decided to order some and it&#x27;s the best product I have used on my hair.... ever! (And I am a bit of a product junky) I would advise anyone to get this and yea I know it&#x27;s quite pricey but then again, everyone knows you get what you pay for. It is an absolute miracle product, a must buy!</li>
    <li> This is better than Moroccon oil.  Protects hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now (on my 4th bottle). It provides shine and smells yummy. Though the directions say to use on towel-dried hair, it has a variety of uses. On towel-dried hair it provides softeness prior to thermal styling. On dry hair, it provides extra shine and smoothes frizzies. You can also use it as a pre-cleansing agent - apply to dry hair before showering...it seems counterintuitive to wash it out, but it really makes your shampoo work harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way - I have long, albeit fine, hair and use a single pump.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in. My hair is now super soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> I was told by a professional hair colorist that Kerastase is \\&quot;the Cadillac\\&quot; of hair products. Well, that&#x27;s true for the conditioner (\\&quot;Ciment\\&quot;), but the elixir really isn&#x27;t any better than less expensive products you find in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> What did I ever do without this product? It has completely changed the texture of my hair. Can&#x27;t leave the house without using some, especially in summer when my hair tends to frizz up. My hair is probably over-processed but you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell it with this product. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This does not irritate the skin, does not get greasy.  Like the smell, not as strong as bain oleo but will use for now.</li>
    <li> It is pretty expensive but it does its job. It makes your hair smooth and it smells nice. It is a bit expensive but you really don&#x27;t have to use that much so it could easily last you about 3-6 months. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was interviewing to work with the L&#x27;Oreal/Keratase group when the GM gave me a bottle to try. Well I didn&#x27;t get the position but I did fall in love with the brand itself. I  first used it on my thinning hair and saw major improvements immediately. Then I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and my goodness it was soft and silky right away. So then I took it to friends and family and before I know my bottle was empty. It is pricey but well worth every penny, any future arguments that could incur from the husband founding out the price, and/or I suggest setting up a a secret fund to make sure you have what I fondly refer to \\&quot;Hair Crack\\&quot;.....  Black women don&#x27;t to opposed to the price when you find something that will address all your hair concerns in on bottle. It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price in gold.  Eunice Johnson  Edgewood, MD</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff - too bad it&#x27;s a little pricey.  A little goes a long way.  Just 1 pump is all I use and it adds a wonderful shine to my hair.  I have color-treated hair and I blow dry it a lot, but this product makes a real difference in the way my hair looks.  It also has a light but very pleasing scent that I think you&#x27;ll enjoy.  I will keep buying this product as long as it&#x27;s available - it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great finishing gel... I use it daily!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while.  While I dont use it every day due to teh cost, I use when going somewhere and always makes my hair so soft and help with fly-aways</li>
    <li> Genuine product From seller . Love kerastase Elixir . Worth every dollar . Transforms your hair</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very pleases with this&lt;br /&gt;shipping was promt and fast&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair smooth and shiny&lt;br /&gt;i would definately re-buy this</li>
    <li> excellent delivery. amazing product, for my blond and dry hair is perfect!!! I&#x27;m so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)</li>
    <li> My hair is medium fine, slightly wavy - which is super prone to frizz here in the Northwest.  I also have 20 inch wavy extensions in brown.  I play a lot of sports and my hair was getting dry and frizzy from sweat exposure, and from monthly coloring.  And, probably from blowdrying/curling/straightening my hair. Go figure.  This product is great in that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair like a lot of serums do.  It also creates a smooth shiny look that lasts until my next wash.  Your hair looks and feels healthy.  I&#x27;ve taken almost a year to go through a bottle, so I don&#x27;t agree with the other reviewers that its expensive.  Try it, you&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else. This product is the very best.I have very fine hair that was dry and destoryed by the flat iron and thought I would have to cut it all off. No way, now my hair is beautiful and looks and feels healthy</li>
    <li> Just spend the money. IT&#x27;s worth every penny. Much better than Paul Mitchell super skinny! I love this and it&#x27;s now part of my routine.</li>
    <li> Save your money!!! a complete waste of money -- nothing but greasy oils combined in a subpar product -- I threw this hot mess away.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Based on other reviews, I expected to LOVE it, but I don&#x27;t find it that much different from my Enjoy hair oil.  It&#x27;s perhaps a bit lighter, but I think Enjoy actually helps the frizziness a little better.  The Kerastase smells lovely though.  They&#x27;re both good products.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times, as I just recived it. So far I like it. it makes my hair very soft. What I don&#x27;t like is the smell. I read another review saying the smell was very stong,and I thought &amp;#34;the stronger the better&amp;#34; how bad could it really be? But it is very over powering, a good smell just too strong. Otherwise I like the product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky. No gunky residue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. And I feel smell well after i use it. I like it and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great poduct, pricey but worth every penny. It smells delicious and tames any frizz and thirsty ends, leaves a beautiful mane all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and 1 to 2 pumps is PLENTY! Will last mon&lt;br /&gt;ths &amp; months!</li>
    <li> Guess there&#x27;s a reason this is in every high scale salon. Amazing stuff. I have hair that&#x27;s been bleached for years and it was getting drier so I used this on the advice of my hairdresser and cannot believe how shiny and silky it is. totally worth every cent!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect! At first I couldn&#x27;t believe that it would be worth the hefty price tag, but when you consider that it can replace multiple products (leave-in conditioner, heat protectant, straightening cream, and shine serum), then it is reasonable. The pump dispenser on the bottle is perfect too--much better than alternatives. This never feels heavy or greasy and leaves my hair smelling great and healthy. I have naturally frizzy/wavy hair and this product reduces almost all my frizz without heat styling. After using for over a month, I don&#x27;t have any split ends and its been over 6 weeks since my last hair cut ( I usually have a lot by now!). This is a great product to increase the health of your hair and increase time in between hair cuts, especially if you&#x27;re trying to grow it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m on my boyfriend&#x27;s account btw, I&#x27;m a woman with medium thickness hair to my mid-back)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, and use it every day. My hair is medium, all one length,  fine, but I have a lot of hair. It&#x27;s the kind of hair that slips right out of barrettes, won&#x27;t hold a curl, starting to have some grey in it. This oil does not weigh down my hair at all. I can get up in the morning, spray a little water on my hair, rub a little oil through, and it looks great. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, and it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good even for my not-so-thick hair!!  I apply it on wet hair after washing and let them dry naturally. As a result, I get very healthy looking, shining hair! Normally, they are fluffy after washing and I have to straighten them. No need to use iron with this elixir! 100% happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered it, its great and as magic for my little girl hair and helped in combing ;)</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Makes my dry hair soft, shiny and manageable. It great for everyday styling as well as overnight treatment. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised</li>
    <li> K ultimate is an amazing product. It&#x27;s like a fix all for hair. But, what I was sent was old off brand k ultimate. It was from sometime when they partnered with a person (I forget the name) and it had a second logo on it. I&#x27;ve been using k ultimate for 4 years usually buying from a salon or the kerastase site directly (hello free samples!) and had never seen the style of packaging I was sent. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and it was like someone just sent me oil. Nothing like the real thing. I love amazon but wouldn&#x27;t use it to buy hair products again.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan oil for the past year and besides the intoxicating scent of Moroccan oil it pales in comparison to Kerastase elixir. I immediately noticed a huge improvement to my fine color damaged hair. It looks thicker and healthier, not to mention the amazing shine. The scent is not bad and not great; it doesn&#x27;t stand out it just kind of smells like any other hair product. I am officially sold on this product!!</li>
    <li> It is so much better than regular hair serums.  Nice and light.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for my hair.  I have asian long hair to my waist.  I smooth this on and my hair just glistens and is super soft!  Great product!  No problems with it at all!</li>
    <li> Love this product and mostly ALL Kerastase products that I have tried in the past.  I use this to wear my hair wavy, in conjunction with the Moroccan oil curl defining creme!</li>
    <li> We love Kerastase products and the quick delivery service provided by the  Amazon supplier.</li>
    <li> My Girlfriend loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this product! My hair is so smooth after using it. And it smells really good. The price is a little bit high but it definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Smell is good. I use it after I wash my hair. But I think shipping is a little bit slow. It takes almost two weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something new in an oil for my hair and found this through my hair dresser - love it.</li>
    <li> great  product  gave  it  to my  hairdresser  daughter  and  she  is  now  using  it  on  all  clients.  buy  it I  promise</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but make my hair smoothy!! Pricy though. Anyway I like it like it like it like it like it</li>
    <li> Worth the price; this product was recommended by my hairdresser and it helps my hair stay smooth even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I like the serum but not sure if Im &#x27;in love&#x27; with it. I dont really like the smell, although its not horrible. It absorbs well into my hair. I noticed the difference most when I initially used it, but now it seems like any other serum I have used. Im glad I tried it, but I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll buy it again considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;After using it for over six months I know now that I wont be repurchasing it. For years, Biosilk seemed to work consistently for me. The Chi serum is unofficially one of the top on my list. When I use the Kerastase serum, I mix it with the straightening serum. It seem to work somewhat better. Pretty much, this is like any other average hair oil. I am glad I got to try it so that I know for a fact it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair; when I got inside my car and looked into the mirror, I could not believe the shine and the delicious smell.  I have coarse and curly hair which I do straighten now and then so using good products on my hair is a must.  This Elixir Ultime is wonderful, adds some hydration, shine and a great fragence.  I would not be without it.  Well worth the money.  One tip, do not use a lot of it, otherwise, you hair can be greasy.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this product is the best!!! use before wash the hair and leaves a delicate scent and ready to brush!!!</li>
    <li> The results are much better than I would have guessed. Silky, almost glossy, and yet soft like my hair had just been washed with rainwater. I&#x27;ll be sure to carry some with me on trips, especially in summertime when drying out is a big issue.</li>
    <li> Kerastase elixir is better than that cheap Argan oil that is hyped now.  I love this stuff.  Shipment came fast, in sealed package.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after receiving a sample.  It is far and away the best oil treatment for my gray hair that I have ever tried; I use it before I blow dry my hair.  Just put a tiny drop or two on my hands and rub them through my hair, blow dry and style, and I have smooth, silky hair for days--even after I shampoo and style again.  Love the fragrance, too; some say it reminds them of Tom Ford&#x27;s (very pricey) scent Black Orchid.</li>
    <li> This oil is terrific!  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair like other oils can.  Adds a wonderful shine and makes your hair nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product at a salon and although it was a bit pricy, it is definitely worth it! The bottle has lasted me two years and I use it every time I shampoo. You only need a little bit. Leaves my hair in great shape, never dry, and it also makes it super shiny,</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have tried different hair product but this is the best!! leave your hair shine and not greasy its easy to use.I will recommend this product no doubt!</li>
    <li> So I read and listened to a couple reviews on this stuff and people were singing its praise. I bleach my hair and you know the toll that can take on it so I thought I would order it, I am not impressed with it, I don&#x27;t feel like its done anything to my hair and I absolutely don&#x27;t feel its worth $40.00. I hope this helps someone else save their money and look for another product. Good luck</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the salons where my wife buys it for herself. Not an imitation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic products. I have ever sensed. I choose the best hair essence.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked healthier before than now since I start using Kerastase Elixir Ultime. This product prevent spliting the hair and keep a natural shine.  I noticed if I don&#x27;t use it, my hair doesn&#x27;t look the same after I style it.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy and wavy hair.  I use a small amount of the Oleo Relax Slim on towel dried hair, then brush and ponytail until dry.  Once dry, I smooth a small amount of Elixir Ultime to give my hair extra softness and shine.  My hair has never looked healthier, with smooth, shiny waves!&lt;br /&gt;Update -- Products are lightweight and not greasy at all.  Just make sure not to use more than a kidney bean sized amount.</li>
    <li> perfect oil. i have been use it long time and will keep buy it as long as it availble .. it protects my hair and gives it shiny and healthy look</li>
    <li> I have a very curly hair and it is hard to find a product that make my hair looks neat and not sticky. this product works and I like it. But I have to say it is a bit pricy. I might buy an alternative after this.</li>
    <li> smells awful, cheap , toxic strong smell. Does nothing special..save your ££ and go for products much much less expensive</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hair oil.  I have relaxed hair and have tried DOZENS of hair oil. This one is by far the best for my hair.  Soothing, protective, almost weightless and smells great.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, though it lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have coarse Asian hair and regular use of this Elixir has made it completely soft, smooth, and far more manageable!  You don&#x27;t need to use much of it, just one squirt into my palm and onto the ends of my hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  Great product, far better than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried (which is MANY!)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing. makes your hair soooo soft. so shiny and beautiful. I love it so much, very much! try it!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on me one time and I fell in love.  I love how soft and shiny it makes my hair, and the scent is wonderful. I oil my hair usually once a week with my own concoction of natural, home items, but this is wonderful to use every evening before I go to bed also.  I find that if I use it in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready it&#x27;s good as long as I plan to let my hair air dry.  If I&#x27;m planning to style it, I guess I put too much in my hair, as once I dry it and then try to curl it, I&#x27;m trying to curl over the oiled sections and it doesn&#x27;t turn out quite as well.  So I will put this in my hair the night before and the next morning it&#x27;s wonderfully soft and pliant. I will definitely buy more of this.</li>
    <li> This product was indicate for me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I like so much this product and was delivery faster&lt;br /&gt;For sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
    <li> Anybody who is familiar with Kerastase knows it is a luxurious product that is exclusive for a reason... This product is not supposed to be sold on Amazon.... I hope that whoever the seller is, Kerastase revokes there contract... Not trying to be rude but this is ruining our brand.....</li>
    <li> Love this and what it does for my hair. My hair is color treated with a lot of grey running throughout. This smooths my hair and helps make it look soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this product. I use it after washing my hair and it makes it shiny and glossy. Simply love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I have fine hair that I flat iron but never seemed able to get it to look like they do in the salon, until now.  My hair tends to run oily, but this hair oil never makes it look greasy.  I use a drop the size of a pencil eraser and is plenty for my shoulder-length hair and the shine and smooth look lasts all day. I have used this daily for over a month and made barely a dent in the bottle.  The smell is amazing and the product is superior to similar products I have had samples of including Moroccan oil, argan oil and aveda products.  You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I felt this was EXTREMELY overpriced for around $60 when I bought it. It did nothing more than any other product I have tried for less than $10. I will not be using this again. The people that really talked this up must not have extremely dry hair. Very disappointed and upset for wasting my money.</li>
    <li> This product has transformed my hair. I will continue to buy it after this one runs out. I love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It smells good and hair is not too greasy after applying one big squirt to my foot-long ponytail.  Very useful for winter with the dry air and static from poofy jackets.</li>
    <li> Great product, have had tons of &amp;#34;beautiful hair&amp;#34; compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it! :-)  If you want to add vitamins and shine to your hair, you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> too oil, just works fine</li>
    <li> I have wavy, dry, over processed hair.  I know there is no miracle out there short of cutting it off that will help what I&#x27;ve done.  However, this is a nice product (albeit expensive).  I am using it after shampooing as a protectant from blow drying and it does help to smooth my hair.  I also use it in between shampooing to help calm the frizz.  There is a greasy feel to my hands, but not to my hair after applying it.  I have used too much smoothing serum in the past and had to wash because it looked greasy, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that at all.  I will be purchasing again.    UPDATE: 1 year later: I am on my 4th bottle of this stuff.  Like other reviewers, I am a \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot;.  I think this is the only product I have purchased this many times - EVER. I am now letting my hair go curly (healthier) and thought I would share a few other ways that this stuff has been helpful to me.  I use it with wet hair right before a small amount of gel - I flip my hair upside down - sopping wet - run 2-3 pumps of this through with my fingers. Then I scrunch with a small dab of gel. Then I usually diffuse my hair. I think this helps with frizzing (along with the gel) and helps decrease the dry time.  I then will use a small amount to tame any frizzies and to add much needed shine.  As others have mentioned, some products can cause break outs if they touch your skin. I have acne prone skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product personally.      I originally gave this product 4 stars and just \\&quot;upped\\&quot; it to 5.</li>
    <li> Love it. Best product for thick dry hair and best price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Just  1 pump for hair 2&amp;#34; below shoulders, that&#x27;s all it takes. Conditions hair, make it soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> People were right the scent is very fragrant and because of my headaches I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, and every stylist I go to says that you have to use hair oil on your ends when you have long hair, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with tons of split ends.  I decided to go with the big guns and bought this.  I still have split ends, but hopefully I have less?  It smells nice and makes my hair shiny, but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper products that could have given me the same result.  I told my stylist that I use this and she said it&#x27;s the best on the market, so who knows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot if you want, but I didn&#x27;t really see split-end results.</li>
    <li> This makes all the difference for my unruly hair.  It just takes a little bit rubbed through my wet hair to make it shinier and easier to manage after I blow dry it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great price!</li>
    <li> Works very well but it smells kinda gross.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great packaging. Brand new. My hair tends to get dry and this product is a miracle serum. I place it in wet hair after a wash and then blow out. My hair feels silky and soft. Great on extensions too.</li>
    <li> Best treatment for dry curly hair. Helps to grow my hair. Good for hair tips. I apply it on wet hair after washing every time. No oil effect.</li>
    <li> The best product ever!!!! I can&#x27;t live without it.  This can be used as a leave in a conditioner in fact I mix with the ultime conditioning mask and leave in for an hour minimum. I next put a couple of drops in after washing and you can use anytime for a blast of shine and hydration.  Did I mention the delicious smell? It&#x27;s luxurious to me.  I can&#x27;t be without it!! I use everyday, I&#x27;ve had it since February so it last a while. Worth every single penny.  You must try if you have damaged or dry hair, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, yes really;)</li>
    <li> Great Product for my thick hair.  Requires just a few drops.  Makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but seems to work well. Only need 2 pumps &amp; my hairs shoulder blade length.</li>
    <li> This is the most amaizing oil for my hair</li>
    <li> Nongreasy , helps manage curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long (past the middle of my back), super curly hair that I like to wear straight with a straightner (else it is a huge curly/wavy frizz ball -- not pretty) and then curl to give it a long wave look using the barrel of a curling iron.  Because my hair is so naturally curly on its own when I straighten and then curl it, it generally gets SUPER frizzy.  This product is great for eliminating the frizz!  I have tried tons of products thus far in my lifetime including, CHI, Bumble and Bumble and even another Kerastase product and this one far beats them all.  I put a little in my hair before I blow dry it (or let it dry naturally) that way when I apply the straightner, the product reacts to the heat perfectly and provides shine and smoothness, making my hair SO soft and silky (which I have never had with my hair ever before in my life!).  I also apply a little bit (not much @ all -- like half the size of a dime) to my hair once it is done being straightened to kind of seal the look.    Use Tips:  Make sure to apply primarily to the base and ends of your hair and then with the remainder you can spread over the top of your hair at the roots (this ensures that you will not have even the slightest of a \\&quot;greasy/oily\\&quot; look).  I like to apply on my hair before I blow dry and then apply a little after I am 100% completed with my hairstyle.  A little of this product in one use goes a long way.            Yes, it&#x27;s on the pricier side for the Kerastase product line, but it is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Just use sparingly to increase its life.</li>
    <li> Other kerastase products have disappointed me but not this one. This light hair-oil/elixir gives an instant boost to parched hair and an incredible softness that lasts for 4-5 days. Have finally figured out my mantra to eliminate frizz..a really good flatiron, kerastase nectar thermique and this heavenly elixir!</li>
    <li> I tried Shu U&#x27;s Essence Absolue Oil and this beats it and is cheaper! It is fantastic!  I have fine, dry, wavy, overprocessed hair that I straighten almost every day and this makes the blowout easier (one squirt on wet hair) and then smooths it all out after I flat iron. Fab!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive products but lots of chemicals so I have not used again.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the delivery and not with the product. Already requested the money back.</li>
    <li> I have used three of these in the last year, it is part of my routine when I wash my hair.  I have shoulder length, thick, color treated hair, that I wash and hot roll every other day, mostly.  I love how it soft and smooth this stuff makes my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very special product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It controls the frizzes.</li>
    <li> Never received...my card was charged but I never got this item.  I wish I had read the poor history associated with this individualsselling profile and I would have never ordered it in the first place.  With such poor ratings, I am surprised that Amazon allows this individual to sell.......It is frustrating to have to be at the mercy of irresponsible individuals who take your money and never deliver what they promised.  Please read the feedback left by others before you decide to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought it for nearly three months, have to say i won&#x27;t love without it! i usually pump 1&amp;half to my damp-dry hair, then keep blowing until it&#x27;s completely dry. My hair feels so smooth and soft every single time after i used it! (i&#x27;m not sure if its work for my splits)</li>
    <li> Love this product,. My hair is so soft shiny and beautiful.</li>
    <li> ok product. not really worth the money to me though. found a product with same benefits for like 1/8 of the price.. Organix.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair product I&#x27;ve tried that made a visible difference. Right away it made my dull, dry hair soft and shiny again. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is that I also tried Organix Argan Oil, which looks and feels similar and works the same way, and if there is a difference in the results, it&#x27;s too small for me to see it or to justify the difference in price (the Argan oil is $6.99).</li>
    <li> This product does not leave your hair oily or grimy.  Does not weigh your hair down. Your hair is conditioned and looks vibrant. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used a million (okay maybe not a million) hair products for defrizzing/protecting/nourishing my hair and this one is the best ever.  I have long blonde highlighted/lowlighted hair that is about mid-back length and it is a challenge to keep it soft and healthy looking, particularly here in the Middle East heat.  This product handles everything I need it to.  I don&#x27;t use spray in conditioner or anything anymore, just about two pumps of this on the ends and distributed through the length after washing, then hair dry/style.  The smell is subtle and I love it.  My hair shines and is really manageable.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product....all the others out the window.  BTW- prior to this I used Moroccan Oil for a year, and this beats it hands down, plus it doesn&#x27;t come in one of those leaky glass bottles.  Half of my Moroccan Oil was in the box when it arrived.  This has a turn top that locks to prevent leaking.  Love love LOVE!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever bought. I use it after my shower, after I brush my hair. It has lasted me a very long time, and I use it every day. I only need the smallest amount, and it fills my entire hair. It keeps it shiny, eliminates frizz, and the curls in my hair are flawless whenever I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a hugely dramatic difference when I do not use it (if I don&#x27;t have it with me for whatever reason), and I am definitely going to get it again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get it out, I recommend unscrewing the cap and spreading the straw on your palm. It gets more than enough on its own. I don&#x27;t like using the pump because it&#x27;s a puzzle trying to catch the stuff after it is pumped, and half of it gets on the bottle anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply it, I suggest separating your hair, and placing half of it on one side in front of your shoulder and the other half on the other side in front of that shoulder. Then after putting the gel on your hands, grab one side of your hair with one hand (as far up as you can grab), and the other side with the opposite hand, and pull your hair all the way down until your hands have completely come off your hair. Then stroke your hands (with palms flat) on the top of your hair. And any left over should be combed in your hair with your hands. Then I brush my hair thoroughly. Until I did it this way, it would make my hair greasy somewhere because too much of it would be in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, this is a must, especially for people with frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Best product of its kind</li>
    <li> The promises are BIG, but I suppose it cuts some of the frizz - not a lot. The scent is fine - not bothersome at all. I&#x27;ve tried using it prior to styling, and after. Frankly, because it seems like straight oil, I feel like I&#x27;m turning my hair into bacon if I add heat to it...I think I made the frizz worse.  Now, I just use it after styling to cut down the frizz. After it is gone, I&#x27;ll probably stick with a cheaper anti-frizz oily product.</li>
    <li> This oil smells like heaven, and leaves my hair just moisturized and light, not too heavy. Feels like I had a hot oil treatment at a high salon.  Can use a little every day to keep hair smooth without getting too heavy or oily feeling.</li>
    <li> My hair is blonde-brown. This adds very good shine which makes my hair look healthy, untangled and it feels soft.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife. We live on well water which is tough on her hair but this seems to help I am glad I found it</li>
    <li> This is a great oil product - smells nice, won&#x27;t weigh hair down, I highly recommend it to those who need smoother and shinier hair.</li>
    <li> I always use different type of Kertastase, the one helped to improve my look. Thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! first time using it I can tell the difference in the blow drying it&#x27;s a lot smoother shiny and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have dry hair &amp; this product helps so much!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best of the best. If you know anything about hair products, you probably already know how the K&amp;eacute;rastase brand is viewed in the hair industry and beyond it: it&#x27;s pretty much the best you could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;This hair oil is more than just hair oil, it actually nourishes the hair from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this item for the first time after watching a YouTube video explaining how it should be applied, which helped me use it. I don&#x27;t think URLs are allowed on reviews here, so if you guys want to check it out, you can look it up on YouTube; the video is called &amp;#34;How to properly apply Oils &amp; Elixirs to your hair&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s by YouTube user ElleBangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this has worked actual wonders on my hair without weighing it down or anything. My hair was damaged from coloring, heat, processing, all that good stuff — and now it&#x27;s manageable and soft, and I only use this product after washing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble finding a hair styling product that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair stiff. I have been using mouse however the hold wasn&#x27;t great, this stuff has no stiffness to it what so ever and my hair stay&#x27;s the way i want it to all day long. Works great on my thick wavy hair,I am a guy and I highly recommend this for mens hair, great great stuff I&#x27;d pay $80 a bottle for it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Very light pretty smell. Leaves hair shiny not oily. Second time I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner without hair feeling oily. One pump is all you need even with my really long hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product. After buying it at my salon, I found it cheaper with this company. I recommend this elixir to all my friends. A little pricey? Yep. Worth every penny. They shipped this very quickly and my order was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it is a full bodied oil with a subtle fragrance.  I used pure argon oil before, and this mixture of oils is the same if not slightly better.  The dispenser closes, so that the fragrance will last.</li>
    <li> My first introduction to this product was that my hairdresser started using it on my hair.  I just loved how it felt and feels.  It is not greasy and does not weigh my hair down.  I have very fine hair and struggle finding products that do not weigh down the hair.</li>
    <li> I use this every time after I wash my hair after towel drying it. A little goes a long way. It keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this on damp hair and again lightly after styling. Hair is so shiny and soft!&lt;br /&gt;All the Keradtase products are amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It keeps your hair soft and protected all day without looking greasy. Other products tend to feel heavy and make my hair look awful by about hour 5, whereas I feel like this product continues to work through to the next wash.</li>
    <li> I just think it&#x27;s not worth the price. It&#x27;s an award winning product, that&#x27;s why I got it, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that good. I mean, there are other products out there that are cheaper and can give you the same result or better. Besides, if you have fine hair like mine, you should use just a little bit of it, so your hair doesn&#x27;t get all oily.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I am not a great fan of how Moroccan Oil smells and the stuff I TRULY love&lt;br /&gt;() is being discontinued AND does not go very far if you put on as much as I need to now with longer hair than I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  In fact, I think it smells like a dead fish.  So there is that right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence, but my  hair started falling out a few days later.</li>
    <li> This serum is the BEST. My stylist switched to this after using Shu Uemura Hair Oil Essence Absolue for a couple of years and I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful my hair looks using this product. I have dry relaxed hair and this product makes all the difference. My hair feels like silk and shines beautifully. I looks very healthy also. Shu Uemura is nice but it is nothing compared to this. Now my hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon! As many reviewers have said, use a little at a time to determine how much you need so you avoid having greasy/oily hair.  It&#x27;s expensive but you will not regret buying it and it will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The salon I go to used this after I had my hair highlighted. I just loved the way it gave my hair beautiful shine &amp; manageability. It was not greasy or heavy. It made my hair bouncy&amp; full of body. it got rid of any frizziness too.I have used every product you can think of but loved this the most. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product on my hair every time I get my hair cut and colored. She recommended I use a small amount while my hair is damp, and then again after I&#x27;ve blow-dried my hair. This elixir has helped my very dry, frizzy, colored hair look a lot more shiny and healthy. I use it with Kerastase shampoo and conditioners, which also have helped my hair look healthier than it has in years.</li>
    <li> using as a leave in conditioner for long hair with wiry grays.  helps to keep it all tangle free &amp; shiny and less crazy cat-lady like.  .  less one star for fragrance. even though it is mild compared to some.  why do all hair products have fragrance?  Postmarked from France!  really!?</li>
    <li> Loved the sample size I used.  Now I find that it really weighs my hair down and feels too heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> Great for southern humidity control</li>
    <li> Just a little drop of this serum goes a  long way. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a fantastic, smoothing effect on hair. Non-greasy and wonderful for controlling fly-away, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> You cannot use a lot, start with a little to the ends first.  The trick is for it to build up in your hair maintaining frizz.  My hair never looked better!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 24 year old daughter and she loves it...and she is very particular about what she uses on her hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.. along with Nutritive Sublimateure... switch off alternate days.... Both items were originally won at a benefit auction ... never looked back</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product! I have never tried the Moroccan Oil so I cannot compare it to this product but I love this stuff. My hair has been dyed many many times and I wash it daily so it is quite dry. This product leaves my hair tangle free, easy to style, and healthy looking. It is super light also. The smell is more musky than flowery but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that I straighten daily. It&#x27;s very fragile/thin and breaks off easily. Additionally - since it&#x27;s so frail - it can look greasy easily - I can&#x27;t use heavy products. I use this leave in conditioner daily and it never makes my hair look greasy. I wash my hair every other day and it looks just as good on the second day.</li>
    <li> After reading the raving reviews about this product, I was very eager to experience the miracle serum for myself! I have naturally curly hair prone to frizz and have gone through many a serum (generally a BioSilk user). With an upcoming move to Costa Rica, I knew I needed something to tame the frizz. I hate to say it, but I have been very disappointed with the frizz control of Kerastase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason I haven&#x27;t seen the life-changing results of Kerastase is that I wear my hair in its naturally curly state. I don&#x27;t use any sort of heat on my hair (I didn&#x27;t even bring a blow dryer or straightener with me to CR). It seems that everyone who loves this product uses it before straightening/blow drying their hair. If this is you, then buy Kerastase! It will definitely keep your hair silky after applying heat. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something to tame the frizz and compliment your curly style, I suggest you move on.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Arrived at my house very fast. Have gotten multiple compliments on my hair since I started using this!!</li>
    <li> I have semi-dry, wavy hair that is auburn in color (natural red streaked through brown). I wanted to try this product for a long time, but since I had invested in new bottles of Moroccan, which I have been devoted to for 4 years, I didn&#x27;t want to spend more or switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changed when I got my hair cut at a new salon that only has Kerastase products. After the blow out, my hair felt remarkably smoother, looked more hydrated, didn&#x27;t tangle as easily, resisted humidity (I live in India where the humidity is epic!) and was shining like it hadn&#x27;t in years. I am 29, and my hair has gotten slightly duller in the past few years - once this product was on, my hair looked 10 years younger! Of course, salon blowout always make you feel like a million bucks, but this one was different. I bought the product and have never received so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific reasons I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cuts down on blowing time - I don&#x27;t know how, but my hair blows out more quickly and with less effort. I think it is because the brush glides through more easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look \\&quot;brassy\\&quot; - other products really tint my hair orange/red, making my hair look brassy over time. That has gone away with this product and I&#x27;m happy to have my natural color back.&lt;br /&gt;3. Improves the condition of your hair over time - I live in India where dust, pollution and UV rays can wreck your hair, especially if it is already a little dry, like mine. Since using this product, I have notices less breakage and hair-fall and more hydrated, healthy looking locks.&lt;br /&gt;4. Has a mild smell - the smell is pleasant but very mild. I can wear a perfume and not have too much going on, or go sent-free and just smell \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; but not perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;5. Lasts and lasts - forget the price of this product and buy it. It lasts forever and will improve the condition of your hair. How much do you spend on trims, conditioners, hair spas, conditioning packs, etc? Add all that up and eliminate it - you won&#x27;t need any of it anymore. So really, you are saving money. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things and firmly stand behind this product. Until something better comes on the market, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for my hair.  It smooths and makes my hair smell like flowers.  I have been buying it for the past two years.  My fave for now!</li>
    <li> like it okay, not sure if worth the price</li>
    <li> Very good. Made my hair straight and soft</li>
    <li> Received better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again</li>
    <li> I love it, great on my fine hair</li>
    <li> This hair oil goes on easily.  Your hair is not greasy after using it.  It smells really good.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> regardless of the price, this is my number one go-to hair product!  it smells amazing and keeps my hair in tip top shape.  this product turns your hair into gold, foreal.  i recommend this to anyone looking for an all-in-one hair product.</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in the feel of my hair since using this product almost daily. And.. it leaves my hair smelling AMAZING:)  Oh, and I also wanted to mention that I have thick, somewhat coarse hair and have used this for months and still have a bit left before I&#x27;ll need to reorder, so it really does last quite a long time!</li>
    <li> I read about the product in a review of hair care products for greying hair.  The review was excellent, and the bottle was said to last a long time.  First, I tried it and found that it was no different than other silicone based products that I&#x27;ve used.  As the day goes by, it loses its hold and my hair frizzes up.  I&#x27;ve had the bottle a month or so, and it&#x27;s already half used up.  So, I&#x27;d think it lasts 2-3 months, if you spread it liberally on your hair.  My hair is short  and dry and greying.  It wasn&#x27;t the anti-frizz solution I hoped for, and won&#x27;t re-purchase when the bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I love Amazon and have gotten all my previous bottles of Ultime here.  But the last bottle of Elixir Ultime I was recently given as a gift  (bought from Amazon) wasn&#x27;t quite right.  Either it had been in the warehouse way past its&#x27; expiration date or the seller ( this is just a hunch, I have NO proof of any of this) diluted the mixture with something else.  It felt too thick and the scent was off.  Usually it smells terrific but this bottle smelled too chemical-ly and like it had gone... bad.  For the heck of it,  I checked on the Kerastase site to see how much more it would be to buy from them directly and it wasn&#x27;t too terrible, about $10-15 more than Amazon.com prices with shipping.  Not great, but since I only buy one of these bottles a year, I am willing to pay the extra $15 bucks for the real deal instead of risking $45 on something that may have gone rancid and I&#x27;ll have to throw away, just to save that $15.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. It was too strong and clashed with my perfume.</li>
    <li> I use a dime sized amount before flat-ironing and OH MY WORD this product works wonders! Smells great and gives my hair a nice smooth shine. Great product but don&#x27;t overdo it... try a small amount first and workup from there if you need more.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair, very disappointed especially considering the price I paid.  I gave it three weeks waiting for these miraculous results to happen.  Nothing.  Hair still frizzy and actually felt kind of yucky from it.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> great product. long dry hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and smoothes unruly frizzy ends, also is exactly the same product I can get in my salon, just cheaper!</li>
    <li> Works well for frizzy hair. It lasts for a long time. Not oily at all. One bottle can be used for a long time</li>
    <li> Hair is shiny , easy to use, lasts a long time. You only use a little and I have long hair. I would refer it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell and too greasy</li>
    <li> My hair looks better with this product.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have found in years!!!!  I will never be without it again.  It made my hair shiny and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Great for normal hair and adds a good shine. Very light texture without greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is very nice with the reflective back sticker and handy with the lock.</li>
    <li> works very well on colored/dry hair, without leaving a greasy residue.  I highly recommend it for colored/dry hair, requires very little to work.</li>
    <li> Use just one drop and your hair is silky. You can let it air dry or style it, either way your hair is soft and manageable not greasy . Love it!</li>
    <li> I have never found a serum that I like until this one. Usually they make my hair feel dirty and greasy. This one just soaks into the hair and makes it so soft! I took off one star because I am not crazy about the scent. It&#x27;s quite strong and last for a while. But it makes my hair so wonderful that it&#x27;s worth putting up with. So even with the scent I still highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After shampooing and towel drying my hair, I put 3 drops in my hand, lightly rub hands together and then through my hair.  Best thing I  have found to keep hair looking healthy and soft for days.  I have color treated hair that tends to be dry, especially in winter</li>
    <li> Bought this product exactly 2 years ago and still have some product left. A little goes a long way! This has been one of my favorite hair oil products I&#x27;ve purchased. At first the price put me off but lasting for 2 years and the results it gives are completely worth it. I have very thin frizzy hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes it feel silky smooth. I will definitely be buying another bottle after this one finally runs out!</li>
    <li> This is the best product i&#x27;ve ever used for my hair!!It&#x27;s amazing!After already third using i can see the difference!!!I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used morrocanoil before and ionix argan oil but Kerastase bits them all. Gives my hair shine and luster, so soft and super absorbent on my fine hair, which is important, because other products weighed it down. It needs only one pump, I have medium length hair, so it lasts long. Superior Kerastase product.!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It will make your hair shine and stay healthy.  Very good price point too and should last at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> I am very blonde, My hair is also very thin and mostly permanent extensions. Because most of my hair is not my own, it does get very dry and dull. This is my absolute favorite product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put about 2 squirts in my palm and put throughout the tips of my hair (avoiding the scalp) while wet. I immediately blow dry after application. Whenever I used this my hair will ALWAYS feel silky and soft. It just boggles my mind at the difference between using this and not using it. My hair becomes soft and silky, it also appears to be very clean and split end free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also good to use for dry hair on the day after washing. Try some dry shampoo followed by a squirt of this and its as if I showered earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT for every blonde with a dry lifeless hair issues. and Especially if you have hair extensions, like myself.</li>
    <li> I like the serum but don&#x27;t really like the smell. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it isn&#x27;t lovely either. It absorbs well into my hair, but it seems like any other serum out there. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy again considering the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase products but this one was disapointing. I would not order again. The only good thing is it does make your hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS ELIXIR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY AND THIS OIL TAKES FOREVER TO FINISH...I LOVE KERASTASE!!!</li>
    <li> I use Kerastase after i iron my hair.After use it my hair looks smooth and glossy.I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I use this oil and love it....I saw that Beautogen had it for a lower price....what i received is not the same oil it smells different and made my hair frizz and feel like straw!!  I asked to return but it was not with in the 14 day policy...I had not started using it  right away as I still had some left.  When I opened the box the bottle was different  I looked up on line and saw it was a limited edition bottle..so I thought It would be ok.  As soon as I put it on my hair it felt different...thicker , did not adsorb instantly as the real oil doesI contacted Keratase customer service and they informed me that  I should purchase their products from authorized salons or direct from their website.  I learned a lesson....instead of  saving 10.00  I lost 45.00  I will never buy these products from Amazon  again.</li>
    <li> OMG it makes my hair so soft and gets rid of the frizz! Amazing! Only complaint is that it tends to slightly weigh my hair down. Will def keep buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - this bottle lasts for a long time! Just 2 pumps a day is all it takes to turn your hair into silk.</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy hair and this smooths it out making my hair more curly and manageable. Have used it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Nothing leaves your hair more soft than this wonderful oil! And it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel oily--it&#x27;s very light weight and leaves your hair with a very silly feel. If you&#x27;re a swimmer, this is a must-have product. It will really help to soften your hair from chlorine damage.</li>
    <li> Make my hair softer and less dry. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I have thick,  coarse hair.  This product tends to give it more volume than I was looking for.  May try again when my hair is longer to avoid the bush.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I wish it came in a bigger bottle though! It&#x27;s not greasy which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend who has some of the best looking hair.. ever.  I am never a hair gimmicking person - but decided to bite the bullet and get it.  I love it.  VERY small dab for my mid-length, thick, nearly 50 year old hair.. but it really does work.  I also purchased a flat iron and when I have the time to spend, I achieve a great look.. thank you!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product. With every penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great; loosens any knots, keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It arrived as promised, great service.</li>
    <li> The real thing.  FOR SURE!!  I compared it to the original one that I bought at the salon and it&#x27;s the same.  The scent and the effect on my hair, all the same.  I must admit, I was skeptical in purchasing this from the other reviews I had read. But, this purchase was a positive one.  Love this product!  Makes my long gray hair beautiful!  I am always getting comments of how beautiful my hair is!!</li>
    <li> It is  excellent for my hair applying it on the tips</li>
    <li> It did not work on my hair or address the static or freezy strand, i am totally disappointed considering that kerastese brand is known for high-end premium quality product.  If this product was sourced from a dealer and not direct from Kerastese exclusive distributor then this might be another imitation, made from china fake merchandise.  Amazon please ensure that you only deliver genuine authentic products to your customer.</li>
    <li> This product busts my face out horribly. No matter how I try to apply it, some always manages to get on my hands or face and the next day I have a face full of pimples. For weeks, I tried to figure out what was happening to my complexion until I finally realized it was the oil in the serum. I hate it because I think this is probably a nice product and with it&#x27;s steep price tag, I hate to see it just sitting on my vanity. I&#x27;m 30, well over my acne years and never have break outs aside from using this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Leaves my hair smooth and straight and the frizz is gone.</li>
    <li> No great product, my hair is worse after use it. I do not recomend this oil.</li>
    <li> I try literally every product to smooth shine and moisture my hair.  After one use I was amazed the kinky hair at nap of neck from aging was straight and silky.</li>
    <li> as expected. on time.</li>
    <li> Great product for enhancing the quality of your hair. One should take into account that using excess of oil can make you hair look greasy. Just two drops are enough</li>
    <li> I use and love several Kerastase products, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;Two reasons:  first, this serum doesn&#x27;t perform any better for me than other serums that cost less.  I&#x27;m a model for print and television and I expect above average performance if I&#x27;m paying above average price.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, straight, long, light brown/dark blonde, and I color it with high and low lights. I&#x27;ll give this serum to a friend with long, dark, curly, coarse hair.  Maybe she&#x27;ll see better results.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it smells like a heavy, cloying perfume.  My husband and a co-worker both noticed and commented, but did not compliment the smell.  That&#x27;s not the effect I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the company&#x27;s Specifique products but stopped using them because of the heavy scent.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Resistance Force and Volumactive lines because they work well and have a MUCH lighter fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be the only Kerastase customer who likes to wear a light touch of quality French or designer perfume.  I don&#x27;t want hair products that clash with or dominate that.  My work also requires me to be in close proximity with others and many people are allergic or sensitive to strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the company would lighten up on product scenting across the board.</li>
    <li> workd  good and helps</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees. Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price. Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale. So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff. Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper.... but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys. Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a product for my hair. However, I received samples of this oil in my BirchBox twice and after I&#x27;d used every last precious drop I decided to splurge on more. Just a tiny bit makes my hair soft and shiny. It also smells amazing. It seems exotic and luxurious and adds something nice to the drudgery of getting ready for work on cold winter mornings.</li>
    <li> I  didn&#x27;t think any product could control my frizz - so I just kept trying them all - but I think I finally found my answer.  The kerastase arrived a few days ago, and I immediately tried it.  I also use a leave-in conditioner first - and than kerastase.  After 3 days, my hair still looks good - and the frizz is not noticeable.It adds shine that the leave-in conditioner alone does not do for my color processed hair.  It remains to be seen how my hair behaves in the hot, humid, Florida summers.  But, for now, I am truly pleased</li>
    <li> This stuff is addicting! I wish I knew about it sooner and will never go without it again. Must buy for the summer!</li>
    <li> Love it... Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  Works like a miracle.  Can be used on wet or dry hair.  A little goes a long way only need 1 or 2 pumps.</li>
    <li> Kerastase Exlixir Ultime works extremely well on both corse and fine hair.  You only need an amount about the size of a pea and work it well down to the ends before styling for shiny glowing hair.  I also use it as a deep conditioner a day or two before my color service to protect my hair from damage.  I have very thick wavy hair prone to being fizzy and my daughter has very thick but fine hair with waves and we both love this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! My hair is super smooth and shiny with it (it&#x27;s very dry in Tucson...), and I like the smell. Also, it showed up when it said it would...and the price was about $10 cheaper than the salon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over two years and apply it once while my hair&#x27;s wet and a little after heat styling. It leaves my hair feeling, looking, and smelling great. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice on Amazon and haven&#x27;t had any issues with authenticity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results of this product, my hair looks shinier and healthier than ever. I have received lots of compliments, and I just keep smiling...</li>
    <li> Love it! Made my hair super duper soft when my hair is stiff and strawlike. Would def recommend this to others. Super pricey but worth the the price.</li>
    <li> This was offered to me at carlton hair salon. After my hair trim,  my hair dresser applied this on my damp hair. Oh boy was i convinced! I immediately searched in amazon and bought it. This is awesome. Not oily nor heavy or greasy on the hair. This is perfect just to give the hair the healthy gllistening look it needs. The smell is also very suttle and pleasant.  I always apply it  on my damp hair after shower, and whenever i am using  flat or curling iron to make my curls bouncier. My hair feels so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a  four stars because of the price. Forty something dollars is a lot of money to shell out for a hair maintenance  product.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel a difference when I use this product in my hair. I usually use it before intense heat styling episodes, and it does a great job. The smell is pretty strong; I can smell whiffs of it throughout the rest of the day, but nothing that bothers me too much. My hair feels a lot softer when I use this product, and I highly recommend it for others who are looking for a quick and simple heat-protector and softening treatment for hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but my bottle had a crack in the bottom and it&#x27;s been leaking.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Makes my hair very silky. Smells divine. Has transformed my hair I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product does not meet expectations. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery which was surprising since it had to make it all the way from England to me, but it is an awesome product. Love it.</li>
    <li> The bottle was about half empty, when I received it. Apparently, it leaked during shipping. I contacted seller, but they were not very helpful. I&#x27;ve been using what was remaining in the bottle, but I am not even satisfied with the product. I heard rave reviews about this product, but I do not understand what the fuss is all about. The serum is a bit sticky and heavy on my hair, even when I used a tiny amount. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to improve the condition of my hair, so I probably will not be ordering this product in the future. They only nice thing I can say about it is that it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great product, absolutely love this oil, I put it on after the shower while hair is still wet and it leaves my hair velvety soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have chemically processed hair and this elixir is a Godsend! The oil is lightweight and smells divine! I like to use 2 pumps on my damp hair after shampoo and conditioning. Then ,I let my hair dry naturally, before it is totally dry, I run a warm blow dryer through my hair to complete the drying process , then I add a pump more of the elixir on the ends of my dry hair before I flat iron. The results are INCREDIBLE! My hair ALWAYS comes out super shiny , bouncy and sleek! I am constantly getting compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks and my husband compliments the softness! If you are on the fence, I say DON&#x27;T HESITATE! , Just make sure you get the ORIGINAL PRODUCT IN ITS SEALED PACKAGING and you will be fine!!</li>
    <li> My hair is so alive because of this product.!! LOVE IT.!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair soaks it up!</li>
    <li> I only got this serum in the mail today but I couldn&#x27;t wait to get online and rave about it! So I have long naturally dark hair and I have it died ombre blonde currently. You can imagine how damaged my hair must be. I use Kerastase shampoo and condition and usually air dry and flat iron my hair straight once or twice a week. No matter what product I use (Moroccan Oil or Shu Uemura) my ends always look so dead and dry like a little rats tail. I washed my hair today using my regime of Kerastase shampoo and conditioner and put 1 pump of the Elixer Ultime through my towel dry hair. I let my hair dry about 80% and then I blow dried it in sections using a round bristle brush to smooth out the ends. After that I used my Paul Mitchell flat iron on a low heat setting and ran through my hair very quickly just to get any little kinks out. My hair feels absolulty amazing. It never looks or feels this great. I kid you not my ends look like I just got a fresh hair cut because this serum gave my hair life again. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or heavy at all! I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my friends about it. Next up on my purchase list is theKerastase Resistance Fibre Architecte Renovating Dual Serum that has clinically proven to seal your split ends so you no longer see them! Cant wait!!</li>
    <li> Kerastase products are the best hair care ever. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> There are so many brands of hair oils but this one for me has been the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  A friend of mine had this when I went on vacation with her and I tried it and I magically had fabulous hair! Then she told me how much it was and I wasn&#x27;t sure about the cost!!! But it is soooo worth it! I have long naturally curly medium thickness hair and this stuff just makes it smooth,soft and wonderful and it smells good too! I use it when my hair is wet and after I am done styling it whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking greasy either...I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Kerastase Elixir Ultime is the best hair tamer! I have thick, corse hair that falls just below my shoulders..I use 2 pumps worth and work it into wet before blow drying.  I use an additional pump after blowing drying but before using the straightening iron.  My hair ends up silky smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The quality of the watch is not good, a piece has broken and I can not fit. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not received at the address provided in the Kerastase oil. I left for Brazil and I contacted the seller, who said he had come.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the responsible of the house and she received a notice to seek the product in the mail, ie, the product was not delivered.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this product you need to. It is the best of its kind. A little go&#x27;s a long way</li>
    <li> Cannot remember how many bottles I&#x27;ve used. They are just my choice of the life</li>
</ol>
