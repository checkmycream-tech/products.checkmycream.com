      <li>Nice product!!</li>
      <li>It does smell very good though</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a very good skin firmer.  </li>
      <li>This cellulite cream has worked incredibly well with extended use and exercise, and it starts working in about two weeks.</li>

      <li>I have used these type of lotions before and found them helpfull along with exercise and a healthy diet.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, this Nivea serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be making a noticeable difference, but I will be sure to keep using it and will note any changes I see.</li>

      <li>and besides try it while you are sticked to a working out programme so you can heal the cellulite and hide it for now :)</li>
      <li>It smells okay</li>
      <li>when I put it on my legs they fill so smooth and nice , but it&#x27;s a temporary effect product.</li>
      <li>Given this, I decided to buy 2 more bottles and got them online this time.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The cream work ok,</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>it will even over-power your favorite perfume or fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love it but wish it had more in the bottle</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it really smoothes the skin - great to save it for when you are going out &amp; wearing shorts, swim suit, etc.  </li>
      <li>I simply LOVE this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll let you know in 30 more days how it&#x27;s going.</li>
      <li>It diminishes the look and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I understand that it wasn&#x27;t going to work like magic</li>
      <li>The more you use it, the more results you see.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this item before, I love having a serum that I can apply along with heavier creams and lotions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product does NOTHING but make your skin soft.  I bought 4 bottles and have seen absolutely NO CHANGE in the appearance of my cellulite in a month.  Waste of $$$ Ladies....</li>
    <li> Product as described and fast shipping. Thank You! :)</li>
    <li> I firmly believe that these &amp;#34;surface&amp;#34; serums and creams do a great job softening your skin, but that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I noticed a difference in less than 7 days and after 10 days the was almost no more cellulite on my thighs or butt. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone with a minor cellulite problem because it really does work!</li>
    <li> After reading all the Amazon reviews and doing a bit of research on google, it seemed that the Nivea serum would be a product with great results for such an affordable price. I was a little skeptical as it isnt an expensive treatment but there were so many positive reviews on Amazon that I had to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a little about me first, I am 25 years old, slim, fairly toned, do high intensity workouts at least three times a week, have a good diet but unfortunately have a noticeable stubborn dimple that I cant get rid of and some slight cellulite texture on the back thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the serum for about three weeks now and have seen no change what so ever. I do admit, I may have forgotten to apply it a night here or there but either way, to me this product hasnt made even a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed as so many people posted positive reviews, I honestly dont know how it can have such positive reviews. My only suggestion is that it is better used on someone bigger with a lot more cellulite than someone slim, fairly toned with a small amount of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I will continue using the product, this time more effort in massaging and with a cellulite massager and see if that makes any difference. Update will come soon.&lt;br /&gt;But for now, wouldnt recommend it-dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I noticed that Nivea took the word cellulite out of the title. It does smell nice and is not sick or sticky. I have used it for months, and have not noticed any firmness in my skin more than usual. I think that in terms of actually firming your skin, this product does not work. It does however smell nice and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it, but I have a concentrated area of cellulite on my thighs.  I have tried other Nivea cellulite products in the past, and they DID work for me, but not as fast and extreme as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)Works Fast - High Payoff -- I saw results the first day. Even asked my VERY skeptical husband, he agreed, smoothness was happening!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Smells nice and this product has an excellent slip which makes it easy to massage into thighs.  I spent a few extra minutes deeply massaging to get some circulation going - this really helps. I was taught this by a therapist in Hungary, who was an EXPERT at cellulite massage.  Just deeply massage cellulite areas, always going up the body!!  Doing it with this serum is like magic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Compact packaging is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) No color stain or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is a little sticky.  But considering the results - it doesn&#x27;t even bother me.  If dries down in about 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I read that this product stops working if you STOP using it.  This is the way ALL cellulite products work -- so that is no big surprise to me.  Personally -- I just want my thighs to look good fast!!  That is exactly what this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an event or a vacation, start using this at least 1 week in advance so you have some improvement in appearance.  This is a MUST try!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this serum it does nothing but make your legs tacky and sticky.  I used it for 6 weeks every day&lt;br /&gt;and it did nothing. It&#x27;s a joke.  Try something with retinol and caffeine.</li>
    <li> I went through various expensive creams until my friend recommended this. I was astonished when I saw visible results, it really does help. Only downside is that it is very sticky, I wear a pair of gym shorts after I apply it to let it dry.</li>
    <li> It works for a couple hours but overall, Not working for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t know if it really firms your skin, but it makes it very smooth. I mix it with my regular lotion. It smells lovely too!</li>
    <li> Does not work- save your money</li>
    <li> I must admit this does work rather well. It is much cheaper than the more expensive creams and starts to work after about 5 to 6 days. For best results I would recommend having someone vigorously massage it into the problem areas.  I would defiantly try this first it does not remove all cellulite but does make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It smells great and works well, I put it on every time I finish showering. Nice to know there something out there that can take those cellulite away.</li>
    <li> I did notice an improve in about a week or so, but just as soon as my cellulite began clearing slightly I realized my rear was covered with zits. Every where I applied there were zits. The product is almost gone now and I look a wee bit better, but this is something I will not buy again and try another so called \\&quot;miracle formula.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Its says in the packet that :Skin becomes smoother in 10 days, appearance of cellulite visibly reduced after 10 days..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reallyyy???????? I used two bottle ...yah skin became soft .. but i haven&#x27;t noticed any visible change in my cellulite ....Still waiting ... to see the result</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff before. It seems to work ok but you must use it everyday. It makes the skin tighter and smoother. However--- if you have lost weight and have loose skin, it&#x27;s not going to help that, it will just help it look not so bad.  Cheer up girls, there are worse things that life can hand you.</li>
    <li> This is great especially if like me you cannot have caffeine in your beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular use over a week or so it did diminish the appearance of my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is already pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford the expensive brands that contain caffeine those will do a bang up job on your cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are on a budget or you cannot have caffeine then this is  great option.</li>
    <li> Just got it so the jury is out as to how effective it is.  I hope it works.  I use it daily after showering.</li>
    <li> Only works when u use it like a body wrap with cling wrap. Kinda small too. But I&#x27;ve bought before so I already knew what I was getting</li>
    <li> This stuff really truly works. My skin is 90% smoother and the celluite apperance is virtually gone. I am extremely happy with this product and will continue to use it1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with cellulite, even though I exercise (weight training and cardio) five or six days a week and eat really healthfully.  I&#x27;ve noticed, however, that since turning 38 last year, my cellulite has gotten worse, so I&#x27;m trying to do something more aggressive about it.  I started using this 10 days ago, and so far I have noticed maybe only a *slight* reduction in the appearance of my cellulite.  It&#x27;s just as visible as it has been on the backs of my thighs, although I do have to push harder on the front of my legs to see it.  For now, I&#x27;m giving this two stars since I was hoping that the appearance of my cellulite would be much less than it is after using it for 10 days, which is when the product description says you will notice improvements.  (I will also  be sure to update my review after using this for a few more weeks to see if there is any positive changes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this once a day (at night, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the stickiness on my clothes, just my pajamas), I&#x27;ve also been massaging my thighs in the shower with a cellulite massager like this Bliss one [[ASIN:B001MVOI7M Bliss Slimulator 1 ea]] that I picked up from the Body Shop a few years ago.  Hopefully the combination of the two will help as I use them for a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had tried the regular Nivea cellulite cream ([[ASIN:B001FB5IQO Nivea Good-Bye Cellulite Gel-Cream, 6.7 oz (189 g) (Pack of 2)]]), but I got lazy about using it since it&#x27;s super sticky (much stickier than this serum), and you have to use it twice a day to see results.  The directions for this serum say that you only need to use it once a day, which I&#x27;ve been doing, but maybe I will bump it up to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve ready that these creams only work as long as you keep using them and that your cellulite will return once you stop using them, I also decided to pick up [[ASIN:0312334613 The Cellulite Solution: A Doctor&#x27;s Program for Losing Lumps, Bumps, Dimples, and Stretch Marks]], which offers suggestions on how to make your skin stronger, so that the cellulite doesn&#x27;t poke through the top layers. I will write a review for Dr. Murad&#x27;s book once I&#x27;ve integrated his recommendations for six weeks.  In the meantime, this Nivea serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be making a noticeable difference, but I will be sure to keep using it and will note any changes I see.arks]], which offers suggestions on how to make your skin stronger, so that the cellulite doesn&#x27;t poke through the top layers.

    <li> I have been thinking about trying this product for about a year now, but i was not sure about the results that i was going to get. I have been using this product for only five days so far and i have already noticed that most of the cellulite on the top of my thighs is gone! Most of the cellulite on the back of my legs is gone, but it has only been about a week so I am continuing my use of this product for a couple more months to get ready for summer and bikini season. I highly recommend this, especially for a quick fix. Just give this product two weeks or so and most of the visible cellutlite goes away. The cellutlite in the deep layers of skin will take longer to go away but don&#x27;t be discouraged. Just apply the product and rub ur leg downward, not up, and massage it deep into skin. I have also noticed that when i press down on my thighs, less cellulite is visible already. (Another plus) and the price is great!!!</li>
    <li> I had used the cellulite serum from Nivea before (the one depicting the girl running, just like in this picture) and it works. I got great results after my first bottle. Given this, I decided to buy 2 more bottles and got them online this time. Such a disappointment: This is a different product, it is not the CONCENTRATE as the picture shows. The serum feels different, and the box looks different as well, it has a big Q10 on it, and no girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they shown the right picture, that way I could have avoided trying a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wrote the review, the picture was updated. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. You will see results in the first fourteen days for sure. I love it. It is well worth the money if you want to get rid of a few patches of unruly cellulite. I honestly think that anyone who gave a negative review must be really overweight and need exercise instead of a good quick fix. But, if you&#x27;re like me and slim and just have a few places that need to be de-cellulized- this product will definitely work and quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of cellulite products, and this seems to work the best. Definitely has a noticeable impact on cellulite after a couple of uses. However, if you don&#x27;t use it regularly, the cellulite will come back (as with any cellulite product). It is also very sticky, so you have to wash your hands after using, and give yourself a couple minutes before getting dressed. If you&#x27;re going to spend your money on a cellulite product, I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I used this serum last summer for several months before going on beach vacation and I have to say it did make a noticeable difference in the appearance of my cellulite. My skin became smoother and less bumpy. I also seemed to slightly diminish my stretch marks but I would have to say the results were not that noticeable until I had been using the product for about 3 weeks, and I continued using it for several months. Avon used to have a product that worked just as well and more quickly but it was unfortunately discontinued. I have noticed that this product seems to work more effectively if you actually massage it throughly into your skin as you are applying it. This serum is a little tacky but dries quickly. Overall, I think it is a good product and does work and that&#x27;s why I am now back to order more before my next beach vacation.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I found it a few months ago.  I absolutely love using it every day, its time to order some more!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am surprised. I did not expect to see a difference. I HOPED I would, that&#x27;s why I bought it. I&#x27;ve used it every day for almost 3 weeks now and I see a difference. Mostly in the lower butt, upper thigh area. That was my problem area, so it&#x27;s a WIN! I use this at least once a day, after showering. Sometimes I use it twice. OKAY! I admit I might have skipped a day or two. Bad me. I&#x27;m gonna keep using this daily, can&#x27;t wait for more results. And I&#x27;ll be recommending this to my gals.</li>
    <li> I have used these type of lotions before and found them helpfull along with exercise and a healthy diet. .&lt;br /&gt; I use this product for over 2 months (morning and night) and didn&#x27;t see much improvement. The bottle is small and runs out fast! The consistency is kinda sticky and dries fast so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it effectively to massage it in and it felt a bit uncomfortable on my skin. I also do not like that it has a smell to it. For the price I was expecting something better or at least more product.</li>
    <li> For me this serum works temporary , like make up, when I put it on my legs they fill so smooth and nice , but it&#x27;s a temporary effect product. The consistency is good .</li>
    <li> Well.. as much as I love Nivea! This is too little product and really. not what I EXPECTED. But I guess it helps.</li>
    <li> I like the product, however it looked like it was open already or tampered with. It was good enough for 4 uses, and I used this product before everyday, bought from a store, and it definitely had more uses that just four times. Using every day I had it last for at least 1.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome thingy! Made my skin (as well as my sister&#x27;s) visibly smoother and firmer after 2-3 weeks of daily usage! Gym + Nivea Q10, and you have it!</li>
    <li> the label says results in as little as 10 days. I have been using it for almost a week now, and I do see results! I love it! I will continue to reorder just to keep up the firmness of that I have been working on. I will admit, I don&#x27;t work out, and I don&#x27;t diet. I am an average sized woman, 5&#x27;2, 140lbs, and I have areas that could use improvement.. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now and I can already tell a little difference.  I will continue to use</li>
    <li> Not a miracle worker, mind you, but hey, at this price point, it is unreasonable to expect so. I do like this serum and when used daily, I believe it helps to some degree.</li>
    <li> Good product. For basic skincare.</li>
    <li> I brought this product, used it, not sure if anything can get rid of cellulite , but working out. So thats what I did. Got off my but and worked out my legs. They are looking better and than I may put this on.but I don&#x27;t think it will work alone.</li>
    <li> it is a very small bottle hope it works bout and it didn&#x27;t come in a box so I don&#x27;t know how to use it properly</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Works best when u get out of the shower and rub into your legs and butt in a circular motion.I use it right before I decide to wear shorts and it tightens my thys instantly. The only problem is that the bottle is so small and it only lasts about seven days😢 other then that great product😊</li>
    <li> This product is ok, have not seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> It works and arrived very fast. You will need to use at least four tubes to see it but it drastically reduces the appearance of cellulite with regular use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it over 2 months, and the cellulite still the same :(&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t this it works at all, save your $$$!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. i saw no results after wearing it everyday for a whole month, what a waste of money</li>
    <li> Now I work out, so its not like I am expecting a miracle...but I really did not see any improvement. I bought this for a beach trip just hoping to help. Its cheap in proce for a reason. I would do a little more research and maybe spend a little bot more on the next one.</li>
    <li> NOT ONLY DID IT NOT WORK it STINKS! Rather just use coffee even though it makes a mess! Do NOT waste your money.. The shipping and service though was great!</li>
    <li> If only these products will do what they claim. These companies should be held accountable for false advertisement. Let&#x27;s see.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nivea Gel Cream in the past with ok results, but I wanted something that would work a lot faster than the four weeks that it takes. I took a chance on this, and I am SO glad I did! I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle! I have a fair amount of cellulite on my thighs, and because of this I have not worn shorts in probably the last 5-10 years, and I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s. After using this, I have been wearing them every chance I get. It really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do, which firms and smooths the appearance. Does it get rid of it? No, but it does what it says it will. I used one bottle up and then continued with the gel cream to supplement, and have had fantastic results. The only con, it is slightly sticky/ tacky, so I use it at night and wear old pj pants and it&#x27;s usually dried by the morning. BUY THIS, you will NOT regret it!!</li>
    <li> i brought two hoping that this product works not really seeing a big difference yet, but i will keep using it. i mean i do have two bottles to use lol</li>
    <li> For the price and other reviews I read I definitely wanted to try this product and I think others should as well. Use it daily and as often as you can and you will start to see very slight results. The more you use it, the more results you see.</li>
    <li> So it isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle, but I actually am seeing a little improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it for about ten days and I am starting to see a little less cellulite. I have read that you need to give it two weeks to see any real improvement so I&#x27;m not disappointed. The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell great and it leaves my hands feeling a little slimy but the feeling washes right off and the smell goes away too. I use it right before bed time and it hasn&#x27;t stained my sheets so that&#x27;s great. I do usually walk around for a little while before I get in bed so it is partially absorbed by the time I hit the sheets. Overall, if I keep seeing  improvements I will definitely rebuy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before, I love having a serum that I can apply along with heavier creams and lotions. I cannot attest to how effective it is, because I&#x27;ve never used it alone. Though I imagine it is a good boost to my regimen. I do love how silky it is, how soft it makes my skin, and it has a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this last bottle I received was off. The bottle was correct by the label was pealed off. The color was a much deeper orange that the previous bottles, the smell was a different from what I remember, and it went on much much more oily that it ever had. An hour later and I still had a slick feel and a sheen to my skin. Not sure what is going on...</li>
    <li> I use this with firming lotion and get great results!</li>
    <li> pretty good but temporary effects of course and it gets used up fast</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 months. Overall it&#x27;s the most effective serum and most affordable one. It can make your skin look tighter, maybe go down half a size during use. The defect is once you stop, everything goes back. But if you don&#x27;t mind keep using it, you might see some surprising results.</li>
    <li> I simply LOVE this. It goes on so smooth &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into your skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but I can tell the difference in the firmness of my skin. I&#x27;m 25 a have a few problems with loose skin around my thighs &amp; butt but within the short period I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but over all, I love it &amp; I&#x27;ll be buying more. I will continue to use it. (: I use other Nivea products as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Nivea Good Bye Cellulite Serum about 10 days ago and bottom line is IT REALLY WORKS! I had this whole long speech but who has time for all that? I apply it once a night after a shower and use a sort of deep tissue massage kind of thing with small circular motions first up and down my thighs then I finish off with long sweeping motions all the way up my leg and down to my knee. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference but that&#x27;s what works for me. I would say my skin is 90% smoother than before and I judged my case as severe! I decided to submit a review, which I never do by the way, while here ordering my next bottle. I think I might just order a few because it&#x27;s that good! I hope your results are as good as mine. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t promise to rid cellulite--I don&#x27;t need that anyway--but it&#x27;s a very good skin firmer.  It&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;It just firms nicely &amp; without any greasy feeling.  I will continue using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall Malloy</li>
    <li> This is another cream/serum to add to an already intensive cellulite remover regiment. I&#x27;m not really sure if it works but it makes ur skin feel good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it hoping to get instant results but if you have a cellulite routine this might be a good thing to add.</li>
    <li> Great item. Would definitely buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd bottle - in about 2 months. I use it religiously every day. However, I don&#x27;t know if it is making a difference yet. I am working out and eating clean, so while I am seeing changes in my body, I dont know what is contributing to it. However, I am hopefuly that this will contribute to help firming up my thighs.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I really should have taken a before/after shot because it&#x27;s really hard to tell if the serum is working. I&#x27;ve also been dieting and exercising, so if there&#x27;s been a reduction it&#x27;s likely because of that. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now, which is well beyond how long the box indicates I need to use it to see results. I&#x27;ll keep using it every day (along with the Nivea gel cream) until it runs out. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again, but at least it smells good!</li>
    <li> It does a decent job. Compared to other higher end products, it compares.</li>
    <li> I love the softness this product gives to your skin.</li>
    <li> This serum smells so good (its like a clear gel cream), and it absorbs quickly as well, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth, and it eventually helps even out the skin. It was also delivered in perfect contidion, and in a cute little box</li>
    <li> I have only got to use this one, so far I love it! I love the consistency. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when applying, the serum leaves your legs feeling smooth. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I wish it did more firming.  It makes my skin smooth but not really firming.</li>
    <li> First let me say that if you do not excerise, have loose skin from weight loss, or are overweight, don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I know as I was/am all the above so I know what I am talking about. However, this stuff really works wonders along with my excerise.  It has helped tone up the skin and butt really well.  It is the first cellulite cream that I have used where my husband asked my why my legs  and butt look so much better.  This is a great supplement to diet and excerise to reverse some of of the damage done by being overweight and it has diminished the look of my inherited cellulite.  I am so happy I found this and use it every day. Please don&#x27;t think this eliminates cellulite. It diminishes the look and I love it.  However, flourecent lights are the worse for showing cellulite.</li>
    <li> I went thru 2 tubes of this and didn&#x27;t see any results. Not worth the money :(</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer, this product is great. As a cellulite cream, it&#x27;s a dud. Used it twice a day for weeks on arms and thighs, and saw no difference. The old stand-by is still the most effective: coffee grounds + Saran Wrap, and you&#x27;re good for 3 days. This cream is cheap enough to try for yourself, but don&#x27;t expect results.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency and the smell of the product, but sadly it did not work for me very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it really smoothes the skin - great to save it for when you are going out &amp; wearing shorts, swim suit, etc.  Almost gives you a light shine, too, but smells odd right when you put it on - wash your hands right away after applying, otherwise it is sticky.</li>
    <li> So-so when compared to other products that are supposed to firm.  After several weeks of use, the skin was no different.  Had to constantly use the stuff for any firming to take place and then it left the skin greasy and feeling icky.</li>
    <li> This is a gel-like lotion.  It goes on really smooth and is very easy to apply.  It is absorbed into the skin quickly, is not greasy and has a nice light and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot in the bottle.... However, the truth is that there was &#x27;some&#x27; noticeable change in amount of visible cellulite on my bottom and the back of my legs. I run avidly - about 15 miles a week and my bottom and the back of my legs is still lumpy. I did see a difference but not enough to want to run and throw on a swimsuit. I am not overweight but I&#x27;m not skinny. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 140lbs (muscular legs). Maybe some of the other reviews are from people who have very small amounts of visible cellulite but I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about honestly.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money because it does not work. I did not see any results from using it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything amazing with this product except how fast the little bottle was emptied!  Liked the way it felt though...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  If used every night after my bath I get up to 1/2 inch reduction in my thighs.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion.  Firms nothing.</li>
    <li> best firming serum in the market. wife swears by it. though it&#x27;s not a miracle or surgery, she works out a lot.</li>
    <li> Ok have not seen a change</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 17, I just started noticing I had cellulite. Not a lot, but enough. It was on the side of my thigh in a concentrated place, my butt slightly and under my butt. I&#x27;ve never had cellulite before so as soon as I notice I started to figure out how to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up pop, all I drink is water no sports drinks only pure fruit smoothies every so often. I gave up fatty foods, anything unhealthy really. I eat fresh fruit for breakfast, brown rice, salmon/a lean meat, almost everyday. I&#x27;ve been doing squats, leg lifts, and lunges every day too. I bought this serum from my local walmart THREE days ago, yes three. I&#x27;ve been applying it every morning after I shower and before I go to bed for the last three days and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am. My cellulite is close to gone. Keep in mind it has been THREE days. After the first day my skin was so smooth and it&#x27;s only gotten better. I massage the serum into my skin reallllly deep. It almost feels like I&#x27;m bruising the day after but it works. I recommend this product combined with a healthy diet and leg exercise and hope you love it as much as I do. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Worked excellently! Love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pearson that likes to do an hour of yoga everyday and runs 3 days week and was really getting discouraged with my cellulite. I&#x27;m not over wieght at all, so i just didn&#x27;t understand &amp;#34;WHY ME?&amp;#34; i tried a few other products and have only been using this for a week and have seen more results than i had the whole month of each other kinds of uses.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  After using for just a short time, I am actually noticing a difference (or my eyesight is getting bad!).  Nice product!!</li>
    <li> The product claims results in 10 days, I tried for 15 days and nada. It leaves a sticky residue. I might have used too much each time since I wasn&#x27;t getting any noticeable results, and this product just barely lasted the 15 days. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months and have noticed the skin above my knees and backs of legs appears firmer. However I haven&#x27;t noticed much, if any, difference in cellulite. But I am 45 years old and don&#x27;t get nearly enough exercise and honestly believe if I toned up my muscles this product would be more beneficial relative to cellulite.</li>
    <li> i find that because of the smell, i don&#x27;t use it as often as i would the gel-cream.  it usually use them together, but lately i haven&#x27;t been as diligent with the serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product with the Nivea goodbye cellulite gel. I&#x27;m not sure which one of them does that magic effect but this product DOES REALLY MAKE CELLULITE GO AWAY!! It&#x27;s not a treatment you have to know that but what it does is that it makes your skin more stiff so it looks like you have been working out for quite time. Like any cellulite product if you stop using it your skin will get back to the same cellulite look. But why quit using it :) It&#x27;s not expensive anyway and besides try it while you are sticked to a working out programme so you can heal the cellulite and hide it for now :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy it, it really works... and i had really a bad cellulite problem, now I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s a past :)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cream to remove your cellulite it does not exist, and you shouldn&#x27;t buy one expecting that. This product does what it says, tightens the skin and reduces the appearance of the cellulite already there. I found it absorbed best when I exfoliated with sugar and a bit of water before I put it on, and do a firm massage upwards on the legs while applying it. The massage also helps encourage lymphatic drainage and reduce cellulite. I have Stage 2 cellulite and when used twice a day this helped bring it don to a Stage 1 appearance.</li>
    <li> I think it did work but only lasts two weeks so a little expensive.  Avon used to have a great product but stopped making it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect any miracles with this product. I&#x27;ve used this for the past two summers to get rid of cellulite. I put in on my butt and thighs. I also do a lot of toning exercises when I start to use this product. I am a poor college student so I can&#x27;t afford to use it during the cold months, and usually I slack on the healthy lifestyle during that time as well. This cellulite cream has worked incredibly well with extended use and exercise, and it starts working in about two weeks. I have almost no cellulite as long as I continue to use it once to twice a day. Once I stop using it, the effects also stop. The cellulite comes back and so does the low self-esteem :&#x27;( If the cellulite stayed away exponentially then this would be a five star review!</li>
    <li> And it&#x27;s not just my imagination. My skin looks much smoother. Use it 2x a day for it to be most effective.</li>
    <li> My Keratosis Pilaris is gone! I can&#x27;t believe it! I began noticing a difference by week 3 and now after two months it&#x27;s totally gone. I can finally show off my well-defined biceps. I&#x27;m a happy girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as firming my skin, I can notice a slight change but nothing significant. However, I&#x27;ve just added Nivea&#x27;s Skin Firming &amp; Toning Gel-Cream along with Nivea&#x27;s Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion, so I&#x27;ll let you know in 30 more days how it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> item provided very minimal to almost no results. Disappointing because the other customer reviews were so promising. I understand that it wasn&#x27;t going to work like magic but I expected some results.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t see any difference after using for several weeks. i expected the appearance of less cellulite after the \\&quot;10\\&quot; days as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product was effective, but it made me feel better using it anyway. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when it comes to these types of products. But I really believe its working! I started using it only 8 days ago. I apply 2 times/day to my thighs and buttocks, and my skin does appear smoother. I haven&#x27;t changed my diet or exercise routine so it has to be the serum! I&#x27;m thinking of using the moisturizer as well. It&#x27;s a bit fragrant for me, but it&#x27;s not awful. It does dry quickly, which I like. I&#x27;m just wondering though, how long the tube will last. All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product so far, especially because I expected it to be a wasteful purchase!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Can see little changes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 already, &amp; nothing!!!!!! Followed the directions exactly as on box, but no difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work for some people but i had bad cellulite for years and i can finally see some improvement. i even started wearing thongs!!! :D i put it twice a day and of course i also exercise which helps us so much!! i would completely recommend this to anyone that wants to get rid of the bumps!!!</li>
    <li> Gave it four stars because I am not sure it&#x27;s really working.  I&#x27;ve been using this pretty religiously for a month now and only see slight improvements.  Granted, since most of the problem with cellulite lies in diet I should probably try harder to stay the course - hence four stars, since it&#x27;s mostly my own fault. It does smell very good though, it&#x27;s quick to dry and it keeps my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Seems to help, but in my case exercise also may have played a role. Will still continue to use though.</li>
    <li> On my 2nd bottle don&#x27;t notice a difference. A little greasy but not bad</li>
    <li> Yes i do like this product but is not the same as the blue gel i used before,&lt;br /&gt;The blue gel made my skin look more firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thnx Christine</li>
    <li> Love it but wish it had more in the bottle</li>
    <li> Good price and exactly what I ordered time expected.</li>
    <li> The cream work ok, but they got my skin pretty greasy.  I was using this product and saw a little difference but it started to get pricey with no amazing results. I ended up buying a beauty brush instead to brush my skin before a shower, and months later my cellulite has gone away much. I would highly recommend the brush instead.</li>
    <li> I started using this along with \\&quot;Jergens skin smoothing lotion\\&quot; with hopes but no real expectations...i am amazed! I stopped using this product everywhere and now only use it to target my problem areas. I have recently lost pregnancy weight and gained jowls...now for the first time in my life I actually have a jawline!!!</li>
    <li> It smells okay but it didn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks and I&#x27;m really not seeing much for results.  Maybe just a tiny bit of reduction in cellulite.  I like the way it feels on my skin though and I do think it smells good, I&#x27;m just not sure how effective it actually is.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and seems to be working.  Bought other brands for a lot more money and this seems to be working better.  Save money and buy this.  Great buy.  Price is way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product and I can&#x27;t really tell how well it is working as I do not using daily. It looks like it may be working but just takes a while to see the full results. I suppose if I use it regularly I would be able to see a significant difference. Not sure I would order this again but at the same time, I wouldn&#x27;t discourage someone else from buying it as the product just may not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the first kind of this type of product that I have tried.  I saw no change in the appearance of the dimples on my legs. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Works great..it does make a difference!!!</li>
    <li> I love this non-greasy, light,  refreshing skin toner after bathing and feel it does help firming of skin when used as directed.</li>
    <li> While the product felt nice and cooling on application, it has such an overwhelming fragrance that I had to return it. If you are sensitive to heavily perfumed product, I would definitely recommend that you remove from the box and do a whiff test before purchasing. It has that very strong, over the top, cheap artificial green tea scent to me that lingers until you shower. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so strong it will even over-power your favorite perfume or fragrance. If you find the scent pleasing, give it a try because it does glide on nicely and according to other reviewers, I suspect that it is effective for the reduction of cellulite. Regretfully, I could not tolerate the fragrance.</li>
</ol>
