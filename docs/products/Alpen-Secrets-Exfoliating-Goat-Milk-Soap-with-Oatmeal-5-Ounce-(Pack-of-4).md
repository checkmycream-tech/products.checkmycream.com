      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>it was just the right amount of scent and he loved that it helped with exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Nice, but not as soothing nor as much rich lather as the CANUS Goat Milk Soap.</li>
      <li>A friend told me to try a goat milk soap, that it helped with her childs sensative skin, (we had been using Aveeno oatmeal body wash for her, which she alternates between that and now the goat milk soap), this was the first brand we had tried, and loved it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> feels really nice on the face.</li>
    <li> I did not experience any major change in my skin after using this product. It&#x27;s just not abrasive enough to exfoliate my firm skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Love the tiny subtle scrub beads in there. Feels like a mini massage every time I use it. Smells fresh and clean in a very unique way not found in common brand name soaps.</li>
    <li> Nice, but not as soothing nor as much rich lather as the CANUS Goat Milk Soap.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar homemade brand of goat&#x27;s milk oatmeal soap at a farmer&#x27;s market for $5 a bar, but honestly I prefer the Alpen Secrets Exfoliating Goat Milk Soap even better.  For one, it&#x27;s FAR less expensive per bar; secondly, the bar&#x27;s size is much larger; and lastly, my skin just feels better.  It&#x27;s a high quality soap that delivers fantastic results.  I love the smell too- very sweet.  And it makes my skin smell the same, and feel super soft and clean without drying it out.  I&#x27;m totally hooked on it, and can never go back to normal soap again!  It feels like a treat and a splurge to buy this soap, but really, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> I am a vegetarian and try not to buy animal-dependent products but on a whim I bought this at a Duane Reade in NYC ($2.79 a bar). I won&#x27;t use anything else now. Whereas I used to feel that I needed body cream, I don&#x27;t, and only bc of this super moisturizing soap. I am fair with medium to dry skin, not oily at all. I don&#x27;t usually use it on my face, but don&#x27;t see a problem there. Just try one bar and if you like it, save and order in bulk.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the early delivery and fair price. This product was okay. If you&#x27;ve never used goat&#x27;s milk soap I highly recommend it. This brand is not my favorite but it still left my skin clean and moisterized without that residue that other bars leave behind. For the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This soap latter very well, the soap is mildly scent. My skin is not itchy withy this soap, like the other soap I use. This is a good purchase for bar soap.</li>
    <li> This goat soap is the greatest ever. There isn&#x27;t any goat milk soap available locally but I would  order this soap anyway it is just simply the best.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, leaves skin feeling soft, and doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin. It&#x27;s gentle enough for the whole family!</li>
    <li> This is a good soap at a reasonable price.  It cleans well, is gentle on the skin, and lasts a reasonable amount of time.  There is a very faint aroma, likely from the ingredients, but it&#x27;s pleasant and not perfume-y.  Got this for the husband, who does not like scented products and has a grungy job.  He likes it enough that I&#x27;ve put it on the Amazon Subscribe-and-Save list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED:  I am bumping my rating down due to inconsistent product quality.  I&#x27;ve order this a couple times.  The first batch was great.  Other batches have just melted away to nothing in a few short showers.  You never know how long it&#x27;s going to last batch-to-batch.  Will not be re-ordering due to this.</li>
    <li> I love this soap . It smells nice but not overpowering . It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and after using it in the shower for couple of times I started to use it to wash off the makeup at night . It feels better then some expensive face washes , I don&#x27;t get any rushes or blemishes from it .</li>
    <li> I like it pretty much. It&#x27;s a bit creamer than the expensive stuff.  I will buy again since it is such a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good and I&#x27;m very like it! It&#x27;s so good and I&#x27;m very like it! and my friends all like it!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today.  I loved the feeling of cleanliness it gave me without the annoying order of perfumes.  I have a skin condition and I look for something to help stop itching and so far this item is great.  I bought it in bulk and I think I will be very happy I did.</li>
    <li> makes you skin feel new again</li>
    <li> I am on my second bar of this soap. The first one lasted a month using it daily. The soap lathers well and it is gentle enough to use every day. I have ultra sensitive skin and have had no problems with it drying or irritating my skin. I will purchase this soap again!</li>
    <li> About six months ago I bought this soap and was very pleased. It was rich and creamy. My newest shipment says &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not nearly as good. I will be looking for a new soap now. I&#x27;m REALLY disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would help my recently discovered skin allergies, and it&#x27;s great.  I was not very happy to be going from body wash to soap but this has proven to be a great fix to my problem</li>
    <li> this soap is great.  Lathers up very well and leaves you feeling very clean.  I would recommend it. It&#x27;s a better price than some of the other goat milk soaps out there.</li>
    <li> That is what it is described as soap is a good product</li>
    <li> Its good for a dry skin. And its a good price. And I can found only here in amazon.com, my favorite website.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this seemingly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product would be fragrance-free, but it is not. Sadly, I cannot use it thanks to my allergy to fragrance.  It makes a nice gift, though for my non-allergic friends.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of soft skin especially in the winter...and my tub stays much cleaner!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s all we use now (the lavender type is great too). It lathers up beautifully and leaves your skin feeling soft.  A bar lasts much longer than regular soap and you can use it down to the very last sliver without it breaking up into pieces, like most soaps..  Best thing, though?  This soap leaves absolutely no soap scum on the shower floor or soap dish.  For that reason alone I would use it.  I highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable, but this soap finally addressed my acne. It has a very gentle scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have very oily skin and this works great.</li>
    <li> This is really a terrific exfolliating soap at a reasonable price.  The soap has a very pleasant fragrance and lasts quite a long time.  All things considered, it&#x27;s not too much more expensive than your standard supermarket bar soap.</li>
    <li> This is a very good goats milk soap bar.  With the winter weather drying out your skin, the goats milk soap moisturizes your skin with every wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap a week, and a half now with no sign of it helping my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s just another bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up alright, and that&#x27;s good, but so does many others.</li>
    <li> I try and find healthy soap and this soap is especially nice because it is longer lasting than my other healthy soaps while at the same time not irritating to my skin.  Goats, good job. he he</li>
    <li> For the first time, my husband actually commented on how much he loved this soap. it was just the right amount of scent and he loved that it helped with exfoliation.</li>
    <li> My skin feels very soft with this soap.  I can&#x27;t be sure about the exfoliating.</li>
    <li> This soap is non drying and leaves your skin feeling clean as well as hydrated, not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumey residue so you can wear your perfume without a conflict.</li>
    <li> I orginally purchased this item for my daughter, who has extremely sensative skin. This product, which I now use as well, didn&#x27;t dry out her skin as other bar soaps did, even the more expensive ones. A friend told me to try a goat milk soap, that it helped with her childs sensative skin, (we had been using Aveeno oatmeal body wash for her, which she alternates between that and now the goat milk soap), this was the first brand we had tried, and loved it. It has a pleasent odor. Lathers well. Softens skin. I highly recommend trying this bar soap.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice feel too it.  Also it is a good size and has lasted two weeks in the shower so far and still going strong.  I don&#x27;t love the smell though, so I won&#x27;t be ordering again. The scent is fairly subtle, but to me it is lightly grandmotherly.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I bought several bars and shared with two of my neighbors. They tell me they now are ordering some for their family</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this brand. Having been using for many years and happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and clean and a delightful scent!</li>
    <li> Was going to try until I saw it has DMDM HYDANTOIN in it.  No thank you to a antimicrobial releaser preservative that releases formaldehyde!  WHO WOULD INTENTINALLY PUT &amp;#34;Formaldehyde&amp;#34; on themselves?</li>
    <li> I really like this soap!  I have used the other brands before but this one is a first time for me.  It has a great fragrance and leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Been using for my child&#x27;s eczema because people have claimed that it helps with keeping the skin supple and not so itchy. have not seen the benefits thus far.</li>
    <li> The soap gives a good lather and does not irritate sensitive skin.  However, it does not seem to clean that well because deodorant residue is usually left behind on my underarms after showering.  I&#x27;ll just stick with Canus Goat Milk Soap that lathers and cleanses thoroughly.  Nice smelling soap though.</li>
    <li> Almost everyone in my family has dry, sensitive skin. In the past, I used to purchase another popular brand of goat milk soap. I stumbled across this brand and I have been in love ever since. Not only does the soap smell really wonderful but it also has a nice lather to it. I am not itchy when I use it . Best of all, I love the price for 4 bars of soap.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It is the only soap I use.  It feels great when using it in the shower and leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Product brand has always been excellent. However their new formula does not have the same impact on my skin and I am unable to source the better stock</li>
