      <li>I can say it was my oopsie, but i didnt know it had a screw off top!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>The Orabrush Tongue Foam is amazing when it is used with the Orabrush tongue cleaner.  </li>
      <li>cost effective, I think.</li>
      <li>But the product comes in handy.</li>
      <li>This foam works well; I&#x27;m sure that my breath smells much better too!</li>
      <li>It is nice and refreshing.</li>
      <li>However, it is very cheaply designed.</li>
      <li>I started using the gel, but the foam is easier and more</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The top became undone</li>
      <li>I use it with the Orabrush brush, and just re-ordered more foam.</li>
      <li>i am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>but this is an especially nice taste left in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I need to do more research in order to know if this Orabrush tongue cleaning foam is working or is another gimmick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, you can get more for your dollar elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I love the mint flavor and it works for me.</li>
      <li>&quot; more of my food.</li>
      <li>I like the Tung gel better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the tongue gel</li>
      <li>I use it with the orabrush tongue cleaners (which I love).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it does no harm</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a foam than a gel, which takes some getting used to.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but you can use tooth paste that works even better in most caepse, but if you wouldn&#x27;t trust it, then it&#x27;s pretty ok</li>
      <li>Now I have a clean HEALTHY tongue and the lump has resolved on its own without the surgery.</li>
      <li>Great addition to normal oral care routine.</li>
      <li>I love using this with the orabrush, it makes my tongue feel super clean and it has a very refreshing taste.</li>
      <li>Although it does not cure either of these problems, it does it help to make my mouth feel fresh and clean for a good amount of time.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh scent, and will work well with an Orabrush.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced - it was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>Its easy to use</li>
      <li>My breath isn&#x27;t stanky, and my tongue looks healthy and clean.</li>
      <li>its worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I originally received one of these products as an ad on in an order of the pet version.</li>
      <li>Use it twice a day and your mouth and tongue will feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>but it does help tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Not magic, but very good.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done - very lightweight with a very mild flavor.  </li>
      <li>certainly don&#x27;t think that regular toothpaste is good to use with the Orabrush to scrape your tongue, nor do I think a toothbrush for brushing teeth will adequately do what the Orabrush can do.</li>
      <li>it was $7) but even now it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I like the way it keeps my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>I brush my teeth thoroughly with a regular toothbrush, and then I scrape my tongue using the Orabrush on its own.</li>
      <li>I am always pleased with the results and my dentist even noticed how clean my mouth was at my last visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product from Orabrush seems to be a nice alternative to Biotene&#x27;s dry mouth gel.</li>
      <li>My breath was fresh for maybe 12 whole hours.</li>
      <li>Tried Amazon.com and got it at a discount and was able to buy several bottles at a time.  </li>
      <li>It makes your whole mouth feel fresh.</li>
      <li>Results were not that much better than using a smaller tooth brush and toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very small bottle, more like a sample size and is only good for 60 pumps.</li>
      <li>Is this a necessary no, but it nice to use something other than your toothbrush and toothpaste to clean your tongue.</li>
      <li>After only the first use I felt my breath was sweeter and my mouth has NEVER felt so clean.</li>
      <li>Too much of a hassle.</li>
      <li>I like how much easier it is to use this foam versus the tongue gel.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>And the taste is just absolutely horrid.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about this foam...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even do it every day, more like once every other day</li>
      <li>not only fresh breath but also heightened sense of taste!</li>
      <li>Just pure natural breath!</li>
      <li>I love the product, and it definitely helps remove the bacteria (white stuff) off of your tounge, but it doesn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
      <li>but I definitely like how mild it is</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a little better effect.</li>
      <li>I love the little brush I purchased with it.</li>
      <li>I am not really sure how much to use, but the tongue foam seems to be okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just saying that if you are highly budget conscious, you can skip this item.</li>
      <li>This is one of those products that actually works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I got this today and it came out as a clear liquid.</li>
      <li>but it is clear liquid when I pump it out.</li>
      <li>but I do not feel the tongue brush products to be any improvement to softly brushing the tongue with a soft toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Both my 7 yr old</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, mild flavor, does not irritate the tongue, and it definitely helps with bad breath.</li>
      <li>I normally do it at night and the next morning I do not have the morning breath whatsoever.</li>
      <li>In short, my tongue cleaning regime seems to be having the effect it was supposed to, so if anyone is trying out new ways to manage their breath, give this product + the Orabrush tongue cleaner a try.</li>
      <li>But since it&#x27;s one of the very few products on the market that actually contain the natural enzymes (e.g. lysozyme), it&#x27;s probably worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Biotene&#x27;s new formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not sure whether it works better than plain toothpaste, but I believe it does what it claims to do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i am satisfied with the product. I have not had the opportunity to use it at its fullest.  But the product comes in handy.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this helps with halitosis but I definitely like how mild it is and it has become a routine to use this. I feel empty and incomplete without.</li>
    <li> Get rid of the coffee taste. It is nice and refreshing. It really works.</li>
    <li> Great tongue cleaner.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Really works, I had chronic bad breath</li>
    <li> I struggled with a pasty film on my tongue - no more!  This foam works well; I&#x27;m sure that my breath smells much better too!</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant, mild flavor, does not irritate the tongue, and it definitely helps with bad breath. Not magic, but very good. I use it with the Orabrush brush, and just re-ordered more foam.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2+ years. I have always cleaned my tongue; this product does an excellent job and leaves a good taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> It makes your whole mouth feel fresh. Its easy to use and I love it. It is a must have product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Both my 7 yr old and I use it twice a day after brushing. He used to have such stinky breath, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. We tried probiotics, etc...finally, I found this!! It&#x27;s great! The price of it has GREATLY a increased ( last purchased it was $7) but even now it&#x27;s worth it. It freshens your tongue, cleans it, and moisturizes! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This foam works for me every time, no matter what I&#x27;ve eaten. For example, I ate raw onions in potato salad for dinner last night, and before going to bed, one pump of foam after my usual teeth brushing and flossing removed all the residual onion taste from my mouth. Now that&#x27;s impressive!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff with the orabrushes and they work so good on my tongue. My breath isn&#x27;t stanky, and my tongue looks healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing BAD BREATH KICKING tongue foam. My breath was fresh for maybe 12 whole hours. Just pure natural breath! I can say it was my oopsie, but i didnt know it had a screw off top! The top became undone and i lost all of the product! But heres fair warning to you all! KEEP THE TOP SCREWED ON!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but you can use tooth paste that works even better in most caepse, but if you wouldn&#x27;t trust it, then it&#x27;s pretty ok</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product in the drug store.  Lately, there wasn&#x27;t any out.  Tried Amazon.com and got it at a discount and was able to buy several bottles at a time.  The foam used with a tongue scraper then kid&#x27;s tooth brush does a good job of freshening your mouth.  Very pleasant taste and helps keep your mouth healthy.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done - very lightweight with a very mild flavor.  Reasonably priced - it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about this foam...I&#x27;m just not sure it does that much. I use it with the orabrush tongue cleaners (which I love). I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really freshening my breath, but I continue to use it, because my mouth tends to feel dirty without it now. I guess that says something? Didn&#x27;t notice any miracles though.</li>
    <li> We used Biotene products for years, but were forced to look for alternatives due to changes in Biotene&#x27;s ingredients. This product from Orabrush seems to be a nice alternative to Biotene&#x27;s dry mouth gel. It&#x27;s more of a foam than a gel, which takes some getting used to. But since it&#x27;s one of the very few products on the market that actually contain the natural enzymes (e.g. lysozyme), it&#x27;s probably worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Biotene&#x27;s new formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: if you&#x27;re also trying to find a replacement for Biotene&#x27;s mouthwashes, check out this option here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087ZJSC6/</li>
    <li> Works great with Orabrush tongue cleaners, which are THE BEST tongue cleaners ever made.</li>
    <li> I got this today and it came out as a clear liquid. It all dripped off of my brush and made a mess, and it also didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in my breath. I don&#x27;t recommend getting this</li>
    <li> I brought this item to combat bad breath due to tonsil stones and post nasal drip.  Although it does not cure either of these problems, it does it help to make my mouth feel fresh and clean for a good amount of time.  I use this in conjunction with the Orabrush tongue cleaner and it is an awesome combination.  I put the foam on my tongue, then brush and scrape it with the Orabrush.  I usually do this before brushing as the enzymes in it breaks down that nasty layer of gunk and bacteria that&#x27;s covering your tongue, allowing the toothpaste and mouthwash to penetrate deeper.  It may not cure your problem but it does help tremendously.  Use it twice a day and your mouth and tongue will feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I like the Tung gel better. This bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, is difficult to get unto a brush and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; the tongue as the Tung brand does</li>
    <li> It works and refresh my breath every time. Hope overtime it will totally get rid of it. Try it to believe it.</li>
    <li> One of them was leaking in the box. I thought I received a letter to just keep the couple dollar bottle (which is open to the air and must be emptied).  However, I&#x27;ve rec&#x27;d a couple missives saying I must return it.  Too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> Nice tasting that helps me NOT gag!</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to come out as a foam but it is clear liquid when I pump it out. Maybe the pump/bottle is defective. I can&#x27;t vouch for how well this product actually works since I can&#x27;t even get a dollop of foam on my Orabrush. Fail! And the taste is just absolutely horrid. The mint isn&#x27;t minty, and reminds me of something gross that a dentist used on me once. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product, combined with the Orabrush and tongue scraper definitely helps. I started using the gel, but the foam is easier and more cost effective, I think. Not sure whether it works better than plain toothpaste, but I believe it does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how this stuff works! After only the first use I felt my breath was sweeter and my mouth has NEVER felt so clean. I would never have heard of this product if I had not found a lump in my tongue. I&#x27;m 47 and not once in all the years of seeing my dentist has he ever told me to do a tongue exam. But I do now! And the Orabrush foam for my tongue I use everyday. I love the little brush I purchased with it. Now I have a clean HEALTHY tongue and the lump has resolved on its own without the surgery. Hurahhhh</li>
    <li> I love using this with the orabrush, it makes my tongue feel super clean and it has a very refreshing taste. Using this is much easier and less likely to make you gag than using those flimsy plastic tongue scrapers you get from the dentist. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I already have a manual tongue scraper but this is an especially nice taste left in my mouth. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I like how much easier it is to use this foam versus the tongue gel. I do feel my mouth is cleaner with the combination of the tongue brush and this tongue foam.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it does no harm but I do not feel the tongue brush products to be any improvement to softly brushing the tongue with a soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> In short, my tongue cleaning regime seems to be having the effect it was supposed to, so if anyone is trying out new ways to manage their breath, give this product + the Orabrush tongue cleaner a try.</li>
    <li> its worth every penny! not only fresh breath but also heightened sense of taste! That was a great surprise! A cleaner tongue means I get to \\&quot;taste\\&quot; more of my food. So, go Orabrush foam!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind putting in the money for it, go ahead and get it. It has a nice, fresh scent, and will work well with an Orabrush. However, if you run out, or you&#x27;re strapped for cash these days, I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is absolutely necessary. I brush my teeth thoroughly with a regular toothbrush, and then I scrape my tongue using the Orabrush on its own. I used to put a little tongue foam on it when I still had some around, but I don&#x27;t think it made my tongue any cleaner, or my breath any fresher, than simply using the Orabrush foam-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t think that regular toothpaste is good to use with the Orabrush to scrape your tongue, nor do I think a toothbrush for brushing teeth will adequately do what the Orabrush can do. And I definitely don&#x27;t think you should leave that gross white coating on your tongue! I&#x27;m just saying that if you are highly budget conscious, you can skip this item. Go buy some floss instead!</li>
    <li> Like the product. I love the mint flavor and it works for me. I would reccommend this product.........That is all</li>
    <li> Is this a necessary no, but it nice to use something other than your toothbrush and toothpaste to clean your tongue.</li>
    <li> I have canker sores.  since I started using it, breakout frequency is getting much less and the intensity and duration of breakouts are much less and shorter.</li>
    <li> I love the product, and it definitely helps remove the bacteria (white stuff) off of your tounge, but it doesn&#x27;t get it all. I was hoping for a little better effect. I&#x27;ll keep using this, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again. Great product idea tho!</li>
    <li> The Orabrush Tongue Foam is amazing when it is used with the Orabrush tongue cleaner.  Hands down this is the Best product for tongue cleaning on the market.  I am always pleased with the results and my dentist even noticed how clean my mouth was at my last visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the over all quality of their oral health.</li>
    <li> This is good, clean-tasting foamy stuff.  I like it--the foamy consistency seems to have a tendency to &amp;#34;move around&amp;#34; (can&#x27;t remember the word for that) your mouth, which is something that is a problem with biotene.  It does seem to work pretty well, although I don&#x27;t have too much trouble with dry mouth.  All the same, I can tell that, on nights when I have used it after brushing that my mouth didn&#x27;t have as bad of morning breath, so it helps keep the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; bacteria count down by keeping the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; bacterial count up!</li>
    <li> Dentist said not to waste my money on this.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that actually works exactly as advertised. I don&#x27;t even do it every day, more like once every other day and it still works great.  I normally do it at night and the next morning I do not have the morning breath whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great addition to normal oral care routine.</li>
    <li> I originally received one of these products as an ad on in an order of the pet version. I like the way it keeps my breath fresh. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure how much to use, but the tongue foam seems to be okay. Results were not that much better than using a smaller tooth brush and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Hardly any morning breath when used at night I really love this stuff. It&#x27;s better than the tongue gel I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> It is hard to figure out if this is working.  I need to do more research in order to know if this Orabrush tongue cleaning foam is working or is another gimmick.</li>
    <li> would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Orabrush tongue foam is a great product. I know nothing else like it on the market. It addresses bad breadth by focusing on the root cause and uses natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I thought the bottle would be bigger.  Not worth the price I paid.  I do like the product.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The taste is terrible. It seems as if you&#x27;re putting foamy shampoo in your mouth. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tell if it actually works breath wise or not because I have such a hard time getting past the taste. It&#x27;s a very small bottle, more like a sample size and is only good for 60 pumps. In my opinion, you can get more for your dollar elsewhere.</li>
    <li> When I saw the product, I was expecting it should work as described. However, it is very cheaply designed. It does not work at all. Extremely poor quality. (feels like water). Very bad taste. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. After years of covering my mouth when I talk to folks for fear of bad tongue karma, I can now speak to folks with words rolling off of a fresh tongue:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you will not regret it.</li>
