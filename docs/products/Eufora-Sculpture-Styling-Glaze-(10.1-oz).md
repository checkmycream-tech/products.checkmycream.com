      <li>I had to buy him his own</li>
      <li>it works great with curly or wavy hair, but also great with straight hair.</li>
      <li>I do not have matching shampoo &amp; conditioner however, but I&#x27;m sure with that kind of a pair</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and styling glade adds body &amp; shine!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It is a very light glaze</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Eufora.</li>
      <li>I have been using Eufora products for more than a year.  </li>
      <li>Considering this is about 3x more in my salon, I&#x27;m overall really happy with it!</li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I love having it delivered to my door.</li>
      <li>I am able to use this product and it works for me.</li>
      <li>I like this product and was glad to find it online.  </li>
      <li>I have over the years tried many beauty products.  </li>
      <li>i have ordered this before and love it,</li>
      <li>This styling glaze also helps eliminate the static during cold,dry weather.</li>
      <li>I use it with the Eufora Illuminate Shine Mist and it makes my hair feel healthy, with lots of body and swing.  </li>
      <li>So glad I was able to find it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Price at Amazon, even with sales tax, is a lot more easier on my wallet.</li>
      <li>Love Ephora Procucts, I have been using it after I shower on my hair</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product at a salon and loved it.</li>
      <li>My husband discovered it works great with his hair as a soft gel and started using it too.</li>
      <li>This stuff is easy to work into my damp hair and it holds my hair in place and smooths it while it dries.</li>
      <li>(Fine wavy hair that tends to frizz)  </li>
      <li>It gives my fine hair volumn.</li>
      <li>It works great, but most of the time just using the dry spray wax does the job.  </li>
      <li>and they leave my hair smooth and silky</li>
      <li>Then you use cheap products.</li>
      <li>Once in a while, I&#x27;ll get sucked into another product that promises great results, but I always go back to Eufora.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t conflict with others I wear.</li>
      <li>Even at after windy weather, I just run wet hand through my hair and the glaze gets reactivated and looks great again.</li>
      <li>This is good if I really want more manipulation of my short hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is perfect, even in very dry climates (I live in the desert).  </li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Great product - won&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and most products have me scratching within minutes.  </li>
      <li>Sites like Amazon and others will NEVER be able to guarantee your product, and most certainly will never teach you how to properly use them.</li>
      <li>This product works great alone or try using it with along with a few sprays of the Illuminate Shine Mist.</li>
      <li>It gives you soft frizz free waves, not at all sticky or crunchy!  </li>
      <li>styling glaze is good, but not any better than others I have used and is more expensive.  </li>
      <li>Does not seem fresh.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Have been using this for years as it holds just fine and is still not stiff or sticky!</li>
      <li>I usually buy from my hair dresser, but it&#x27;s so much more convient to be able to order online and recieve it so quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not a heavy glaze, just enough to add body and more manageability to fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It definitely gives my hair more body &amp; combined with the shine mist</li>
      <li>Exactly what she wanted.  </li>
      <li>The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that I wish it had a ad more hold with the same smooth results.</li>
      <li>Some products I&#x27;ve used might give me more hold, but they leave my hair dry and feeling like hay.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hair gel I will use on my wavy, curly fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, I depend on this product to keep my curls without them feeling that &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really picky in that I don&#x27;t like products that feel greasy - and this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like the silky feel and hold-ability of style.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and since it is colored I used a conditioner, therefore, need something to give it hold.  </li>
      <li>it is very versatile.</li>
      <li>Really reduces the frizz</li>
      <li>I have very thick/wavy hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product alot.</li>
      <li>it will really show a difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy from this Amazon store again.</li>
      <li>This product in particular, is one of my favorites.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product and was glad to find it online.  It works well.</li>
    <li> My stylist turned me on to this product a couple years ago and I love this product.  It is a very light glaze but it holds your style great. Another plus is you only have to use just a dime-sized amount because of it&#x27;s concentration.  It is all organic too.  Absolutely good for your hair -  five stars all the way around!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, but I always used to buy it only in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy from this Amazon store again.</li>
    <li> I use this product after every shampoo and conditioner, leaving on to blowdry hair. It gives my fine hair volumn.</li>
    <li> I like the Eufora product line.  I use this with the leave-in conditioner and it helps control my hair during humid weather.  It&#x27;s not perfect--I have not yet found any product that completely controls my hair when the weather is humid--my hair frizzes in high humidity.  This styling glaze also helps eliminate the static during cold,dry weather.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eufora products for more than a year.  Once in a while, I&#x27;ll get sucked into another product that promises great results, but I always go back to Eufora.  This product in particular, is one of my favorites.  It gives body to my limp, baby fine hair without weighing it down.  I use it with the Eufora Illuminate Shine Mist and it makes my hair feel healthy, with lots of body and swing.  I highly recommend it.  Eufora can&#x27;t be found in lots of salons, they limit the distribution so it&#x27;s nice to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well for my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well and you need only a little.</li>
    <li> I really like this product - this seemed less thick than I have had in the past, but it is working well.  Yes, I would order it again.</li>
    <li> This is good if I really want more manipulation of my short hair.  It works great, but most of the time just using the dry spray wax does the job.  I&#x27;m really picky in that I don&#x27;t like products that feel greasy - and this doesn&#x27;t.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have very fine hair and styling glade adds body &amp; shine!&lt;br /&gt; without being sticky.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel I will use on my wavy, curly fine hair.  It gives you soft frizz free waves, not at all sticky or crunchy!  The only salon I know that sells it is 6 hrs away from me, so I&#x27;m so glad that I can buy it on amazon!</li>
    <li> I have over the years tried many beauty products.  Eufora is the best of all.  You will never be disappointed.  I have white hair and this product is the only one I know of that doesn&#x27;t turn my hair yellow.  It also makes me appear as if my hair were three times as thick.  I absolutely LOVE Eufora.</li>
    <li> Love Ephora Procucts, I have been using it after I shower on my hair, I combine 4 different ones before I dry my hair and they leave my hair smooth and silky, they are pricey though</li>
    <li> Do not like this product.  Does not seem fresh.  May return it if I can.  Not as good as if it came from the salon. Makes my feel hair yucky..</li>
    <li> Not a heavy glaze, just enough to add body and more manageability to fine hair.  Only a small amount needed so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product ever.  So glad I was able to find it at Amazon.  Keeps my curls in control.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at a salon and loved it. My husband discovered it works great with his hair as a soft gel and started using it too. I had to buy him his own so he would stop using all of mine!</li>
    <li> styling glaze is good, but not any better than others I have used and is more expensive.  Great to use with the Shine Mist.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and most products have me scratching within minutes.  Then I get these litchy bumps that last for a few days even if I never use that product againt.  I LOVE THIS PRODUC!!!.  I can style my thin hair to give it a little body and glow.&lt;br /&gt;NO ITCHING  NO BUMPS.  So i am concluding no chemicals that are unfriendly to our skin</li>
    <li> Works very well, this is what is used when I have my hair professionally styled. Buying through Amazon is less money too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for seven years and have no plans on switching. I mix this with the illuminate spray to protect my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this after the wash, just a quarter size dab worked into the hair and it makes it blow dry just a little nicer.  Little shiner and less fly-aways.</li>
    <li> Once I started using this product, nothing else compares.  Price at Amazon, even with sales tax, is a lot more easier on my wallet.</li>
    <li> I USE IT ALL THE TIME GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years and I&#x27;m so happy to be able to get it here on Amazon. It costs less here than in a salon and I love having it delivered to my door. Very little is necessary for use after every shampoo. It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t conflict with others I wear. The way it helps with management is great. I would recommend Eufora products any time and the sculpture glaze is a keeper.</li>
    <li> My mom wanted this for a gift and she loves it.  Exactly what she wanted.  No issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product - won&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
    <li> I really like the silky feel and hold-ability of style. I have been using this line for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great for curly frizzy hair. Really reduces the frizz</li>
    <li> At last salon appt, my hairdresser used this and I was impressed with the smoothness and body of my hair. (Fine wavy hair that tends to frizz)  Unfortunately, the salon was out of it, so Amazon got my business.  This stuff works</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this hair product!!!</li>
    <li> Great. I will buy again, but not yet. This product goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> It definitely gives my hair more body &amp; combined with the shine mist it makes my hair color last longer.</li>
    <li> This product works great alone or try using it with along with a few sprays of the Illuminate Shine Mist.</li>
    <li> Works excellent with the illuminate shine mist. Hair is no longer crazy and unruly!</li>
    <li> My must have!  Love Eufora products!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and it&#x27;s quite difficult to get soft, non-crunchy curls.  This product is perfect, even in very dry climates (I live in the desert).  You only need a dime size drop so the one bottle lasts a l-o-n-g time, even with long hair.  I highly recommend this sculpting glaze to keep naturally curly hair from frizzing!</li>
    <li> i have ordered this before and love it,</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this styling glaze at a salon a couple of years ago and loved it. Loved it loved it. It was an amazing product. I ran out recently and ordered a new bottle from Amazon. Maybe they changed the formula or something, but it&#x27;s not nearly as awesome or effective as the first bottle I had. At such a high price, it&#x27;s very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Considering this is about 3x more in my salon, I&#x27;m overall really happy with it! I use it before I style my hair with a straightener or curler and it really helps keep my hair shiny and soft. I do not have matching shampoo &amp; conditioner however, but I&#x27;m sure with that kind of a pair it will really show a difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this product alot. I use it in combo with the polishing drops and it makes my hair feel very soft. I scrunch my hair with it. it works great with curly or wavy hair, but also great with straight hair. it is very versatile.</li>
    <li> I use both Eufora Glaze &amp; Serum as alternative from my daily product. I like to switch it up just like changing my shampoo &amp; conditioner for a few days. I also sometimes use the serum on the days I use my daily product. I just use a dab and run it through my hair. It brings out the luster &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion you get what you pay for. You spend your hard working money for an amazing hair style or Brazillian blowout. Then you use cheap products. Your not going to get that look you want. The product speaks for itself. Plus purchasing it through AMAZON you&#x27;ve already saved $$.</li>
    <li> The best gel ever. No alcohol keep hair soft and shiny. Delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is easy to work into my damp hair and it holds my hair in place and smooths it while it dries. It doesn&#x27;t dry hard, or it if does, running my hand through my hair once loosens it up, but it still stays where I put it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, I depend on this product to keep my curls without them feeling that &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; texture. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and very long lasting. I love it! I&#x27;ve been using this line for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> I am able to use this product and it works for me. I have thick hair that is heavy and is hard to find a product that can hold it in style…I live in a very humid climate and this product serves e well!  LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years as it holds just fine and is still not stiff or sticky! Will get more when I need it!</li>
    <li> Eufora products are SALON PROFESSIONAL products for a reason. It is hurting our industry and all the time and money we invest in education, so we can educate our clients, for sites like this and, sleekhair.com to \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; Eufora products. Sites like Amazon and others will NEVER be able to guarantee your product, and most certainly will never teach you how to properly use them. Save you money and go see a PROFESSIONAL Stylist, certified in Eufora.</li>
    <li> this was a gift that someone had asked for so I know she loves the product. I was happy with shipping and the price!</li>
    <li> My baby fine hair is hard to style because it won&#x27;t hold onto a curl (round brush and dryer). This product gives my hair some fullness and helps keep my style longer and it looks shiny, not dry and brittle. Some products I&#x27;ve used might give me more hold, but they leave my hair dry and feeling like hay.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is that I wish it had a ad more hold with the same smooth results.</li>
    <li> Comes in different bottle. Not sure if original.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and since it is colored I used a conditioner, therefore, need something to give it hold.  This product works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought it on recommendation of a friend and am very pleased.  I have very thick/wavy hair and it makes my hair feel very soft -also smells great!</li>
    <li> Eudora hit another home run with this product.  Competes favorably with any other styling gel. Holds without stiffness. Product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years, theirs are the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> This bottle of sculpture glaze was perfect!  Mary Grant</li>
    <li> Not heavy. Not stiff. Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Eufora products for years and wouldn&#x27;t change.  The Shampoo, especially, is excellent at cleaning the hair without leaving a residue which reduces the times of shampoo per week.  I usually buy from my hair dresser, but it&#x27;s so much more convient to be able to order online and recieve it so quickly.  The skin and hair serum, hair conditioner,root boost, hair spray, conditioner mist are all really great products that I use.  BF.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of controlling gels for my curly hair. Nothing can compare to this glaze. It is lightweight but does a great job. Even at after windy weather, I just run wet hand through my hair and the glaze gets reactivated and looks great again.</li>
