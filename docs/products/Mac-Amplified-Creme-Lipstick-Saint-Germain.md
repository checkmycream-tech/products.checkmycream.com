      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a lipstick exactly like this, the color, the texture,</li>
      <li>Its REAL!</li>
      <li>The one from the store is a different color, goes on smooth, and lasts for hours!</li>
      <li>Love this shade alone or mixed with Mac creme d&#x27; nude.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more mac lipstick.</li>
      <li>It was just what I expected matte super and cute</li>
      <li>The color is cute but definitely never spending this much on lipstick again.</li>

      <li>Much more pinky pink than expected--pretty, though.</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t really look well on my skin tone.</li>
      <li>When this color wears off, looks like you have really chapped lips</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
      <li>I bought it , because it really resembles color of my favorite YSL lipstick pink celebration</li>
      <li>If u don&#x27;t own Saint Germaine, ur missing out cause</li>
      <li>Every woman looks good in this color-I have this and use it either by itself or mixed with other colors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lipsticks in pink and again nothing compares!</li>

      <li>I wear it all the time &amp; it smell nice &amp; last long</li>
      <li>High end product as expected from MAC, adorable on her lips to complete her divine beauty</li>

    <li> Every woman looks good in this color-I have this and use it either by itself or mixed with other colors.  Looks like 1960&#x27;s cool color.</li>
    <li> Please please please, I am begging you to not buy this product as it is not a real mac product. When I wore this lipstick, I realized that it doesn&#x27;t last longer. It goes away in 10min. But then I know friends who wear the same thing and I realized the texture was different and theirs&#x27; last longer so I decided to take it to mac store to compare and come to find out, this lipstick has a shiny tone to it and the real mac one looks dry. The sales person told me straight up that it&#x27;s not real and he didn&#x27;t even have to tell me I noticed it myself. I can&#x27;t believe how people can copy other product exactly the same as far as design wise but when you use it, you see a huge difference.I purchased two other colors and I must say that big regrets. All three products are fake. Not real. Please do not buy! It took me this while to rate it because I am a busy person but I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lip color!!!</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t really look well on my skin tone. But maybe I&#x27;m not pairing it well... I&#x27;ll see if I can get it to work.</li>
    <li> This Mac lipstick is amazing! The color is so matte and smooth (: I&#x27;ve been looking for a lipstick exactly like this, the color, the texture, everything./ I haven&#x27;t found one in drugstores. Now i was a little doubtful of getting this because I didn&#x27;t know if this was a rip off or not. Well, it wasn&#x27;t! Now the price is a little expensive and i definitley reccomend getting this at the mac counter because it is cheaper and there is no tax on shipping. But, because i dont go to the mac counters a lot, i thought why not? It was delivered very quickly and it was brand new and well managed! I definitley reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> glad I was able to find it. Product came in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love the color! But this is not authentic Mac! I ordered this one and loved it, until I went to an actual Mac store and bought the same kind. The one from the store is a different color, goes on smooth, and lasts for hours! This one dries out your lips and lasts for like 20 min.</li>
    <li> The color is cute but definitely never spending this much on lipstick again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE everything about this lipstick! The color is beautiful, and looks exactly how it does in this photo. I only reapplied once in the span of 7 hours, and only because I had been eating and wanted to freshen up.</li>
    <li> Great !! buy buy buy ! perfect lipstick, i wont buy any other brand but mac again!!</li>
    <li> And unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it at the moment. I think I&#x27;m just going to I order a new tube. It was pink but a little edgy in a way that suited pale skin. This is for saint Germaine</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this lipstick for awhile and finally found it at a good price it arived pretty quick and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it and I love it its bright but not to obnoxious it does turn a bit hot pink on me as it wears off but I get lots of compliments and I love it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and love the lipstick</li>
    <li> WOW what a gorgeous color I where it all the time.Thank you mac.LOVE LOVE...</li>
    <li> My first Mac lipstick. Love it</li>
    <li> very little product at steep price not worth it</li>
    <li> St Germain Mac Lipstick is my favorite! Very Feminine &amp; Lovely. I&#x27;m sure you will Love it too!</li>
    <li> People go to mac and buy this lipstick! I jst bought it 3 days agoo its $15.!! #ripoffs #smh</li>
    <li> This was a perfect shade for my complexion! I love it and I&#x27;m going to be buying again!! Very satisfied thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This pink is hot and I am in love! It goes on smooth and last a long time. I will continue to order from this company.</li>
    <li> Great price ...great color, just needs gloss to keep it from drying up on your lips</li>
    <li> smells like sewage and is totally fake DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> One of my faves LOVE the bright neon light pink color for summer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this lipstick and can truly say its my #1 one favorite. It&#x27;s creamy and stays on, the colors is a real pretty pink with a blue undertone. I&#x27;m light skinned with dark hair and eyes and when I put this baby on, it goes so well. I&#x27;ve tried many lipsticks in pink and again nothing compares! If you&#x27;re debating on a pink, this one is it!</li>
    <li> I love the pink lipstick its so me and so pretty love how pink it is great product cant wait to use it</li>
    <li> My 1st MAC purchase &amp; it&#x27;s amazing! If u don&#x27;t own Saint Germaine, ur missing out cause, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; 4 ur collection!</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected matte super and cute</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, very bold, i love it! Great service, very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the colour of this lipstick but unfortunately this colour is blue based and my undertones are yellow. Do not choose this colour if you have yellow undertones in your skin it will clash and look ashy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Color doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone. Simplydesignlife.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Love this shade alone or mixed with Mac creme d&#x27; nude. I have a caramel complexion and a little of this goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t really last through a few sips of a drink or bites of a meal though. When this color wears off, looks like you have really chapped lips but overall it&#x27;s nothing To just reapply!</li>
    <li> this lipstick is so cute 😍 I wear it all the time &amp; it smell nice &amp; last long</li>
    <li> My father bought this lipstick for me, and it just came in the mail today. The color is AMAZING, and it stay on for a long time, well worth the price &lt;3 &lt;3 (Actually, the price it a bit cheap lol)</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite shades of lipstick, either on its own or on top of a darker pink, I love every single thing about it from the texture to how long it lasts! It is a little dry, but as long as you lightly exfoliate you lips or use a lip base you will be fine!</li>
    <li> Lipstick is almost white, not the pretty pink I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Love the color. It&#x27;s an authentic product.</li>
    <li> Efficient delivery and loved the product. Color is very very bright</li>
    <li> I luv this pink shade it&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
    <li> High end product as expected from MAC, adorable on her lips to complete her divine beauty</li>
    <li> If you like pink, this is a must have. It says girly with class, yet fun.  I am totally enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I loveeee this lipstick. MAC has such good products and the shade of pink is really pretty. It&#x27;s really glossy and looks really nice.</li>
    <li> I love it. Its a like a pale pink. It looks nice on me. I will definitely buy more mac lipstick.</li>
    <li> Been wanting Saint Germane for along time but my local MAC has been sold out for months. It took a week and a half to receive this from California which is a little ridiculous. But the product is authentic and wonderful! And for you guys who want to know; I&#x27;m an NW10 with black hair and green eyes, It looks bold and wonderful on us really pale ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a MAC lipstick in this color forever.  I happened to receive a Amazon gift card for Christmas this year and I thought that I would go on a hunt for this color.  It shipped quickly and came in great shape the color is exactly what it looks like and this seller was very helpful and nice.</li>
    <li> Much more pinky pink than expected--pretty, though.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love MAC!!! Great color, lasted all evening, nice and creamy. Would definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I bought it , because it really resembles color of my favorite YSL lipstick pink celebration #22, very good substitute, but still #22 is better.</li>
    <li> Mac is good but I would NEVER buy this again. $20 for lipstick is highway robbery!&lt;br /&gt;This product is way overpriced and not worth $20. This should be no more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a company that is paying their CEO&#x27;s thousands WITH YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s right. If you do not buy the price will come down. How long do we really want to support other people and not ourselves?&lt;br /&gt;$20 for this lipstick is an outrageous price. I will never pay that price again. if your dumb enough to pay that price then they will keep the price that high. The question is now : do you want to be dumb and give your money away or be smart and BUY REASONABLE!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s your choice.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST COLOR ONE OF MY FAVORITE!!</li>
    <li> very good quality, and pigmentation and wonderful. I can not say not a bad point about this product. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly when it comes to lipstick I normally only purchase MAC lipsticks, they stay on great and last quite awhile, I&#x27;m a huge lipstick junkie so I always gotta buy a lot. To be honest on MACs website they sell this lipstick for 14.50 which is not bad at all for such a great product but then there&#x27;s the shipping, which I HATE how ridiculous shipping is, like everywhere. So looking on all the sites I found amazon is more for me. Great product, shade, texture, everything! Love it! ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this.... Last very long. Mac is the best lipstick to order</li>
    <li> Its REAL! Love the color!!! Shipping was on time and delivered sooner than I thought!!! Two thumbs up</li>
</ol>
