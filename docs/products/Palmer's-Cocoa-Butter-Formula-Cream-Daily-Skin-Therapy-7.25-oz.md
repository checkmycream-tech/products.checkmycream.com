      <li>but it looks more tone.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love this Cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>, what more could I ask --</li>
      <li>so I finally ordered it and am very happy I did.</li>
      <li>Real cocoa butter smells much more pleasant and also works much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent source of moisture and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>my skin feels great, it&#x27;s helped a lot with preventing itchiness, and so far not a stretch mark in sight!</li>
      <li>this is the best I found a large sie super cheap at BJs club-not trying to be funny!</li>
      <li>You have to wait just a minute or so for the stuff to sink in, then no greasy residue to deal with--just great smelling and soft hands and feet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over thirty years especially when i was pregnant it the best</li>
      <li>This is the hands down best seller, PERIOD.</li>
      <li>and my face is dewy and line free after years of using this.  </li>
      <li>The pot of cocoa butter formula and stick are now indispensable to me.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy it.</li>
      <li>This was really cheap and works sooooo</li>
      <li>Worth every dollar!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizing that I still have it on my face when I wake up.  </li>
      <li>I can laugh all day and nothing!</li>
      <li>but I think it would be great for a moisturizer for those with dry skin!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and makes skin so soft and you don&#x27;t even need to use very much so the pot lasts forever!</li>
      <li>I have a full confident with this seller and I&#x27;ll be glad to do business again with this seller in the future.</li>
      <li>but it got to me relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>My face feels great the whole next day, even now during the winter time.</li>
      <li>I DIDN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE FORMALDAHYDE : } LIKE AND OLD LADYS CREAM !!</li>
      <li>But with 2 nights apply, her eye got swollen huge, and my daughter says it&#x27;s very itching.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However overnight it gets fully absorbed and becomes odorless.</li>
      <li>well but never really found one I loved until now.  </li>
      <li>This makes my skin feel really good and soft, and takes dryness away completely.  </li>
      <li>Oh, that&#x27;s right</li>
      <li>Some spots of my face get REALLY dry while my t-zone gets really oily, so finding a good face lotion has been an ongoing task.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I have noticed is it has COMPLETELY erased my fine wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t exactly want to smell like cocoa in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife used this throughout our first pregnancy and she never got any stretch marks.</li>
      <li>but our local stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more</li>
      <li>, so more likely I am allergic to one of the chemicals in this lotion.  </li>
      <li>My skin absorbs this stuff &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; on hot toast.</li>
      <li>Makes guys or girls heads turn trust me ;)</li>
      <li>I bought this product online rather than the store because it the container was bigger  and for a better price than what you can find in the store.</li>
      <li>It smells incredibly good and lasts a long time, keeping skin soft.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great even for dry skin (especially on the feet).  </li>
      <li>The first ingredient is cocoa butter and not water like most other products.</li>
      <li>Before when I would smile for a long time or cry, you could see these wrinkles around my mouth (laugh lines) and between my eyebrows (11&#x27;s) and now they are gone!</li>
      <li>I also love the smell, it always smell so sweet and a little like chocolate!</li>
      <li>used this on my whole body, including my face.</li>
      <li>Really helps the skin stay moisturized.</li>
      <li>#34;My face looks really soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>and im saving money by not needing to use my concealers so much.</li>
      <li>I use it in the sun and feel very moisturized after.  </li>
      <li>This keeps me moisturized the whole day without having to reapply.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and gives a bit more elasticity, especially my forehead which wrinkles</li>
      <li>The tub is much larger than my old one so the price makes more sense.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many cocoa butter moisturizers and keep coming back to this one: it has the best smell, it is really really thick without being hard to spread, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>and I love the way cocoa butter feels on my lips &amp; the back of my hands -- feels moist but not oily and smells like white chocolate</li>
      <li>Am using  the cocoa butter mainly on the arms, feet, and legs.  </li>
      <li>If you must use it, you better test somewhere else before using for your little ones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and absolutely love it --</li>
      <li>other Palmers products I&#x27;ve tried have had such a strong fragrance that I never used them after the first try).  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea and my skin is VERY sensitive</li>
      <li>Nice sized jar but yet small enough to take along.</li>
      <li>Normally the winter completely dries out my face, and even though I live in a city where I bike and walk a lot in bitter, winter cold, my skin is in the best shape ever.  </li>
      <li>Even though my skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all</li>

    <li> I love this brand of cocoa butter! It&#x27;s an excellent source of moisture and leaves my skin super soft. I especially like it for my elbows. Just rub it in - instant softness! I also love the smell, it always smell so sweet and a little like chocolate!</li>
    <li> So I have combination skin. Some spots of my face get REALLY dry while my t-zone gets really oily, so finding a good face lotion has been an ongoing task. I have tried EVERYTHING, from generic lotions to lotions that cost $60 for 2oz! I kid you not! I found a few that moisturized well but never really found one I loved until now.  I had ordered a pound of raw shea butter and started trying to use it everyday, but because it was just a big chunk in a bag it was messy and inconvenient. I had used the palmers lotion in the pump and didn&#x27;t care for it, but something told me to try the jar.  When you look at the ingredients for the 2 they are different btw. Anyway, that was about a week ago and I am so glad I tried it. It does leave your face a little shiny so I use it as a night cream but you could also rub in on in the morning and wipe off the excess.  Not only is my face moisturized but it looks more tone.  Another thing that I have noticed is it has COMPLETELY erased my fine wrinkles.  Before when I would smile for a long time or cry, you could see these wrinkles around my mouth (laugh lines) and between my eyebrows (11&#x27;s) and now they are gone! I can laugh all day and nothing! I have rosacea and my skin is VERY sensitive so this was a God send! Oh yeah and the price is not too bad the jar is under $10 at walmart and a little really goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is just what your looking for when you think of cocoa butter. The first ingredient is cocoa butter and not water like most other products. It is excellent and will definitely need to buy more!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me as a great body moisturizer to use during pregnancy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and absolutely love it -- my skin feels great, it&#x27;s helped a lot with preventing itchiness, and so far not a stretch mark in sight! Only negative is that it feels a bit greasy and can take a little while to fully soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I love this Cocoa butter. I caught this when it was $6 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my whole body, including my face. I have very dry skin. This keeps me moisturized the whole day without having to reapply. It is the only cream I use on my 18 month old as she has sensitive skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. I keep some in my purse for my hands. The smell is to die for!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF I USE IT ON MY FACE EVERY NIGHT IF FACT MY SKIN IS ADDICTED TO IT IF I STOP FOR A FEW WEEKS MY SKIN TURNS FLAKY I HAVE ALOT OF SCARS ON MY FACE FOR A VISCIOUS DOG BITE AS A CHILD AND IT HELPED REDUCES THE SCARING BUT I THINK ONE OF THE BEST THNGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS WHEN I PUT IT ON AT NIGHT MY HUSBAND LOVES THE WAY IT SMELLS AND TOLD ME I DIDN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE FORMALDAHYDE : } LIKE AND OLD LADYS CREAM !!</li>
    <li> very good smell and feels very nice on your skin. delivered as requested. Used it for years. massage it after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has been around for many years and has not disappointed me yet. I use this product on my stretch marks and for moisturizing my skin---it works great!</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers, I was looking for a paraben-free product when I came across Palmers Cocoa Butter with Vitamin E.  The tub is almost half-empty now and I decided to write a review because I think it&#x27;s great.  This makes my skin feel really good and soft, and takes dryness away completely.  It has a nice, very delicate scent that I only smell while applying, not all day long (other Palmers products I&#x27;ve tried have had such a strong fragrance that I never used them after the first try).  I imagine I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When I order it from amazon i thought it would take a long time to get to me since i&#x27;m currently out of the country but it got to me relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over thirty years especially when i was pregnant it the best</li>
    <li> This is a thick dense balm that melts into your skin. The main ingredient is coca butter (not mineral oil or water like other brands). It smells incredibly good and lasts a long time, keeping skin soft. I like to use it on my legs after shaving. I&#x27;ve used many cocoa butter formulas, but this one in my opinion is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this product online rather than the store because it the container was bigger  and for a better price than what you can find in the store.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-soothes and heals cracked dry skin fast&lt;br /&gt;-smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-is clump and sometimes a pain to get out of the container&lt;br /&gt;-not recommended for use under direct sunlight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought this for my elbows and knees which take a beating on a daily basis while working. within 2 days of using this product, my skin felt totally different. no more white cracks where the skin folds and no itchy, dry patches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy another when it runs out</li>
    <li> My podiatrist recommended cocoa butter for post surgery scarring on my foot once bandages and stitches were removed.  I like this product because a little goes a long way. The fragrance is very pleasant and I use it to soften rough heels and elbows.  This was certainly a good value for the money.  I highly recommend this product because it is also amazingly not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Introduced to this product after a massive wreck , ran over in the bike lane.  Sutures, road rash, and hospital air dry air were all ameliorated.  Now it is a daily post ride rite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so be careful</li>
    <li> I use this as a night cream.  It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizing that I still have it on my face when I wake up.  Even though my skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all and my face is dewy and line free after years of using this.  When I get compliments on my skin, I tell people about Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter in the jar (the lotion in the bottle is great, but not as a night cream).</li>
    <li> I am a very satisfied customer. My product arrived on time and in superb condition. I have a full confident with this seller and I&#x27;ll be glad to do business again with this seller in the future. This is the hands down best seller, PERIOD.</li>
    <li> I love anything with cocoa butter in it!!!  the smell was delicious!  We bought this for my son with such dry exczema. It made him have a wonderful smell and we loved how it wasn&#x27;t too strong.  Was suusul for everyone else for thir dry skin or just because they wanted to have that smell.  cocoa butter should be in all lotions I think!</li>
    <li> My wife used this throughout our first pregnancy and she never got any stretch marks. Really helps the skin stay moisturized. Needless to say, we ordered it again for our second pregnancy. We also tried the one with elastin, specifically for stretch marks, but this is as good. 5 stars !</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of lotion for a dry flaky nose I got from a combination of having a cold and using the wrong tissues, so I bought an Xmas related Palmer&#x27;s gift pack while I was out shopping with a tiny pot of this, the cocoa butter stick, shower wash, and regular lotion and I&#x27;m ADDICTED!  The pot of cocoa butter formula and stick are now indispensable to me.  I am at an age where I am starting to see wrinkles, while I also deal with adult acne and oily skin, I slather my face with this stuff (including my lips and eyes) twice a day, in the am before make-up and at night after I wash my face off, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Normally the winter completely dries out my face, and even though I live in a city where I bike and walk a lot in bitter, winter cold, my skin is in the best shape ever.  When I had really dry patches of skin before, I would use Vaseline, but now this is my go to moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical, and it works so well for me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  Am using  the cocoa butter mainly on the arms, feet, and legs.  Leaves them very soft especially the feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Mom after knee surgery to help with scarring and dry skin - she loves it and has ordered several of these!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many cocoa butter moisturizers and keep coming back to this one: it has the best smell, it is really really thick without being hard to spread, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying it.&lt;br /&gt;Product satisfies the requirement.&lt;br /&gt;Good result on scars and spots.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to buy</li>
    <li> Great for when my balls and shaft start chaffing!</li>
    <li> My skin absorbs this stuff &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; on hot toast. It feels and smells yummy. You have to wait just a minute or so for the stuff to sink in, then no greasy residue to deal with--just great smelling and soft hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the past and this was my second purchase. I apply it generously to my face before I go to sleep. I KNOW it works because often I see myself in the mirror the next day and think, &amp;#34;My face looks really soft and fresh. Oh, that&#x27;s right, I applied the cocoa butter last night&amp;#34;. It makes my skin soft and gives a bit more elasticity, especially my forehead which wrinkles less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I notice that it can slightly irritate the skin on my face near my nostrils, but only if I rub a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;- I can only use it as a night cream because it looks and feels really greasy on my face and I don&#x27;t exactly want to smell like cocoa in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However overnight it gets fully absorbed and becomes odorless. My face feels great the whole next day, even now during the winter time. I love this stuff, please do not change the formula.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought it was rather expensive but our local stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more and I love the way cocoa butter feels on my lips &amp; the back of my hands -- feels moist but not oily and smells like white chocolate, what more could I ask -- so I finally ordered it and am very happy I did. The tub is much larger than my old one so the price makes more sense. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I would actually have preferred a smaller tub as I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> this is the best I found a large sie super cheap at BJs club-not trying to be funny! ha ha</li>
    <li> We purchased it for our 6-year old daughter, who got burn eye and nose part. One of friends told me it works well for the healing and keeps moisture at night time.  But with 2 nights apply, her eye got swollen huge, and my daughter says it&#x27;s very itching.  And some of her face parts turned red (some of it must have gotten those areas) and those parts got severely dried out later on like after burn.  We stopped using immediately.  However, those horribly dried parts are staying very long.  Now I am trying to return it but AMAZON is not taking it back, saying not available for return.  If you must use it, you better test somewhere else before using for your little ones. Horrible experience after all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the chemical, artificial cocoa scent. Real cocoa butter smells much more pleasant and also works much better. I think this particular product is too greasy, and I don&#x27;t like that the second ingredient is mineral oil, a clogging ingredient.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  I use it in the sun and feel very moisturized after.  It makes skin smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used cocoa butter before and was never allergic to it, but this stuff gave me a horrible rash on my belly (using for stretch marks).  It was so bad, my OB thought I may have PUPPP.  But a week after I stopped using it, the rash is gone and no more itching, so more likely I am allergic to one of the chemicals in this lotion.  Just beware this is not REAL cocoa butter, it has a lot of chemicals and nasty ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product it is very effective and you won&#x27;t regret buying this product. Worth every dollar! Enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, good for your skin and provides a nice layer of protection from the elements. Nice sized jar but yet small enough to take along.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews of this product, I purchased it.  I am sorry to say that, for me, it did little or nothing to help my dry dry hands and elbows.  I used it faithfully for weeks.  I do think it may have helped some blemishes fade.  I am grateful for that.</li>
    <li> I love this. Smells amazing and makes skin so soft and you don&#x27;t even need to use very much so the pot lasts forever! I was suffering with scars on my face from picking spots and I used to use harsh expensive products on it which made it worse! This was really cheap and works sooooo well my scars are fading and my confidence is back and im saving money by not needing to use my concealers so much. Teeny bit too thick to wear during the day for me because I have really oily skin but I think it would be great for a moisturizer for those with dry skin! I use as a night cream. I smell great as well! People are always asking me what scent I am wearing!!! Makes guys or girls heads turn trust me ;) xx</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping your skin in great condition</li>
    <li> My husband started using this on the recommendation of his physical therapist after carpel tunnel surgery.  I used it after foot surgery.  This stuff is great even for dry skin (especially on the feet).  Everyone needs a container of this in their homes.  Try it on the fingertips in the winter when the skin gets cracked.</li>
