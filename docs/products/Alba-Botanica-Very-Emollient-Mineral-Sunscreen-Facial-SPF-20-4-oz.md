      <li>I bought this because it got good ratings on EWG.  </li>
      <li>I refuse to use chemical sunscreens, they are not as effective and it is believed they may disrupt hormones.  </li>
      <li>i dont want chemicals on my body and this product is perfect for those who are the same.</li>
      <li>fantastic !</li>
      <li>I also love this since it is the non water proof sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Dimethicone is a safe moisturizing silicone</li>
      <li>Great product and safe... would highly recommend to everyone !</li>
      <li>Be sure to keep it away from your eyes because at some point during the day, you&#x27;re bound to get it in your eyes - somehow,</li>
      <li>So shipping was fast and the product came to me in great condition, no damage....</li>
      <li>This is a great mineral sunscreen at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I FOUND THIS SUNSCREEN TO BE MORE GREASY THAN THE LAVENDAR BODY SUNSCREEN FROM ALBA.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>First time purchasing an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; sunscreen, and Alba seems a good brand</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly for easy coverage!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t not disappointed, though I&#x27;ll continue searching for better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is the best natural facial one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>but then it quickly disappears.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen and would recommend it to anyone looking for a more natural and yet very functional alternative.</li>
      <li>I think that this sunscreen would be fine for whole body, but it does leave your face super greasy.</li>
      <li>It goes on with a white cast but goes away nicely as you rub it in.  </li>
      <li>It is a natural, physical sunblock so it is great for sun protection.  </li>
      <li>While the other brand didn&#x27;t blend into my skin and gave me a distinct pale &#x27;vampire&#x27; face, as my husband and I liked to joke, this one blends in beautifully.</li>
      <li>Most formulas have Dimethicone may be 6 to 8 (or more) down the line of ingredients.</li>
      <li>Since this is made with minerals its much better for my skin apparently.</li>
      <li>I previously used Josie Moran spf 47, which, I loved but gave me zits</li>
      <li>I tried a different brand that was a bit more economical and paid the price.</li>
      <li>easy to apply as it spreads out smoothly (maybe a little bit too smoothly</li>
      <li>but it works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>sunscreen is completely fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to try Alba Mineral spf 20 Emollient Facial sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I also use Kiss my Face, Face Factor SPF 30 under the Alba SPF 20 also but the KMF Face Factor doesn&#x27;t give as much slip as the Olay!</li>
      <li>It does feel lighter than the Alba spf 30 Emollient Mineral Sunscreen, although, you can&#x27;t tell at first.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend this product to people who mostly work in urban area (thus not exposed to strong sunlight for a long time).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face really greasy or shiny</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it aggravated my acne much.</li>
      <li>it works very well as a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and i can&#x27;t really feel it on my face.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really retain a shine.  </li>
      <li>helps to control how much you get out each time.</li>
      <li>is too wide for a sunscreen that flows so easily.</li>
      <li>I like having the extra 8% zinc oxide in Alba on top of the 3% Olay which is not enough.</li>
      <li>I have a cool technique of layering this over my daily moisturizer (Olay SPF15 sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>Be careful and maybe try another product first!</li>
      <li>You only need a pea-sized drop for your whole face.</li>
      <li>So far, it seems to work well.</li>
      <li>Main problem I have with mineral sunblocks is they are so drying, so I only buy emollient ones.  </li>
      <li>I finally realized that I have very sensitive skin and break out with cosmetics and creams with lots of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the other reviewers are putting on too much?  </li>
      <li>The Olay (or any moisturizer for that matter) gives the skin a little &#x27;slip&#x27; making the Alba much easier to blend.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that it is very emolient as it states on the bottle, leaves my skin a bit greasy after a little while, this is the only reason why it did not get 5 stars because I have oily skin as it is</li>
      <li>I gave Alba 4 stars because this Alba formula is too high in Dimethicone, and one would wish it was down the line of ingredients versus being 2nd.</li>

<li> UPDATE: September 10, 2015, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
<li> I let it soak in, then I layer on a little pressed powder to cut the low shine to a matte finish.</li>
<li> mostly.&lt;br /&gt;Still a little bit greasy, meaning you definitely can FEEL it on your skin after you applied</li>
<li> I only noticed after a few minutes since my face didnt look as shiny</li>

<li> This is not what I expected at all.</li>
<li> Be careful around the eyes as with any sunscreen.</li>
<li> A little odd considering it&#x27;s a facial sunscreen.</li>
<li> greasy than other sunscreens that I used before, which may be due to lower SPF?&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is runny, but goes on thick and leaves a white coating on your skin, and I put it all over my face, as I have always done in the past and it some how migrated down</li>
<li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The tube needs a little bit improvement as the opening &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34;</li>
<li> but I have read it can be a little drying to the skin.</li>
<li> A little is all you need.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find this sunscreen heavy on face at all, perhaps I am dryer on the face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll use it for beach days but never again for everyday protection.</li>
<li> I have been using this everyday for about a year.</li>
<li> no sunburn in mexico and i am pale too so</li>
<li> It is a little hard to wash off but that is the point-it stays on and protects.</li>
<li> I have used this brand for years and was,so disappointed in this new formula, yuck!</li>
<li> BUT, I&#x27;m not loving the product itself.</li>
<li> It goes on thick and greasy but that goes away once it&#x27;s on my face for some reason</li>
<li> By which I mean if you just want to rinse it off with water it won&#x27;t work...</li>
<li> The cream is very thick.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, also.</li>
<li> It leaves an awful white cast.</li>
<li> As with all unscented products, it has a faint chemical smell (disguised in scented products by the fragrance.)  </li>
<li> I also haven&#x27;t had any weird acne breakouts or skin issues with it-ever!</li>
<li> Even under makeup it looks awful.</li>

    <li> Works for me! I don&#x27;t find this sunscreen heavy on face at all, perhaps I am dryer on the face. Perhaps the other reviewers are putting on too much?  A little is all you need. I use 1/2 dime size for entire face and neck. It can be a little hard to spread but (for what&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth) I have a cool technique of layering this over my daily moisturizer (Olay SPF15 sensitive skin). The Olay (or any moisturizer for that matter) gives the skin a little &#x27;slip&#x27; making the Alba much easier to blend. I dot the Alba 20 SPF all over my face/neck and blend in, works perfectly. It blends in well with no white zinc oxide appearance. Be careful around the eyes as with any sunscreen. I let it soak in, then I layer on a little pressed powder to cut the low shine to a matte finish. Works flawlessly.  I like having the extra 8% zinc oxide in Alba on top of the 3% Olay which is not enough. I gave Alba 4 stars because this Alba formula is too high in Dimethicone, and one would wish it was down the line of ingredients versus being 2nd. Dimethicone is a safe moisturizing silicone but I have read it can be a little drying to the skin. Most formulas have Dimethicone may be 6 to 8 (or more) down the line of ingredients. I also use Kiss my Face, Face Factor SPF 30 under the Alba SPF 20 also but the KMF Face Factor doesn&#x27;t give as much slip as the Olay! Hope that helps. I buy this product in retail stores and not online.</li>
    <li> Keep this stuff away from your eyes because it HURTS! A little odd considering it&#x27;s a facial sunscreen. I&#x27;m only using it because my facialist recommended it. You only need a pea-sized drop for your whole face. It comes on VERY white and you need to spend quite a bit of time rubbing it in, but once you do, there&#x27;s no trace of white on your skin. It&#x27;s very thick, also. Be sure to keep it away from your eyes because at some point during the day, you&#x27;re bound to get it in your eyes - somehow, someway - and it STINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be careful and maybe try another product first!</li>
    <li> This is a great mineral sunscreen at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin. Since I have used mineral makeup and now mineral sunblock I no longer breakout only on occasion. I finally realized that I have very sensitive skin and break out with cosmetics and creams with lots of chemicals. Since this is made with minerals its much better for my skin apparently. SPF 20 is just enough because I have not sunburned my skin nor have sun damage. I have been using this everyday for about a year. Very happy with this product. The only thing is that it is very emolient as it states on the bottle, leaves my skin a bit greasy after a little while, this is the only reason why it did not get 5 stars because I have oily skin as it is but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
    <li> I refuse to use chemical sunscreens, they are not as effective and it is believed they may disrupt hormones.  I previously used Josie Moran spf 47, which, I loved but gave me zits and I NEVER get zits.  I am glad I decided to try Alba Mineral spf 20 Emollient Facial sunscreen.  It is a natural, physical sunblock so it is great for sun protection.  It goes on thick and greasy but that goes away once it&#x27;s on my face for some reason so I don&#x27;t really retain a shine.  It does feel lighter than the Alba spf 30 Emollient Mineral Sunscreen, although, you can&#x27;t tell at first.  I only noticed after a few minutes since my face didnt look as shiny and i can&#x27;t really feel it on my face. It goes on with a white cast but goes away nicely as you rub it in.  I bought the facial one because I use it every single day and it is noncomedogenic.  I use it over my daily moisturizer.  Main problem I have with mineral sunblocks is they are so drying, so I only buy emollient ones.  I will need to use it for a while to see how it will affect my face, I will then update my review.  UPDATE: September 10, 2015, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
    <li> I FOUND THIS SUNSCREEN TO BE MORE GREASY THAN THE LAVENDAR BODY SUNSCREEN FROM ALBA. IT WORKS GREAT ON YOUR BODY BUT WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT FOR YOUR FACE.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best natural facial one I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried a different brand that was a bit more economical and paid the price. While the other brand didn&#x27;t blend into my skin and gave me a distinct pale &#x27;vampire&#x27; face, as my husband and I liked to joke, this one blends in beautifully. It doesn&#x27;t make my face really greasy or shiny but it does have a moisturizing effect which makes a morning moisturizer application obsolete. I also haven&#x27;t had any weird acne breakouts or skin issues with it-ever! I love this sunscreen and would recommend it to anyone looking for a more natural and yet very functional alternative.</li>
    <li> So far, it seems to work well. The cream is very thick. As with all unscented products, it has a faint chemical smell (disguised in scented products by the fragrance.)  I will buy ti again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Goes a long way. 2 week beach vacation on coast in NC June sun. Family of 4 with 3 tubes of this and no sunburn.  It is a little hard to wash off but that is the point-it stays on and protects.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen. It goes on white so you never miss a spot but then it quickly disappears. I also love this since it is the non water proof sunscreen.</li>
    <li> alba brand gets good ratings on ewg,org  ewg &#x3D;  environmental working group</li>
    <li> it works very well as a sunscreen. However, it really is very greasy and heavy on your skin. It made me sweat and break out from it.</li>
    <li> i dont want chemicals on my body and this product is perfect for those who are the same. it worked great for me. no sunburn in mexico and i am pale too so it works great.</li>
    <li> too greasy and had white film residue.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make you look like a mime!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it got good ratings on EWG.  It is a bit thicker than I like especially for my face but it works pretty well.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> fantastic ! very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; sunscreen, and Alba seems a good brand so I decided to give it a try. I wasn&#x27;t not disappointed, though I&#x27;ll continue searching for better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is completely fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply as it spreads out smoothly (maybe a little bit too smoothly so be careful not to squeeze out too much).&lt;br /&gt;Less greasy than other sunscreens that I used before, which may be due to lower SPF?&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to wash off without body wash/shower gel, etc. By which I mean if you just want to rinse it off with water it won&#x27;t work...mostly.&lt;br /&gt;Still a little bit greasy, meaning you definitely can FEEL it on your skin after you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;The tube needs a little bit improvement as the opening &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; is too wide for a sunscreen that flows so easily. I have to use care when I squeeze some out--holding it upside-down with the mough facing up helps to control how much you get out each time. Otherwise you may get a burst of sunscreen everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to people who mostly work in urban area (thus not exposed to strong sunlight for a long time).</li>
    <li> Great product and safe... would highly recommend to everyone !</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly for easy coverage! Nice to have one without the skin cancer causing ingredients!</li>
    <li> I think that this sunscreen would be fine for whole body, but it does leave your face super greasy.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected at all. It is runny, but goes on thick and leaves a white coating on your skin, and I put it all over my face, as I have always done in the past and it some how migrated down and it got in my eyes and they were bleary all day. I ended up just giving it away, should have returned it, but couldn&#x27;t be bothered. I have used this brand for years and was,so disappointed in this new formula, yuck!</li>
    <li> So shipping was fast and the product came to me in great condition, no damage.... BUT, I&#x27;m not loving the product itself. I used it in the morning and I regretted it! It leaves an awful white cast. Even under makeup it looks awful. Overall it&#x27;s a good product and I don&#x27;t think it aggravated my acne much. I&#x27;ll use it for beach days but never again for everyday protection.</li>
