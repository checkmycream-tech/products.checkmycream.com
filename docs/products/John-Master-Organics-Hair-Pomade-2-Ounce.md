      <li>Excellent product, I&#x27;m sure cancer hates this stuff.</li>

      <li>Organic hair products &#x3D; love.</li>
      <li>Love the texture of it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product but</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Great natural product!  </li>
      <li>It might be ok for flighty hair that you need to smooth out.</li>
      <li>this stuff does the trick of smoothing it and helping it lay down perfectly.</li>
      <li>works fine.</li>
      <li>Its very greasy, not the kind of pomade I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Am so happy with this product - I will definitely reorder and recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t flake like regular gel which is great.</li>
      <li>But, for me I just need light hold and frizz relief... and this delivers.</li>
      <li>With those I never wanted to go to bed without washing them out first, but this pomade is much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>So worth the $!</li>
      <li>Great product, wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hold all day for thick hair, but def works well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got nurturing, safe ingredients, and it really makes your hair soft and gives it a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>I like the scent, and it makes my very shiny !!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any hold, but is a perfect finishing product, especially for dry hair</li>
      <li>this stuff is pricier.. but worth it for non chemicals and the peace of mind that atleast now with my hair...</li>
      <li>A healthy, natural look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light but has a fairly high shine, and it doesn&#x27;t really hold all too well.</li>
      <li>Generally i can just run my finger around the top without pressing into it and rub my hands together then just rub it on the surface of my hair.</li>
      <li>Plus the fact that it&#x27;s organic, and uses very few chemicals makes me happy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use very much</li>
      <li>So, just use a bit, and your hair will be light and soft all day.</li>
      <li>and even then it worked just as well as the morning when I first applied the pomade...</li>
      <li>Just a tiny dab made my hair look greasy, and the &amp;#34;pine&amp;#34; scent is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>When you use more than a tiny bit it will make your hair look oily</li>
      <li>Most likely won&#x27;t do well for a mohawk.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be too good for styling purposes as it kind of weighs my (very thick) hair down if I use more than a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really provide any hold.</li>
      <li>and I felt it didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
      <li>I really wish it did because it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much at all</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
      <li>It holds his style with a nice shine but not oily lookinget and his hair doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy after a few hours.</li>
      <li>Nice Organic Pomade, leaves hair feeling soft and healthy, while maintaining slight wet look.</li>
      <li>I usually use Aveda Brilliant, but add this product (sometimes mix the two) when my hair is especially dry.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard, but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>Wish it had a little more oomph in the hold dept.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; really makes your hair feel natural with hold.</li>
      <li>When I wake up, my crown stays exactly how I brushed it.  </li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals, therefore components are nutritious to hair!</li>
      <li>I really have been pleased with the results of using it over the last few months.</li>
      <li>I have to go light on the crown or it&#x27;ll weigh my hair down too much.&lt;br /&gt;Tames</li>
      <li>I have 4 to 5 inch hair on top and a short high tight fade on the sides...</li>
      <li>As valuable as my luscious locks are to me, I opted to use a product that would be natural.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair back like the &#x27;dillinger&#x27; look and also holds very well for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an all natural, all organic everything girl</li>
      <li>small is strong like pine tree.</li>
      <li>Gives a prominent shine to hair, certainly not a matte finish, however when used very sparingly (half a pea sized amount) it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The tin lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Good, smells well enough, just expensive.</li>
      <li>It has been a month so far of daily use and it looks barely used.</li>
      <li>Even calmed down the brittle, wiry white hairs with a very pleasing shine.  </li>
      <li>Cost should not be a concern, this contains top quality ingredients and should last a very long time due to the small portions needed with each use.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses this pomade and I noticed how much shinier just a little of it makes my hair.</li>

<li> You only use a small amount so the 2oz container last for 3-6months.</li>
<li> It only takes a little bit to improve your hair.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so just rub a pea sized amount between your hands and run it through your damp hair to distribute it evenly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is great that there is an organic option for all the hair products out there. I like the scent, and it makes my very shiny !! I don&#x27;t have to use much at all (I do have short hair) , so I think it will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really provide any hold. Provides some shine, and moisture which helps with frizzies. Smells like a man&#x27;s product, woodsy or cedar like.</li>
    <li> Use small amount! It works with less. When you use more than a tiny bit it will make your hair look oily</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan, I have thick hair and I felt it didn&#x27;t do much at all. I really wish it did because it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any hold, but is a perfect finishing product, especially for dry hair</li>
    <li> Great natural product!  Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Great product, wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hold all day for thick hair, but def works well.</li>
    <li> Male here. I love this stuff. It has a cedar/woodsy kind of scent to it which is nice. A little bit goes a long way. Generally i can just run my finger around the top without pressing into it and rub my hands together then just rub it on the surface of my hair. I only use this when my hair is down and dry-ish feeling (depending on where I am and the water type). It&#x27;s kind of like rubbing oil into your hair but it&#x27;s good stuff and I recommend it. I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be too good for styling purposes as it kind of weighs my (very thick) hair down if I use more than a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair and this stuff does the trick of smoothing it and helping it lay down perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair product for a while. I used few products before i.e. aveda, american crew, but discontinued them as they were itchy to my scalp and did not add much to my hair.  John Masters hair pomade is really good, it gave nice shine, hold and importantly its NOT itchy.</li>
    <li> Works well for my 3b-ish medium length curls as a finishing product on dry hair.  I usually use Aveda Brilliant, but add this product (sometimes mix the two) when my hair is especially dry.  I can&#x27;t use a lot of the pomade---just a bit rubbed between my hands, then smoothed over the driest areas and to define curls around my face.  I have to go light on the crown or it&#x27;ll weigh my hair down too much.&lt;br /&gt;Tames frizz and adds some shine.</li>
    <li> Very pricey for such a small can. I would say It is best suited for adding texture to your hair as it does not have a very strong hold.</li>
    <li> I ended up using it for my kids. works fine. Not too greasy and by the end of the day its out of their hair. light pleasant smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27; really makes your hair feel natural with hold. And smells really good</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty small, but I would describe the consistency of it like shoe shine. It&#x27;s very hard, but that&#x27;s a good thing. You only need a very small amount to style your hair. It&#x27;s very light but has a fairly high shine, and it doesn&#x27;t really hold all too well. But, for me I just need light hold and frizz relief... and this delivers. Plus the fact that it&#x27;s organic, and uses very few chemicals makes me happy. I&#x27;d recommend it to somebody who has a comb-over or any other mellowed out hairstyle... Most likely won&#x27;t do well for a mohawk.</li>
    <li> Terrific soft shine and conditioning after application to wet hair. This pomade does not yield the same firm, waterproof hold of petroleum-based products, but it also doesn&#x27;t have the heavy, sticky feel of those other products. With those I never wanted to go to bed without washing them out first, but this pomade is much more comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t provide lots of control, but it is good at giving just-washed hair a shinier, softer appearance. A healthy, natural look.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Only 4 stars because the can in&lt;br /&gt;hard to open.  But yeah, helps keep my hair back.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product worked great and held all day without a greasy look.</li>
    <li> The key distinction of being &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; is what drew me to this product. As valuable as my luscious locks are to me, I opted to use a product that would be natural. However, the product unfortunately doesn&#x27;t provide me with the results of other pomades I&#x27;ve used such as American Crew, or frankly any other. There is very little to almost no hold. If you simply want to add a sheen to your hair that requires minimal styling, this product should do the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it to merely give my hair some barrier to the elements, whilst using a regular pomade for the style and finish I actually want. I have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I really have been pleased with the results of using it over the last few months.</li>
    <li> So pleased with the results. Just a TINY bit on the fingers and it softened my dry white hair. Even calmed down the brittle, wiry white hairs with a very pleasing shine.  Am so happy with this product - I will definitely reorder and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this pomade and I noticed how much shinier just a little of it makes my hair. So, I found it online and will use it in for a very long time. It only takes a little bit to improve your hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite pomade out there. It&#x27;s got nurturing, safe ingredients, and it really makes your hair soft and gives it a healthy shine. It will NOT make your hair stiff or keep it very still. It makes your hair lay flat and stay manageable. A little goes a long way, so just rub a pea sized amount between your hands and run it through your damp hair to distribute it evenly. If you use too much, your hair can feel a little heavy and oily (this is because of the beeswax base). So, just use a bit, and your hair will be light and soft all day.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this product are wonderful but it just doesn&#x27;t do what I need it to do:  keep my hair spiked.  It has NO tackiness to it whatsoever.  It might be ok for flighty hair that you need to smooth out.</li>
    <li> Just a tiny dab made my hair look greasy, and the &amp;#34;pine&amp;#34; scent is overwhelming. Seriously let down. I would return, but it&#x27;s already been used (once).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and does as it says. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good, smells well enough, just expensive.</li>
    <li> Started using because Axe Pomade was making my hair fall out. It get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product has no hold. It provides a relatively non-greasy shine, that is about it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my guy friend along with other John Masters Products. He loves them. It holds his pompadour hairstyle in place without making it too stiff where he cant run his fingers through it. The product doesn&#x27;t flake like regular gel which is great. We both happy that its organic so there isn&#x27;t unnecessary chemicals damaging his hair. You only use a small amount so the 2oz container last for 3-6months.</li>
    <li> It has been a month so far of daily use and it looks barely used. This stuff lasts.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Works a treat. Gives a prominent shine to hair, certainly not a matte finish, however when used very sparingly (half a pea sized amount) it goes a long way. Cost should not be a concern, this contains top quality ingredients and should last a very long time due to the small portions needed with each use. I have no need to look further for an organic hair product. I do not have unrealistic expectations for extreme hold while committing to an organic product. Since it is organic, it will also act as a conditioner. No harsh chemicals, therefore components are nutritious to hair!</li>
    <li> Was delivered quickly and smells great but haven&#x27;t used it yet. I&#x27;m sure it will hold all my baby hairs in place!</li>
    <li> Its very greasy, not the kind of pomade I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My go to product for over a decade.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!! I found a Pomade thats organic, I was annoyed by the research I was doing into all the petroleum and crap in my other pomades... Sauvecito, Uppercut, Layrite, Murrays,.. You get the point, I DO own all of those brands and others too.. Well I did.. I have given them away to friends / bandmates that will use them... since from now on all I will ever use, is John Masters Organics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have 4 to 5 inch hair on top and a short high tight fade on the sides... It holds my hair back like the &#x27;dillinger&#x27; look and also holds very well for 50&#x27;s influenced comb overs and a basic pompadour look too... I&#x27;ve gone 5 to 6 hours with no problems at all.. only ONCE, have I actually &#x27;re-slicked&#x27; my hair my just running a minor amount of water through my Kent comb and &#x27;re-combing&#x27; my hair.. and even then it worked just as well as the morning when I first applied the pomade... this stuff is pricier.. but worth it for non chemicals and the peace of mind that atleast now with my hair... I won&#x27;t be putting carcinogens in it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this stuff on this website after using another pomade that had alcohol in it.  I wanted something less drying and gentler so I decided to try this.  Love this product but the price has really jacked up over the past couple years.  I don&#x27;t use very much so it lasts me a while.  Love the texture of it.  Gives hair a nice sheen and the smell is pleasant and mild.  Would recommend, especially if you only use a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and gives great shine. Wish it had a little more oomph in the hold dept. But overall very happy,</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It holds his style with a nice shine but not oily lookinget and his hair doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy after a few hours. He even slept in it and after combing his hair it still looked great</li>
    <li> Nice Organic Pomade, leaves hair feeling soft and healthy, while maintaining slight wet look. All that and organic!</li>
    <li> Ok, the reason why I gave this product only 4/5 stars and not a perfect score is because of 3 things. Number 1 its way overpriced even for an organic product. Regular hair pomade costs $3, but this stuff cost $25. Number 2 it is surprisingly small when you get it. You will burn thru this stuff in 1 1/2 to 2 months if you are using it for hold. Number 3, the smell; this stuff smells like...40% methol coughdrops,  55% redwood planks, and 5% dirty wet rain water gym socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the pros, this is as organic as it gets when it comes to hair pomades. There isn&#x27;t a single artificial ingredient in this at all. It has a firm/medium hold to it and it doesn&#x27;t look like it can buildup at all if you use more than needed. It does not turn your hair ashy white like 360 style pomade does and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a coating either. I use it as a finisher to nourish and enhance my 360 wave pattern. It does wonders for maintaining the pattern in my crown area while I slept. When I wake up, my crown stays exactly how I brushed it.  So because of its ingredients this will be the only pomade that I will be using from here on out.</li>
    <li> small is strong like pine tree. holding power is just like thick oil. not like gel</li>
    <li> Organic hair products &#x3D; love. I&#x27;m an all natural, all organic everything girl and I love this pomade to help style my pixie cut. So worth the $!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m sure cancer hates this stuff. The tin lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
