      <li>Amazing blue!  </li>
      <li>if you make mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Darker colors needs more practice than lighter ones, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll love the dark nail</li>
      <li>I have to wear a dark blue uniform for work so this color is perfect!</li>
      <li>I read a review that said it was more cobalt blue</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This color is exactly as shown online.  </li>
      <li>I layered it with \\&quot;Night Shimmer\\&quot; and it lightened the blue to more of a denim (metallic.)</li>
      <li>Really pretty.</li>
      <li>Do two coats or even three very thin coats for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> Very pretty color, true to picture on screen.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful blue with hints of sparkles in it. Applies smoothly and lasts. One of my new favorite colors!</li>
    <li> Nice color !!! Love it !!!</li>
    <li> I really love this color.  I love how my polish stays on for well over two weeks and the color never fades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the Gelish nail system. This is all I wear. I love the Caution color, because it&#x27;s a great alternative to black. To me it&#x27;s a cobalt blue or some may think of it as a rich navy. There is a little sparkle to it in direct sunlight. Good coverage with two coats without streaking. I posted a picture and as you can see I have dark skin, but this color looks nice. Also delivery from this company was fast.</li>
    <li> so beautiful has a shimmery green sparkle to it I love it</li>
    <li> Beauttful color. Shimmering bright blue. Very close to the sample color.</li>
    <li> I love this color - it is a dark navy but shines blue in the light.  Beautiful color for fall/winter!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this dark blue its wat i was looking for. If ur lookin for a dark shimmery color this is the one i recomend . It looks cute on short nails and mote dramatic on longer nails. Happy to have thins color</li>
    <li> You need to be cautious when applying this, cause it&#x27;s so dark, it&#x27;s so obious if you make mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Darker colors needs more practice than lighter ones, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll love the dark nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one, it&#x27;s darker than navy blue.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gelish color! It is such a gorgeous dark blue. I have to wear a dark blue uniform for work so this color is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Amazing blue!  One of my fav &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; colors!</li>
    <li> Love this color! Dark hue, different shade, very noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is a great dark blue with a bit of sparkles in it.  This color goes on easy and covers well.  Great winter color!</li>
    <li> This color is a very deep blue with alot of depth to it. Very punk rock its beautiful. would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This colour is a BIG hit in my house!  May daughter&#x27;s adore it, and even though I don&#x27;t love the blue on my fingernails, it&#x27;s definitely my first choice for a pedicure :)</li>
    <li> I love this color. Its really dark and beautiful. Very long lasting and it is even better when i used it with the base and top coat from the amor us brand. They are a cheaper option if you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on the polish. This was my 1st harmony gelish polish that i got. I would buy again but the price is what scares me from other color.</li>
    <li> Terrible ink that does not match.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a very dark blue. Wish it was darker but it&#x27;s still gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Covers well. Pretty blue with sparkles.</li>
    <li> Not as dark as I thought nothing special till u add some sparkle to it then it Wonderful and Elegant looking so if u buy buy a glitter gel too</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It is grown up and sexy.  If you want blue but shy away from black this may be the color for you.  My polish came sooner than I expected and I just love it.  You can probably mix it with other blues although I will not as I&#x27;m not a fan of layering.  Glitter like Waterfield or Vegas nights compliments it nicely.  Great vendor/fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product! Lasts a long time and the color is very vibrant. Love Gelish products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, shimmery navy blue. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with the Gelish colors, and that is still true. The colors are deep and rich, and the coverage is great. I decided to try out a diy matte finish and it looks like denim. My hubby said &amp;#34;wow, that&#x27;s a nice color&amp;#34; before the matte finish, which is probably the best compliment I&#x27;ve gotten from him on something like this. (He has informed me that nails should be shiny).</li>
    <li> I started doing my own gel polish about 4 or 5 months ago.  The problem with buying these colors online is that the color is typically not true to what you see on your screen.  A good tip is to go to youtube, there are several videos that compare and will show you the actual colors.  Regarding this color, I wanted BLUE that did NOT look BLACK.  This is exactly what I was looking for but NOTE: the color of this product is NOT NAVY as it appears onscreen, it is METALLIC ROYAL BLUE.  Absolutely beautiful, this will probably be my staple toe color. :)</li>
    <li> A color sure to be loved by all. Even though I have not been able to try it out yet, it looks so pretty just in the bottle and I&#x27;m sure on. Arrived quickly and would recommend this to anyone who wants a great gel polish. The size of the bottle was larger than expected and worth every penny so don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> pretty true to color...not quite as dark as photo but really close!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product - beautiful blue!  Even better it lasts or at least 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m hooked and have invested a lot of money and time learning to do this on my own.  Great products!</li>
    <li> Exactly the color I was looking for. It is navy blue with a bit of shimmer. I read a review that said it was more cobalt blue but that&#x27;s not true</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It is gorgeous.  It is well pigmented and I kept it on a little over a week and I am sure it would have lasted longer.  I did a silver stamp over it and it really was beautiful!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, but requires a few coats.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and easy to work with it ! Love the color !</li>
    <li> Beautiful color...love it. Long lasting navy blue with a touch of metallic finish.  I love Belisha colors and will clone to purchase them.</li>
    <li> i am very particular about nails. for years i&#x27;ve been waiting for a product like this where i can have long lasting color for weeks and no chipping or very little. with the system and the uv light dryer, i&#x27;m all set.</li>
    <li> I have never been into any kind of blue nail polish until very recently, growing tired of all the reds, etc. I decided to give this a try and play around with it a little by layering. The color by itself is a deep royal blue, I would say verging on navy, but not quite. It has a very pretty metallic to it and I&#x27;m able to detect turquois in the sparkle. I think that is what makes it really unique and gives it depth. I layered it with \\&quot;Night Shimmer\\&quot; and it lightened the blue to more of a denim (metallic.) Both were so pretty, that when I had the denim look on one hand and started with the two coats of the \\&quot;Caution\\&quot; on the other, I really had a hard time deciding which I liked better and contemplated removing the \\&quot;denim\\&quot; look and starting over! To get the \\&quot;denim\\&quot; look, I used 2 coats of \\&quot;Caution\\&quot; followed by 2 coats of \\&quot;Night Shimmer.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love the color, dark but doesn&#x27;t look black. Goes on well, just make sure you use thin coats. Haven&#x27;t had any trouble using different brand base or top coats with this brand.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty deep cobalt blue with a nice shimmer. The color is nicely represented by the gelish picture and covered well with 2 coats.</li>
    <li> I know from having my nails done to use very little polish and go as close to the sides as you comfortably can.  Do two coats or even three very thin coats for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about four colors and like all so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to thin them when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish step - by step instructions came with all Gel products as when I read the failed attempts I know they missed a crucial step.  Like the rubbing alcohol at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure and soak for at least 20 minutes in a fast polish remover and 30 minutes is better to not damage nails by scraping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish should come off in one piece if soaked long enough!</li>
    <li> colour wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great and lasts forever !!!! Last about 4 weeks on hands and almost 8 weeks on your feet !!!!</li>
    <li> The blue is a beautiful deep dark royal and the sparkle is a subtle shimmering teal. I was expecting a sparkly blue which would have been great but I really love this one.</li>
    <li> It is a great color but it is not as dark or as blue as it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love the Caution polish color for a blue french manicure or nautical themed nail. One of the best colors in Gelish. Plenty rich in color pigment, smooth application.</li>
    <li> I received the gel nail polish in great condition. The color looks great and nothing is wrong with the product</li>
    <li> This color is awesome. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I expected this polish to be a deep navy blue with a slight sparkle. Well it does have a slight sparkle, very subtle, which I like but the blue is more royal blue.  It&#x27;s not bright but it&#x27;s very noticably blue.  Sometimes when you have a very deep navy polish, it can look black in certain light - this will NOT look black.  Like I said, it&#x27;s a royal blue.</li>
    <li> deep blue that ive always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;this blue is almost the same as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;i love it! black was too much for me, i was looking for a deep blue one for a while. this is nice.</li>
    <li> This color is exactly as shown online.  A nice dark blue with a shimmer.  (It&#x27;s not glittery/sparkly).  This color will look great with anything you wear; fancy or casual.  I&#x27;ll be using this color a lot.</li>
    <li> This is not quite what i was looking for, I wanted a solid deep blue color and this one is a shade lighter then depicted and also is glittery which doesn&#x27;t show up in the picture either. I&#x27;m ok with the color but would still like to find a deep solid blue. It also applies perfectly, not to thick, not too thin.</li>
    <li> This is not my usual choice of color but I wanted to try something new.  So glad I did to!!  This is a navy blue color.  Looks great if you want to try doing a light color and add this blue to the tips!  Last week I painted the entire nail with Caution then added Waterford to the tips.. Looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Very dark (almost black looking) yet in certain shades, it is a very pretty sparkly dark blue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice color but didn&#x27;t stay on like the nail salon gels do.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping. Love being able to get a larger bottle for less money than they charge at Sally&#x27;s for the mini size. Ordered one afternoon and it was at my door 1 day later.</li>
    <li> I saw some of the pics of this color online, but it color is even prettier up close and personal.  This is a deep blue with purple undertones. It is absolutely gorgeous in sunlight.</li>
    <li> This product lived up to the reviews, navy blue with sparkles in the right lighting, have had on for 2 weeks, still looks great!</li>
    <li> I love it! Really pretty.The perfect blue. It has the perfect amount of shimmer so it shines in the sunlight.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl. She has the gel light and a kit to apply the colors. This color came out very nice and she loves it. I would highly recommend this gel product.</li>
    <li> I really love their color line, but the paints are a little thin, but my nail technician uses 3 coats and its great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great gel polish</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using the product wrong but it is difficult to paint with because of its thickness. The UV lamp does not dry this product quickly compared to other gel polishes. The delivery was earlier than it&#x27;s delivery date.</li>
    <li> I bought this color with the direct intent of layering it with the Gelish effects color \\&quot;Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy\\&quot; with this color as the base.  This color came a couple days ahead of my other one so I put this color on solo at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not wear blues.  I&#x27;ve always thought they looked horrible or \\&quot;teenage\\&quot; on me (I&#x27;m in my 40s).  But this color just worked.  It&#x27;s a classy blue.  In certain light (indoors/office) it looks more navy.  Out in the sunlight, it looks more Royal and you see the shimmer in it more.  I wish it was a tad more shimmery alone but that&#x27;s where Izzy Wizzy took it up to a whole other level!  Those two together make one fantasic color! (Izzy Wizzy is an irridescent blue/purple sparkle coat for adding effects to colors)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this color alone wouldn&#x27;t be one of my faves, layering with Izzy Wizzy it&#x27;s now my #2 favorite color.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would be a little darker like pictured but it&#x27;s not. Overall it&#x27;s a really nice deep blue color. Kind of sparkly-not glittery but there&#x27;s a nice sparkle to it! It&#x27;s very pretty:)</li>
    <li> I borrowed this from my daughter.  Loved it!  Bought some for myself.  Many dark colors take 3 thin coats but this one took only 2.  Looked great!</li>
