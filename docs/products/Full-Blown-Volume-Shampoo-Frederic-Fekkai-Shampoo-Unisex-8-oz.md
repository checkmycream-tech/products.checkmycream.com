      <li>A great match for the full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this shampoo smells absolutely amazing.  I didn&#x27;t see a ton of volume difference, but I definitely would buy it again because the smell is similar to a peachy smell and made me feel luxurious.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing!  Loved the citrusy smell right from the start!  You didn&#x27;t need a lot of product to get a good lather and it left my super fine hair feeling incredibly soft!  Downside?  Not a fan of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received this product to try free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells  wonderful! and the scent it lasting.  Really good lather, probably because it contains SLS. and i personally hate using any products that contain SLS. The shampoo left my hair feeling straw like so i HAD to use a conditioner after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would never buy it on my own. mostly due to it containing SLS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This combo worked ok. I didnt notice any real additional volume but it was good on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo your hair is not weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this shampoo gives my hair the appearance of thicker hair. I&#x27;m a fan!!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this shampoo. Did nothing to achieve volume in my hair and I did not care for the smell. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I like the product for my hair. Helps me to have a fuller texture!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay, doesn&#x27;t get my hair as full as I&#x27;d hoped.  The shamppo feels almost slimy when I am using it, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very clean.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used several other shampoos but so far Fekkai is the best.  No ichy, no flakes, easy rinse off.  Scent not very strong yet fresh enough.  Been using Fekkai for over 2 yrs!</li>
    <li> Works Great and Smells Awesome</li>
    <li> Best thickening shampoo ever!!!  Works SO well!</li>
    <li> Same as above order their products they are great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It gives a full blown volume as stated. If you need fullness.  This is the product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00FRDPOVU Fekkai Full Blown Volume Shampoo 8 Fl Oz]]My hair is very fine.  I have used this shampoo for years and if I try something new, I always go back to this shampoo.  It gives my hair more texture and body which my hair is in great need of.  A big plus is it makes your hair smell great!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Does what is says it will do-- gives  volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> If you want volume use this and for an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair&lt;br /&gt;in the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always coveted this shampoo.  I see it in salons and I&#x27;ve always ignored it because it&#x27;s so darn expensive and I always think that the extra money goes towards paying for someone&#x27;s beach house.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this shampoo.  First of all the scent is heavenly.  I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling it a spice-herbal blend, but it is definitely not the fruity aromas of other shampoos. It smells rather sophisticated (the smell does not last after washing; at least on my hair).  My hair breaks off very easily.  I know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but I often comb my hair in the shower to detangle it.  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t get nearly the breakage I do when I use this shampoo -- not a lot of hair is left on the comb.  This is considering I only use this shampoo, not the conditioner (I&#x27;ve always used L&#x27;Oreal in the black bottle).  I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;d purchase this because it is still expensive, but if it keeps up the good work and continues to impress me, then I may make the switch for good!</li>
    <li> I am amazed by how soft and full my hair feels after using this shampoo and the Full Blown conditioner together.  It leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage.  The subtle herbal fragrance is really nice as well.  There is a lot of lather from just a small amount of shampoo.  I will definitely be buying more of this product and will recommend it to all my friends who suffer from fine or thin hair.  It&#x27;s simply great stuff.</li>
    <li> I like the subtle scent and the way it gives my hair more volume. I take this shampoo to the health club with me to use three times a week after I swim.</li>
    <li> Full volume is what you get.  A little bit of this shampoo works wonders.  It can be drying, so don&#x27;t use too much.  Use this with the matching conditioner and perhaps a tangle free spray after you clean your hair.  It works really well to create squeaky clean hair that coupled with the volumizing mousse, gives you fuller hair.  It smells good and I would recommend!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was that this shampoo smells fantastic, very citrusy. It lathers up well and my hair felt very clean afterwords. But it didn&#x27;t do anything for the volume unless I used other products. I don&#x27;t buy into the idea that you have to buy a whole line of the same products to make your hair have more volume or more whatever they are selling. I didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable using this every time I shampoo as I color my hair red and this was not meant for color protection. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with this shampoo but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is better than other shampoos at a similar price.</li>
    <li> I have used Fekkai Glossing products but stopped buying them due to their high cost and my lowered income.  When offered the Fekkai Full Blown Volume Shampoo 8 Fl Oz to try, I knew it was a good match for my hair.  Initially, I loved the scent and I still adore it.  Having thinning and fine hair, for best appearance, I benefit from a shampoo that is not weighty.  This shampoo is just what the doctor ordered and my haircut schedule will occur at longer intervals.  The shampoo is truly perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, not too overpowering. It&#x27;s also lathers to a modest extent -- which I&#x27;m happy about, as it seems to put all its effort into not worrying about fancy tricks and chemicals. I have thick hair anyway so I am not looking for added volume, and just ask that a shampoo clean well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For volume, I find that [[ASIN:B006OHM5T2 John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse, 7.5 Ounces]] works fantastically well. I gave this product a 5-star review, for fluffing my thick hair, and I see that others recommend it for thin hair as well. Check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I love the container here -- it&#x27;s a good size for my gym bag, and I&#x27;ll be keeping the container and filling it with other shampoos for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I used both this and the conditioner from the same line for a week and here&#x27;s a summary of my experiences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers really well&lt;br /&gt;It smells FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;Left my hear shiny, soft and managable&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it give my very fine hair amazing body? Nope! But did I really expect it to? Once again, no. If you are born with fine hair there isn&#x27;t a magic potion you can take to change your genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall? It&#x27;s a quality shampoo that smells great and leaves my hair in nice condition but not magic, and honestly I can find shampoo to do the same for a fraction of the price, so while I like it I, personally, wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> High quality is the trademark of this company.  The packaging is elegant, the smell is terrific, and the net result is perfection.  My wife the cosmetologist really likes the way you can get a foamy result from just a quarter size of shampoo.  This is highly concentrated and even though it appears to be a small bottle, it is going to last a long time.  Great product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> While I certainly like how this shampoo makes my hair smell (INCREDIBLE!) and feel (silky!), I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in volume. My funky mostly-straight-but-slightly-wavy hair is just as flat as always, after using this and following my normal styling routine. I also really dislike that it contains parabens. If I&#x27;m going to use shampoo that&#x27;s THIS expensive it needs to be made with better quality ingredients. I&#x27;m just going to stick to Aveda, which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this shampoo is the refreshing scent of citrus, herb and fruit. But after rinsing the shampoo out my hair feels stripped and dry like straw. I needed to use a conditioner to be able to get a comb through my hair. The packaging is great, just the right diameter to easily fit in my hand, has a press to open cap and has a matte finish that isn&#x27;t slippery when wet. On its own I think the shampoo is only OK but used with the Fekkai Full Blown Volume conditioner [[ASIN:B00FRDPR4O Fekkai Full Blown Volume Conditioner 8 Fl Oz]] my hair felt great; shiny and soft but not limp.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and is easily weighed down by hair products. This shampoo is just the right type for my hair. I notice a visible difference in body and volume when I use it. I love how shiny and manageable my hair is now.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo. No build up, and not harsh.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo, lathers really well and feels very luxurious. I have longer thick curly hair and it gave me a lot more volume, to the point here I had some fly away hair. It smelled really nice, left my hair soft, but it felt a bit too stripping for me, like a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice and I&#x27;ll use it but not a daily shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> As some readers may know, I love all things Fekkai.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai&#x27;s Full Blown Volume Shampoo is another winner!&lt;br /&gt;The citrusy fragrance is extremely elegant and a welcome scent to start your morning as you shower.&lt;br /&gt;My hair really does look fuller when I shampoo with Fekkai&#x27;s Full Blown Volume Shampoo. All I do is blow it dry gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai has not let me down yet concerning the quality of the company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai&#x27;s Full Blown Volume Shampoo is another star in the pantheon of Fekkai products I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
    <li> It does the job of giving my hair some body, with my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo. I also like the way it lathers. I didn&#x27;t have to use a palmful to feel like my hair was squeaky clean. Compared to Suave Professionals, however, there&#x27;s nothing special about it. Since receiving the Suave, that for the moment has become my regular shampoo. While I liked the smell of this and the lather, it did not really add more volume to my hair. I still had to use a 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron to get any boost/volume in my locks, so I honestly can&#x27;t say it does what it promises. But it sure smells nice. And it does not strip my color.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other reviewers who say that this product is good but not great.  It smells fantastic, adds a little volume and helps my hair to be more manageable, but doesn&#x27;t add as much volume as I was expecting.  I was expecting it to do a lot more given the price.  Even without the price in consideration, I would not switch to this from my current shampoo, which is called Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo because I get better volume with the Nexxus shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly short, primarily grey, thin and fine, mostly straight, and limp.  I do not like to spend a lot of time on my hair, nor do I expect miracles from hair products, only some slight improvement.  For two weeks, I used three Fekkai full blown volume products together, the shampoo, conditioner, and aerosol styling whip, and no other products.  I have no allegiances to shampoo or conditioner, but I have used the Paul Mitchell extra-body sculpting foam for over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is silicone free and has a positively lovely citrus scent.  The fragrance is very fresh, but not too strong; unfortunately, my husband noticed no residual scent.  I used about a quarter’s worth of shampoo, and one wash proved to be sufficient.  The directions say to massage your scalp at the same time as using the shampoo, which I did.  Frankly, I find no practical difference with this shampoo from the many others that I have used over the years, other than the lovely fragrance, which is in my opinion not enough to justify the cost at almost $19 for eight ounces.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t add any extra body to my hair, or shine.  It smells nice, but where&#x27;s the promised volume?</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, so a volumizing shampoo is always in my shower - and usually more than one brand. This shampoo has joined my rotation (I read somewhere once that the best way to keep hair clean, and detangled was to rotate shampoos because if you constantly use the same shampoo, it can build up on your hair in a gross way). This has a very strong minty/citrus/herbal smell to it, so I can see how this may not appeal to every user - but it is a pleasant combination, if a bit overpowering at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well and leaves hair feeling clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic difference in volume, but I have also been using this in connection to other products (conditioner, leave-in sprays or gels), so I can definitely say that it is at least consistent with my other volumizing shampoos by John Frieda, Pantene and Aussie. Generally, I like it - it is not a life-changing shampoo, but it certainly is a pleasant one.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells absolutely amazing, let me just get that out of the way.  If this was body lotion, I would stock up on it-stockpile it, it smells that good.  But the scent doesn&#x27;t last, in fact, five minutes after showering, I asked my husband to sniff my newly shampooed locks-nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a short bob, and though my hair is on the thinner side, I have A LOT of it.  So without styling it has a tendency to be rather limp.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that will add some body and give some &#x27;oomph&#x27; to my hair.  I used this, blowdried my hair, and frankly didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference.  I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but when the name of the shampoo is &amp;#34;Full Blown Volume&amp;#34; I expect some volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this product lived up to it&#x27;s promise, I would gladly spend the almost twenty dollars for a bottle of shampoo, but right now all I have is a shampoo that smells wonderful in the bottle-albeit it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets my hair clean, but not much else. Think I&#x27;ll stick with my Tresemme-less expensive and does the trick.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used</li>
    <li> C&#x27;est magnifique!  I&#x27;ve got superfine, long hair and this gave me volume, shine, vibrance, and I got compliments all day long about how great my hair smelled.&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample from Influenster, and immediately was hooked.  I avoided spending a lot of money on hair products, but found this to be the right balance of price and value.  It&#x27;s not excessively expensive, and the benefits are priceless.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai stole my heart with this product!</li>
    <li> I received the products from my vox box. I recently had my hair straightened. I used the volume shampoo and conditioner. It smells really nice and left my hair feeling silky. Not a lot of volume, but it did give me a little.Copy &amp; paste this line at the bottom: \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review from influenster.com.  I did love the smell and it did make my head feel tingly.  I would purchase this product to try for a longer period to see if it did give more volume to my hair.  I liked the way it made my hair feel for the two times I used this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!! I would definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner if you have straight, fine, hair like me.  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and matching Conditioner smell amazing. However it did not get me the volume I needed. I would defiantly try a different product of theirs though that would meet more of my hair needs.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and that is the only good thing I have to say about this. Gives my fine limp hair no volume, no body and just makes it feel dry. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s volume, but it is a great everyday shampoo. It left my hair shiny and soft and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like this products...adds body to my thinning hair</li>
    <li> I usually use Dove&#x27;s for men full body thickening shampoo which is pretty good but this full-blown shampoo really is very good.&lt;br /&gt; It seems that I use less of this to get some more lather and it seems to give it just a little bit more &amp;#34;oomf&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt; It has a nice scent that seems to stay with the hair for a while too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As others have said, does seem to have more of a conditioner feel to it so if you like your hair more manageable this may be a little bit too soft , but for me I really like it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, love everything about Fekkai full-blown volume&lt;br /&gt;shampoo; and as far as great, full hair goes, my mane has to rock or I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t leave the house. I&#x27;m a total EMO when it comes to picture-perfect&lt;br /&gt;hair. Ironically, my hair is fine and limp so I am always on the lookout&lt;br /&gt;for miracle products, and I will try anything once. I had not found a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;must-have\\&quot; shampoo--Bumble and Bumble comes close--until I received this&lt;br /&gt;product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love-love-love-love broken down for easy interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love...the substantial, durable packaging and translucent bottle that&lt;br /&gt;shows the sunny-color of the shampoo. In other words, before you flip&lt;br /&gt;open the tab, you are already feeling like it&#x27;s gonna be good. Even though&lt;br /&gt;it has some tongue-twisting ingredients, the silicone-free aspect is a&lt;br /&gt;plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love...that this full-blown volume shampoo gives you a mind-blowing scent&lt;br /&gt;that is infused with citrus extract and ginseng. In the shower, it may&lt;br /&gt;not feel like an into-a-rabbit-hole encounter leading to a citrus&lt;br /&gt;fantasy grove, but it&#x27;s an invigorating sensory experience especially&lt;br /&gt;first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love...the thick texture, shimmering color of the shampoo and the fact&lt;br /&gt;that a dab transforms to cloud-like proportions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, and most importantly, love the results of thick-looking hair&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s easy to blow dry and style. Note: on occasion I have had&lt;br /&gt;a bit of frizz; a little hair serum, and I&#x27;m great to go forward because&lt;br /&gt;a good hair day (and I won&#x27;t stand for less) is a day worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE&lt;br /&gt;Ace Blogger: WTF: Where&#x27;s the Faith, wtfwheresthefaith.wordpress.com</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo!  Great for fine hair, and the scent is WONDERFUL, best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This shampoo only seemed to provide additional volume when blow drying or heat styling my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any additional volume when letting my hair air dry. However, the shampoo did smell lovely, wasn&#x27;t too drying, and cleansed my hair well. While I won&#x27;t continue to use it on days where I don&#x27;t plan on blow drying or heat styling my hair, I will use it on those days when I know I will be styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this shampoo worked okay for me and my highlighted and color treated hair I prefer some of Fekkai&#x27;s other shampoos like the Apple Cider Clarifying Shampoo that don&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down when I let my hair air dry.</li>
    <li> Tropical Paradise!  The smell of this product is awesome.  Every time I use this product it makes me  feel like I am on vacation on a tropical island.  As for the results of this product, I didn&#x27;t notice really any difference from my usual shampoo.  However it does smell better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this shampoo, but I am not really &#x27;wowed&#x27; by it. This is a nice shampoo with a citrusy scent that is light and pleasant to use but this shampoo is more on the drying side and is a decent but not exceptional shampoo. I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of body giving that the full blown volume alludes to and I found it a bit drying for my already dry hair. This is a nice shampoo don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the price should reflect a dazzling product and I didn&#x27;t get that from using this. In general, I really like the Fekkai brand and love trying their products, but this Full Blown Volume shampoo is good but not great!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Does make my hair feel a bit dry though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have straight dull black hair and I noticed a difference in using this shampoo and how it helped volumize my flat boring hair. Smell was great and made my hair feel soft. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I was blown away by the scent. It smelled like I was in a salon. I used the shampoo and conditioner with no other styling products and my hair held up well all day. It didn&#x27;t tangle and the smell lasted all day. I would like to use this again with some volumizer because it really worked well.</li>
    <li> For the price, I would rather buy a product that works post-shower, as I did not feel that it did anything volumizing. I did love the smell though. I received this complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product through Influenster. I tried it the very next day and completely fell in love with it. I love its citrus scent that lasted all day. My hair felt cleaner and softer. I will certainly be ordering the bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good at creating volume in my hair, but not great. It does have a pleasant understated fragrance and so far does not strip my hair of color. Considering the price, I will continue my search.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Very light.  Leaves hair super soft.  Don&#x27;t need a lot to make your hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, lots of body, easy to style</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this, and I am so happy that I tried it. Not only does the shampoo smell amazing, It gives a tingling feeling on your scalp, and left my hair really soft and clean. I have long, thick hair and I usually have no volume, but this left me with an actual lift to my hair! I have volume. YAY!!!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo as a complimentary sample from Influenster. The initial citrus scent was quite overpowering, but then I noticed more of the ginseng and it balanced out.  It really lathers well without using too much, which helps my hair feel cleaner.  I like the body and extra volume, and my hair definitely has more shine than my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Better than resorting to Suave, lol... but I won&#x27;t buy again. I need light weight, but it didn&#x27;t seem to give me that lightness I look for. I will stick with Biolage.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this shampoo through VoxBox. I&#x27;ve used it three consecutive shampoos in a row and followed up with the matching conditioner, and I do notice that my shoulder length, thin, curly hair does have more volume. And I love the scent. I&#x27;d buy it for the smell alone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more like a 4.5 on this product.  I used Fekkai in the past and hated the product...BUT this stuff was amazing.  I received a sample via influenster gratis to try out again.  I typically have very thin, fine, long, limp hair.  I just used this shampoo and it made my hair bounce.  It was amazing.  And not to mention that my blow out lasted me past the weekend.  I love a hair style that holds.  I absolutely hate blow drying my hair and this was great because it lasted so long.  It gave me great, full, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Works so very well on my hair type.</li>
    <li> Best price,fast shipping</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and found it was just okay. The first thing I noticed was the strong citrus scent. I loved it, but that&#x27;s about where it stopped. I did not find any volume improvement in my hair, though it did feel lighter. The shampoo seemed like more of an everyday, normal shampoo, and that is how I would use it in the future. Do not use if you are looking for volume.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair so when a product claims improvement I am interested. The volume is not as expected and still requires the use of additional products.  Right now I favor The Big &amp; Sexy brand called DENSE, a product that thickens. It is applied to damp hair and then blown dry.  If more body in needed you can repeat the process. Then style with hot rollers, a round brush or regular curlers. People like myself with fine hair have to go through multiple steps to look good.  Fekkai products are seldom disappointing, this product is the exception. Additional information Most manufacturers need to evaluate their product directions.  Most are very vague and could be improved. Also enlarging the print would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;This product works best if applied to my roots while hair is still dry. Massage thoroughly, wet hair and finish shampooing as usual..... for what its worth.</li>
    <li> This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. I do recommend using an additional leave on for hair ends if you use a flat iron or curling iron as I do.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this shampoo and conditioner for free from a sample I got. My hair is pretty flat and gets semi frizzy without any products. The Shampoo smells great and I felt like it really got the normal oil residue out. The conditioner also smells great and left my hair silky and soft. Now, I let my hair half air dry and half blow dry to help increase the volume. The shampoo and conditioner really did make my hair get volume, even without adding any other products. I did add some anti frizz serum since I have that issue, but overall the product is great and makes your hair smell and shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A great match for the full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner.  Gave me fluffy, full hair for a full 2 days (and even the 3rd day wasn&#x27;t bad).  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo is good.  The smell is nice and it has a nice texture to the shampoo.  Although it is thin in my hand it lathers up nicely and does a good job getting my hair clean. As I got this for review I didn&#x27;t have a choice to get a type that was what I would say is beneficial for my hair.  Have no idea what full blown volume might be but it probably isn&#x27;t moisturing and that is what I need for my hair.  I did choose the Fekkai color care conditioner to pair with it and used them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shampoo, when I rinsed it from my hair I never got that squeeky clean sound or feel but since I was reviewing the shampoo I went ahead and put the Fekkai conditioner on as instructed.  My hair feels and looks nice but some thing I can&#x27;t ignore is that my scalp itches until I shampoo again.  Since I am using this product for review  I used both shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks and nothing else.  I have no bugs in my hair but yet it feels like I do.  Uncontrollable itching occurs on my scalp and it was embarrasing to scratch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I used my regular Loreal shampoo and my argan oil conditioner as I had been before this shampoo.  My head hasn&#x27;t itched all day.  That being said I believe its the shampoo or conditioner.  Does it get my hair clean and conditioned?  Yes it does.  It is quite expensive though for a shampoo for a normal person but if it was just great I might spend the money for it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo.  The texture is very creamy and it has a light, very pleasant scent.  After using it, it seemed like my hair was softer and bouncier.  I&#x27;ve tried another shampoo and the hairspray in the Fekkai Technician line, and I&#x27;m very impressed with all of them.  Fekkai seems to be a great-quality line, and I&#x27;m eager to try more.</li>
    <li> For the price, I expected a really good product and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I liked the scent, although I thought it was a bit overpowering and made me think of grapefruit.  So far as increasing the fullness of my fine hair, it did the job.  But, I am unaware of how any shampoo can strengthen the strands of hair and it did not do so with mine.  And, for the claim that it stimulates hair growth -- well, I think that if that&#x27;s the case it would be something for further investigation.  It&#x27;s a pricy product and to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m fine with the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure product which I currently use..</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Full Blown Volume Shampoo is pricey but is a very good product.  It has a very light citrus fragrance that is pleasant but not overbearing.  It does not lather very well on the first application but by the second time it works really well and it does not take a lot to get your hair clean. I am not sure about it adding more body to my hair (my hair is pretty short) but It left my hair smelling and looking great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful! It lathered well and left my hair feeling soft.  Though not noticeably thicker/fuller, my hair was easier to style and less fly away after blow drying.  My husband commented that my hair looked really nice--something I hadn&#x27;t heard from him in a while so it works for me!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has everything I needed! Great fragrance, rich lather, clean rinse, and does, indeed , leave my hair feeling like it has more volume. I have very short, gray, thinning hair and keep going back to this product. It does not weigh my hair down with that coated feeling. For me, conditioner is over-kill, so I have never tried theirs. I have used the Fakkai Full Volume Mousse, but it does not have enough hold. If is effective, light and has that divine fragrance, but just not enough of whatever keeps hair in place.</li>
    <li> I received my Shampoo from #influenster although it was only a sample it lasted for three washes.  It was nice and I definitely noticed a bit more volume  but not sure it was enough to spend that much on shampoo.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from the Amazon Vine program. I really liked the smell, texture and packaging of this shampoo. I was hoping that it really would add volume to my hair, but it did not. In fact, it left my hair more flat than many other volumizing shampoos I have tried.  Unfortunately, I would not buy this product-it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service</li>
    <li> Nice product, makes my hair seems thicker. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I LOVED the smell, it has a great citrus smell that helps open the eyes in the morning while showering. My hair felt clean and was very easy to style. I was kind of hoping for more volume than I received as I have pretty flat hair.... However, I may really consider buying this product in the future. I have long hair, so I can&#x27;t expect miracles when it comes to volume.</li>
