      <li>Delivery estimated time was perfect..</li>
      <li>Great product, been using it for years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately Clarins has started adding that gag-me perfumey smell to many of their moisturizers that Olay puts in all their products.  </li>
      <li>I really love the texture and the scent.</li>
      <li>Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Any $10 SPF15 cream from a grocery would do better.</li>
      <li>Got a sunburn during mostly cloudy couple of hours outdoor.</li>
      <li>She has a perfect face however liked this product and again much less on Amazon than at Macys.</li>
      <li>I enjoy my morning and evening &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; even more now.</li>
      <li>I love this rich creamy product on my face as day cream.</li>
      <li>The scent is like a musk but is fairly strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, I would definitely recommend for woman in my age range</li>
      <li>This is creamy and goes on light.</li>
      <li>This is a light face cream which does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It is lightly scented.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin after use.</li>
      <li>Really like and recommend it.</li>
      <li>And yes, I am a REAL customer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is real</li>
      <li>I have moderately sensitive skin and this works wonders.</li>
      <li>I felt like an old lady, which is not what you want your wrinkle to make you feel like.</li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t like it, it is a bit much and does last awhile.</li>
      <li>It was alright, but not necessarily fantastic or unique.</li>

<li> Too bad, because French company Clarins used to be known for the lovely, natural and subtle floral scents they put in some skincare products,</li>
<li> , the texture was simply on par with any other thick cream.</li>
<li> Very expensive, but I have realized I am worth it now that I am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Too heavy for my combination skin.</li>
<li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results.</li>
<li> Not impressive on moisturizing part, nothing near sun protection despite of &amp;#34;SPF15&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I have it in the pump version with SPF 15 and not only is it an ineffective moisturizer, I hate the yucky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I love this rich creamy product on my face as day cream. It works well with my liquid makeup</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real</li>
    <li> This is creamy and goes on light. The scent is like a musk but is fairly strong. I like the scent but if you don&#x27;t like it, it is a bit much and does last awhile. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin after use. I got similar results with drug store brands at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have it in the pump version with SPF 15 and not only is it an ineffective moisturizer, I hate the yucky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Clarins has started adding that gag-me perfumey smell to many of their moisturizers that Olay puts in all their products.  Too bad, because French company Clarins used to be known for the lovely, natural and subtle floral scents they put in some skincare products, reminiscent of an alpine meadow.  Lay off the perfume Clarins!</li>
    <li> This is a light face cream which does not leave your skin feeling greasy. It is easily absorbed and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. It is lightly scented.</li>
    <li> person I bought it for loves it</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my combination skin. Not impressive on moisturizing part, nothing near sun protection despite of &amp;#34;SPF15&amp;#34;. Got a sunburn during mostly cloudy couple of hours outdoor. Any $10 SPF15 cream from a grocery would do better.</li>
    <li> I oove this cream? Not greasy at all and works well for me. Definitely takes care of my skin, hidrates it.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel. This is my third order. That should tell you something. And yes, I am a REAL customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to notice any visual results...but I feel so pampered!  I enjoy my morning and evening &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; even more now.</li>
    <li> Lve this product! This is a must have in my vanity case. Dont know what I will do without it. I have moderately sensitive skin and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, this lotion makes my skin feel wonderful! Very expensive, but I have realized I am worth it now that I am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> She has a perfect face however liked this product and again much less on Amazon than at Macys.</li>
    <li> I use this cream daily and I am a costumer in a very long time. I really love the texture and the scent. It&#x27;s a great product, I would definitely recommend for woman in my age range (close to 30&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results. Really like and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, so this product didn&#x27;t work well for me.  But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it for years.  Delivery estimated time was perfect.. Thank you..</li>
    <li> Even if this stopped all signs of early aging, I can not get past the overly perfumed smell. I felt like an old lady, which is not what you want your wrinkle to make you feel like. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the texture was simply on par with any other thick cream. It was alright, but not necessarily fantastic or unique.</li>
