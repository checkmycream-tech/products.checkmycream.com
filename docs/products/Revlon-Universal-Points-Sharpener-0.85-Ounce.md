      <li>so I can easily carry it in my bag.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and to discard shavings.</li>

      <li>Overall I am very pleased!</li>
      <li>This is a simple and great sharpener.  </li>

      <li>I really like this thing, its really handy to have around and works well.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good product; I have not had any issues with it falling apart or ruining any of my pencils.</li>
      <li>but good enough.</li>
      <li>super cool.</li>
      <li>This was not the size i needed but it worked great on all my other eye liner pencils and lip liners.</li>
      <li>Great sharpener I like the precision sharpens pencils other sharpeners wouldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Definitely deserves a 5/5 rating :]!</li>
      <li>Thanks, REVLON!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice feature is that it catches the shavings and is easy to empty.</li>
      <li>Judging by the description, I was hoping that it would fit one really fat color pencil that I have.</li>
      <li>This pencil sharpener works great for my eyeliner - it has a few different sized holes as well which is nice.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seems a little strange to be so enthusiastic about a pencil sharpener, but this is a great product.</li>
      <li>A sharpener that right size for my eye pencils and brow pencils.  </li>
      <li>The collection chamber is also very convenient so that I don&#x27;t have to clean up shavings every time I sharpen.</li>
      <li>Give a good point and does not leave little bits of wood on the pencil.</li>
      <li>This sharpener creates a broader, stubbier point that is ideal for a cosmetic pencil for which you don&#x27;t want a long sharp point.</li>
      <li>Smooth tips, doesn&#x27;t get clogged, empties easy, doesn&#x27;t leave traces of other color eyeliners.</li>
      <li>I have not tried the large hole.  </li>
      <li>This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole).</li>
      <li>This is a handy little gadget.  </li>
      <li>Great little sharpener, works especially well for the chunky Nars lip pencils.  </li>
      <li>Also it is really sleek looking</li>
      <li>It has two holes for different sized pencils, and while I have only used the smaller one, it works great.</li>
      <li>After muddling along with a cheap alternative I finally got this one and</li>
      <li>Small, light, cheap, functional.</li>
      <li>This is a great feature because it&#x27;s hard to find sharpeners that work with larger pencils.</li>
      <li>Trish McEvoy Classic Eye Pencil, shade&#x3D;Black]]</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Gets my eyeliner pencil sharp very quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks better than your typical clear plastic</li>
      <li>Extremely well made, compact, and light.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to keep the shavings self-contained until you&#x27;re ready to empty the little drawer, instead of inadvertently spreading them all over the bathroom and into one&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Larger ones can be sharpened too and it is easy to empty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better than my previous sharpener because this one has a hinged cap whereas my old one just snapped on and would occasionally snap off and all the shredding would be all over the bottom of my cosmetic bag.</li>
      <li>I like that the lid on this one comes completely off, so there</li>
      <li>Overall, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and traps the mess.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a little stick to clean the blades embedded inside the sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it replaced my old sharpener which had the normal sharpening hole and the bigger sharpening hole.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately it was a small investment.</li>
      <li>When you finally get a high quality sharpener you can feel how big the difference is.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, it sharpens fabulously AND catches and holds the shavings.  </li>

    <li> The lid does not fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds more than a week&#x27;s worth of sharpening pencils every morning (three-five turns a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little stick to clean the blades embedded inside the sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets your pencils sharp as a needle for perfect winged eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks better than your typical clear plastic sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> This thing is the best sharpener ever. Omg. How did I survive for the entirity of my make-up wearing life without this?  Seriously, it sharpens fabulously AND catches and holds the shavings.  Wonderful. Great design. Going to buy some for gifts this year at Christmas! Highly, highly recommend. Thanks, REVLON!!</li>
    <li> At last a perfect eye pencil sharpener.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sharpener big enough for my one cream eye shadow stick and this one has a piece you remove and it fits it. I am very happy with this sharpener, I can leave it in my makeup bag because it has a compartment for the shavings.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A sharpener that right size for my eye pencils and brow pencils.  Give a good point and does not leave little bits of wood on the pencil.</li>
    <li> Most pencil sharpeners are designed to create a long, very sharp point, which is not ideal for a cosmetic pencil. This sharpener creates a broader, stubbier point that is ideal for a cosmetic pencil for which you don&#x27;t want a long sharp point.</li>
    <li> I really like this thing, its really handy to have around and works well. I would purchase again, good one to get.</li>
    <li> This is the only sharpener I have found that does NOT break the tips off my eyebrow pencil.  I am very happy with it and recommend it to anyone else having the point breakage problem.</li>
    <li> Judging by the description, I was hoping that it would fit one really fat color pencil that I have. It did not. Works fine on everything else though.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye pencil sharpener I&#x27;ve used to date and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive which is very nice. I would recommend this to anyone. (:</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a makeup sharpener that doesn&#x27;t get jammed by the tips of the makeup pencil like all the other sharpeners I have tried...kudos!</li>
    <li> Amazing. It works well and lasts a while. It also sharpens my eyeliners to the perfect tip, I love it.</li>
    <li> This works really well for eyeliner pencils--they sharpened up beautifully!  I sharpened five or six. Larger ones can be sharpened too and it is easy to empty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seems a little strange to be so enthusiastic about a pencil sharpener, but this is a great product. After muddling along with a cheap alternative I finally got this one and my life is all the better for it.

The collection chamber is also very convenient so that I don&#x27;t have to clean up shavings every time I sharpen. Overall, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a simple and great sharpener.  Must have for the make up collection.  I use this with the Prestige eyeliners that I found on Amazon and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This was not the size i needed but it worked great on all my other eye liner pencils and lip liners.</li>
    <li> Great sharpener, does not fall apart and holds a lot of shavings. I recommend this if you need a sharpener. I love this sharpener!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review months after buying this sharpener. Works great. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Good buy, very cheap and pretty good quality. It was above expectations. Sharpens my lip pencils and eyeliners excellently. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like that this comes with a compartment to trap the shavings so that if you&#x27;re doing your makeup on-the-go, you don&#x27;t have to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sharpener comes with two holes: a small and large. The smaller one fits a regular eyeliner pencil. The larger hole has a plastic stopper piece that you can pull out to make an even bigger hole. This is a great feature because it&#x27;s hard to find sharpeners that work with larger pencils. This works with my [[ASIN:B0006B12KK NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil]] and my [[ASIN:B00FKPK09G NYX Jumbo Shadow Crayon]].</li>
    <li> This is a very good sharperner. I use it to sharpen my Maybelline eye pencil and benefit instant brow pencil. Works as expected. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little gadget.  At 74 my eyebrows are practically non-existent, so I use a brow pencil daily.  With this little sharpener I can draw brows that look close to reality.  May seem expensive, but well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not Revlon&#x27;s fault, but this item doesn&#x27;t work with Avon&#x27;s eye shadow pencils. It is sturdy, though, and I&#x27;ll keep it. Fortunately it was a small investment.</li>
    <li> Great little sharpener, works especially well for the chunky Nars lip pencils.  It&#x27;s nice to keep the shavings self-contained until you&#x27;re ready to empty the little drawer, instead of inadvertently spreading them all over the bathroom and into one&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Very good sharpener. Love it</li>
    <li> When you finally get a high quality sharpener you can feel how big the difference is.  I bought this because my NYX jumbo pencils would not fit in my other one.  This one fits everything and works great.  Also it is really sleek looking and I&#x27;m a sucker for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to add (cause I just found it) if the pencil breaks inside the sharpener, theres a little tool, like a pick, inside to get it out!! super cool.</li>
    <li> i picked a winner! this sharpener makes great points on my makeup pencils and does not crack the makeup part of the pencil when it gets to a centain sharpened length, as most sharpeners do. the only con of this sharpener is trying to open it without shavings flying everywhere is difficult to do. i guess it will come with experience.</li>
    <li> The hole for a small (regular) eye pencil does not create a sharp point - frustrating!  I have not tried the large hole.  It is easy to use and to discard shavings.</li>
    <li> I always seem to loose my sharpeners.  These one is my favorite.  Smooth tips, doesn&#x27;t get clogged, empties easy, doesn&#x27;t leave traces of other color eyeliners.</li>
    <li> Small and can be used for small and large pencils</li>
    <li> I keep this in my make-up bag, and I love that the lid stays on.  I&#x27;ve had two similar ones, but the hinges on them broke making the lid impossible to secure to the sharpener.  I like that the lid on this one comes completely off, so there no hinges that can break.  I also like the black finish.  Others that I&#x27;ve had start looking dirty from makeup soon.  Oh, and most importantly... this sharpens great too!</li>
    <li> This Revlon Universal Points Sharpener, 0.85 Ounce works well &amp; sharpens both smaller and larger pencils.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that it catches the shavings and is easy to empty.</li>
    <li> I just changed over from Trish McEvoy&#x27;s powder eye liner to her pencil [[ASIN:B002D509NS Trish McEvoy Classic Eye Pencil, shade&#x3D;Black]] and I needed a sharpener &amp; this works great; I also love her eye liner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do keep it in my make-up bag and it has not opened &amp; dumped shavings all over.</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT!  It&#x27;s a wonderful price and it replaced my old sharpener which had the normal sharpening hole and the bigger sharpening hole.  It&#x27;s even better than my previous sharpener because this one has a hinged cap whereas my old one just snapped on and would occasionally snap off and all the shredding would be all over the bottom of my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this sharpener for about a month now, and it works perfectly! No matter how many times i use it, it&#x27;s still spick n&#x27; span! Considering the quality, the price is a great bargain! Definitely deserves a 5/5 rating :]!</li>
    <li> Good sharpener at a great price. Like the cover and can carry in makeup bag for both my eyeliner pencil and bigger lip pencils.</li>
    <li> Someone reviewing it said when they dropped it, it didn&#x27;t bust open but it did open and spill the shavings when I dropped it in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner sharpener I&#x27;ve used for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caps stays tight (no accidental shavings spills!)&lt;br /&gt;Sharpens effectively&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t jam/snap pencils</li>
    <li> Clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and traps the mess. Both fat and skinny eyeliner fits in it. Good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole). I&#x27;ve always had problems with sharpeners but this one hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
    <li> Great sharpener I like the precision sharpens pencils other sharpeners wouldn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product for sharpening your eye pencils.  Ihave tried several other products and I always get a rough cut but this seems to work just great.</li>
    <li> Extremely well made, compact, and light.  While other sharpeners break eyeliner/brow pencil tips, this one sharpens like a dream.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The Revlon Universal Points Sharpener, does a great job of sharping my eye-liner pencils. Overall it is a good product; I have not had any issues with it falling apart or ruining any of my pencils. I would definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Serve the purpose. I tried to use them for regular pencils, and of course they won&#x27;t work, but I was curious.</li>
    <li> Works well. What can I say? I bought it to sharpen different Revlon and etc brow pencils and lip pencils. It works. :D Not perfect--it&#x27;s not as universal as I&#x27;d like--but good enough.</li>
    <li> This pencil sharpener works great for my eyeliner - it has a few different sized holes as well which is nice. Overall I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Small, light, cheap, functional.</li>
    <li> Great sharpener. Does not harm the eyeliner at all. The container is also very useful, it does not become dirty so I can easily carry it in my bag.</li>
    <li> I like how the compartment catches everything, but the lid isn&#x27;t very tight so I just end up emptying it in the trash everytime anyway--or else I&#x27;ll have dirty eyeliner shavings all inside of my clean makeup bag!!</li>
