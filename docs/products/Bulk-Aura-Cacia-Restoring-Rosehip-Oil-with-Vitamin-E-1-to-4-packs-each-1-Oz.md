      <li>believe helping me ----gives a nice glow to my face</li>
      <li>A dermatologist mentioned that rose hips was effective on rosacea and in fact, she used it herself.  </li>
      <li>Really effective ..</li>
      <li>To be honest, I would have continued using the Aura Cacia regardless since after applying it</li>

      <li>I figured I had nothing to lose and at best, the oil would be effective on my dry skin.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for or what ingredients the product should contain</li>
      <li>I love the tv doctor, love his advice, so I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Despues de usarlo por 3 semanas, los cambios son notabes</li>
    <li> Just bought a second one. Helped heal acne and has been feeling great in my hair. Great find for myself and I&#x27;d buy as a gift!  Shipping and packing could be better. My last one came with it all leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> Does not feel overly greasy, or heavy. This is a product i&#x27;ll probably reorder hundreds of times.</li>
    <li> rose chip oil is great product for skin.It is very good moisturizer. I had  different brands before , but Aura works the best.Wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> have been using this --I believe helping me ----gives a nice glow to my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this oil. I use it on my face morning and evening - not sure I look younger yet (lol) but my face feels moisturized without feeling greasy.  UPDATE: 5 months later, my pump has stopped working. I still have 1/3 of the bottle of product left but now have to take the top off in order to use it.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily moisturizer. It is a light oil and absorbs fast. Unlike other oils this doesn&#x27;t leave an oily appearance. It just gives you a glow. I put my Jane Iredale pressed powder over it and a little of my bronzer on my cheekbones and I am out the door. I love this oil. Word to the wise, follow the storing instructions which say to refrigerate after opening. This does make it a little inconvenient since it is not right by your beauty products but it&#x27;s worth the walk to the fridge to get a couple of pumps in your hands to apply. Maybe while you are in the kitchen grab yourself a glass of water to keep hydrated as well:) Which is exactly what this oil will do for your face. It is great for other things too like cuticles, dry hair, scars etc. It is full of vitamins, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. This oil will not disappoint!!</li>
    <li> I have really loved using this product, so prior to this last bottle that I ordered/received via Amazon, I would&#x27;ve rated this a 5-star. However, the last bottle that I just received has a completely disgusting odor to it ... Nothing like the other bottles that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;-If a product change, bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;-If a quality issue, it&#x27;s a huge deviation from the norm.</li>
    <li> It worked really well for a moisturizer. I used it mostly around the outer corner of my eyes and nose. It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product for your entire face. I would definitely recommend this for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. My daughter and I both use it daily as a moisturizer. I have oily but sensitive skin that still breaks out and my skin is so much better than it was before.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product in an online forum addressing skin concerns including dry skin. Since I have inserted it into my skin care routine, I have no dry skin and this has been during the very cold weather too.  I do not use it alone but between a serum and a moisturizer. I hope it will be sufficient during the summer when used alone but that is several months away and I cannot wait until then to post my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it is hard to spread over my face unless I spray my face with water or other thin liquid immediately prior to use. Otherwise it goes into dry skin so fast, I needed several pumps for my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is helpful to note that, as the description said, this product needs to be stored in the refrigerator. I find this a worthwhile hassle since the product works so well for me so far. I do not know if the seller kept it cold before shipping, it was room temp on arrival but did not smell rancid then nor today, many weeks later.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is magical - I dab a couple of drops around my eye area in the morning, and voila&#x27;, black bags are gone and I am suddenly dew eyed and ready for the day.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this product and love it. I use it for under my eyes and I swear it works better than any of those high priced products.  I have also used other products Aura Cacia and have never been disappointed. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works miracles on my dry elbows. I use this with cocoa butter and it makes my skin absolutely soft.</li>
    <li> I use the oil in my face care blend.  It works well and smells good.</li>
    <li> This oil is not rosehip oil. Please do not sell this item to other people.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this oil is supposed to smell like this, but I am skeptical. The color is bright orange and although it does fell awesome on my skin I can&#x27;t use it because of the odor. Sad...</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a facial moisturizer for about a week, and someone mentioned that my skin looked brighter. Not sure if it would work so soon, but I&#x27;ll take the compliment! Not too greasy. Two pumps covers my face and neck. It does have an earthy smell to it that took a bit to get used to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven for your face.  I mixed my with 10 drops of Helichrysum oil.  Makes a great moisturizer. I use this concoction in the morning and night.  My skin is a lot smoother and even.  My need for foundation has faded.  I simply apply a little concealer under eye, a light dusting of powder and mascara. BOOM! I&#x27;m ready for the day and I look years younger.  I&#x27;m only 35, but it&#x27;s never too early to start warding off the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this product to aid/cure my discoloration from past acne. However to see results you got to apply constantly and really rub it in the affected area. It didn&#x27;t get rid of the scars (yet) but so far it really made it from severe to &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; in a 2 week time.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product.  My skin never looked better.</li>
    <li> This rosehip oil is not good quality. It is NOT supposed to be light yellow, it&#x27;s supposed to be a vibrant orange color. The smell is awful. It&#x27;s moisturizing, but the oil was shipped to me already rancid. Don&#x27;t waste your money, you really shouldn&#x27;t skimp on your facial oils. I suggest mountain rose herbs.</li>
    <li> Rosehip seed oil does not contain retinol!  Retinol is only obtained from animals sources, such as fish-liver oils, liver, egg yolks, and butter (Dunford et al. 2012).  Rosehip seed oil mostly contains beta-carotene which is a pre-cursor to vitamin A.  Beta-carotene can be converted into vitamin A by the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beta-carotene is an important antioxidant so I&#x27;m not saying to not use it, just saying that its inaccurate for it to be advertised as retinol.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and neck, great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> OMG I can swear by this stuff!!! It works soooo well!! I love that it can be used overnight or in the day time (it&#x27;s that light and fast absorbing!!!). My skin feels incredibly moisturized when I feed it with this magic stuff and it just drinks this oil up, becoming more soft and dewy. Great at healing skin irritations and blemishes!! Leaving it overnight is guaranteed to make you not recognize yourself in the mirror in the morning... It just makes your skin look soooo much better!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use no more split nails! I have very thin and short nails that split as soon as they leave nail bed. Nothing would work in the past. Only Rosehip oil did.</li>
    <li> great good quality organic oils.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. i have OILY skin (i&#x27;m a grease ball) and i have been getting drier in the winter as i age (i&#x27;m in my 30s). i started using this to help &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my oil slicks. typical moisturizers normally leave my face even oilier and i wanted to start using something that was natural to help with wrinkles and the like. this oil smooths my skin out and i&#x27;ve definitely noticed a reduction in the amount of oil my skin produces. any discoloration i&#x27;ve had has been fading as well. the only thing i don&#x27;t like about this stuff is the smell. it&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s just not a pleasant fragrance. but that&#x27;s okay because i know that&#x27;s just me being used to all the chemically fraganced stuff. you could easily mix it with peppermint oil or lavendar if the smell really gets to you. i also use this in my hair, along with coconut oil. this is a staple on my beauty list.</li>
    <li> I use only essential oils &amp; natural cleansing products on my face.  I use this nightly, along with a few drops of my favorite essential oils (sandalwood, rose, lavender) on my face.  My skin looks 20 years younger in the morning.  I keep it in the frig so it will remain stable longer.  It only takes about 3 sprays in your palm along with a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil to apply to your face &amp; neck. it would probably take 5 sprays if you did not use the essential oils with it.</li>
    <li> Was what it was supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Used but twice but it smells horrible, probably won&#x27;t use again.</li>
    <li> Rosehip seed oil is the best product I have ever used for healing/restoring my skin. I bought it to use on a rash/reaction to bad sunburn damage, and its helped that Steele down. Man while, I used in on my face, and its really helping with signs of aging. It hasn&#x27;t miraculously life&#x27;s what&#x27;s starting to sag, but it definitely looks less leathery and damaged. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in your purchase.</li>
    <li> This is good for my dry, sensitive skin. It is absorbed into the skin and not greasy.  After opening, it must be refrigerated which results in putting it on cold.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is. I gave it 2 stars because it made me break out. If you know how your skin reacts with argan oil, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this the color of the oil was clear..then I ordered it again..the oil was a lite orange color..I thought maybe I ordered a different one this time with vitamin E last..I checked my last order and it was the same.  I&#x27;m not using it anymore and surely won&#x27;t buy it from this vendor again.  Please be aware...</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a short time so feel I haven&#x27;t benefited fully from it yet.  However, it does make my skin feel so soft and it absorbs into the skin without leaving a oily residue.  Anything left on my fingers, I rub on top of my hands!  I first saw this promoted on the Dr Oz Show.  I feel for the price, it&#x27;s a very good product.  I may report later after using it a while longer, and have no doubt it will be a very positive report.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face for 1 month. I&#x27;m fast approaching 60 and I want to look and feel good. The pump on this is a great way to dispense. Great quality. I keep my in the fridge. I will buy this again. Love it</li>
    <li> My first bottle was &amp;#34;Great stuff, good price :)&amp;#34; my second bottle I ordered smells REALLY fishy... Confused how same product from same seller can be SO different</li>
    <li> The bottle it came in was very messy ,when I wanted to use it, it squirted everywhere . The smell was ,well, it smelled like rancid cooking oil not pleasant . The only good thing about it was that it was absorbed quickly into the skin . No I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this on and off- it is great- you only need a small drop or two- lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this skin care line. This product is super absorbent and feels great on the skin. It does have a yellow color to it and it smells. I would say the smell is the only downside to it. But hey that is the sacrifices we make for an organic product.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use on a hypertrophic or keloid type scar caused from a recent surgery. Sadly, it has not improved the appearance of my scar but it does have a very moisturizing effect. This is my first time using rose hip oil, so I&#x27;m not familiar with the way it normally smells, but I find it has an odd, slightly fishy smell. I think I will continue using it on my face as part of my nightly regimen. Overall, the quality seems to be good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil at night for awhile and it&#x27;s made my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Really effective .. That&#x27;s my 3rd purachse .. I use it every single night and u wake up with a fresh skin..  The smell is a bit strong but not bad at all it smells more of vitamin e .. Will keep using it</li>
    <li> Great stuff for your skin!! A must for everyone&lt;br /&gt;Who wants good skin.forget acne meds, wrinkles around the lips... the best Stuff fir yiur skin! !!</li>
    <li> After a facial it was recommended that I use the Aura Cacia rosehip oil on my face.  I ordered and have loved the results.  My face is definitely more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time great price and I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased my first bottle of Aura Cacia Rosehip seed oil several months ago. I was looking for a natural anti aging product to deal with age spots and fine lines on my face without having to use a harsh retinol. It has improved my skin but like any natural product it does take some time. As other reviewers have stated, there is an odor to the oil but I recognized it to be from the added vitamin E oil, which is good for the skin and preserves the oil. I use just a small pump of this oil on damp skin for best results, it does absorb well without a greasy feel.  I keep it in the refrigerator since it is a natural oil.  I just ordered 2 more bottles online so I will continue to assess the results after longer use. Overall I like the oil and how it feels as well as how my skin is responding and happy to be using a natural product.</li>
    <li> Yep! It sure does make the skin look so much better. I did not recognize myself this morning in the mirror. I went from looking dull and ole looking to looking fab and fit and glamorous and younger. I love this ........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not that bad once it is rubbed into the skin ...as one reviewer said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i must update this review. i am not using this anymore. it seemed to cause a rash after continual use. i have other products that do this. i guess i could try using it less frequently like all my others. i will try that and update. best wishes.</li>
    <li> I am not sorry I made this purchase. I keep it in the refrigerator per the instructions on the bottle. I like to use it on my hair and face. No problems with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a large scar for myself, but started to use it on my son for his eczema and it is very soothing and helps control the flare ups. it is helping my scar to heal up as well</li>
    <li> After just 3 weeks of applying to my face at bedtime along with Jojoba Essential Oil, I can&#x27;t even find the little wrinkles I had around my eyes.  And I didn&#x27;t expect this but my Rosacea is 90% improved.  I can&#x27;t praise this enough.  My skin overall looks better too.  I&#x27;ve suffered with the redness of Rosacea for over 10 years and in just 3 weeks it&#x27;s almost gone.  amazing.</li>
    <li> wonderful product and I love how moisterized my skin feels around my eyes.  Would recommend the autoship too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making my own skincare now and this is one of a few oils I use on my face now for moisturizer, along with argan oil, sea buckthorn seed oil and a couple drops of essential oils.  It&#x27;s so much less expensive than the organic lines of skincare that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the aroma very much but the texture is nice and soft. I liked when I combine it with olive oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years, and tried just about everything under the sun. I read a blog post about this and decided to try it. Absolutely amazing. The first month I had 2 blemishes pop up. I averaged dozens over a month, so two was phenomenal. The next month I had none. NONE! I haven&#x27;t had skin like this since high school. I have chronic dry skin and eczema, and this has helped with that as well. All natural, cheap, and the most effective thing I have ever tried. Incredible stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought it weeks ago and I love it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t have the expiration date.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product, but when I opened the package it was broken, it was a shame, you should be more careful with the shipment of these type of products .</li>
    <li> This is not real rosehip oil. this is fish oil!!!</li>
    <li> This was okay. Didnt see a huge change on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this rosehip seed oil. It&#x27;s fantastic; and the price is very good for the quality of the oil. I have been using this for my facial oil blend. I mix 1/3 of the following oils: rosehip seed oil, grape seed oil, and jojoba oil; and then add 15 - 20 drops of carrot seed E.O., lavender E.O., and chamomile E.O. This blend has been great for my oily/mature skin that is prone to breakouts. I wash my face with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s mild baby soap, follow that up with witch hazel toner, and then apply the oil blend to my face, neck, and chest (if I&#x27;m fresh out of the shower). I do this at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my wrinkles noticeably diminished. My face is so soft, and I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> loved the way the oil made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> As promissed skin is suptle and softer. I&#x27;ve been using the light almost odorless oil mixed into my moisturizer for a month. Results are amazing.</li>
    <li> This was a my second bottle and it seems very orange this time.  I&#x27;ve been mixing it with my moisturizer to cut down on the color.  Not sure I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this for my face, soaks right in &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with break-outs, which sometimes happen when I use other moisturizers full of complicated synthetic ingrediants.  Also is great to use around the eye area with no stinging.  Makes skin soft as a rose petal.</li>
    <li> love the rosehip oil, and the non greasy after applied on face. my skin is more smoother after a week use. I do recommend to buy this product. It does help smooth out the  fine lines and wrinkle, also scar and brighten up all the dull skin</li>
    <li> No change/improvement noted in skin.</li>
    <li> this has improved my skin so much. AMAZING product!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on nightly before bed and my skin drinks it up! (and I have oily/combo skin)&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a nice glow by morning :)</li>
    <li> Great for aging or sensitive dry skin! This stuff works miracles, my sister and I both apply this twice a day and it is a noticeable improvement in a very short time. Also great on hair and works wonders on dark spots and scars!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, spots on my face are gone!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have been using this on my face for 1 month and everyone tells me that my face looks different clean, silky, bright, fresh. It is not bright yellow as they say in some reviews , is almost orange, remember  this oil also has vitamin E so is not pure rosehip oil , so it will not be identical to others that are pure rosehip oil but i think it works great. I am 25 and works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> All the reviews have been raving about the product, so I may have just gotten a bad batch.  The oil has an old, rancid smell.  I know oil blends can smell like this after they expire, but this has no expiration date on it so there is no way to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it anyway and my skin was breaking out.  It takes a while for skin to get used to new products, but with the bad smell, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very surprised there is no expiration date.  Essential oils will last for years, but they eventually do go bad.</li>
    <li> I happened to be watching Dr. Oz one day and it caught my attention when I heard the topic was about rosacea.  A dermatologist mentioned that rose hips was effective on rosacea and in fact, she used it herself.  I looked at various providers and liked that the Aura Cacia Rosehip was organic and found the reviews very helpful.  When I came upon one of the reviews, it said that her rosacea had improved by use.  I figured I had nothing to lose and at best, the oil would be effective on my dry skin.  I must say that I fell in love with the product quickly and after using it several times at night that I did notice my rosacea&#x27;s redness had decreased.  To be honest, I would have continued using the Aura Cacia regardless since after applying it my skin feels as if it has been massaged and the sensation lasts for about ten minutes.  I&#x27;ve never had this reaction with any products I used and it is a wonderful sensation.  I have always had extremely sensitive skin and was happy that the rose hip did not cause a reaction.  What is really nice is that one pump of the bottle is enough for my whole face.  So, if you have sensitive skin, there is a good chance you will be able to receive benefit from this product.  Another no brainer is that the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Maybe you&#x27;ve been searching your entire life for that one silky, sweet-smelling moisturizer that will change everything.  And then gradually, you realize that all those costly, processed cremes are just so much water and chemicals that very few can pronounce, the empty promises of a handsome label.  One after another leaves you brokenhearted and your bathroom a little more cluttered with half-used containers.  Then you notice this short brown bottle of oil, nothing shiny about it, but somehow it&#x27;s been there for you year after year, taking care of your skin and calming it down when you make the disastrous choice to follow another beauty trend. (But Diane Kruger swore by it! you wail to your sympathetic rosehip seed oil).  That&#x27;s when you decide that maybe the best moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need whole slew of faux-scientific sounding buzz words and or any fancy actress friends shilling its virtues.  This is just what it is, so now go start the rest of your life together.</li>
    <li> Had this for awhile really didn&#x27;t see an improvement in my skin while using. I stopped using it actually. Will have to check back in once my order of sulfur products arrive &amp; I incorporate all 3 products together.</li>
    <li> I use this every night, it&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing and I have never had a break out from it.  It improves acne scars dramatically.  This is my fourth bottle.</li>
    <li> No doubt I look fifty years younger.  I bought this as an experiment after using moisturizers for years.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this item, but I was sent argan oil instead! I am so frustrated because re-shipping and returning is expensive and such a hassle. Saw a a review on aura cacia&#x27;s argan oil of someone who was sent rosehip oil instead so this is a recurring problem that needs to be FIXED. I am really disappointed and I will not be ordering from this company again as I do not want to be sent products I DID NOT order.</li>
    <li> I received this today in the mail, and upon closer inspection, through a fault of my own, I discovered that this is NOT pure essential oil.  It is blended with Vitamin E.  In the description it does state this, but I suppose I didn&#x27;t do my homework. The scent of this oil smells old. I think the vitamin E is in a state of becoming rancid. Oh well, I&#x27;ll take this as a learning experience, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t take my $10.00 back.</li>
    <li> Great Oil, good for healing scars spots.</li>
    <li> This has made my skin glow! It healed up persistent acne scars, too. I&#x27;m a devoted rosehip oil user now! I just need to make sure my foundation has SPF in it now since this is my moisturizer. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it had vitamin E in it either.  Wanted more of the retinol in rose hips as my skin is more normal than dry</li>
    <li> It smells like very old.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t have rose hip oil smell.&lt;br /&gt;It must be very old product or storage mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy that oil.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning on my face</li>
    <li> I received this in October and it made me have the most horrible break out I ever experienced. I&#x27;ve had mild acne since I was 12, and in the recent years it had calmed down a lot since I stopped wearing makeup. All my hyperpigmentation was nearly invisible and not much acne scarring. My skin was doing fine. Till I made the horrible mistake of purchasing this oil. I used it for a month, thinking things would \\&quot;get worse before they get better\\&quot;. I also thought the biotin pills I had begun taking were the cause of my acne so I stopped taking them, but continued with the oil. By November my skin was horrid, filled with acne all over my cheeks and chin. Now I have the scars/hyperpigmentation to prove it. Thank God my skin got better when I stopped, but I just wanted to warn others before they make the terrible mistake of buying this and making their skin worse.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell and is a bit thick to apply around my neck chest area.</li>
    <li> GREAT product to use as a facial oil, especially during dry months.  No residue, skins soaks it up and looks great for hours.  Nice option for the organic switch from perfumey facial lotions.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like all ladies, I  was getting worried when I saw those wrinkles and fine lines and spent a lot of money trying different products that made all kinds of fantastic promises.  Nothing worked like I wanted it to (yes, I really believed that those other products would take away the fine lines and wrinkles...!) but fast forward to lots of dollars spent on other products and a few more wrinkles that I discovered the information about the affects of Rosehip Oil for the skin being touted by a famous tv doctor. I love the tv doctor, love his advice, so I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for or what ingredients the product should contain so I could get the results this doctor spoke about.  I found this product, Aura Cacia Organic Natural Skin Care, Restoring Rosehip Oil with Vitamin E.  I bought my first bottle, and in all honesty, I noticed the results practically immediately!  Needless to say, I was - and still am, thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this product, and will keep using until I&#x27;m a little old lady (or, maybe I am and you can&#x27;t tell?!?  I&#x27;m not going to! LOL)!</li>
    <li> very nice skin oil. doesn&#x27;t make you break out. good price</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my micro current facial machine [[ASIN:B006HTPL8Y NuFace NuFace Trinity]].  It is fine as far as serums/oils go.  It absorbs well into the skin and leaves it feeling nice.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the way it smells and would prefer something with a nice fragance or fragance free.  I also am not fond of the color  and would prefer if it was clear or had a clean color to it.  But I have read good things about this oil and with the machine it&#x27;s not bad.  But I will probably by a different oil/serum when I&#x27;m done with this.</li>
    <li> Read about this being great for all skin types ranging from acne prone skin to aging skin.  I&#x27;m almost 51 and have always taken really good care of my skin and eat well and like trying new things.  This stuff is so affordable and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.  I only use it at night b/c I have an oily T-zone (altho the Rosehip oil is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil so it&#x27;s not greasy), so it&#x27;s a bit rich for me for daytime.</li>
    <li> I love Rosehip seed oil and have used it for years with great success but this particular product caused a burning rash and breakout. This was the first time I tried this brand. I used the oil like I normally do and broke out, but I thought the breakout must be caused by something else because I have used rosehip seed oil for YEARS. I slowly stopped using different products to find the culprit, and unfortunately it was this. I missed my deadline to return it. So if you get a reaction, return immediately but don&#x27;t give up on rosehip seed oil, it really is wonderful. I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with this particular product.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this rosehip oil as a night moisturizer for dry skin and wrinkles. The texture is light and the smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> This oil is so good for my skin. I use it if I feel a little dehydrated. I also use it as a base before I apply my retinoid product to help the product best soak into the skin and prevent the dryness, redness and flaking that can happen using a retinoid product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I recently moved from SC to UT and it&#x27;s so dry here my skin wasn&#x27;t as moisturized and vibrant as it usually is with a more humid environment. I use one pump every night all over my face and neck then apply my usual face lotion over the top and wake up with amazing skin! It&#x27;s even helped me with breakouts! I hardly ever get them now! I was hesitate to try an oil on my face, but it absorbs so quickly into your skin and it&#x27;s just amazing! Def worth a try!</li>
    <li> IT work so well for the wrinkled and it all natural. i just love it. unbelievable. i definitely recommended. i very seldom write an reviews.</li>
    <li> the label was the same as I&#x27;ve bought before, but the liquid inside was definitely NOT rosehip oil . . . it was fish oil!  Ew! Not exactly what one wants to put on one&#x27;s face. I don&#x27;t know why this product is different than before, other than it&#x27;s an Amazon &#x27;add -on&#x27; item and must be a fake product. Auria Cacia has always been a good quality product that contains what the label states. So I find this very, very odd. And disgusting.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use an oil on my face since I didn&#x27;t realize that the reason why a dry face that is prone to acne breaks out because it is LACKING in oil. Also, I use Proactiv to combat my hormonal chin acne and that product is extremely drying...my Clinique moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it and my face would be super dry (especially in winter). I decided to try rosehip oil because I love that it is a natural product (as opposed to the Proactiv...extremely unnatural!) and, lo and behold, it gave the dry skin on my face a great big drink of water. I slather it on in addition to my moisturizer and I have not broken out ONCE since. I also apply it at night...so twice a day, each time after using Proactiv. It is incredible that an oil that comes directly from a plant can be so good for your skin! Proof that the best things for our bodies come directly from the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I give 4 stars is because after 6 months of using this jar (it lasted that long! you only need 1-3 pumps depending on how dry you feel) I find myself reapplying it in the winter. It is very good at moisturizing but I thin kI am going to try jojoba or argan oil to see if they keep the moisture a bit better in the cold and dry months of upstate NY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil in particular is a transparent orange/yellow color with a nutty smell that I don&#x27;t mind. An overall great product</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, this looks and smells a bit like vegetable oil.  If it actually worked I&#x27;d get over the smell, but this didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I bought it to combat some dry skin and because I&#x27;d heard it made acne scars fade faster--after a month I saw zero improvement on either count.  I&#x27;ll give it two stars instead of one since it didn&#x27;t do anything bad either; my skin isn&#x27;t crazy sensitive, but there are definitely products that break me out, and this isn&#x27;t one of them (so at least there&#x27;s that).  Hope others have better luck with this--for me it did a lot of nothing.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something that was simple and all natural so I tried this rosehip oil that a friend recommended.  It&#x27;s really fantastic!  My skin tone is more even, smooth, and it evens gives me a glow.</li>
    <li> Its only been a few days since I&#x27;ve used this so there hasn&#x27;t been a dramatic change yet. But within the first couple days I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve already noticed some changes.&lt;br /&gt;My small, light blemishes have disappeared already and my really dark ones are starting to fade. So I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use, they will eventually disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply this on after I shower and leave it on over night. When I wash my face, my skin is soft and not dry which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad. To me, it smells like tea.&lt;br /&gt;As far as pimples goes, I don&#x27;t see it doing much in that area. I haven&#x27;t been getting any but I haven&#x27;t seen any disappear either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a way to get rid of scars or blemishes. i think this oil is good for all skin types too because it absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t make oily skin any oilier and gives dry skin the moisture it needs.</li>
    <li> This is great for my thirsty sensitive skin.  I use it every day and it has really helped to keep my skin from drying out in the winter.</li>
    <li> I really like Aura Cacia&#x27;s essential oils so I had high hopes for this.  I took the other statements that it was stinky with a grain of salt because a lot of times people don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No...really, this stuff stinks.  Plus, the texture is all sorts of off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed the deadline to return this so I&#x27;m glad I got it for under $10 bucks because it&#x27;s a huge waste!</li>
    <li> I heard about this oil on Dr. Oz. It&#x27;s supposed to be a great moisturizer. I had many brands and sellers to choose from but I decided on this one. It arrived on time but it quickly went all wrong. The first major issue was the pump. I had to use a lot of force to get the oil out and it shot oil all over me. You can&#x27;t just pump out a little as it squirts out way more than you most likely will need as it&#x27;s just a wast of money. Not to mention you will quickly get irritated as it just makes a mess every time no matter how carefull you are. The oil also stains, look it up, I would buy from another brand. Then, the worst  of all, I broke out very bad! I just put a little around my eyes and I can tell you I do not have sensitive skin. I have used other oils and numerous other creams from all the majors brands and never broke out before. I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I waited a week and tried it again. Nope, same thing! Broke out with pimple like bumps and I&#x27;m 34, past that stage. I then contacted the seller asking if I could return for a refund. The seller emailed me back nicely saying I could not get a refund for this purchase and I was out of luck. I would stay away from this seller as you WILL NOT GET A REFUND! So it stains, makes a Big mess, and many others have said they have also broke out! And No refund! Stay away!!!</li>
    <li> On my second bottle! This is doing wonders for my skin. It has evened out my skin tone and helps with the dry flakes I sometimes get on my forehead!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know maybe this product deserves more than a star, but I had a severe allergic reaction right after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are so natural so I was pretty alarmed about the inflammation on my face. I was looking forward to using this and I&#x27;m so disappointed with what&#x27;s happened to my skin. Maybe I&#x27;ll try another kind of oil like argan or jojoba, hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with those.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil isn&#x27;t cheap, but it is worth it. I was happy to find such a good quality organic product at this price. The item arrived in great condition, the oil wasn&#x27;t rancid, as often happens when I purchase oil on amazon.A little goes a long way. This product is what I used for my nighttime moisturizer. Its healing properties act like an anti-aging serum, without the chemicals. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for awhile now, certainly before Dr. Oz made it popular...  I use this oil combined with a few others in various types of lotions and bath products I make for myself. In the past few years I&#x27;ve become increasingly more sensitive to commercial products, especially those involving the face, and I like to know what I put ON my body just as much as I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;Although I sincerely enjoy and have success with most of the Aura Cacia products, this oil isn&#x27;t one of them. This particular Rosehip oil leaves you feeling greasy, especially when used alone. I couldn&#x27;t quite place my finger on what was making everything feel so greasy and slick until I used it alone on my face and hands. That&#x27;s when I knew that this was the greasy culprit. A good Rosehip oil will immediately absorb into your skin and within five minutes, feeling well moisturized and soft, you won&#x27;t feel like an oil slick. This brand doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and I need to wipe most of it off otherwise I look like I&#x27;ve covered myself in a layer of Vaseline. Could it possibly be because the oil is mixed with Vitamin E oil?? Possibly. Even still, just wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase...</li>
    <li> I got this oil for improving my skin. Generally I get one or two pimples every other month or so, but after using the oil for a couple of weeks I ended up with a bad break-out that I did not have before. If you have an acne-prone skin, will not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Mixed this product with witch hazel and I use it right after I wash my face everyday. Keep my skin smooth but not greasy. I have oily skin and this works great on it. Not a super strong smell either, which I really like.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, and it is defintely helping some &#x27;trouble areas&#x27; and some past-sun-damaged areas. Following an operation a couple of years ago, I developed a small bit of psoriasis on elbows; medicine for that is not much use, and ridiculously expensive. This is a &#x27;replacement&#x27; for that, and is doing some good so far, with just small applications. And since I have it anyway, why not?</li>
    <li> I like the product just fine but plan on making my own product to store in the bottle when this has been used up. I like this company&#x27;s products a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought the Rosehip oil in hopes that it would help my partially oily, partially dry skin even out and appear less \\&quot;irritated\\&quot; during the winter months. I&#x27;d read numerous reviews that this product freshened and renewed skin without leaving it greasy or causing any other side effects. Unfortunately, it did not work out as well as I&#x27;d hoped. The first time I used it, my face looked very greasy, so I thought maybe I&#x27;d applied too much. I rubbed most of it off, but my skin remained oily for the duration of the day. That night I used it after a shower, and I applied less (only a small dab on a cotton ball). My skin did look \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, but within five minutes of lying down to sleep, I felt my cheeks burning. It really stung when touched, but in my sleepy-induced haze, I ignored it. The next morning, I had red patches on my cheeks/face and painful little bumps. It still hurts to touch, and upon researching I&#x27;ve discovered Rosehip oil can actually cause an allergic reaction in some folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only deducted one star, because it did make my skin look very healthy for a bit when I used the correct amount, and it&#x27;s not the product/company&#x27;s fault that I had a reaction. If you have sensitive skin and break out easily, I&#x27;d caution use and maybe do a small test on your wrist before applying to your face. I was just so giddy to see some results that I didn&#x27;t even think to do a test run first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now applying Tea Tree oil to the \\&quot;rash\\&quot; and it already is feeling better. Oh well, my hunt for a natural product that reduces redness and combination skin continues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Made skin look soft and healthy&lt;br /&gt;Smell (I really didn&#x27;t find it bad at all, in fact I kind of liked it!)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Made oily/dry combo skin look worse/greasy all day&lt;br /&gt;Caused a reaction/rash</li>
    <li> Best rosehip oil. I have used another brand- but will not be using that anymore. Keeps skin supersoft and dryness is completely gone!! Does smell a little like fish oil, but once you see the dryness in your face disapper, the smell is definitely something you can deal with.</li>
    <li> I love adding this light oil to my regular day and night cream. I live in Colorado and it is so dry here this product really helps. The smell is a little like vit. E oil and maybe something else but, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> This brand&#x27;s oil smells a lot better than the trilogy. I like how the dispensary bottle is not a dropper bottle. The rubber part of a dropper always break.</li>
    <li> After doing some research on the benefits of rosehip oil for skin, I decided to try it. This is a \\&quot;dry oil\\&quot;, meaning it soaks into the skin pretty quickly instead of sitting on it and leaving an oily film. It&#x27;s also pretty moisturizing, and I like that. It does pretty well on my skin in terms of keeping it moisturized, bright and healthy but it sometimes breaks me out, and I&#x27;m not sure why. I only use 1-2 pumps and after washing my face while the skin is still damp, I gently pat and smooth the oil all over. This tiny bottle is lasting me a long time so when it runs out, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
    <li> I just found this stuff to oily and it smelt funny. My experimental journey of herbal medicine and lotions ended quickly with this one.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so smooth. I use it before putting on my makeup and primer and my makeup goes on smoother. Even without the primer. I even got my sister hooked on it and she bought a bottle of her own. It smells a little weird, but I usually put makeup on over it anyway.</li>
    <li> I got this product and my dog found it real interesting.  He got a hold of it, broke off the top and it all emptied out on to the couch cushion.  Never got to even try it.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this little bottle of rose hip oil. It&#x27;s pricier than other essential oils I have purchased, but maybe that&#x27;s just rose-hip oil in comparison to other oils that you wouldn&#x27;t put on your face (like eucalyptus). The pump is very convenient. I use this on my face every night before my moisturizer. It sinks into the skin very well. The scent is a little strange at first, if you&#x27;re not used to it. It&#x27;s like an earthy tea scent. It stopped bothering me after a couple uses, and it dissipates after being massaged into your skin anyway. Rosehip oil has done wonders for my dry winter skin. One thing to note, there is a disclaimer on the bottle which tells you to refrigerate the bottle &amp; use within 6months for the best results.</li>
    <li> Fast absorbing, skin glows, no odor. I carry this with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have two bottles, one in my purse and one by my vanity.  I use it mixed with my foundation...and it soothes the skin on my face and helps give a smooth look.  I have it in my purse for my dry hands. It does not smell like roses. It&#x27;s a neutral almost nutty scent, very light and barely noticeable.  The oil has an orange tinge to it, does not color the skin orange.  Just smooth and soothing.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible!! It is rancid..don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> Rose hip oil is a wonder substance. It does great things to your skin, reducing wrinkles and redness. Aura Cacia is a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I have seen people&#x27;s review about Rosehip oil, and seem some people confused on \\&quot;Rose\\&quot; oil and \\&quot;Rosehip\\&quot; oil. Rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t have strong rose sented smell. However, it really works on healing acne scar, at least for me. Aura Cacia&#x27;s products are very natural, doesn&#x27;t have bad chemical smell. I also bought their Macadamia Oil, my bf loves it....My bf always feels dry and itching on his hand after shower. I had made him try lotion to ease the itching, but it didn&#x27;t work. After I gave him the Aura Cacia Macadamia oil, he is now adictive to it....He love the pure nature nutty smell, and he almost finished the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Same as other brand product. I don&#x27;t like smell of the oil . Smell like expired . This price is ok. Maybe I will try other brand.</li>
    <li> it worked really good on  my skin, my face scars getting better after used it,try this ,it have a good quality!</li>
    <li> I ordered the rosehip oil when I heard of all the great things it could do. Recieved it 6 months back. Like many of the beauty items I purchase, I put it aside until my current moisturizer runs out. Well yesterday, upon looking at the bottle closely, I discovered they sent me ARGAN OIL instead! Now the return window has expired and i have a product I dont know anything about. Are the people incharge of packaging this stuff illiterate?</li>
    <li> This smells like it&#x27;s really old and is giving me acne which I haven&#x27;t had in years. It is the only thing that has made me break out.</li>
    <li> I use this before bed at night. It just absorbs into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Love the way my skin looks in the morning. I have sensitive skin and this does not break my skin out or irritate.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of oil is Fantastic!  It has replaced all of my expensive serums I have used.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I heard that Rosehip has ultra VitC...&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t feel any differences and feel like my pore got blocked with the oil...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product but  it&#x27;s already open when it came so it spilled all over its packaging but amazon gave me a full refund after contacting them and I&#x27;m giving amazon a 5star on that. So I decided to purchase this product at a wholefoods store instead. I used it every night hoping my old blemishes will fade but after 2 months of using it I don&#x27;t see any difference. I think it contains more of vitamin e that&#x27;s why it smells different.</li>
