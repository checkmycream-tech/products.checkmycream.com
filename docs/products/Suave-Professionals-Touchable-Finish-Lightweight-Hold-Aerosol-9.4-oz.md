      <li>It sprays a very fine mist, and leaves hair looking shiny.  </li>
      <li>This is not a heavy hairspray which I like, I use this after my Suave Captivating Curls Whipped Cream Mousse and it holds my curls great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice fine mist and evenly coats where I sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>My favorite hairspray, can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and it leaves my hair touchable.</li>
      <li>Better buy more before they discontinue it...</li>
      <li>This has a very light mist, perfect to use on my super fine hair before I curl it, followed by a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; spray once styling is complete.  </li>
      <li>I took a walk early evening right before a thunderstorm and my hair still looks amazing!!!  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased after the first use of this hair spray, that I immediately ordered two more cans to have on-hand!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for quick, simple hairstyles to manage flyaways.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair so find a spray that works but doesn&#x27;t harden my curls and make them like glue was challenging.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was TOO light but further use persuaded me that this was an excellent product to use along with a heavier spray.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite hair spray!</li>
      <li>Light spray that gives a light hold without making hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product if you are looking for a light spray.</li>
      <li>Works great for short baby-fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Spritz on lightly before and/or you curl you hair for added hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair except for making it stick together without any hold.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a light hair spray.  </li>
      <li>For a bit more hold, works very well.</li>
      <li>She loves it because it is a very fine mist, and a nice light hold, not sticky and heavy.</li>
      <li>Wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the bottle color; I liked the pink better.</li>
      <li>Today was very hot and humid.  </li>
      <li>I also like to use this to calm fly aways when I wear my hair down.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny, yet didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
      <li>The mist is soft, and has a very pleasant smell, as compared to other hair sprays that BLAST out of the can, and smell like industrial-strength bug spray!  </li>
      <li>It holds great, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff.  </li>
      <li>It smells good, but other than that it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>As per usual I then checked out Amazon because I know that Amazon will have what I want at a great price.</li>
      <li>FINALLY, a hair spray that goes on lightly, but offers strong hold!  </li>
      <li>Fresh, fruity, and very feminine.  </li>
      <li>Cans a tiny bit dented, otherwise fine.</li>
      <li>While this spray is certainly &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; it really has no staying power.</li>
      <li>Light weight, not glue but definitely works!</li>
      <li>I really like this hair spray.  </li>
      <li>It is very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much or any</li>
      <li>I have curls and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy but would keep my curls from becoming a afro this summer (which tends to happen after a long day as a teacher).</li>
      <li>I also really like Suave volumizing mousse.</li>
      <li>Will buy again if the price remains reasonable.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight and holds well.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t fuss to much with my hair</li>
      <li>so I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very a versatile formula</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember where I heard about this little tip, but it&#x27;s worked for me for many years.  </li>
      <li>When I tried it on a hot day in the city my curls fell flat</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used it for old fashioned pin curls, victory rolls, and finger waves.</li>
      <li>IT IS NOT HEAVY ON YOUR HAIR LIKE SOME SPRAYS.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and natural looking.</li>
      <li>When I tried to again purchase the Suave Touchable Finish Ultra Fine Mist my supermarket no longer carried it, nor did other likely vendors in the area.  </li>
      <li>Light hold..not stiff but keeps style in place.</li>
      <li>I love hairspray that allows your hair to move, but this stuff is ridiculous.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a hair spray that would not only hold the set all day but will leave my hair soft and manageable and this one does the trick</li>

<li> but I don&#x27;t like it laying flat on my head either.  </li>
<li> There seems to be a declining number of places to shop, at least in my area, but in addition those who have survived carry only fast moving items.  </li>
<li> It is not heavy or sticky or stiff.  </li>

<li> Does not make my hair stiff</li>

<li> that the spray did not make my hair hard</li>
<li> hard to find a light-mist hairspray.  </li>
<li> I hardly ever do a negative review on anything, but I feel this product is just too over-rated.</li>
<li> My two boys had plenty of ink and grass stained pants or shirts and there&#x27;s never been an instance when this tip has failed me.  </li>
<li> I just ran out of my expensive salon hair spray and didn&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of money on a replacement....  </li>
<li> and I hate it  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> hard to find a light-mist hairspray.  This does the best/same job as one I paid $17 a can for.</li>
    <li> I have curls and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy but would keep my curls from becoming a afro this summer (which tends to happen after a long day as a teacher). While this spray is certainly &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; it really has no staying power.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is very light and smells very good. I do like that the spray did not make my hair hard but I wish it gave my hair some sheen. When I tried it on a hot day in the city my curls fell flat so I&#x27;m not sure if I sprayed enough.</li>
    <li> Light weight, not glue but definitely works! Smells good too. Wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the bottle color; I liked the pink better.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray.  It is very inexpensive.  It is not heavy or sticky or stiff.  Very lightweight and holds well.</li>
    <li> I love hairspray that allows your hair to move, but this stuff is ridiculous.  It smells good, but other than that it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I am sending it back it was not what I had ordered. I had ordered a touchable finish hair spray and recieved a stronger hair spay which I had tried before I ordered these and I hate it  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;  Lori jackson</li>
    <li> Light hold..not stiff but keeps style in place.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray a lot.  It sprays a very fine mist, and leaves hair looking shiny.  Does not make my hair stiff and I can brush my hair to restyle without having to wash out the spray.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I just ran out of my expensive salon hair spray and didn&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of money on a replacement....  I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this Suave hair spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair with long layers and it&#x27;s shoulder length.  I washed and used a heat styling brush on my hair this morning and gave my hair an application of the hair spray.  Today was very hot and humid.  I took a walk early evening right before a thunderstorm and my hair still looks amazing!!!  I love the scent and it leaves my hair touchable. It&#x27;s a nice fine mist and evenly coats where I sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saying good bye to salon brands!</li>
    <li> Lightweight with a touchable hold is what I wanted and this fits the bill great. Also has a good smell. I have used it for over a year now. It costs just $2.88 at Walmart. I also really like Suave volumizing mousse.</li>
    <li> I had initially bought this product at my local supermarket.  I was looking for a light hair spray.  At first I thought it was TOO light but further use persuaded me that this was an excellent product to use along with a heavier spray.  When I tried to again purchase the Suave Touchable Finish Ultra Fine Mist my supermarket no longer carried it, nor did other likely vendors in the area.  Apparently not enough shoppers like the product.  There seems to be a declining number of places to shop, at least in my area, but in addition those who have survived carry only fast moving items.  As per usual I then checked out Amazon because I know that Amazon will have what I want at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hair spray that would not only hold the set all day but will leave my hair soft and manageable and this one does the trick</li>
    <li> Pleasant fruity smell. Light spray that gives a light hold without making hair crunchy. When I put my hair up this spray helps to keep the clip in place. I also like to use this to calm fly aways when I wear my hair down.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because it&#x27;s hard to find at stores near her. She loves it because it is a very fine mist, and a nice light hold, not sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> The only product that hasn&#x27;t turned my gray hair yellow so I really like it.  Hope Sauve continues making it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray, can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> KEEPS HAIR IN PLACE AND HAS A GOOD FEEL TO IT IT IS NOT HEAVY ON YOUR HAIR LIKE SOME SPRAYS.</li>
    <li> Works great for short baby-fine hair.  I don&#x27;t wear much or any make up.  And I don&#x27;t fuss to much with my hair but I don&#x27;t like it laying flat on my head either.  This is just enough hold for me.  Of course whose hair is going to look good after wearing a ski hat/helmet anyways :)</li>
    <li> I liked the fragrance of this hairspray. No chemical smell. Touchable lightweight hold with no sticky buildup or residue. Perfect for quick, simple hairstyles to manage flyaways.</li>
    <li> It does the job it&#x27;s meant to and it&#x27;s a good price. I have super curly hair so find a spray that works but doesn&#x27;t harden my curls and make them like glue was challenging. Better buy more before they discontinue it... All good products get discontinued... Ugh</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It holds great, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff.  I also love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I tried this hairspray several times and each time my hair fell flat.  It simply has no hold whatsoever.  It may have been inexpensive but I&#x27;m left with half a can of useless product.  So what do I do with the remainder?  Years ago I discovered that hairspray will take out ink and grass stains if you spray it on liberally and then throw the items in the washing machine.  I can&#x27;t remember where I heard about this little tip, but it&#x27;s worked for me for many years.  My two boys had plenty of ink and grass stained pants or shirts and there&#x27;s never been an instance when this tip has failed me.  I&#x27;ll simply take the remaining Suave hairspray and put it in the laundry room.  Although my kids are all grown up now and out of the house, my husband still manages to make a mess every once in a while.  So I&#x27;ll definitely use the hairspray can up eventually.  I just though those reviewers who didn&#x27;t like this product would like to know what to do with what&#x27;s left.  Just FYI.  I don&#x27;t recommend this hairspray for hair, but it definitely works for ink and grass stains.  Like a charm, lol!</li>
    <li> For a bit more hold, works very well. Combs out well too. Worth every penny, yet didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair spray! Lightweight and natural looking. It has great hold despite the fine mist. Oh, and it smells wonderful! Fresh, fruity, and very feminine.  This spray works great on mini-pompadours and curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling sticky, hard, or crunchy like other hair sprays I&#x27;ve used. Spritz on lightly before and/or you curl you hair for added hold. I use heat protector spray before I curl and Suave Professionals Touchable Finish to set the curls. Also an excellent spray to add more volume. Just tease hair, spray lightly behind the tease, comb over, and spritz one last time to finish. I&#x27;ve even used it for old fashioned pin curls, victory rolls, and finger waves. It&#x27;s very a versatile formula and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It is great if you have fine hair and don&#x27;t like the cement feel from heavier hair sprays.</li>
    <li> Cans a tiny bit dented, otherwise fine. Timely.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviewer, this one should be called no-hold. I hardly ever do a negative review on anything, but I feel this product is just too over-rated. It&#x27;s cheap but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair except for making it stick together without any hold.</li>
    <li> This is not a heavy hairspray which I like, I use this after my Suave Captivating Curls Whipped Cream Mousse and it holds my curls great! Would recommend this product if you are looking for a light spray.</li>
    <li> This has a very light mist, perfect to use on my super fine hair before I curl it, followed by a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; spray once styling is complete.  Will buy again if the price remains reasonable.</li>
    <li> FINALLY, a hair spray that goes on lightly, but offers strong hold!  The mist is soft, and has a very pleasant smell, as compared to other hair sprays that BLAST out of the can, and smell like industrial-strength bug spray!  It holds well, without being stiff and sticky, or leaving hair with that glossy, &amp;#34;varnished&amp;#34; appearance!  I was so pleased after the first use of this hair spray, that I immediately ordered two more cans to have on-hand!  I highly recommend this hair spray; LOVE it!!!</li>
