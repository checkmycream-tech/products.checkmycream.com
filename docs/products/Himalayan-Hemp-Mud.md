      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this mud.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a month now, and can tell a significant difference in my skin!</li>
      <li>I am always on the lookout for excellent skincare products and I have spent years and lots of money trying every product under the sun.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face soft and feeling great.  </li>
      <li>I have only good things to say about Hemp360 products!</li>
      <li>Hemp360&#x27;s Himalayan Hemp Mud is a dream come true!</li>
      <li>and I would strongly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, the effect was amazing.</li>
      <li>It is such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>But, as I continued (once/twice a week), the result wasn&#x27;t that satisfying as the first time.</li>
      <li>After use, my skin felt clean, and revitalized.</li>
      <li>I will be loyal a customer of this product.</li>
      <li>So proud we share the same hometown with such an amazing product that really works!</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have to be very careful as to what products I use, and this mud did wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It helps clear her acne, and it helps smooth out my wrinkles!</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feel and that it contains natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>We also purchased the raw for the neighbor girl&#x27;s eczema with great success.</li>
      <li>so I used the skin repair lotion and then used the Himalayan Hemp Mud as a spot treatment right before bed.  </li>
      <li>I Love how pure and natural every one of their products is.</li>
      <li>It makes your face smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>hopefully its just cause its my first time using it.</li>
      <li>could be a bit bigger just saying &#x3D;) ...</li>
      <li>I purchased the kit at the New Braunfels Farmer&#x27;s Market and I recommend getting the full kit so you can try everything together.</li>
      <li>and I have even noticed that the fine lines &amp; wrinkles on my face are becoming less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my skin feels so soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I also recently started using this on my feet &amp; heels, and they have been so smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was given the small container of hemp mud, and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>This mud made my face very soft, helped my acne and scares my Kids every time!</li>
      <li>it was too harsh, but if it stayed moist it worked better on the tender irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it made my face soft an dry skin free</li>
      <li>I use it with several of Hemp 360&#x27;s other products and my face has never been better.</li>
      <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone, hands down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m vegan and where can you find vegan products that actually work and are a decent price?!?</li>
      <li>It helps clear it up.</li>
      <li>This mud makes my face feel so soft.</li>
      <li>After three soaking sessions it is now COMPLETELY gone.</li>
      <li>this is already mixed for you and ready to go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a high quality, nontoxic facial care line.  </li>
      <li>This was an important step as it seemed to keep the mask from completely drying, which seemed to be a big secret to its success with my skin condition.</li>
      <li>It has really helped with my acne and dry patches.</li>
      <li>My face tends to feel tight and dry after using clay masks, but this one is moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I have dry skin by nature so most mud masks leave my face so dry and tight</li>
      <li>Truly does NOT dry my skin out at all but does somehow manage to suck all the oil from my pores!</li>
      <li>I found if I let it dry completely</li>

<li> After a long day nothing beats soaking in a bubbly bath slathered with Hemp Mud all over my face, neck, arms, hands, and feet.  </li>
<li> Prescription creams, dry skin creams, Colloidal Silver....</li>
<li> My crazy dry to oily skin just feels even, supple and clean.</li>
<li> There are no artificial ingredients or weird preservatives in their products and everything was around $25-$30, which is way less than I have paid for products like this in the past.&lt;br</li>
<li> There was a myriad of booths selling lavender soaps and other handmade products but</li>
<li> the only breakouts I get are when I am feeling lazy and go to bed without washing my face.</li>
<li> Being a vegan, it&#x27;s hard to find products and they have several.</li>
<li> I had some slight acne on my chest and the mud also made that</li>
<li> No more dry patches!  </li>
<li> but im also a little mad that the jar is not that big at all like seriously the picture looks bigger and for the price come on the jar</li>
<li> purchased the face kit, which included their face soap bar and trial sized containers of their moisturizer, skin repair raw lotion &amp; the Himalayan hemp mud</li>
<li> a little worse but</li>
<li> I had a &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; on my neck for few weeks that I was unable to get rid of.  </li>
<li> It got very bad at one point and was very visible.  </li>
<li> This mask goes on thin and you can feel it working as it dries.  </li>

    <li> This mud makes my face feel so soft. I love it. My daughter in California also uses it and love it for her acne. It helps clear it up.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, the effect was amazing. But, as I continued (once/twice a week), the result wasn&#x27;t that satisfying as the first time. It is moisturizing though.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use it once a week. Both our skins have seen great improvement. It helps clear her acne, and it helps smooth out my wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Love love love</li>
    <li> I ran into these folks at a local farmer&#x27;s market.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a high quality, nontoxic facial care line.  I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS.  This mask goes on thin and you can feel it working as it dries.  Leaves my face soft and feeling great.  No more dry patches!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff works great and face feels so good after use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m vegan and where can you find vegan products that actually work and are a decent price?!? My skin feels absolutely amazing! I was a fan of glam glow and I won&#x27;t touch it now that I have found Hemp 360. My crazy dry to oily skin just feels even, supple and clean. I purchased the kit at the New Braunfels Farmer&#x27;s Market and I recommend getting the full kit so you can try everything together. We also purchased the raw for the neighbor girl&#x27;s eczema with great success. So proud we share the same hometown with such an amazing product that really works!</li>
    <li> Love this mud! It makes your face smooth and soft! It has really helped with my acne and dry patches.</li>
    <li> Hemp360&#x27;s Himalayan Hemp Mud is a dream come true! After a long day nothing beats soaking in a bubbly bath slathered with Hemp Mud all over my face, neck, arms, hands, and feet.  I emerge softer than a baby&#x27;s hiney.  Vegan, organic ingredients &#x3D; LOVE!</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! My face tends to feel tight and dry after using clay masks, but this one is moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I have dry skin by nature so most mud masks leave my face so dry and tight it hurts. This mask leaves my skin feeling great, as do all of the Hemp360 products. Best line of skin care products ever!</li>
    <li> Truly does NOT dry my skin out at all but does somehow manage to suck all the oil from my pores! Pretty awesome stuff. I already own the Aztec Indian healing clay but its nice sometimes to not have to mix up a max..this is already mixed for you and ready to go. Also the oils in this mask truly do wonders for my skin. I have only good things to say about Hemp360 products!</li>
    <li> This mud is great! I use it with several of Hemp 360&#x27;s other products and my face has never been better. I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and still get some breakouts. Well, I DID. Since I have started using these products (1-2 years) the only breakouts I get are when I am feeling lazy and go to bed without washing my face. (Please say I am not the only one. lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this mud. It helps control my oil without drying me out. I used to use my own, homemade mask. Once in a while, I still do for a different feel or for some specific need my skin has. However, this Hemp 360 mask covers almost all of my needs and I use it regularly! I definitely suggest it!</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for excellent skincare products and I have spent years and lots of money trying every product under the sun. Two weeks ago I ran across the Hemp360 booth at the Blanco Lavender festival.  There was a myriad of booths selling lavender soaps and other handmade products but the thing that impressed me the most about the folks at this booth was they had an answer for every question about their product. There are no artificial ingredients or weird preservatives in their products and everything was around $25-$30, which is way less than I have paid for products like this in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the face kit, which included their face soap bar and trial sized containers of their moisturizer, skin repair raw lotion &amp; the Himalayan hemp mud and I started using it all that night.  I have an acne scar on my cheek that I have been trying to get rid of for months now so I used the skin repair lotion and then used the Himalayan Hemp Mud as a spot treatment right before bed.  The next morning I noticed that the scar was lighter which blew my mind that I would see a visible improvement overnight!  After using the products for 2 weeks now my skin looks &amp; feels healthier and I have even noticed that the fine lines &amp; wrinkles on my face are becoming less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been raving about these products to all of my friends so I couldn&#x27;t help but post a great review here.  I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone, hands down.</li>
    <li> I really love love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I slather it on and pretend to be a monster and tickle my son. And&lt;br /&gt;After I wash off the mud my skin feels so soft and clean. I love mud! Who knew?!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and company! Being a vegan, it&#x27;s hard to find products and they have several. This mud made my face very soft, helped my acne and scares my Kids every time! It&#x27;s a win Win! I Love how pure and natural every one of their products is.</li>
    <li> I was given the small container of hemp mud, and I LOVE it! I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have to be very careful as to what products I use, and this mud did wonderfully. After use, my skin felt clean, and revitalized. Thank you hemp360 for this fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now, and can tell a significant difference in my skin! It is such an amazing product! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Im giving it two stars for now because I havnt tryed ot yet lol but im also a little mad that the jar is not that big at all like seriously the picture looks bigger and for the price come on the jar could be a bit bigger just saying &#x3D;) ...well see how my face feels about it stay tuned...I finally tryed it (3/13/15) &amp; it made my face soft an dry skin free but I still have some redness an it kinda made my heat bumps a little worse but hopefully its just cause its my first time using it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hemp 360 potion ever!!!! It smells earthy just like all of there products.(which I love) It goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been looking around for a mud mask when I was told about this product. I love how it makes my skin feel and that it contains natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  The best face mask I have ever used!  I also recently started using this on my feet &amp; heels, and they have been so smooth.  Your skin feels amazing after using this.  I use this along with the Facial Cleanser Bar, and will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would.  Absolutely one of the best products I have ever used.  I had a &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; on my neck for few weeks that I was unable to get rid of.  It appeared to be raised itchy, flaky, skin. It got very bad at one point and was very visible.  I tried everything.  Prescription creams, dry skin creams, Colloidal Silver....none of it worked.  I pride myself in good skin and it was embarrassing to have this rash that would not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this mask while I was soaking in the tub.  This was an important step as it seemed to keep the mask from completely drying, which seemed to be a big secret to its success with my skin condition. I found if I let it dry completely it was too harsh, but if it stayed moist it worked better on the tender irritated skin.  After just one use (soaking in the tub with the mask for 40 minutes) the rash was 50% better.  After three soaking sessions it is now COMPLETELY gone. I applied it on my face at the same time and I have noticed a difference in my complexion as well.  It seems tighter and younger looking.  I had some slight acne on my chest and the mud also made that disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mud and I would strongly recommend it.  I will be loyal a customer of this product.</li>
    <li> Totally love this product. Better than the expensive ones I bought. O also recommend this vegan face scrub:  [...]  it&#x27;s amazingly beneficial for the face!</li>
