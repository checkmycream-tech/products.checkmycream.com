      <li>it smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>Still looks awesome though! :D</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, and i hope it lasts, but it&#x27;s not what i was expecting.</li>
      <li>and on bleached hair it comes out a beautiful color</li>
      <li>Great for 1 use or 1 1/2 uses.</li>
      <li>I love this dye!!</li>
      <li>I would love for these to be permanent dyes instead of semi permanent, because the color is so great!</li>
      <li>Glad I did because I am SOO happy with it.</li>
      <li>And I love it!</li>
      <li>The colour is also amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing</li>
      <li>I always buy this kind.</li>
      <li>and I got even more compliments as it faded.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>, just greeeeeen! :)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade away fast and smells great.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
      <li>I love this brand</li>
      <li>It was sealed &amp; new, smelled great and felt like conditioner.</li>
      <li>It got to my house fast and it was set at a good price.</li>
      <li>This hair color not only smelt amazing after using it, but my hair is still an awesome color almost two months later.</li>
      <li>Best green dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I used this on nearly platinum bleached hair, and the result is a VERY pretty and Very bright shade of blue.</li>
      <li>The color stayed vibrant after many washes.</li>
      <li>It came super quick.</li>
      <li>It matched our neon green walls perfectly lol.</li>
      <li>The Punky I just received from here was fresh</li>
      <li>I have used tons of \\&quot;weird\\&quot; hair dye products, punky colour is my favorite thus far.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what my daughter wanted worked were looked good held steady though several washings too.</li>
      <li>After using this my hair came out an amazingly bright and vibrant color of green.</li>
      <li>it went from a beautiful emerald green to a gross snot color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited to use it when my current hair color fades out.</li>
      <li>I have also added a light blue by another company to it, to give it a really punky aqua color.</li>
      <li>Bought pink and purple as well, and am excited to give those a try!</li>
      <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product, is the same thing i don&#x27;t like about most color products.</li>
      <li>I spent soo long trying to pick out the perfect shade of green for my hair before I decided on this one.</li>
      <li>I have used MANY MANY different green dyes in that time, and Jerome Russell is always the color that I come back to.</li>
      <li>Before most of the Manic Panic dyes went vegan, they used to be just as vibrant and last just as long as this Punky.</li>
      <li>I love the color green.</li>
      <li>listen - if you really want this product to work - you MUST bleach hair first (unless you naturally have really blonde hair).  </li>
      <li>Also after twp months it&#x27;s completely out which I like.</li>
      <li>Not green, not even a greenish blue, but pretty much blue verging into aqua.  </li>
      <li>Color was vibrant and lasted long.</li>
      <li>Did not dilute, dyed straight over a light pink dyed hair and the green came out dark and vivid.</li>
      <li>We did it as highlights on dark brown hair and it gave her hair a nice subtle color.</li>
      <li>The green turned out more like a slime green.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had almost had every color you can imagine in my hair, and this was my first ever green color in my hair.</li>
      <li>The first few washes it ran but after that I had no problem with it running.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I have dark ash brown hair, and even before bleaching, this color leaves a vibrant tone in hair that is almost black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Needed to be re-dyed after about 2 weeks as expected, but worked as well as any of the expensive dyes I&#x27;ve used, and the price is amazing.</li>

<li> Needed to be re-dyed after about 2 weeks as expected, but worked as well as any of the expensive dyes I&#x27;ve used, and the price is amazing.</li>
<li> The dye lasted so much longer than I thought and it really does condition your hair, not like those other dyes that just dry up while it&#x27;s working and makes your hair all hard.</li>
<li> It takes well and lasts long with proper care.</li>
<li> The color has stayed in my hair for about 2 months so far, with only a few touch-ups.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Ion Color, Manic Panic, Paul Mitchell Ink Works (that one is DEFINITELY not worth it), and Apple Green is always the color I come back</li>
<li> Hair that is dirty blonde does not work very well!  </li>
<li> /&gt;Apple Green stains significantly less than the purple or the red tints in Punky Colours.</li>
<li> The color started dark then got to a lime greenish after a couple weeks.</li>
<li> (my hair is mostly dark brown, but the lighter parts are noticeably green)</li>
<li> I have been using the Apple Green color for nine years now.</li>
<li> I bought apple green from the seller Altima Beauty.</li>
<li> If you want just a very slight tint, don&#x27;t bleach  </li>
<li> I dyed it about a month ago and there is still green in it!</li>
<li> and though I wouldn&#x27;t want to age myself when I started dyeing my hair crazy colors they didn&#x27;t have pink or purple hair dye.</li>
<li> If so, you will not be disappointed with the green.  </li>
<li> (Yes it can go stale).</li>
<li> ill never use it again.</li>
<li> after 2 washes it faded really bad.</li>

    <li> listen - if you really want this product to work - you MUST bleach hair first (unless you naturally have really blonde hair).  Hair that is dirty blonde does not work very well!  USE BLEACH.  If so, you will not be disappointed with the green.  If you want just a very slight tint, don&#x27;t bleach  (but 8 out of 10 people may not even notice anything different with hair.)  Great for 1 use or 1 1/2 uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had just about every color you can imagine and though I wouldn&#x27;t want to age myself when I started dyeing my hair crazy colors they didn&#x27;t have pink or purple hair dye. the point is after using about 3/4 of the dye on the market I ADORE Punky color. The Punky I just received from here was fresh (Yes it can go stale). It came super quick.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Apple Green color for nine years now. I have used MANY MANY different green dyes in that time, and Jerome Russell is always the color that I come back to. I&#x27;ve used Ion Color, Manic Panic, Paul Mitchell Ink Works (that one is DEFINITELY not worth it), and Apple Green is always the color I come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark ash brown hair, and even before bleaching, this color leaves a vibrant tone in hair that is almost black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple Green stains significantly less than the purple or the red tints in Punky Colours.</li>

Also after twp months it&#x27;s completely out which I like. I don&#x27;t have to dye it back blonde to dye my hair a different color.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were very happy with the end result. We did it as highlights on dark brown hair and it gave her hair a nice subtle color.</li>
    <li> Best green dye I&#x27;ve ever used. Did not dilute, dyed straight over a light pink dyed hair and the green came out dark and vivid.

    <li> I spent soo long trying to pick out the perfect shade of green for my hair before I decided on this one. Glad I did because I am SOO happy with it. Not too blue or too yellow, just greeeeeen! :)</li>
    <li> This hair color not only smelt amazing after using it, but my hair is still an awesome color almost two months later. The color started dark then got to a lime greenish after a couple weeks. Still looks awesome though! :D</li>
    <li> Color was vibrant and lasted long. No pillow stains after applying this product. i love it.</li>
    <li> it smells wonderful! and on bleached hair it comes out a beautiful color but... after 2 washes it faded really bad. it went from a beautiful emerald green to a gross snot color. ill never use it again.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my daughter wanted worked were looked good held steady though several washings too. This meet all our expectations</li>
    <li> Before most of the Manic Panic dyes went vegan, they used to be just as vibrant and last just as long as this Punky. Stuff. I think I&#x27;ll probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had almost had every color you can imagine in my hair, and this was my first ever green color in my hair. And I love it! The color has stayed in my hair for about 2 months so far, with only a few touch-ups. I have also added a light blue by another company to it, to give it a really punky aqua color. Its also a very forgiving dye, as when it gets on your skin, it comes off in your next shower or two, I&#x27;ve had a few dyes that it took weeks to get it off.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It doesn&#x27;t fade away fast and smells great. It doesn&#x27;t even damage your hair! It got to my house fast and it was set at a good price.</li>
    <li> I always buy this kind. It works well for me. It will lasts longer if you leave it in longer.</li>
    <li> I bought apple green from the seller Altima Beauty. It was sealed &amp; new, smelled great and felt like conditioner. It&#x27;s been about a month and it hasn&#x27;t faded! Amazing</li>
    <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product, is the same thing i don&#x27;t like about most color products. I would love for these to be permanent dyes instead of semi permanent, because the color is so great! Bought pink and purple as well, and am excited to give those a try!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m glad I got it. I love the color green. I&#x27;m pretty excited to use it when my current hair color fades out.</li>
    <li> DECIDED NOT TO USE IT.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It takes well and lasts long with proper care. The colour is also amazing. I&#x27;ve decided to make it my all the time hair colour. Plus, it smells soooo yummy!</li>
    <li> I love this dye!! I dyed it about a month ago and there is still green in it! (my hair is mostly dark brown, but the lighter parts are noticeably green) The dye lasted so much longer than I thought and it really does condition your hair, not like those other dyes that just dry up while it&#x27;s working and makes your hair all hard.</li>
