      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was just this batch--but the mix of the two smells kind of turns me off.</li>
      <li>It sure feels good on the rest of me.</li>
      <li>But once you leave it on your skin for a while it gives you a nice sensation.  </li>
      <li>I now realize you can get excellent lotions that are natural that do just as a good job or would say even better job then does with chemicals</li>
      <li>Kind of pricey, but as I have sensitivity to perfumey fragrance, this is better for me.</li>

      <li>I thought I would really love this</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products but this contains alcohol and does not moisturize, it drys you our more.</li>
      <li>I hand wash many dishes at work/home with detergent that strips the oils from my hands.  </li>
      <li>but i love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>like there is a film sitting on top of my skin.</li>
      <li>Love the peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and cooling.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the peppermint Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap</li>
      <li>consistency of this lotion is more on the liquid side.</li>
      <li>But, there are two things about it that just make it okay.</li>
      <li>and I love Dr. Bronner products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>This has a nice peppermint smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and fades quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I love that it&#x27;s organic and chemical free, I do hope dr bronners comes out with a more moisturizing lotion.</li>
      <li>organic, fair trade and affordable...seems too good to be true, especially for a skeptic like me</li>
      <li>The peppermint is a refreshing, clean scent as well.</li>
      <li>Texture could be thicker, scent is too strong, and I don&#x27;t like tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>Which also means its light and the skin absorbs it quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for my hands.</li>
      <li>feels very fresh and minty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wanted very much, for this product to moisturize better.</li>
      <li>The lotion has a unique, slippery feel to it, I&#x27;m guessing from the jojoba oil</li>
      <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a trusted brand in using safe and responsible ingredients and practices.  </li>
      <li>This is a very strong peppermint scent, so much so it can almost feel tingly when you first put it on..</li>
      <li>No residue after application, and dries up quickly, but I don’t quite like the waxy feeling.  </li>
      <li>It is not sticky or watery, it is super moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is definitely my new favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic, but the strong alcohol smell really throws me off.</li>
      <li>use this product after I am fresh out of the shower (after my pores clothes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the product is natural, organic and I believe safe for your skin, it somehow is not moisturizing AT ALL.</li>
      <li>My personal preference is unscented lotion from Loving naturals, but it&#x27;s out of stock on amazon (temporally I hope), so I went with this one.</li>
      <li>well who knows, turns out most of the natural products I use have a ton oils in it.  </li>
      <li>This one is nice for the hands after washing, especially if you wash your hands often, however I need something stronger for my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is stress relieving and fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh.</li>
      <li>I like that this product is natural, but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m very excited after I tried it.</li>
      <li>This lotion soaks right in after a minute.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion - great ingredients, fabulous and natural scent, and slight cooling sensation (from the essential oils).</li>
      <li>It is creamy and covers well and does feel like it moisturizes just fine, but just note it is not a heavy lotion.</li>
      <li>I have super dry skin that soaks this light, liquidy, lotion quickly, but it leaves an oily glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I swear it smells like a mix of peppermint and leather--oddest thing.</li>
      <li>Lovely Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product as usual. :)</li>
      <li>At first I was on the fence with this product</li>
      <li>Is very sweet - and that was an issue for me - next time fgoing for lavender or something with almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I particularly like this lotion right after I have washed my face.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely work for my dry skin, but I love it anyway!</li>
      <li>It really has helped me alot</li>
      <li>I really like this Organic body lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is NOT greasy in anyway, and soaks straight into your skin without that &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion because I love the smell of peppermint in soaps, so I tries it in lotion, too.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s intensely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The lotion is hydrating, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would.</li>
      <li>so I thought I would really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think I like this product, however I will not order from The Vitamin Shop again. I ordered several items and they were just thrown into a box with no packing material. The lotion arrived broken with a big mess in the box. I wrote to the Vitamin Shop and reported the damage. They never replied to my email. I would probably buy this product again, but I will never order from the Vitamin Shop again.</li>
    <li> I just have to say that this lotion is amazing! I have the worst dry hands in the winter and this lotion reversed my dry skin in 3 days. I still can&#x27;t believe it. Just rub it on your hand several times a day, and it will take care of the rest. Thank you Bronners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Brandi</li>
    <li> Lotion arrived in the promised time frame.  I use it after showering with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap.  It feels great.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Terrible consistency, was not all the way blended and very chunky. It did not soak into my skin. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> This lotion actually made my skin dry :c but I just ended up using it on my temples for headaches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s moisturizing. I love the way it smells. It&#x27;s fresh.</li>
    <li> Slight alcohol smell but i love this stuff.  Im a guy, it&#x27;s excellent for after shave and hair gel</li>
    <li> Feels horrible on the skin. It is very watery too. To bottle had also busted open during shipping. Luckily it was sealed in another bag, but still a mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> I love this it reminds me of back in the 60 &amp; 70s. I will be buying it again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This lotion was not what I had hoped it would be.  It has a great scent but it is greasy and does not absorb well.  I did use it, but will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion - great ingredients, fabulous and natural scent, and slight cooling sensation (from the essential oils). Really recommend it for anyone trying to eliminate terrible ingredients from their life.</li>
    <li> Nice...and smells WONDERFUL (if you like the minty aroma) which I do...LOL</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion. It doesn&#x27;t smell as peppermint as the soap, but it almost makes does wonders for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion does not work. It does not moisturize at all, no wonder why this lotion is not widely available because no one who tries it would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This one just isn&#x27;t that great. It&#x27;s a bit too oily (smells great though). I use it not only on my body but my face as well and it does not clog my pores but it just doesn&#x27;t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they also had a dedicated face cream and Deodorant but according to there site, they do not. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to drop them a line to suggest this.</li>
    <li> Use it for my lotion and pomade. Bought this multiple times. Good quality, ethical, and for a good price. One of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> I really like this Organic body lotion.  It is like a sticky cream.  But once you leave it on your skin for a while it gives you a nice sensation.  You might need to apply this morning and evening as it doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice. It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly pepperminty, and it goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s a pretty thin lotion, and it dries well. Once it&#x27;s dried I can&#x27;t really feel it unless I run my fingers over an area where I&#x27;ve applied it. At that point, I can feel a very thin layer of moisturizing oil on my skin. However, the oils don&#x27;t make my skin break out, which is something I&#x27;m very prone to. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s intensely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The only things I don&#x27;t like about it are that the bottle doesn&#x27;t come with much, and the consistency of the lotion makes it hard to pump sometimes. Also, I live in a very tropical environment. The lotion feels dry in the house, but as soon as I step outside, it gets wet and sweaty, which isn&#x27;t particularly pleasant. Also, as the lotion is drying, it can feel a little tacky on my hands (this goes away once it&#x27;s completely dried).</li>
    <li> Best applied right after washing your hands or taking a bath. After this lotion gets fully absorbed (doesn&#x27;t take too long) my hands look smooth and hydrated, the peppermint smell is fortunately not overpowering. This lotion has an unusual tactile feeling, not like a lotion or a cream, just plain weird. I almost feel like I&#x27;m rubbing some kind of heavy soap into my skin. I think that it&#x27;s not going to absorb, and then it finally does. Typically it absorbs fully, but if you hands aren&#x27;t super clean then I get a weird feeling like there is a film sitting on top of my skin. Unfortunately, the hydrated look that this gives my skin doesn&#x27;t come with a hydrated feeling. My hands still feel dried out even though they look nice. I will continue to use Argan and other oils to get a hydrated feeling, and I will probably reserve this for my legs and arms where I tend to not care about the hydrated feeling as much.</li>
    <li> Good lotion; I&#x27;ve always trusted Dr.Bronners brand line, and they&#x27;ve done it again with this lotion. The only thing I hate about this lotion is that it&#x27;s not very viscous, I would wish it would be just a little thick, but I guess it&#x27;s probably like that because it&#x27;s organic, which by the way I couldn&#x27;t find many organic lotions. I give it for stars because of its viscosity.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the peppermint Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap so I thought I would really like this lotion. But, there are two things about it that just make it okay. First, I swear it smells like a mix of peppermint and leather--oddest thing. The other is that it is thin. It is creamy and covers well and does feel like it moisturizes just fine, but just note it is not a heavy lotion. Feels good though. But, the odd smell might impact me buying it again. Don&#x27;t know if it was just this batch--but the mix of the two smells kind of turns me off. Once it&#x27;s on it smells less like leather--but...</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic, but the strong alcohol smell really throws me off. I have to hold my breath each time when I use it. No residue after application, and dries up quickly, but I don’t quite like the waxy feeling.  Maybe other people don’t mind it.</li>
    <li> Not the most moisturizing, but pleasant smell. Not greasy at all. Have to use a lot. Kind of pricey, but as I have sensitivity to perfumey fragrance, this is better for me.</li>
    <li> At first I was on the fence with this product and I love Dr. Bronner products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this lotion is more on the liquid side. Which also means its light and the skin absorbs it quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after I am fresh out of the shower (after my pores clothes. Which means after I&#x27;m not longer moist)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks you will see and feel a noticeable difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes for all Dr Bronner products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Vaseline for men, and this product soars above without a doubt.</li>
    <li> But I like initial minty refreshing feeling (I wish it would last longer).  And of course, I love that it&#x27;s certified fair trade and organic.  I&#x27;m reluctant to put in on my face because of all the comedogenic oils in it though-- well who knows, turns out most of the natural products I use have a ton oils in it.  The bottle came with the pump half screwed on, and there was lotion spilling out from the pump. Also the bottle doesn&#x27;t have the same label as the picture shown, instead it has the old school Dr. Bronner label... Seems like the picture is showing the international/foreign label.  I thought I would really love this but it&#x27;s just not moisturizing and actually makes my hand feels dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;I left it fell over for about a week (shows how much I use it) and lotion started oozing out of the faulty pump.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite lotion. I have been looking for one without all those crazy chemicals, and thought I would start with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, since I like their soaps. This lotion is great. It is not sticky or watery, it is super moisturizing. My hands get very dry in the winter, so I am picky about my hand lotions. I have been through countless other ones, but this one takes the cake. The peppermint is a refreshing, clean scent as well.</li>
    <li> great light weight lotion.the smell(peppermint) is nice but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This product will last you a long time. You only need a tiny bit. feels very fresh and minty. Perfect for hot summers.</li>
    <li> I hand wash many dishes at work/home with detergent that strips the oils from my hands.  A little dab of this stuff makes my skin feel elastic and nourished again.  The jojoba oil goes a long way.  I&#x27;m still on the same bottle after a year or so.  I also use it as an aftershave lotion.  Love the peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> This has a nice peppermint smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and fades quickly. I have super dry skin that soaks this light, liquidy, lotion quickly, but it leaves an oily glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love that it&#x27;s organic and chemical free, I do hope dr bronners comes out with a more moisturizing lotion. This one is nice for the hands after washing, especially if you wash your hands often, however I need something stronger for my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for hands and face (if desired).</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot, smells wonderful, has a great silky feeling.  Unfortunately the packaging is horrible.  It arrived with almost 1/4 of it leaked out in the bag it was shipped in.</li>
    <li> I really like all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  It came on time and through Amazon prime, which is always a major plus for me!  I absolutely love the minty smell, but I am partial to mint --  it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents!  This is a very strong peppermint scent, so much so it can almost feel tingly when you first put it on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product is natural, organic and I believe safe for your skin, it somehow is not moisturizing AT ALL. I took off a star for that very reason. To me, if lotion is not moisturizing, it&#x27;s not doing its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted very much, for this product to moisturize better.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a trusted brand in using safe and responsible ingredients and practices.  I particularly like this lotion right after I have washed my face.  It&#x27;s not an incredibly nourishing lotion, so if you have dry skin you may want to look for something different.</li>
    <li> This lotion soaks right in after a minute.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and if your skin is extremely dry, you may feel like you need more frequent applications than once per day.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews who thought their skin felt drier after using the product. I find if you squirt some lotion into your palm and add a couple of drops of baby oil the dry feeling went away. I&#x27;ve also used almond oil.</li>
    <li> Found this brand while trying to remove all the chemicals from my soaps/shampoo/cosmetics etc. I use this lotion all over my body and on my face.  The peppermint is very cooling and using natural soap plus this on my face has really improved my skin, no more oily t-zone for the first time in my life!! I also shampoo with Dr. Bronners soap and use their hair rinse then I use a small amount of the lotion on the ends of my hair to smooth and de-frizz.  Love this stuff...organic, fair trade and affordable...seems too good to be true, especially for a skeptic like me but it really is great.</li>
    <li> Great product and great company! I love the smell and the feel!</li>
    <li> I really like that this is an organic product.  I have used it all over my skin, and it feels great.  Not sure it&#x27;s the right product to combat my tendency toward dry &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34;  face, though.  It sure feels good on the rest of me.</li>
    <li> Is very sweet - and that was an issue for me - next time fgoing for lavender or something with almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in general the texture feels great and my mother loved it too. plus organic! what else do you want!?</li>
    <li> 30 years ago, I used to pack Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid biodegradable soap for canoe trips. At that time, it was carried in the camping/hiking sports stores. Now I find it under Spa stuff on the internet--amazing! But I digress. I wash my arms and hands in Dr. B&#x27;s liquid soap and then I apply this lotion before I venture out into mosquito territory, a.k.a. my yard. I&#x27;m not bothered by mosquitoes, so I&#x27;m really happy to be using these products again.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is natural, but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m very excited after I tried it. My personal preference is unscented lotion from Loving naturals, but it&#x27;s out of stock on amazon (temporally I hope), so I went with this one. Texture could be thicker, scent is too strong, and I don&#x27;t like tingling sensation.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I love the smell of peppermint in soaps, so I tries it in lotion, too.  I use this for very dry skin and it soothes as well as moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion. The peppermint scent is wonderful. The lotion has a unique, slippery feel to it, I&#x27;m guessing from the jojoba oil, that makes it a pleasure to use. It&#x27;s refreshing and cooling. Doesn&#x27;t completely work for my dry skin, but I love it anyway!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for someone that loves peppermint.  She loves the lotion in small amounts for hand lotion but states it does initially feel oily when applied.</li>
    <li> This is a very natural smelling lotion --- not sweet at all, just all natural, pure, organic ingredients. It is NOT greasy in anyway, and soaks straight into your skin without that &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feeling. Lovely Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product as usual. :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Not greasy but works exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> I get very into natural organic lotions after using Natural way organics oats lotion I now realize you can get excellent lotions that are natural that do just as a good job or would say even better job then does with chemicals</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products but this contains alcohol and does not moisturize, it drys you our more.</li>
    <li> I have heard that peppermint is a natural remedy for joint pain so I was looking for a peppermint cream to alleviate tendonitis in my hand. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks. I apply it at night before bed and in the morning. It really has helped me alot and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for my hands. It seems at first like it wouldn&#x27;t absorb well, but it does so beautifully. The smell is stress relieving and fresh. It&#x27;s obvious there is real peppermint essential oil in this lotion.</li>
    <li> The lotion is hydrating, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> awesome company too. never tried a dr. bronners product i didnt like</li>
    <li> Feels great and smells wonderful!</li>
