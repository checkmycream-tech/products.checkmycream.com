    <li> i received my Baja Baby Lavender Shampoo and decided to use it and liked how it smelled for one thing, I used it at night on my friends child. He is very sensitive to soaps but this one was very mild and the smell wasn&#x27;t over powering. It helped his eczema he has I noticed that his legs were not red like they normally are after a bath. And I love the fact it didn&#x27;t burn his eyes when we did his hair with it to. His hair was very soft after his bath and his skin was so soft to.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about what I put on my baby&#x27;s skin. So when I saw that this was sulphate, paraben and phosphate free I was very interested. My little man has super-dry skin and can get a rash because of it so I did a test run first. It has a great smell of lavender and suds up nicely. My hair was soft and smelled great afterward and it didn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I washed it out. I tried it on my son the next day and he loved it. His hair actually tangled less when I was drying him after his bath. His skin didn&#x27;t dry out and, maybe it was just me, he seemed more calm after his bath.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It&#x27;s nice to see natural baby items out there that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Smells so fresh. So far so good with my babies.</li>
    <li> We especially love this body wash for bubble baths! It bubbles up fabulously and smells great.</li>
    <li> I am a grandmother. My 3 and I year olds have done well with and enjoyed baja baby products.  They enjoyed their baths with this new wonderful smelling lavender shampoo and wash.  But here&#x27;s the deal. Smelled so good and soft tgAt I used it in my bath too!!!  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Our family loves this stuff!!  The lavender smells amazing and is ultra calming.  I have a two year old whom we use this on daily and we as a family use it as a natural body wash. I am happy to be confident in the ingredients and it does not over dry the skin like a lot of washes.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to review this item. Love the smell of this product. It lathered well, and got my boys clean. It is safe and gentle. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I use this product at night for two reasons. First it relaxes my mind and spirit for easy resting and secondly because I live near rice fields so mosquitos can be intense here and the lavender smell helps to deter the insects from landing on me while walking my dogs late at night.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Smells great!  My kids love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for baby products that are all natural and free of phosphates, parabens and sulphates. Babies don&#x27;t need these chemicals and I want the best for my grandson. Baja Baby Lavender Shampoo and body wash smells awesome! It smells of pure lavender, but not too heavy and lavender helps baby relax so he/she can sleep. There are very few products on the market that are all natural and I&#x27;m so incredibly happy to have found this for my grandson, this will be a lifelong brand for our family and all future grandbabies.&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product at discount to review and to give my unbiased opinion. My opinions are my own and are based on my experience with the product alone. This is an honest, unbiased and fair review of this product*</li>
    <li> I love lavender and the Night-Night has a nice lavender scent as well as leaving my skin and hair feeling fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have been using Baja Baby Shampoo &amp; Body Wash in Citrus scent for months and I love it!  Thank you for the option in a Lavender scent.  After a busy day, it&#x27;s a great way to wind down, calm and soothe!  Makes for great bubble baths! Thank you Baja Baby Gear!</li>
    <li> The Baja baby night-night shampoo and body wash is a very unique and helpful product.&lt;br /&gt;Since lavender is known to have a calming effect it helps your young one to unwind when used in a warm bath.&lt;br /&gt;100% harmful chemical free and containing only natural and safe products it is a must have for parents of small babies and children.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter has a hard time unwinding after a long day, but I can put her in a bath using this product and she calms down and within just a few minutes after bathtime she is ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;She has extremely sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it all.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to be helping with her eczema we have noticed that her skin is much clearer since we started using this baby wash.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and will be reordering when needed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced cost for my honest review.  All opinions are my own based on my personal experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells delightful. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on the baby today. I just tried this wash and it&#x27;s really nice. It lathers very well with a rich, rich quality. It is a treat to use on the baby. She smelled sweet after her bath.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 4-year-old son. He is always complaining about the shampoo burning his eyes when the suds from the shampoo gets near his eyes. With this there is not the worry or fear of his eyes burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice large bottle and it will last for a while. It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot so the old saying of a little goes a long way again applies to this. I couldn&#x27;t really notice any scent when it was in my hand or when applied to the hair. That could just be to my sinus problems though and there may be a hint of fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will produce a fair amount of suds when applied to the hair and does produce a lot of bubbles when added to running bath water. There is no worry about it causing any discomfort to your little ones eyes if the soap gets into them. I used it on my hair as a test and let some get in and near my eyes and felt no burning or stingy from it. That is a very big plus for me since my son hates to wash his hair because he is afraid of the soap getting into his eyes and making them burn and sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is that after I used this and my hair dried the hair felt very soft and silky. My hair is not usually that soft as it is right now after using this just once. I really like that it has made my hair feel that soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have their hair feeling soft or to anyone who has a child afraid of having that burning and stinging feeling in their eyes after washing their hair. Well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a discount of this product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Simply the best soap we have ever used on our kids. It is the only soap we use now. No tears or fuss from the kids and if it has my wife approval then you will too!</li>
    <li> Great smell! My wife and soon love it.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> bathe the baby girl in this and she&#x27;s asleep within the hour EVERY TIME.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Really!&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried another popular non-sulfate brand but it gave me skin irritation. Baja leaves the hair clean and feeling great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Baja Baby. Pleasant smell and cleans without irritating my boys&#x27; sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Baja Baby Night-Night Lavender Shampoo cum Body Wash comes in a fairly large 16 oz bottle. It has a very thick consistency and nice fragrance.

I really recommend this and it would be a very nice baby shower gift for a new mom or new baby gift too. Well worth the money.Sample provided for discount to test and provide my unbiased feedback.</li>

I would recommend this to any parent looking for a light, chemical free soap that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in return for my honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of soap &amp; shampoo over the last 5 years ( one of my kids has very sensitive skin).  The Baja Baby night night wash is one of my favorites and I will be ordering from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells great, no issues at all for my sensitive kids skin, all natural&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none so far</li>
    <li> Great product,fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product that gives you a clean &amp; shiny finish and I have no kids! I was very interested in the ingredients in the formula: nettle, lavender, rosemary, etc. Nice natural product that everyone should use!</li>
