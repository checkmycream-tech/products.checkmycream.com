      <li>Awesome, and strong.</li>
      <li>This is a good product but people need to do their research before using.</li>
      <li>This way, you can keep your face make-up free and apply a real good lotion during this time.</li>
      <li>and I am very very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Shop for prices on Amazon - they&#x27;re real cheap.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Always purchase the neutralizer and you will have a nice peel experience.</li>
      <li>A gauze pad folded over would have been and was more efficiant.</li>
      <li>I got the product on time and am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>the product is overall great!</li>
      <li>Maybe you will have better luck.</li>
      <li>And make sure to wear sunscreen afterwards</li>
      <li>and I was completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>It works even better when combined with the jessners peel.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the results</li>
      <li>Just using water to wash off will dilute it and get most of it off</li>
      <li>I wish they explained dilution better and all, had to look that up online myself.  </li>
      <li>But I found instructions easy to follow.</li>
      <li>a bit too strong, tried the lactic peel instead</li>
      <li>I diluted it when I first started doing my own peels.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for keep the baking soda handy to neutralize</li>
      <li>The product also ships very fast!!  </li>
      <li>I use this peel lightly 1x/week</li>
      <li>at this concentration and having acclimated myself to the acid, I experience a significant tingle.  </li>
      <li>A necessity for anyone over 50, great to get rid of small wrinkles and smooth skin, works for sun spots too.</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t neutralize in time for some of the areas where my skin was bit more sensitive and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so my skin always looks fresh.</li>
      <li>but, it will still continue to get absorbed deeper into your skin if not neutralized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available and at such an economical price.</li>
      <li>This is a good product but the buyer needs to know how to use it and it will react will other skin products.</li>
      <li>so everything goes right.</li>
      <li>This stuff is clinical - medical - real and effective.  </li>
      <li>I like the product very much.</li>
      <li>the product made my skin glow, look more youthful, smaller pores..but does not peel your skin</li>
      <li>Please read instructions and have a baking soda solution close by, as first application can shock the skin.</li>
      <li>So the skin does peel but it will not be very noticeable.</li>
      <li>I was very surprise at this, since it is much longer than what I am accustomed to.</li>
      <li>This stuff does the trick, but you must REALLY follow instructions.  </li>
      <li>because once I got the hang of it, I still didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>The price was reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>I really am.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, this is a very high strength - if you&#x27;re new to peels do NOT start at this strength - start at something like 20%, which I believe this company also provides.</li>
      <li>Be careful if you are new to peels, this is strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lesser percent in the past, but this is good.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is strong and if left on too long will cause a real scab all over your face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this project last year for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is strong, and I did suffer a few burns that was do to ME and not the acid itself.  </li>
      <li>so far it&#x27;s not working for me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is my advice that if you are new to chemical peels or if you do not have an intense relationship with glycolic acid, you try lactic acid for a few weeks, first, and see if it can get you the results you&#x27;re looking for without all the side-effects.</li>
      <li>but be careful if your a professional, you can really burn your skin.  </li>
      <li>It burns extremely bad, a great product works well</li>
      <li>I would, however, recommend buying or using a sturdier fan brush (a ver lightweight brush is included in the package), as the one provided is only good for one use and rather weak, limp and bristles immediately separate.</li>
      <li>Dermatologists with whom I&#x27;ve spoken typically say that people associate trauma with results, and so when they feel the burn, see the redness, and see the peeling, they think it means that it&#x27;s working really well.  </li>

<li> I recommend this product to anyone that is trying to clear dark blemishes on their skin.  </li>
<li> Left my skin red and sore in a few placea</li>
<li> I have used 3 different strengths and they have all worked well on my dark spots.  </li>
<li> I helped remove my black heads and also I mixed some of it in my 3% salicylic acid shampoo from CVS to help kick out some dandruff</li>
<li> (WOW that&#x27;s hard to say . . .</li>
<li> But not as much as I expected.</li>
<li> However, be careful if used on face.</li>
<li> I expected after day 3 I would see results....</li>
<li> Do not use retinol products and other products before using or you will burn your face.</li>
<li> They also point out that this acid is comparable to lactic acid, which causes significantly less</li>
<li> I got a little over jealous and burned a spot on my jaw.</li>
<li> My face peeled for a few days.</li>
<li> It also helped even out my skin tone since it helped wash away all the dead skin cells on my face.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now on sun spots on my arm.</li>
<li> I will do the peel again in a few days.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice the dead skin till day 6.</li>
<li> I was about to wax and put baby powder on and notice the dead skin coming off.</li>
<li> I mean, it is acid and does as expected.  </li>
<li> you have to discontinue use of other skin products for at least a week before trying a peel.</li>
<li> and it said leave on for no more than 10 mins.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s peels the skin in small pieces.</li>
<li> I am accustomed to using 60% glycolic acid and usually leave it on as per the instructions for 20 seconds.</li>
<li> I would always suggest that you do a peel on a Friday because your face is real tight for a couple of days afterwards.</li>
<li> pealing at least....</li>
<li> Be prepared to hide out in the house for at least three days.</li>
<li> AND it seems that people are rather SHOCKED when they hear how old</li>
<li> I felt maybe they formulate it different, so I left it  on for 6 mins and have been horribly burned all over my face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s serious and not for beginners.</li>
<li> Do not apply this full-strength to your skin unless you hate yourself or are anticipating that wherever you apply this should have a rapid and complete exfoliation of whatever was once there.  </li>
<li> and my face looks worse</li>
<li> so now I can&#x27;t swin because it&#x27;s just too painful</li>
<li> THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I refuse to pay hundreds of dollars on facial peels and so I do mine at home.  This works well.  I&#x27;ve used a lesser percent in the past, but this is good.  And then simply rinse with a water baking soda mix.  It does the trick.</li>
    <li> no problem with the product</li>
    <li> It did the job. My face peeled for a few days. The price was reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I did everything that the directions said and my face got craters and red and scars all over and it&#x27;s still lasting. I hurts to even put water (warm or cold) on my face so now I can&#x27;t swin because it&#x27;s just too painful and my face looks worse then it did before. It also hurts just to make any facial movements. THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I expected after day 3 I would see results....pealing at least....but nothing. I will try again next week but I don&#x27;t think this product will produce the results I had hope for. It may not work for everyone body....so far it&#x27;s not working for me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the peel works it&#x27;s peels the skin in small pieces. I didn&#x27;t notice the skin until  I was about to wax and put baby powder on and notice the dead skin coming off. So the skin does peel but it will not be very noticeable. I didn&#x27;t notice the dead skin till day 6. I will do the peel again in a few days.</li>
    <li> Left my skin red and sore in a few placea</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. No need to pay exorbitant prices at the spa, plus I can regulate the amount and strength of the application. I use this peel lightly 1x/week so my skin always looks fresh. Also, the company packages the glass bottle well and delivers expediently. I would, however, recommend buying or using a sturdier fan brush (a ver lightweight brush is included in the package), as the one provided is only good for one use and rather weak, limp and bristles immediately separate. Please read instructions and have a baking soda solution close by, as first application can shock the skin. After that, it just becomes a part of the skin regimen. It&#x27;s a pleasure doing business with Planet Eden.</li>
    <li> Do not apply this full-strength to your skin unless you hate yourself or are anticipating that wherever you apply this should have a rapid and complete exfoliation of whatever was once there.  I dilute this 1 part acid to 3 parts water, because it&#x27;s about twice the strength of the glycolix pads to which I had grown accustomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at this concentration and having acclimated myself to the acid, I experience a significant tingle.  Dermatologists with whom I&#x27;ve spoken typically say that people associate trauma with results, and so when they feel the burn, see the redness, and see the peeling, they think it means that it&#x27;s working really well.  They also point out that this acid is comparable to lactic acid, which causes significantly less trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my advice that if you are new to chemical peels or if you do not have an intense relationship with glycolic acid, you try lactic acid for a few weeks, first, and see if it can get you the results you&#x27;re looking for without all the side-effects.</li>
    <li> I could have left it on a bit longer than 2 minutes. So I peeled. But not as much as I expected. Next time I&#x27;ll leave it longer. But I found instructions easy to follow. The brush I don&#x27;t care for. A gauze pad folded over would have been and was more efficiant. I like the product very much. Going to do my next peel tonight.</li>
    <li> Packaging and all was as described with instruction card and fan brush.  I wish they explained dilution better and all, had to look that up online myself.  It is strong, and I did suffer a few burns that was do to ME and not the acid itself.  I mean, it is acid and does as expected.  I just didn&#x27;t neutralize in time for some of the areas where my skin was bit more sensitive and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 3 &#x3D; \\&quot;It&#x27;s okay\\&quot; because once I got the hang of it, I still didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  Maybe you will have better luck.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the trick, but you must REALLY follow instructions.  I would not recommend this to those unfamiliar with peels.  Be prepared to hide out in the house for at least three days.</li>
    <li> the product is overall great! but be careful if your a professional, you can really burn your skin.  the product made my skin glow, look more youthful, smaller pores..but does not peel your skin</li>
    <li> Awesome, and strong. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now on sun spots on my arm. The spots are starting to fade. It works even better when combined with the jessners peel. However, be careful if used on face. I got a little over jealous and burned a spot on my jaw. line and now have a scar. Test at one minute, then go longer if needed. For my arms I leave it on for 16 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chemical peels since I was in my 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;m now 57 and wholly endorse them. Back in the day, I paid $80 for each treatment. I am fair-skinned so I only had 3 peels and I was completely satisfied. Do them yourself. Watch YouTube videos for testimonies. Shop for prices on Amazon - they&#x27;re real cheap. If you have never had one, use the mildest acid out there. I would always suggest that you do a peel on a Friday because your face is real tight for a couple of days afterwards. This way, you can keep your face make-up free and apply a real good lotion during this time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet expectations</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for keep the baking soda handy to neutralize</li>
    <li> This is actually my second time issuing this product.  I LOVE the results AND it seems that people are rather SHOCKED when they hear how old I really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this project last year for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be 60 this year (WOW that&#x27;s hard to say . . . LOL) &amp; thought I use it again in preps for my birthday celebration the month of September.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but people need to do their research before using. Do not use retinol products and other products before using or you will burn your face. Always buy the neutralizer and follow instructions so everything goes right. This is a good product but the buyer needs to know how to use it and it will react will other skin products. you have to discontinue use of other skin products for at least a week before trying a peel. Always purchase the neutralizer and you will have a nice peel experience. I got the product on time and am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is clinical - medical - real and effective.  I am a RN.  I have lots of experience with acids, peels and lasers.  This stuff is strong and if left on too long will cause a real scab all over your face.  I only caution to start using it for SHORT periods of time and have a paste of backing soda to rub on and neutralize the acid when you have had on for the amount of time desired.  Just using water to wash off will dilute it and get most of it off but, it will still continue to get absorbed deeper into your skin if not neutralized.</li>
    <li> This products smoothed out my skin very nice.  I helped remove my black heads and also I mixed some of it in my 3% salicylic acid shampoo from CVS to help kick out some dandruff and it did an amazing job!  Also it cleared up some pimples and I am very very pleased with this product.  I will buy it again.  Please read instructions and follow them, after all, it&#x27;s 70% glycolic acid.  It also helped even out my skin tone since it helped wash away all the dead skin cells on my face.  Use a sun screen if you use this product.  ~Sam Mraovich, licensed Cosmetologist in CA, NV, UT, and PA.</li>
    <li> This is what it says it is - medical-grade 70% glycolic acid (I&#x27;m assuming unbuffered) at an excellent price. That said, this is a very high strength - if you&#x27;re new to peels do NOT start at this strength - start at something like 20%, which I believe this company also provides. It&#x27;s serious and not for beginners. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available and at such an economical price. You shouldn&#x27;t visibly peel from this - the peeling will be microscopic. And make sure to wear sunscreen afterwards (you should be using it all the time anyway). I&#x27;m quite experienced with peels and wanted to kick it up, which this did. Great value.</li>
    <li> I am accustomed to using 60% glycolic acid and usually leave it on as per the instructions for 20 seconds. I bought Planet Eden 60% glycolic acid and it said leave on for no more than 10 mins. I was very surprise at this, since it is much longer than what I am accustomed to. I felt maybe they formulate it different, so I left it  on for 6 mins and have been horribly burned all over my face. I am now terrified that I will be scared. I plan to write the  company to get it to change its  labeling.</li>
    <li> A necessity for anyone over 50, great to get rid of small wrinkles and smooth skin, works for sun spots too. Be careful if you are new to peels, this is strong. I diluted it when I first started doing my own peels.</li>
    <li> It burns extremely bad, a great product works well but I go weeks before another application because of the pain.  I had to dilute it to about 10 percent I cannot handle 70 percent at all.</li>
    <li> Great people to buy from, there honest great folks. Very good product.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I ordered Youthful Glow.  I have used 3 different strengths and they have all worked well on my dark spots.  I recommend this product to anyone that is trying to clear dark blemishes on their skin.  The product also ships very fast!!  I hope you give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!</li>
    <li> a bit too strong, tried the lactic peel instead</li>
