      <li>Love Blue Grass Products and very happy to find a supplier...</li>
      <li>Love it, have used i for 60+ years.</li>
      <li>I love those memories as much as I love her.</li>
      <li>Great product, classic smell, very smooth and luxurious...</li>
      <li>This was a easy way to send her favorite fragrance without issue.</li>
      <li>I am glad it is available somewhere.</li>
      <li>Clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Dusting powder is not that easy to find and at $11.98 compared to $38 elsewhere</li>
      <li>She likes the powder because it&#x27;s not as strong of a smell as the perfume.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is what I remembered, but it is 10x too strong.</li>
      <li>Its a light, clean smell.  </li>

      <li>First smell it in the 50&#x27;s and loved it then, finally found it and am using it again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s thrilled with all the Blue Grass</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Always loved Blue Grass bath powder and cologne -- hard to find these days -- am very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
      <li>This is a light sweet scent reminiscent of a spring day.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because of the cost to dust under &#x27;the girls&#x27;, but will likely use it inside my workout shoes to keep them smelling better instead&lt;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not possible to get this any more in Europe</li>
      <li>Love Blue Grass Powder.</li>
      <li>Next time I will order powder with a more feminine fragrance</li>
      <li>On a whim I checked with amazon, and sure enough there it was.</li>
      <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s no longer carried at Department stores.  </li>
      <li>She was an ambitious gal and her first perfume was &amp;#34;Blue grass&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend smells just as she did 35 years ago when I married her.</li>
      <li>THE FRAGRANCE LASTS A LONG TIME AND MAKES ONE FEEL CLEAN AND FRESH.  </li>
      <li>The dusting powder is very silky feeling that captures the light scent of Blue Grass.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember how it smells, I just remember how much she likes it.</li>
      <li>No longer carried in store cosmetic departments this product was a real find through Amazon, and at an extremely reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>SO MUCH ONE DAY</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying it.  </li>
      <li>It was a nice big powder box for about 17 bucks (back in the day I paid around 45).</li>
      <li>It has a nice big puff and the scent is terrific!  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Lid fits pretty tightly (which can be good) but takes a bit of muscle to open</li>
      <li>really likes the full size, gift box, powder puff, Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass dusting powder.</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time and has a very distinct smell, so many of today&#x27;s fragrances are carbon copies of each other, not this one.  </li>
      <li>MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS LOVE THIS POWDER AFTER THEIR BATHS.</li>
      <li>she was not at all willing to help she simply told me</li>
      <li>A little too strong in scent.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A VERY &#x27;HEAVY&#x27; FRAGRANCE, YET LOVELY TO WEAR.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased Blue Grass Bath powder a long time ago and until now had not been able to find it at my local cosmetic counter..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this fragrance for year and am finding it harder and harder to find.  </li>
      <li>I WAS SURPRISED</li>
      <li>That wasn&#x27;t her born name but her professional badge.</li>
      <li>I bought the deodorant and when I saw Amazon also had the dusting powder I couldn&#x27;t order the powder fast enough.  </li>
      <li>Powder feels so soft and silky on my skin.</li>
      <li>I send this to Scotland where I have an older relative who loves it, as did my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
      <li>applicator is too large for the container with strands that are too long.  </li>
      <li>strength of the fragrance isn&#x27;t over-powering - light enough that it&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Blue Grass perfume and cologne for over 4 decades.  The dusting powder is very silky feeling that captures the light scent of Blue Grass.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> I WAS MISSING MY GRANDMOTHER SO MUCH ONE DAY THAT I DECIDED TO ORDER BLUE GRASS WHICH  WAS MY GRANDMOTHER&#x27;S SCENT. IT BRINGS HER BACK TO ME AFTER 50 YEARS..MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS LOVE THIS POWDER AFTER THEIR BATHS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this lovely fragrance for years.  Sadly, it&#x27;s no longer carried at Department stores.  Only one mail order catalog carries it, and that catalog charges about double the amount as Amazon.  I was very pleased to discover that Amazon carries it and will purchase it there from now on.</li>
    <li> Next time I will order powder with a more feminine fragrance but I love Elizabeth Arden products and you cannot go wrong with any of them. This one has a beautiful large powder puff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this solely and still love it.</li>

    <li> Love Blue Grass Products and very happy to find a supplier...Powdere exactly&lt;br /&gt;as promised. Smells great and priced well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My mother is England really likes the full size, gift box, powder puff, Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass dusting powder. It&#x27;s not possible to get this any more in Europe so you have to ship to a US address and forward it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I dearly love this dusting powder!  I bought the deodorant and when I saw Amazon also had the dusting powder I couldn&#x27;t order the powder fast enough.  It arrive on time, was well packaged, and the fragrance is wonderful!  Its a light, clean smell.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this product!  It has a nice big puff and the scent is terrific!  I am so glad to find this on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love Blue Grass Powder. I have been using this powder since college. It is hard to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;find in a store, so I am very pleased to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> SICKENLY SWEET SCENT, NOTHING LIKE THE COLOGNE I REMEMBER. I LOVED THE FRAGRANCE  I WAS SURPRISED THE PRICE OF $14 WAS VERY LOW, AND I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN. DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good amount of powder for the $$$&lt;br /&gt;-The strength of the fragrance isn&#x27;t over-powering - light enough that it&#x27;s not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Puff applicator is too large for the container with strands that are too long.

    <li> My girlfriend smells just as she did 35 years ago when I married her. I love those memories as much as I love her.</li>
    <li> I used this fragrance when I was a teenager and loved it.  I was very happy to find it again and am really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I send this to Scotland where I have an older relative who loves it, as did my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is what I remembered, but it is 10x too strong. It just knocks you down when you open the canister.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Cannot send liquid or flammable products overseas to my mom. This was a easy way to send her favorite fragrance without issue. Smells amazing and is excellent quality.  Will repurchase when she is all out!</li>
    <li> i was told i would get this any where from th 23rd to the 27 on the 27th after not reciving it i called the shipper and was told to bad you can wait till the 4th of next month and if you dont like that you can send it back the person i spoke with was patricia she was not at all willing to help she simply told me i could just wait i will never buy from this seller and if i could give no star i would like to do that better ..</li>
    <li> A little too strong in scent.</li>
    <li> Ah, once a Blue Grass fan, always a fan.  Lightly scented and excellent quality powder.  Makes you smell clean, not perfumey.</li>
    <li> No longer carried in store cosmetic departments this product was a real find through Amazon, and at an extremely reasonable price.  It made the perfect Christmas gift for a long-time user who had given up trying to find it!  The fragrance is unique and the product luxurious.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Dusting powder is not that easy to find and at $11.98 compared to $38 elsewhere I&#x27;ll keep coming back.</li>
    <li> dusting powder is hard to find but this one is rather stale smelling. I probably would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of the powder.  It is clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Have been using this fragrance for over 40 years. Powder feels so soft and silky on my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this fragrance for year and am finding it harder and harder to find.  Thanks for carrying it.  It is a wonderful summer fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Lois Mc.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this gift was ecstatic... item is not easy to find.</li>
    <li> First smell it in the 50&#x27;s and loved it then, finally found it and am using it again.  Lasts a long time and has a very distinct smell, so many of today&#x27;s fragrances are carbon copies of each other, not this one.  Clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my grandma. She likes the powder because it&#x27;s not as strong of a smell as the perfume. I used to get it for her every year for Christmas, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the department stores anymore. On a whim I checked with amazon, and sure enough there it was. I can&#x27;t remember how it smells, I just remember how much she likes it. I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price. It was a nice big powder box for about 17 bucks (back in the day I paid around 45).</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY &#x27;HEAVY&#x27; FRAGRANCE, YET LOVELY TO WEAR.  THE FRAGRANCE LASTS A LONG TIME AND MAKES ONE FEEL CLEAN AND FRESH.  FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A &#x27;WHAT TO BUY HER&#x27; PROBLEM, HERE IT IS. PROBLEM SOLVED!</li>
    <li> This is a light sweet scent reminiscent of a spring day.  The powder is smooth and perfect for maintaining a fresh feeling over the course of the day.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scented powder and the best price I was able to find anywhere. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Reminds me of a time gone by, a simpler time. I&#x27;m often complimented on this fragrance...only one I purchase.</li>
    <li> My mother is always asking for scented body powder for Christmas or her birthday. I took a chance ordering this based on previous reviews and I am so happy I did. The scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Recieved my talc today..I was doing research on the late Miss Elizabeth Arden. That wasn&#x27;t her born name but her professional badge. She was an ambitious gal and her first perfume was &amp;#34;Blue grass&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is very hard to find now...but not with amazon. Great product, classic smell, very smooth and luxurious...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Always loved Blue Grass bath powder and cologne -- hard to find these days -- am very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
