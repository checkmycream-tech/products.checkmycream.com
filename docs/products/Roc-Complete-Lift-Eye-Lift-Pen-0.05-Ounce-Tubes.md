      <li>design helps you save product, use only what you need, and it&#x27;s the best under-eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I need to be more diligent about using it.</li>
      <li>Started using the hand crème years ago and now use most of the Roc products.  </li>
      <li>I used it for more than a month and NOTHING happened NO reduced puffiness NOTHING.</li>
      <li>This is the only eye treatment I LOVE!!!  </li>
      <li>It appears to help with under eye puffiness, which at 60 is becoming more apparent1</li>
      <li>The product does not roll easily along the eye area.  </li>

      <li>Really good product, reduce the wrinkles and stay soft</li>
      <li>I love this eye pen so much I buy it for friends!  </li>
      <li>First day I was ok.</li>

      <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This new eye lift pen does not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>It works, it&#x27;s not messy, and the rubber tip on the applicator makes massaging the cream into the eye area</li>
      <li>I have never been allergic to anything, and don&#x27;t have &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is old, concentrated or what, but I would not recommend this item.</li>
      <li>Roc Complete Lift Eye Lift Pen</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I continued to use it a few more days and the burning lingered and now it became red around both eyes.</li>
      <li>ROC  stands behind it&#x27;s items, you can feel confident you are getting something that has been totally researched.</li>

<li> Did not really do anything for me at all.</li>
<li> I have about given up using it due to this.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this is making a difference or the other stuff, so I&#x27;ll probably just use the rest of this and stick with the other products.  </li>

<li> Not sure what is its purpose.</li>
<li> Was a little disappointed, but you live and learn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product does not roll easily along the eye area.  In fact, it pulls and the product does not come out evenly.  Not worth it.  Roc makes great products that do work - this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I love this eye pen so much I buy it for friends!  It works, it&#x27;s not messy, and the rubber tip on the applicator makes massaging the cream into the eye area very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design helps you save product, use only what you need, and it&#x27;s the best under-eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I do like this ROC range and I think the pen works. However it is good as a night gell as it does cake under make up.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to get the product out of the dispenser.  I have about given up using it due to this.</li>
    <li> I prefer the tube, but it&#x27;s discontinued. It does give some lift to the eyelid.</li>
    <li> I guess I expect that what they say they will do is actually going to happen....Wake up kid they LIE...</li>
    <li> I love Roc products and I bought this one for eye bags/puffiness. Sad to say, I didn&#x27;t observe any improvement whatsoever.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001OMI8ZM Roc Complete Lift Eye Lift Pen, 0.05-Ounce Tubes]] BEST eye cream ever used and I have tried them all! Instantly rids lids of lines and crows feet gone! As a nurse I look for important peptides,etc. in the wrinkle creams. This has all at 1tenth of a price in a department store. PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see results with the product though that may be because there is so very little product! It only lasted about three weeks using it twice a day. As I didn&#x27;t see any results and it didn&#x27;t last long, there was no point in ordering more.</li>
    <li> This product is suppose to reduce eyelid puffiness but I could see little change in mine even after 2 weeks.There was not a lot of product in the tube so did not last long.Will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I dont know if its my skin, if im putting it on wrong, or what but the third time i used it, my eyelids felt like they were on fire. Use at your own risk!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It is a great product which gives you just enough but not too much product with a few &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; of the pen. I think it has helped my under eye area to be not so &amp;#34;baggy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so so. Doesn&#x27;t do a miracle. Wrinkles  are still there and visible. Just one of the products with the same promises on the market.</li>
    <li> Really good product, reduce the wrinkles and stay soft the face.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. The package is small but the product is good.</li>
    <li> It works and I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this pen thinking it would reduce my eye puffiness. I used it for more than a month and NOTHING happened NO reduced puffiness NOTHING.</li>
    <li> Nice liked it. didn&#x27;t last too long.  It appears to help with under eye puffiness, which at 60 is becoming more apparent1</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see any change at all. It was difficult to get out of the &#x27;pen&#x27; to begin with. Complete waste of time &amp; money in my opinion.. it may work for someone else, but it sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Did not really do anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> I cannot say whether this product has definitively lessened any wrinkles, but it appears to be working and it does definitely make my eyes feel firmer. I need to be more diligent about using it. But I would recommend and buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Within just a couple days I could tell the improvement. I have ordered a second one. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes all red and puffy. I have used ROC eye lift products before with no problem, but never the pen, and always bought sealed from the store. The area around my eyes was swollen, burned and then peeled, I looked like a bulldog. It took 5 days to go away. I actually tried it twice a month apart in case it was a reaction to something else. Same thing happened both times. I have never been allergic to anything, and don&#x27;t have &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin. I don&#x27;t know if this product is old, concentrated or what, but I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> They really remove the lines around my eyes.  Wish they make them bigger so they last longer.</li>
    <li> Never used this product before.  Not sure I really like it well enough to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Started using the hand crème years ago and now use most of the Roc products.  This new eye lift pen does not disappoint.  I would prefer a wider application tip is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  It does as promised.  For the price it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> When using the eye lift pen it is hard to get a little amount. After applying It and wearing it for a few hours I have noticed that when I rub my eye it rubs of in flakes. I was wondering why, I thought it would absorb into my skin.</li>
    <li> Never seen any change.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye treatment I LOVE!!!  Results are noticlible</li>
    <li> I love Roc products normally but this was not one of them. It gave me NO RESULTS at all and it was harsh on my skin and burnt my eyes. Will NEVER buy again.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I hoped. Was a little disappointed, but you live and learn. You don&#x27;t know if you don&#x27;t try.</li>
    <li> No change noticed after using this product for few weeks. Not sure what is its purpose. Continue using just to avoid wasting it.</li>
    <li> Great big waste of my money. Did not see a difference at all. Still had puffiness under my eyes even after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This item works great I can take with I on the go&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly I use mist all of the roc skin care products and I can tell a difference m the areas n my face where I needed help with no knives</li>
    <li> I tried this with the other Roc products I used. It does sting a little when you put it on, but it does go away. I don&#x27;t know if this is making a difference or the other stuff, so I&#x27;ll probably just use the rest of this and stick with the other products.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this if you have sensitive skin. It does flake if you try to use it under makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought it from another site. I have good skin that takes anything without sensitivity to any products. I used it for a week. First day I was ok. Second day I had some burning on the outside corner of my eye. I thought maybe it means it is working. I continued to use it a few more days and the burning lingered and now it became red around both eyes. After a few days I woke up to find severe redness and swelling around both eyes. I have no wrinkles anywhere, but under my eyes, instead of getting rid of the small bags, I ended up with wrinkled red bags and severely dried patches. So now this pen landed in trash.</li>
    <li> I beleive that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to make dramatic differences, but anything for your face coming from ROC is #1 in my book!!!  I have been using their products ever since I had facial surgery.  A lot of the items are not in the stores, it is better to get them on line, that way you can pick and choose what particular item you need at the time.  ROC  stands behind it&#x27;s items, you can feel confident you are getting something that has been totally researched.</li>
