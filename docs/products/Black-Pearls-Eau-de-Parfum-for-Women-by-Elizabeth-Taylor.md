<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is amazing. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. It was so great to find and be able to purchase at such a great price.enjoying!!</li>
    <li> The product was well packed and the box was sealed. I will be giving this perfume to a friend as a gift and I&#x27;m pretty sure she will love it. I actually went to this vendor&#x27;s website and they had a lot of good deals, needless to say, this will be my vendor from now on. I highly recommend this vendor to all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, but neither of us like the &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; smell very well. I think we would prefer White Diamonds much better. T.Lee</li>
    <li> I love the scent liz taylor scents are the best. Product came carefully packaged, so as not to break&lt;br /&gt; Price is awsome, will order more of her scentts</li>
    <li> What I can say other than it is a marvelous Eau De Parfum!</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance I would introduce to just about anyone. It&#x27;s not overpowering and can be worn daily or on a night out. I purchased this product based on reviews and was not disappointed. It has a powdery scent that is quite appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the product was the same as described and the shipment fast. Again, if your taste is similar to mine, you can go ahead and add this perfume to your collection.</li>
    <li> Too strong. Almost gave an instant headache. I can take a whiff from far away but would not want it too lcose.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister and got very positive feedback from her. It arrived on time, safely and well packaged. She loves the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I gave Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Black Pearls as a present to my mother. She said the scent strength is moderate, lasts 6-10 hours and it&#x27;s a flowery fragrance. She loved it! The pure perfume version comes in an exquisite bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I received it in excellent condition, and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Very nice.. My wife really liked it.. nice item</li>
    <li> the smell does not stay</li>
    <li> This is the only Elizabeth Taylor fragrance that I can wear. If you like soft, powdery florals and classic scents, give it a try. There&#x27;s also a body lotion. Wish I could find a dusting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how does it smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Powdery.&lt;br /&gt;Warm.&lt;br /&gt;Feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Floral.&lt;br /&gt;Old-Fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-Wear.&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;Close-to-the-Skin.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Good Value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a recently produced bottle (clear glass), and it&#x27;s good. However, it is worth seeking out a vintage one. I recently purchased an unused gift box, probably from the mid-1990s, that contained two frosted bottles. The current formulation is good but the vintage in the frosted glass is great!  It&#x27;s worth seeking out the smaller vintage, frosted bottles - 30ml EdP and 7ml parfum - that were sold as gift sets when BP was released. Just lovely and better than the current formulation in the 100ml unfrosted bottles in my opinion.</li>
    <li> it was a gift and hasn&#x27;t been given yet.</li>
    <li> It was a gift but it smelled nice and arrived on time, thanks</li>
    <li> really great buy. my girl friend was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Has to much of a powder smell and is very strong.  I personally do not care for this cologne.  I do love Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s  White Diamonds and Forever Elizabeth (my all time Favorite!!)</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the name &#x27;Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;. Thought it would be something classy and nice-  I was wrong. Although it is very strong and long lasting, I don&#x27;t like the scent at all. Smells like Yardley talc or the Avon perfume that was very popular in the 70s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 24th October, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a two star rating to this perfume but I&#x27;ve now upgraded it to four.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got and used this perfume, I didn&#x27;t like it, I was not happy at all about the purchase. But I decided to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice after then and funny, I&#x27;m beginning to like it.  A reviewer said the scent has a way of changing with time and I think I agree with that. It has a fresh smell to it and most important- the scent is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Provider was great. Fast service... The product Smells flowery. However I mix with non scented body lotion and smells better.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smell ever.  It made me sick to my stomach. I generally have had good luck until now. Very disappointed I cannot return it.  Donating to the Goodwill.</li>
    <li> It arrived in record time and I love the aroma of this product I took a chance and ordered it I had never used this one before, I am happy with the packaging and would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Very good and my wife loved it</li>
    <li> An excellent fragrance, My wife loves it,Is very exotic.&lt;br /&gt;Una excelente fragancia, a mi esposa le encanta, es muy exotica.</li>
    <li> This perfume has an awesome womanly smell soooo feminine...fast delivery...will definitely buy from this seller again !!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I disliked this scent instantly.  I have boxed it up for a future yard sale because there are folks that do like it.  We found it very be cloying and too strong.  The scent changes over time and not for the better.  Perhaps I received an old bottle.  Unfortunately this type of item is not returnable.</li>
    <li> This is the actual perfume. It took a long time to get to me but my mom loved it for mother&#x27;s day. I order it on May 1st and I didn&#x27;t get it until May 15th which was 2 days after Mother&#x27;s day and I have Amazon prime. The shipping speed was the only disappointing thing about this product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent. The trick is to find it at a good price. Amazon&#x27;s sellers have the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Black Pearls and have ordered it numerous times from Amazon!  It arrived in excellent condition. packaged well!</li>
    <li> for the price it is ok, the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, it would have been nice if the smell stayed a bit longer. but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old brother picked this out to give to our mom for Xmas! She loved it, not just because it was from the baby of our family but she actually loved the scent of those perfume. Arrived in time, a littler earlier too in fact and packaging was unscathed and intact. Thanks!</li>
    <li> yet to try it. i hope she gets to like it.lol. when i get a proper feedback i would paste some thing for u guys</li>
    <li> Loved it, and it was delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> Had this one a while back &amp; was glad to get it again . Very good</li>
    <li> smells good and the price is cheap</li>
    <li> Never tried this scent before. Decide to do so, but it is not the scent that I thought it would be. Don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;White diamond is more my type.</li>
    <li> Was purchased for my mom, just facebooked her to ask how she liked her Black Pearls, she responded by saying she just loves it!!</li>
    <li> I received this perfume as a gift 10 years ago and have been looking for it since and was very happy to find it! I will continue to look for hard to find items here at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> My mom loved! Is a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I absolutely -- with no question -- love this spray.  It is light but strong but absolutely not too strong.  The shell makes it even more beautiful.</li>
    <li> My mom loved her birthday gift. She said the scent is so divine. She wished she could thank Liz Taylor herself. :)</li>
    <li> I liked it but the scent didnt fit with me but will give to the grandaughters so for the price i decided to keep it</li>
    <li> very refreshing sent, bought for wife as a gift, she loves it as well as i do. i would buy it again</li>
    <li> Definitely not the scent for me.</li>
    <li> I have worn Black Pearls for year. It&#x27;s sent is soft an very pretty. I have actually has men stopped me to ask \\&quot; what is the name of that perfume &amp; where can they can purchase it? \\&quot; for their wife&#x27;s. So, ladies if you want your man to love what you wear as perfume. I highly recommend, Black Pearls.</li>
    <li> Eau de&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Parfum does what perfume is supposed to do, i.e. smell good.  Like most perfumes it is overpriced, but women seem to think it is important. That is why I am buying this for my wife.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance .Very Feminine.</li>
    <li> Purchased as present for my 86 yr old mom, she loves it.</li>
    <li> It is lovely, however the scent does not last on me.</li>
    <li> My mom has been wanting this for so long and we could not find it-so thank you she is very happy</li>
    <li> Just as described. Love the fragrance. Packaged very well. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this parfum spray.  I wear it often and get lots of compliments as it is not too heavy scented</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance I would introduce to just about anyone. It&#x27;s not overpowering and can be worn daily or on a night out. I purchased this product based on reviews and was not disappointed. It has a scent That is quite appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for mature people buy it for my aunt and dies by its smell.</li>
    <li> Hello, as for the parfum, it&#x27;s nothing out of this world, but for its price, is more than acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Strong, flowery, and does not have great pretensions, but adequate, particularly for night use.&lt;br /&gt;The merchant from whom we bought it, though, are special, as they placed an unusual amount of attention to our very small purchase. Prompt delivery, follow through, courteous, don&#x27;t know what else they could do to make my shopping experience any better.&lt;br /&gt;In my humble opinion, that is not something that one finds every day , thus, I&#x27;ll make an effort next time I need time I need fragrances, to check them up</li>
    <li> I love it. I like E.T. Scents, and this is a beautiful lite and soft scent. It smells like baby powder. I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife was pleased and happy when I surprised her with this. It has that pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and gets the job done with the desired effect.  I will order again from here.</li>
    <li> love love love this perfume by Elizabeth Taylor. please don&#x27;t hesitate to get it it&#x27;s worth every penny.and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
    <li> soft smell, non offensive. my daughter says it smells like an old lady perfume but i like it. only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it was the scent only lasts a few hours.</li>
    <li> love it. its one of my favorites and the price is excellent</li>
    <li> I liked a mini set from Elizabeth taylor and thought this one would be as good as the others, this is mild but nothing great about this perfume. I waiting for it complete. 3.3 ounce seems  a lot to finish, size of handsoap .</li>
    <li> Very heavy scent, but bought to remember mom &amp; her fragrance is in the air when I spray this...</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.  I bought a couple of the spray bottles for &#x27;older&#x27; women on my Christmas list.  They were appreciative of it and really like the scent.  One asked me to get her another bottle next year.</li>
    <li> This perfume is absoulitly intoxicating!!!!  It smells very much like Fendi&#x27;s Theorema but not quite as lemmony as Theorema is but just as gorgous.  It almost gives the smell of baked cookies to me-it may just be the way my nose is percieving it but that is what it smells like to me and I cannot get enough of Elizabeth Taylors perfumes.  This is quite suprising to me also because I never thought I would go for such inexpensive perfumes but Elizabeth Taylor has outdone herself on her scent lines.  The only one perfume that I cannot tolorate is Diamonds and Rubies-way too something that does not agree with my nose.  I recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I purchase this item as a gift for someone especial, she&#x27;s very pleased with the gift. I haven&#x27;t smell it yet, but she expressed it was really exquisite so I trust her word. She has very good taste, so if she liked it then it must be really good.</li>
    <li> the smell is not really good , and there is no box with it.  it looks not really good,... o</li>
    <li> BLACK PEARLS IS GREAT SO GLAD I ORDERED IT I LOVE THE SMELL  WELL WORTH IT MONEY,SO YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR LOVE IT..</li>
    <li> Thanks for the beautiful fragrance.  It got here on time, and I smell like a million dollars.</li>
    <li> On time delivery. Good scent.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume my husband got me.  He bought me all three, and this one is his favorite. Thanks hon.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is now one of my favorites, it&#x27;s just right and it last a long time. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is nice, and I would recommend it to anyone who prefer a soft perfume scent. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This perfume is so elegant and lovely. I love this sent and I feel so beautiful when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and product.</li>
    <li> Smells a little like an old woman scent but not too bad!</li>
    <li> My mom and grandma had been trying to find this perfume everywhere.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made anymore so I ordered it on Amazon for them.  It arrived quickly and they both love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all !</li>
    <li> Me llego rapido y en excelentes condiciones.</li>
    <li> great perfume for older women, bought it for some aunts, they liked it</li>
    <li> This is one of the most wonderful smelling fragrances ever. To me it&#x27;s just a hint of vanilla, just a hint...and then there is that awesome powdery smell. ....and it has staying power....not too strong, just right. You won&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it like lots of the other weak watered down fragrances. This is unique. It reminds me of when I was younger and a very sophisticated woman wearing a hat in church would walk past me and the air all around me was powdery and fresh and clean and had a lovely elegant fragrance that lingered. This is a perfect fragrance. I love it. A good fictional/pioneer family saga book written by me, Sheila White - is Mile after Mile [...]  a fun story, that takes the reader where they feel every emotion.</li>
    <li> Worst scent ever, I totally got disappointed</li>
    <li> I love white diamonds but I tried this and fell in love with it also. I like to keep both on hand.This is soft and very feminine.</li>
    <li> Am i the only one in the world that purchased this product and can&#x27;t figure out how to use it ??  It says that its a spray on the package , but it has this round ball on the top and i can&#x27;t figure out how to use it ....I call customer service and they were very nice and sent me a replacement and now i have two that i can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell really DUMB After having the perfume since Christmas and calling customer Service for a replacement i decided to bring the bottle to a small perfume shop at my local mall...The little old lady that ran the shop took the bottle from my hand and took the cap off and underneath the cap was the spray button. i could not believe it , somthing so simple ,my wife LOVES the perfume and we give it 5 stars!  Thanks Robert and Maria</li>
    <li> I was wearing White Diamonds and wanted a change. This has disagreeable after tones after applied.</li>
    <li> is very good but is a lady smell the truth is that I&#x27;m young and I let my mom but is very well</li>
    <li> My mother is allergic to almost all fragrances except blak pearls. she hasn&#x27;t been able to find any in stores for over 10 years so I bought her this black pearls for Mother&#x27;s Day which to this day I&#x27;ve only found on amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume after listening to a book on tape. I was so impressed by the descriptions in the story I had to order this perfume. I love the smell and will continue to order this item.</li>
    <li> I love Elizabeth Taylor products and this is no exception.  The scent/fragrance was delightful.  Recommend it to anyone who likes lighter scents. I liked it so that I bought extra bottles for me and my siblings.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this available since online is the only place I can find Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Black Pearls. This is my fragrance. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and not one to change it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to surprise her on Mothers Day. It came way before the event but I gave her the product and she said she likes it. I&#x27;m not sure what other ratings are but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It goes on a bit strong, but softens as the day wears on. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive compared to my other perfumes (I&#x27;m a bit of a perfume freak), but it&#x27;s by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I really like how this works with my body. It has a stay on terrific sex smell. As always the service was great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all, it smells yummy.</li>
    <li> I  don&#x27;t like it that much. I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. I was thinking of white pearl. hanks so very much. See you some other time</li>
    <li> this is my favorite perfume, and I can only buy it online since it has been discontinued. I hope you will continue to have it available.</li>
    <li> my wife has used the product before loved then and still loves it very pleased with the speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> Black Pearls has been a long-time favorite, especially for the autumn/winter months.  It has a lovely soft powder note, which lasts ALL day long.  It is an Eau de Parfum, so a few sprays will last a long time.  If you like fragrances such as Chantilly, you&#x27;ll LOVE Black Pearls.  It is worth every dime just for the lasting power alone.  I could still smell Black Pearls on my wrist the next day, so it is worth it&#x27;s price for the staying power, especially considering many fragrances these days don&#x27;t last past 10 minutes.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  A wonderful cashmere fragrance!</li>
    <li> Black Pearls by Elizabeth Taylor has a wonderful enticing scent. Long lasting, very feminine and liked by everyone who I&#x27;ve let try it!</li>
    <li> I buy this every christmas for my mom, she loves it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother who loves this perfume. She&#x27;s been talking about it for some time now and she was so excited to receive it. It smells timeless.</li>
    <li> A cool unique but attention grabbing fragrance that lingers while you socialize. This scent can be confidently worn in a work environment.</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume years ago!  I still appreciate the fragrance but it seems slightly different now.  I do wear it occasionally.</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister, she loves it..........</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister for Christmas since you can no longer purchase in store and she was so excited that I found it. She loves it and was so excited to get.</li>
    <li> Love this scent I bought 2 bottles and going to buy another. It has a very light powder floral scent very lovely. When you put this scent on you feel very wonderful makes you smile, like you are walking on the beach with just pearls on. It&#x27;s so wonderful and Elizabeth Taylor always had a taste for the daring good things in life and to me this is what this scent is all about.....the good things in life with a touch of spices you add to your life in this case the rich black pearls kissing your neck..</li>
    <li> The arome is a little powerfull, but is good</li>
    <li> This one is a night time fragrance with a sensual undertone and a provocative aroma.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Thrilled to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for Mother&#x27;s Day online.  I was weary because I did not know what to expect.  My mother loves Estee Lauder Knowing and this fragrance is very similar to it. Great Price!</li>
    <li> A very nice fragrance with a very good price.  And as promised on time.</li>
    <li> My signature scent for 15 years. Simply gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It aint a white diamond but I like it when my wife wears it</li>
    <li> this product by liz taylor--is very, very strong--and it lasts forever--it is probably more suited for an older lady--but a great price</li>
    <li> I love this smell, and the bottle is very cute. I think it is a great buy. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Do not like the smell of the perfume.  The bottle is very pretty.</li>
    <li> Smells so great &amp; bottle was awesome lol!! Fast service. Will use again &amp; recommend to others</li>
    <li> Smell great on my wife. It lasts awile after she puts it on too. All in all its a great product . A steal of a deal..</li>
    <li> Got the item for myself, my Mom, and my sister and we all loved it!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to give Elizabeth Taylor a try this year.</li>
    <li> Would recommend purchasing this luxury fragrance through Amazon.  It was priced reasonably and the fragrance is wonderful. My wife was thrilled with the purchase.</li>
    <li> After opening the package ,the spray broke .And I can&#x27;t used it.I am very disappointed at this product. Is there anyway that I change the perfume.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  She LOVES black pearls... thought this would be a nice&lt;br /&gt;addition to her gem collection.  She loved it!</li>
