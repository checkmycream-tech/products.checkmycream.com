      <li>I can say BH Cosmetics has done an outstanding job with their eyeshadow palettes.  </li>
      <li>and i have to say the colors are even better</li>
      <li>I love the pallet case with the mirror.</li>
      <li>these are great very pigmented if u like shimmer colors</li>
      <li>Love all looks I can create.</li>
      <li>I just was expecting it to be more shimmery</li>

      <li>I absolutely love both sets of shadows &amp; with all the color selections</li>

      <li>I absolutely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>So many shimmery colors more than I expected, was really impressed</li>
      <li>I would think this item could be a great starter kit for a young girl learning to use make up, and the cost is much more affordable than MAC.</li>
      <li>The one thing I do not like about it is the applicators are not the best quality as they become loose and you need to buy some.</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and they really pop on my lids.</li>
      <li>very shimmery and bright colors with lots of shades.</li>
      <li>The reviews was right, this palette is beyond amazing.</li>
      <li>I received my palette today and its in perfect condition unlike from other reviews i&#x27;ve read here.</li>

      <li>This a very good product its has a good smell, stay on your lid for long and its have a big plenty of colors and the best part is very affordable price thanks .</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and vivid.</li>
      <li>so let me first start off by saying that this product is awesome &amp; more than I expected for the price.</li>
      <li>the colors are brilliant and you dont have to use alot of color to make it vivid, colors are strong and highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect professional and non professional eyeshadow palette mate.  </li>
      <li>I purchased it expecting the same bright colors shown in the picture but most of them are not.</li>
      <li>I am a free lance make-up artist an</li>
      <li>And the yellows are way too light.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>If i hadn&#x27;t been looking for anything specific I would have been happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a seriously good quality eye shadow, perfectly suitable for adults, but I think the palette of iridescent colors would be too much for an old dame like me!  </li>
      <li>The pressed shadows have a smooth quality that applies easily and blends beautifully with other shades.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES EYE SHADOW AND IS LOOKING FOR A SHIMMER LOOK THIS IS THE ONE TO TRY!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Colors are vibrant and shimmery and smooth</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and undamaged. The colors are beautiful. The sizes of the eye shadows are ideal. They are small so you have the chance to use all the colors instead of having a ton left over. I bought this as a birthday gift for my sister and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. Bh Cosmetics has a excellent quality and the customer&#x27;s service is very very good.  When I received my palette two colors were broke. Imediately I called to BH Cosmetics explaining what happened and they apologized and sent me a new one.   I would like to say that I hate receive my products by UPS. The worst service in USA. I had two problems and my friends too.    Love Bh Cosmetics and hate UPS!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are everything I expected them to be and more.  I have had so much fun with these shadows.  Its worth the price and will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I really was hoping that the other reviews weren&#x27;t accurate in the damaged product you receive and the customer service.. but they are.  Palette arrived shattered in three places due to NO packaging whatsoever besides the envelope, all the shadows are now orange. Amazon was terrible telling me that of course I can return the palette for a refund but since I needed this for a photo shoot TODAY that is not very helpful. They cannot replace the product because they are not an Amazon company or some lame story like that. Get it together BH and Amazon, you are losing customers all over the place due to IGNORING the negative reviews on your sites!</li>
    <li> My friend  sent me one for my birthday.  I was so excited and of course it was wrapped and everything so she had no idea how bad it was.  I didn&#x27;t tell her how bad it was because I didn&#x27;t have the heart to and there was not much pigmentation at all, many broken shadows, and the pigmentation that was in there seemed to just spill out on me when i opened it since they were broken.  You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; Geat price! I would especially recommend this for starters! The only reason why I haven&#x27;t rated this as a 5 star product is because the shadows are super duper small, I would highly recommend using an eyelid primer NOTE NOTE NOTE that you could absolutely still use this w/o but there are a few colors that need the help of primer to reach its full potential! This thing has practically every shade of every color!!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this package because i heard great things about BHcosmetics.  But when i opened the package, it only had one thin layer of bubble wrap that proved useless.  There were at least 5 shadows completely shattered and all the rest were slightly damaged.  Along with that, they did not put the lid on correctly, so one side is not hooked so the lid is half off.  I have never been so angry with a delivery that I most likely will NEVER EVER order from this company again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the colors, and they are very good quality for personal or professional make ups. the shadows are very pigmented and vibrant, and I just love them. the packaging was great, none of the shadows was broken.</li>
    <li> This product is just as it&#x27;s described, color that shimmers. I got this for as a gift for a cosmetologist and she was thrilled. She always looks fabulous and credits this eyeshadow for her gorgeous color pallet!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup fanatic so let me first start off by saying that this product is awesome &amp; more than I expected for the price. I am an African American women with a darked skin tone so it is hard to find shadows that show up on well on my skin but BH cosmetics solved my problem! The shadows are very pigmented &amp; show up very well, with lasting coverage. Let me also add that BH stands up hands down to the more expensiver name brand shadows that I have in my makeup bag. I didnt have any broken shadows as other customers have complained about. However, I wouldnt take that out on BH or amazon I would take that up with the mail or parcel carrier. My shadow was wrapped in bubble wrap &amp; packaged very well. I also purchased the BH 88 shimmer pallete at the same time &amp; none were broken. I absolutely love both sets of shadows &amp; with all the color selections I think I am done with collecting shadows for a while. So dont believe the bad reviews &amp; give it a try. I would definitely reorder when I run out far down the road from now.</li>
    <li> i ordered this pallette because it has every color i could want all in one. i recieved it very quickly, and it was in perfect condition. Ive used it about 4 times now and the colors are really beautiful and pigmented. You of course need a good primer, and to really have the darker colors show their best i used them with a damp brush. i saw alot of people said the eyeshadows were small, but they seem about the size of any regular pallette. the 120 seems to have alot of small variations in colors, and may last longer because it has alot of the same colors, but i think this one has everything i need.</li>
    <li> I loved this palette! Shipped fast and was packaged nicely. I enjoy having an array of colors in one and they look so beautiful on. The only problem I have is one of the colors keep popping out but I just put it back where it belongs. For the price and quality I cannot complain though.</li>
    <li> I would never buy any bh products again. The quality is just not good.  The pallets are best for teenagers who re just getting into makeup that want to learn.  Other than that ill stick with my urban decay, mac, Est&amp;eacute;e, Lancôme etc.  the quality of the shadows are chalky, or to glittery or have a lot of fall out, fade,  crease. Etc.</li>
    <li> The order did no go out when stated, it took forever to recieve this product. I should have gotten it at Coastal Scents</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing! The shadows are very pigmented, stick to the brush with no problem. The colors are bright and vivid. I absolutely, hands down, LOVE this palette! :) When I received it only one shadow was broken but nothing huge. I absolutely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i finally got them today, but what i disappointment as soon as i open the package there was eye shadow all over on the inside of the envelope, all over the box and on the inside on the palette, multiple eyeshadow broken (about 13)and just plain messy.&lt;br /&gt;i did gave it 3 stars because the color are pretty, well the ones i could actually save anyways.&lt;br /&gt;does anybody know if you can return them???</li>
    <li> The product is great but the condition in which I received it was not. The colors were broken</li>
    <li> Even though I can afford MAC, one can always benefit from other companies to provide other colors.  The palette is small, compact and has various shades to appeal to all skin types and eye color.  Intense pigments delvier a high color payoff.  I would think this item could be a great starter kit for a young girl learning to use make up, and the cost is much more affordable than MAC.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product on the august 9th and recieved it august 11th! it was shipped and delivered in 2 days!! when i recieved it none of the eye shadows were broken and it was in tip-top shape!! don&#x27;t listen to those other negative reviews!please do buy this! it is a beautiful palette :)!</li>
    <li> This set of eye shadow colours are great. The pigmentation is excellent and it has great shine. The wide array of colours are beautiful. The only thing that shocked me when it arrived was how small the actual quantity of eye shadow there is. Meaning that it appears much bigger in circumference online (I was expecting the palette to be the same size of the Mac eyes hadow shades) but it is considerably smaller. A little goes a long way however and not much product is needed in application. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> BH COSMETICS HAS SERIOUSLY THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK...THEY HAVE VERY PIGMENTED COLORS AND THIS IS COMING FROM A MAKEUP ARTIST WHO HAS SEEN EVERYTHING FROM THE WORST TO THE BEST.  BUT I MUST COMMENT ON AMAZON AND ITS TERRIBLE PACKING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS.  I ORDERED THIS PALETTE ALONG WITH AN NYX PALETTE AND THEY BOTH ARRIVED DAMAGED..WHEN I CALLED TO COMPLAIN I WAS TOLD I COULD BE REFUNDED BUT THE ITEM COULD NOT BE REPLACED...UMM NOT MUCH HELP WHEN I NEED THIS FOR WORK IN A FEW DAYS..SO NEEDLESS TO SAY EVEN IF YOU GET YOUR ITEM DELIVERED DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORST BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PACK A PALETTE.  IT WAS SENT IN A BOX WITH ABSOLUTLY NO PACKING MATERIAL.  SO I ASK FOR A MANAGER AND GOT TRACY M WHO WAS NO HELP JUST LIKE THE REP AND BASICALLY RUSHED ME OFF THE PHONE WITH A PROMISE OF A REFUND IN 2-3 DAYS!! SO BASICALLY AMAZON EXPERIENCE WAS HORRIBLE, BUT BH ROCKS.</li>
    <li> as soon as i recieved this product i went straight to my mirror to try it out. the colors are brilliant and you dont have to use alot of color to make it vivid, colors are strong and highly pigmented. i would definetly reccomend this palet.</li>
    <li> I received my set in perfect condition. The colors are vibrant and they apply well. They last for fairly long time, but by the end of the day (or night) you will need to touch up. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I got this palette about 2 months ago and I love it. The colors are bright and they really pop on my lids. I should add that I use eyelid primer before I apply shadow. Delivery was prompt and my palette arrived without any broken pots of color.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering because of the negative shipping reviews. I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did. It came very well packaged. It was in a box with packing paper, wrapped twice in 2 kinds of cushioning shipping material. Not a single color pan was damaged.     As for the product itself, the colors are generally very nice. A few of the darker shades are a little chalky but are fine when used with an eyeshadow primer. I will definitely be ordering more from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to buy this because seeing the one about the eyeshadows coming shattered. But i am very happy that i did buy it because amazon packaged it perfect and the palette arrived perfect! and it was a very good price a for sure buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my oldest daughter as recommended by my younger daughter. This product arrived in excellent condition. Was exactly as described in the advertisement. I plan on buying her more of this product!</li>
    <li> This a very good product its has a good smell, stay on your lid for long and its have a big plenty of colors and the best part is very affordable price thanks .</li>
    <li> The fifteen-year-old young lady who received this for Christmas has done nothing but touch up her makeup for three weeks, now.  It arrived beautifully packaged, each shadow clean and unbroken.  It&#x27;s a seriously good quality eye shadow, perfectly suitable for adults, but I think the palette of iridescent colors would be too much for an old dame like me!  But, the young folks love it.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I dont wear makeup on a regular basis, only when i go out and for special occations. this is a great product. very shimmery and bright colors with lots of shades. it replace from the stress and space to buy so many...this will last me forever bought it in early 2009...good if u dont want a bunch of eyeshadow and want that shimmer look</li>
    <li> Could not be any happier with this product!! Love all looks I can create. It&#x27;s awesome and so perfect !</li>
    <li> The color are amazing but the way that it was sent to me it was horrible five of the colors were smashed.</li>
    <li> super fun! lots of colors!! was a little shaken up from shipping but i blame the post office, id definitely buy as a gift! lots of colors!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows were not packaged well at all. There were no bubble wrapping at all over the products, which caused some of the eyeshadows in the boxes to shatter. I am very upset as it should have been better packaged.</li>
    <li> I received my palette today and its in perfect condition unlike from other reviews i&#x27;ve read here. I tried em on and there awesome! I will definately be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! The pigment is outstanding, there is so much variety, and the possibilities are endless. Whether you are a beginner, professional or just plain experimenting. I absolutely recommend this palette. If you are skeptical, don&#x27;t hesitate. This palette is amazing.</li>
    <li> BH Cosmetics has put together a great collection of colors for makeup mavens to try for a great value (I got mine for about $12).  The pressed shadows have a smooth quality that applies easily and blends beautifully with other shades.  I recommend using them over a primer or eyeshadow base to get the most color payoff and the longest staying power, but they look lovely even without this base.  The pans are not large (approximately the size of a dime, maybe a little smaller), but you get so many colors that you can play and experiment with that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  These 88 shades have a lovely shimmer; they aren&#x27;t super glittery but have a nice sheen to them that will give you a nice reflective effect.  If you want to try out new colors but don&#x27;t want to lay out a lot of money up front, then this is the product for you!  The rainbow of shades gives you a little bit of everything to test and try so you can see what you like and what works for you, all for less than the cost of one or two single shadows from a high end brand!</li>
    <li> GREAT COLORS AND LONG LASTING</li>
    <li> The colors are quite pigmented, especially when used with an eye primer.  The colors are easy to apply and blend well.  There is a good variety in this palette, I use it often.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and i have to say the colors are even better then i expected. But as other say and sadly its true i got it and some of the colors were shattered an there was eye shadow everywhere and i had to clean it all up. To make matters worse i accidentaly dropped it not even a foot high an even more of it shattered, so that was more cleaning for me :( i sent an e-mail to BHcosmetics to see if they could sent me a new one and i return the one i have now. They said they would reply in 24 hours so hopefully i get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this it works an looks wonderful an beautiful but be warned some of your colors might be shattered. Honestly its very likely to happen.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail today it was not broke anywhere! Really good packing! I LOVE IT!! I would tell a friend about it and tell her its a MUST buy! Great product</li>
    <li> It is alright for the new makeup beginner.</li>
    <li> I am a free lance make-up artist an I do a ton of weddings. This palette is awesome, b/c I don&#x27;t need to pack much! The colors are so vibrant! My brides always love their make-up! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was not happy when I received this product. I purchased it expecting the same bright colors shown in the picture but most of them are not. The picture makes it look like there is a bright red, orange, and yellow, which is what I was looking for. Instead the \\&quot;reds\\&quot; are pinkish or like a burgundy. The \\&quot;oranges\\&quot; are more of a peachish color. And the yellows are way too light. I feel like I just wasted my money because I specifically needed the brighter colors.... If i hadn&#x27;t been looking for anything specific I would have been happy with the product.  It came without anything being damaged and there is a good variety of colors overall. Just not as bright as the picture.</li>
    <li> I liked them, are very beautiful all colors, has good fixation on the skin, are portable and are at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> it has very light colors. Maybe it is good for someone who does not know how to wear make up.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The only reason I had to rate it a 4 is because I wish some of the colors were more pigmented, but this is great for beginers. None of my shadows were broken when it was delivered which is what I was mostly worried about.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup fanatic! I love experimenting with new colors and make up. This product lasts very long I still have ever color and its been a few months!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect professional and non professional eyeshadow palette mate.  If you want a professional and beautiful shimmer eyeshadow that has an unbeleivable price, and - at the same time - unbeleivable quality, which is soft and is pigment rich; that will last all day long, then this is the perfect product for you.  As I&#x27;ve stated in other reviews, I am a huge fan of the best quality products in the professional and non professional make-up markets.  I can say BH Cosmetics has done an outstanding job with their eyeshadow palettes.  This is a product I would buy for me as well as for a loved one, like my mother, a cousin or a best friend who will appreciate excellent quality make-up products and will use it in an almost daily basis.</li>
    <li> Awesome color selection, I use this every single day, my only complaint would be that the eyeshadows pop out.. No problem though, all girls have nail glue!</li>
    <li> I heard about this palette and watched reviews and also read reviews. The reviews was right, this palette is beyond amazing. It has a lot of beautiful and pigmented colors. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it&#x27;s doing great. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the packaging. Two 4 of my colors were kind of destroyed. My blue was destroyed all together but my other 4 just won&#x27;t stay in its place</li>
    <li> its alright, although each color was about the size of a dime;P sorry i dont know what else to write</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these for presents, and fter reading reviews after I had already bought them I was praying none of the colors would be broken! Thank god none of them were! Perfect! tons of bubble wrap all around for protection!</li>
    <li> I liked that there are a ton of colors however the staying power isn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;d rather fork over money for higher end brands.</li>
    <li> I have literally been through three of these shimmer palettes!! Great colors, I do recommend applying a base prior to the eye shadow to make it pop and last longer. The only thing with these palettes is some times the eye shadow is loose with it arrives but nothing a little glue can&#x27;t solve.</li>
    <li> I like it,  I just was expecting it to be more shimmery but it was packaged good and the colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> i use it everyday..love the bright bold colors..i use the shimmer with the matte..i have been very pleased with this product since i ordered it!!</li>
    <li> This product gives you array of colors so that you can try out the colors that best show your natural beauty. Colors are indeed in size of a dime but it last long. You can&#x27;t remove this eyeshadow with your finger only and they keep about 10-12h a day. at the end of the day you will need a touch up (form 5:30am to 9pm). The one thing I do not like about it is the applicators are not the best quality as they become loose and you need to buy some. Either way I believe two of them is not enough. Also they way they attach to the side of the mirror is troublesome. Other than that I like it. Good for travel (no need to get lots of mini colors in a bag)</li>
    <li> these are great very pigmented if u like shimmer colors and u want bright colors this is for you at a great price</li>
    <li> So many shimmery colors more than I expected, was really impressed</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as it is advertised. None of the colors were cracked or falling apart like many eyeshadow pallets you get in the store. They also blend pretty well.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and bold even for my dark skin tone. I love the pallet case with the mirror. It just makes it so convenient to apply makeup at anytime. I have recommended this product to all of my friends of all skin tones and they love the shimmer pigments.</li>
