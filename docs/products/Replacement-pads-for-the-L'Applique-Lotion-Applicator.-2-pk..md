      <li>These little pads fit on my applicator</li>
      <li>the ease of applying lotion to hard to reach spots on your back is amazing.</li>
      <li>thanks to Amazon they were delivered in a very short time.  </li>

<li> A must have for those who are single.</li>
<li> I had replacement pads previously that were too small for the applicator and very poor quality; these fit the applicator and hold up well enough.  </li>

<li> I had used this product in past years, and they were reliable for months, but when I ordered new replacement pads, they would come loose from the plastic backing and the pad would be useless!</li>
<li> These pads are on the small side, and one you remove them from the wand they are not reusable, which was a disappointment and a waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
<li> TOO BAD NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE</li>
<li> And so, it separates and the product is useless.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t even give these one star; They were the worst quality ever.</li>

    <li> I purchased these for my sister&#x27;s applicator.  She can&#x27;t find them in any store and they turned out to be exactly what she needed.  Stores don&#x27;t always fill the requirements after they sell the original applicator.  So glad they showed up on the internet.  This is how people get started internet shopping just trying to find the refills.</li>
    <li> The lotion applicator, for which these are a replacement, refresh the applicator after it has been used a number of times. The applicator is a great product for applying lotion for a person with limited range of motion in the upper body, or for anyone, for that matter. Refreshing the pads keep things soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> Replacement pads do not stick well to the applicator.  We have even tried gluing them and it doesn&#x27;t work. Product needs a stronger bonding system.</li>
    <li> These pads are on the small side, and one you remove them from the wand they are not reusable, which was a disappointment and a waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I would prefer some type of velcro attachment between the pad and the wand so that the option to wash and reuse could be made available.  I won&#x27;t order any replacement pads once I&#x27;ve finished with these.</li>
    <li> I have had the L&#x27;Applique Applicator for several years but could not find replacement pads that fit until I found these online.  These pads are just like the original ones and sized perfectly.  I am so glad to have found them, and thanks to Amazon they were delivered in a very short time.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found replacement pads for my lotion applicator. Ordered them right away and they arrived just a couple of days later! Please keep them in stock! I will always be looking to you for more. Thank you.[[ASIN:B000VUWSYK Replacement pads for the L&#x27;Applique Lotion Applicator. 2-pk.]]</li>

    <li> This is the best back applicator on the market. The pads last a long time and the ease of applying lotion to hard to reach spots on your back is amazing. I have one for lotion and keep another by the pool for sunscreen!</li>
    <li> A must have for those who are single. If your back is dry and itchy, or if you simply need sunscreen, you can easily apply any kind of lotion with this tool. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> They work very well, but do not last very long before they begin to fall apart.  They are easy to put on the applicator.</li>
    <li> When I was first attempting to work with my fibromyalgia back pain I used the applicator and used these replacement pads.  It worked but I needed something a little more sturdy that could use both cream and oil.  These had a tendency to fall off.  Good and inexpensive way to get started but I needed something a little stronger.</li>
    <li> Am glad that I found the refills, have used them for years and hope to continue using them. They are perfect for someone with mobility problems.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS PURCHASSED AS A GIFT.  IT IS PERFECT FOR ITS INTENDED USAGE AND THE GIFT WAS VERY APPRECIATIVELY RECEIVED.  GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The replacement pads for the lotion applicator worked just fine and have made it possible for me to continue using lotion where needed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even give these one star; They were the worst quality ever. I had used this product in past years, and they were reliable for months, but when I ordered new replacement pads, they would come loose from the plastic backing and the pad would be useless! Then I would have to spend an hour scraping off the plastic sheeting from the applicator wand. I gave up on ever ordering these again. I can only speculate that they may have been stored in a warehouse for a long time and lost the capacity for the sponge to stay adhered to the plastic backing that sticks to the applicator wand. And so, it separates and the product is useless. The regret is that the design of the wand is excellent, ergonomically, to other applicators, but my wand is useless without a reliable sponge.</li>
