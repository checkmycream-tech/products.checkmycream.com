      <li>This one is light with more spice notes that I like.</li>
      <li>I find this more suited to office wear as opposed to special occasion or romance.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like most fragrances as they are too floral and sweet to me.  </li>
      <li>And the seller shipped it out quick !</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell whether it actually smells good because the fact that it&#x27;s a Hermes product just makes it really cool.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong, very fresh.  </li>
      <li>As expected these products are very good.</li>
      <li>Has a rotten smell to it and makes me wonder if the bottle wasn&#x27;t filled with an inferior product.  </li>
      <li>I read that this scent had a citrus scent that I thought would be light.</li>
      <li>But enjoy.</li>

      <li>Well, no, only pleasant.</li>
      <li>atleast once since it&#x27;s really beautiful and different ...not the love of your life but pretty close to your first real crush !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a favorite scent for years, but never found anything I like as much as this.</li>
      <li>Stick to a true parfum retailer to make your purchases.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume - it is the only perfume I have ever bought more of after running out.  </li>
      <li>This is classic, ageless, not overpowering - appropriate for any occasion.  </li>
      <li>arrived as described and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>But it is definately breathtaking yet subtle the first hour !</li>
      <li>Use the money you save for new shoes :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is not too strong but very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Worth it?</li>
      <li>but if she likes it then it was worth it</li>
      <li>I have allergies to many scents, but this one is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>Looked high and low for this and was delighted to be hooked up through Amazon to buy it.  </li>
      <li>I usually prefer crisp and fresh scents, but this one appealed to me because it is very soft and warm--a perfect perfume for winter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Such a classy chic but yet sexy elegant smell...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent price, cheaper than duty free at the airport.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  HOWEVER, the plastic packaging of the cologne box was clearly opened before as the seal was broken and the plastic torn.  This makes me somewhat nervous.  The box itself and the bottle do not look like they have any wear.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever!  Many compliments on it - husband loves it.  Has become my signature.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, nice paperwork, good product. Package arrived within time frame, however there are some really speedy sellers out there, even to send stuff down here to New Zealand I&#x27;ve gotten stuff within a few days. I will try this seller again.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s right for you, it will become your signature scent;  soft yet lingering.</li>
    <li> Have recommended this scent before, especially for anyone who prefers a clean scent and not overpowering!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very happy would buy agin.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Fast and exactly what I was expecting. Will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Looked high and low for this and was delighted to be hooked up through Amazon to buy it.  Scent is really nice and package arrived in good condition and plenty of time.  Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love Hermes Merveilles!! Totally one of my favorites!! Will buy again and again!! Elixr or eau de toilette, both are fabulous</li>
    <li> Found the most wonderful price for this fabulous Hermes scent.  When I encountered this scent, I asked the person wearing it what it was.  As soon as I arrived home I sought it out on Amazon because I knew I would find the best price and I certainly did.  When my bottle is empty, I will most happily reorder this splendid product that truly has an amazing scent.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for several years and found that the price kept going up with the different online services until researching it on Amazon.com. Best price and quick delivery. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! A great way to start the Holiday Season!</li>
    <li> This is a light, refreshing yet mystic scent that smells different on different women. So it&#x27;s ideal for daywear and/or at work where you don&#x27;t need an overpowering fragrance or want to smell like everyone else ! Despite the description it does have woody undertones that last the longest once the citrus disappears in a few minutes. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 since it only lasts through 2-3 hours. But it is definately breathtaking yet subtle the first hour ! Be careful that you don&#x27;t mistakenly buy the Elixir de Merveilles (EDP) since it is much too fruity and floral and startlingly different from the Eau de Merveilles. Overall, I love this fragrance but may not buy it again since I would like something that lasts longer. But you do need to own it atleast once since it&#x27;s really beautiful and different ...not the love of your life but pretty close to your first real crush !</li>
    <li> Fake! Fake! Fake! DO NOT BUY. The bottle is not the same. There is no Hermes sticker on the bottom and the spray nozzle is so cheap it is clearly NOT Hermes quality. Plus, the imitation scent made me sick! Stick to a true parfum retailer to make your purchases.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find locally.  Should have thought of amazon from the start.  One of the few fragrances my wife really really likes.  Perfect stocking stuffer and a wow surprise.</li>
    <li> Ordered my perfume frome here for the first time--saved about 40% for the same top qualitiy product that I was accustomed to buying direct from Hermes!</li>
    <li> This was a ripoff. It&#x27;s a fake perfume or highly diluted. Smells nothing like the real perfume. I would never have purchased had I known it was a scam!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume - I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> A truly \\&quot;Hermes\\&quot; fragrance - fresh, woodsy with a slight citrus bite that settles into salty creaminess. Unisex and summery - I wear it all year long!</li>
    <li> I constantly get complimented on the smell whenever I wear this perfume. My husband loves it. It&#x27;s pricey, but I was always able to find a good deal online. I never had a favorite perfume until I tries this one. I will always go back to it. It can be heavy for some people though, so I&#x27;m usually very careful about how much I put on at work.</li>
    <li> So I got this because it got great reviews AND because it&#x27;s Hermes.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell whether it actually smells good because the fact that it&#x27;s a Hermes product just makes it really cool.  It smells totally different from Pleasures, Lovely, Romantic, etc.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to ask one of my girlfriends what they think--without letting them know that it&#x27;s Hermes.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume its the lighter version my all time favorite: Elixir Des Merveilles . I usually wear it during the day for outings or business meetings. I got it for a fair price here and it was shipped fast to me.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend she loves the smell. I do also. A little on the expensive side but if she likes it then it was worth it</li>
    <li> I had a very pleasant experience with my purchase of Eau Des Merveilles by Hermes.  The perfume smells wonderful and arrived sooner than anticipated.  The price of the perfume was much better than in the department store and came right to my door.  This was my first purchase on Amazon and it was great.  I would not hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this it was a gift. I have absolutely loved it since. I ALWAYS get the best compliments when I wear it. Love it love it love it!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smell is phenomenal!!!! Such a classy chic but yet sexy elegant smell... I always get compliments, it never fails !! And the seller shipped it out quick ! And I would buy again from this seller and perfect packaging and wrapped well !! Love this perfume !!!</li>
    <li> I usually prefer crisp and fresh scents, but this one appealed to me because it is very soft and warm--a perfect perfume for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not too strong but very noticeable. After application I can smell it on myself for the next 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notes have a lot of warm citrus, definately orange-rich. Pepper and violets make up the medium note. The base note is composed of grassy scents, which provide the longevity for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this perfume and would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since it came out, its alittle citrus with woodsy accents, everyone says how good i smell. the smell is not overpowering by any means, just a good medium balanced smell.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle and am not sure it is the real thing! I had my previous bottle which was being thrown away and compared to this one. Bottom shape of bottle is completely different and no Hermes sticker on the bottom of the Amazon bottle. Again this is what lead me to believe not the real thing! Disappointing for the price tag of $96 plus tax!</li>
    <li> The wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance… and I like it too!  Great price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This was cheapest Eau des Merveilles eau de toilette spray online. I love the scent. I have been using it for more than 3 years now and I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the perfume itself as I planned to give this as a gift to my daughter, which she has used for the past 4 years. The EDP had the cellophane wrapper totally undone, an indication of either old stock and/or poor storage. Either way, its not fit to  be sent as a gift. I do believe, however, it&#x27;s an authentic perfume, just not in prime condition.  Amazon has been very responsive. I am very sad this happened as the price was excellent, perhaps too good to be true. I purchased another Hermes, 24 Faubourg from Amazon directly and everything was perfect.So in brief, this review is 2 stars for the product and 5 stars for Amazon&#x27;s excellent Customer Service.UPDATE: I neglected to mention stock was from 2005 which likely explains the condition of the box.</li>
    <li> Regardless of the advertisement say about the basic scent, a person&#x27;s chemistry affects the depth and longevity of a scent. I read that this scent had a citrus scent that I thought would be light. On me, it&#x27;s heavy and smells like a cheap male cologne. You know that heavy, worn smell of thirft stores? That&#x27;s the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will regift it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She immediately sprayed it and fell in love with it as with the other Hermes that she&#x27;s has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived as described and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller! Product, price, delivery time and delivery! As announced. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume the first time I smelled it when it was released and have used it almost every day since. It&#x27;s a sophisticated feminine fragrance. If you love bergamot (earl gray tea), you have to try this. It can be hard to find in department stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this product. Will be back.......</li>
    <li> A complicated fragrance that really opens into a sophisticated, unforgetting, lasting scent.  This really delivers what everyone is looking for.  Expect compliments</li>
    <li> This stuff is fresh and clean, modern and vaguely unisex. Long- lasting and a tiny spritz should be enough, therefore a reasonable value. I find this more suited to office wear as opposed to special occasion or romance.Is it extremely unique? Well, no, only pleasant. But enjoy.</li>
    <li> as the name, this is wonderful Hermes perfume. This was the first purchase of this brand. I recommend not only the perfume, but the purchase by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent and its a must have  for fall and winter. However, if you&#x27;ve never smelled it I would try to smell it in a store before purchase (you should do that with any fragrance in my opinion ). Anyway, this review if for those skeptical about getting the real deal. I was nervous to purchase online at such a discount because I&#x27;ve doen it in the past for other fragrances and got a fake fragrance. I took a leap of faith here since it was being fulfilled by Amazon and YES IT IS AUTHENTIC! I got the bigger bottle for less money than the little bottle at regular price. Just make sure it says shipped and fulfilled by Amazon and you&#x27;ll be happy. Use the money you save for new shoes :)</li>
    <li> As expected these products are very good. The ladies love these products very much and they were delivered on time.too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for many years and continue to receive compliments.  The Amazon price is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVED this perfume every time I went into Sephora and tried it. I ordered the large bottle thinking I will definitely use it all up but it just smells different. I don&#x27;t know how to really explain it but it&#x27;s just not the same. It smells a lot stronger in the beginning than the one at Sephora but the one at Sephora lasted all day and night and this one is gone in a few hours. I would suggest getting the small bottle first if you want to try.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume - it is the only perfume I have ever bought more of after running out.  I hate all the sweet women&#x27;s scents out there right now.  This is classic, ageless, not overpowering - appropriate for any occasion.  Not sweet, yet still feminine.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a favorite scent for years, but never found anything I like as much as this.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Happy wife &#x3D; Happy life</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years.  This is not the same fragrance. Has a rotten smell to it and makes me wonder if the bottle wasn&#x27;t filled with an inferior product.  Buyer beware of this company</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances.  I don&#x27;t like most fragrances as they are too floral and sweet to me.  This one is light with more spice notes that I like.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and receive compliments from everyone when wearing it.  I have allergies to many scents, but this one is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I receive great, timely service from the vendor when ordering. The product was just as advertised.</li>
    <li> nice handling, package ok, and off course 100% original.. loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;  The Hermes product I received was adulterated and does not match the product I just bought. I was so frustrated upon opening the bottle in front of my wife. This is not the right product!!! Please reimburse me or I can mail back the product.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely matter.. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love this scent - always receive compliments on it.  Not too strong, very fresh.  Worth the price.  Its my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I would have expected that, for the price, this would have been perfume. While I love the scent of Eau Des Merveilles, this scent does not stay with you long, since it&#x27;s not perfume. Too expensive for what it is...</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent! I&#x27;ve bought it before, then tried other, cheaper brand and can&#x27;t stay away. Expensive? Yes! Worth it? YES! I&#x27;m not even thinking about switching to another perfume, this really is the one for me! It seems strong at first, but it mellows out in minutes and provides a nice light subtle fragrance that lasts all day without bowling people over. Very classy and feminine without being all floral.</li>
    <li> Fabulous perfume my favorite.</li>
