### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>received today in perfect conditions</li>
      <li>I bought this product for all family, because is the best protection for avoid the damages caused for caribbean sun, is hypoallergenic and waterproof.</li>
      <li>An excellent product; how to decipher the expiration date</li>
      <li>I think it works best when you put it on 10 or so minutes before so that it has time to absorb otherwise</li>
      <li>I like that it has Titanium Dioxide as it is a great sun blocker</li>
      <li>Stays on great against water.</li>
      <li>It does work well as a sunscreen, but make sure not to get any in your eyes !!  </li>
      <li>Good for kids and adults.</li>
      <li>product does not sting my eyes or crack the cleft in my chin, and it provides good protection.</li>
      <li>It was a warm, but not sweltering day.  </li>
      <li>Because it works, you will put more sunscreen on your kids and your own face without fear of stinging and burning.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>Simply the best for children and also for you, that love being in a pool or beach!</li>
      <li>The best thing about this mineral based sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually, in most Banana Boat products there is a series of embossed numbers on the cap or crimp.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s tear-free for my kids.</li>
      <li>The company says its products remain potent for three years from the date of manufacture.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite sunscreen.</li>
      <li>. Tear free!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would rate it as an OK product.</li>
      <li>It is better than spray on product.</li>
      <li>course, the most important thing is sun protection and Banana Boat Kids protected us all quite well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product all summer, and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>my best pick  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on adult sensitive/ reactive skin)  </li>
      <li>It is not too strong of a smell for my grandchildren, so I have given it to them.</li>
      <li>and you will look fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I wrote this review HOWEVER -- I have been informed this particular BANANA BOAT KIDS does not have Parabens in it anymore - !!!!  </li>
      <li>I find that it soaks in well and does not leave my skin oily and it has a much more pleasant smell compared to many other suntan lotions.</li>
      <li>So, &#x27;tear free&#x27; may be an exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>cheaper sunscreens (non tear free)</li>
      <li>are too important.</li>
      <li>and I was furious that this product was being sold as kid friendly.  </li>
      <li>This is a red flag to check the ingredients in your BANANA BOAT KIDS SUNBLOCK before you buy it to make sure you&#x27;re getting the kind without parabens( \\&quot;MethylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;EthylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;IsobutylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;PropylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;ButylPARABEN\\&quot;.. )&lt;</li>
      <li>The bright yellow color and the logo in large font that says &#x27;KIDS&#x27; are probably more for the parents rather than the kids themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this, whole family uses it.  </li>
      <li>please read other reviews on how good</li>
      <li>This product works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>His first sunburn.  </li>
      <li>Great sunblock for adults and children, no tears, easy to apply, and a very nice thick sunscreen, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Bottle design makes it easy to get every last drop of sunscreen out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but you really need to work it in.</li>
      <li>It really</li>
      <li>Goes on VERY white--just rub it in</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I made sure to put it on 20 min in advance, not sure that helped.  </li>
      <li>The first two represent the year, the next three the day of the year.</li>
      <li>Rubs in clear as well.</li>
      <li>Very waterproof, stays on several hours while swimming.</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin:  </li>
      <li>I put this 50spf on myself and my 2.5 year old.</li>
      <li>NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN plenty of chemicals&lt;</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>It is certainly pricey compared to other similar generic products (must be due to the bright yellow color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the older version of this stuff used chemical sunscreens, but the newer version uses mineral sunscreens only.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again --  apparently kids don&#x27;t react because this type of allergy is developed with time</li>
      <li>use it on my kids, especially on their faces, and so far have had NO crying or tears at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A little more expensive than non tear free versions of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Works good, extra thick, makes your face and body look a little white-ish.  </li>
      <li>This product is effective as a sunscreen but leaves a noticeable white film that&#x27;s difficult to wash off.</li>
      <li>I find that it stays on well and is very waterproof and if a little sweats into my eyes it doesn&#x27;t really irritate them like other products.  </li>

    <li> NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN plenty of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you tried it on yourself? I did  for a year, had no skin problems, but I noticed serious breast pain - Danger: Oxybenzone&#x3D;hormone disruptor. -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a VERY BAD EXPERIENCE with this sunscreen and mostly with  Laroche Posay  Antelios 50 .&lt;br /&gt;Put it on my face and neck, I had a feelling of suffocation with red face.  Also had the worst almost instant headach.&lt;br /&gt;Also tried other suscreens for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and do not recomand so called \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreens. Watch for perfumes, hidden chemicals, hormones disruptors (oxybenzone  is in Banana Boat 50 for babies... dangerous)&lt;br /&gt;Very bad and dangerous product,  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++  Sensitive skin:  my best pick  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on adult sensitive/ reactive skin)  ++++</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but I wanted to share my experience.  I bought this on sale at Kmart, and a few weeks later went to the Outer Banks in mid-May.  It was a warm, but not sweltering day.  We were out for 2 hours.  I put this 50spf on myself and my 2.5 year old. Neither of us went in the water (too cold) or sweated much.  I applied it twice and yet we both still burned.  His first sunburn.  :( Lesson learned.  I&#x27;ll be using Trukids from now on. It&#x27;s only 30 spf, but we&#x27;ve never burned using it and it&#x27;s got less harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well for duration of an hour or so, assuming not working well would mean getting sunburn. The bright yellow color and the logo in large font that says &#x27;KIDS&#x27; are probably more for the parents rather than the kids themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few areas that this product can really improve:&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves a thin white greasy film after application. I understand that the idea for it being greasy is to make it water resistant. However, it is also difficult to get rid of this film even after some amount of scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Its odor is not really kids friendly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Yes, it irritates the eyes if finds its way there. So, &#x27;tear free&#x27; may be an exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;4. It is extremely runny - it tends to drop off from your palm if you (or your kid) is not careful. The part that makes it worse is the fact that it has a &#x27;stand up&#x27; package with the outlet at the bottom. The runny lotion always leaks out due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;5. It is certainly pricey compared to other similar generic products (must be due to the bright yellow color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would rate it as an OK product.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my kids, especially on their faces, and so far have had NO crying or tears at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend putting this on their arms and hands so that when they wipe their faces, they don&#x27;t get tears.&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper sunscreens (non tear free) we use on the body and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even started using it for myself for when I&#x27;m swimming in the ocean and surfing. Nothing like burning sunscreen in the eyes to make you miss seeing waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Tear free! It really works.&lt;br /&gt;2. Because it works, you will put more sunscreen on your kids and your own face without fear of stinging and burning.&lt;br /&gt;3. Bottle design makes it easy to get every last drop of sunscreen out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A little more expensive than non tear free versions of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2. Sand will stick to it (just like almost every other sunscreen made).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan well and rely on this product whenever I will be outside for an extended period. I find that it soaks in well and does not leave my skin oily and it has a much more pleasant smell compared to many other suntan lotions. I think it works best when you put it on 10 or so minutes before so that it has time to absorb otherwise it sweats off a little. I find that it stays on well and is very waterproof and if a little sweats into my eyes it doesn&#x27;t really irritate them like other products.  Because this product is for \\&quot;kids\\&quot; the cap has a smaller dispensing nozzle under the cap which is about half the size found on the Banana Boat products for \\&quot;adults\\&quot;.  It is not much of an issue and if you are in a hurry you can unscrew the cap and there is a larger hole underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the label this product (active ingredients) contains Homosalate (15%) Octinoxate (7.5%), Octisalate (5%) and Titanium Dioxide (2.4%). Unlike some other Banana Boat products it does not have Avobenzone or Oxybenzone. I like that it has Titanium Dioxide as it is a great sun blocker but you really need to work it in.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for all family, because is the best protection for avoid the damages caused for caribbean sun, is hypoallergenic and waterproof.</li>
    <li> I used this on my shoulders, back and chest. Now I have a burn.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite sunscreen. Stays on great against water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all summer, and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin. The best thing about this mineral based sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers are correct, though. I think the older version of this stuff used chemical sunscreens, but the newer version uses mineral sunscreens only.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock for adults and children, no tears, easy to apply, and a very nice thick sunscreen, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I recently did an extensive review of this sunscreen on my review blog. I took a lot of pictures including before and after sun exposure, I list pros and cons, and whether or not I would buy this sunscreen again. It is my sincerest hope that this review helps somebody out! [...]</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Tear Free\\&quot; ?  That&#x27;s a lie !!  I&#x27;m 45 and I accidentally got some in my eye today at our pool.  My eye burned for an hour and a half before it was back to normal.  Ruined my entire day.    In fact, I had this problem years ago with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, \\&quot;generic\\&quot; sunscreen, so this stuff isn&#x27;t made any differently.    It does work well as a sunscreen, but make sure not to get any in your eyes !!  (And my wife just chuckled.  She&#x27;s had the same problem.)</li>
    <li> Rated well by EWG.org. I love that it&#x27;s tear-free for my kids. It&#x27;s thick but works really well.</li>
    <li> An excellent product; how to decipher the expiration date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not sting my eyes or crack the cleft in my chin, and it provides good protection. Another Amazonian has complained in these pages that he can&#x27;t find an expiration date. Actually, in most Banana Boat products there is a series of embossed numbers on the cap or crimp. The first two represent the year, the next three the day of the year. For example, 14159 means that the product was manufactured on the 159th day, June 5, of 2014. The company says its products remain potent for three years from the date of manufacture.</li>
    <li> Love this, whole family uses it.  I use it also because it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes.  I have sensitive eyes and this is the only lotion that has worked for me so I trust it doesn&#x27;t hurt the kids either.  Thick and stays put too.</li>
    <li> Does not sting my kids eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself because it said it was \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;.  I have terrible sinuses and fragrances make me sick. With this product \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; means they didn&#x27;t add perfume.  It has a smell.  It is not too strong of a smell for my grandchildren, so I have given it to them.</li>
    <li> Caused a bad rash on my forearms.  The rash continued long after discontinuing use of the product.  NY Times article, &amp;#34;Ask Well: Nanoparticles in sunscreen&amp;#34; (Jul 22, 2014) suggests that titanium dioxide nanoparticles may have unknown side effects.  I suspect this is one of them.  I will never use another Banana Boat product again.</li>
    <li> It is better than spray on product.</li>
    <li> I use this for myself (I&#x27;m not a kid) because it does not sting, no matter how close I apply it to my eyes.  Goes on VERY white--just rub it in and you will look fine.  I even wear it under makeup.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased again for my kids.  The only active ingredients listed are Titanium Dioxide (3.2%) and Zinc Oxide (4%).  I hope this doesn&#x27;t change!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product there were PARABENS in it .. and I was furious that this product was being sold as kid friendly.  PARABENS cause rashes in older people - usually 60s plus - due to exposure throughout the years; they&#x27;re a preservative in cosmetics / sunblock / lotions / hair coloring / etc that has been banned in other countries but not in the US.  Kids don&#x27;t respond to Parabens because it is an allergy created with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wrote this review HOWEVER -- I have been informed this particular BANANA BOAT KIDS does not have Parabens in it anymore - !!!!  They&#x27;ve updated their formula -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please read other reviews on how good this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping my one star because some BANANA BOAT KIDS SUNBLOCK products still have parabens in them.  Be careful when you buy and read the label.  This is a red flag to check the ingredients in your BANANA BOAT KIDS SUNBLOCK before you buy it to make sure you&#x27;re getting the kind without parabens( \\&quot;MethylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;EthylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;IsobutylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;PropylPARABEN\\&quot;, \\&quot;ButylPARABEN\\&quot;.. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google \\&quot;Paraben allergies\\&quot; for further info.re I used this product are covered in Poison Ivy.  I stopped for two weeks.  Tried it again on specific areas - those areas became rashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Googling \\&quot;Paraben allergies\\&quot; for further info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again --  apparently kids don&#x27;t react because this type of allergy is developed with time --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just upset (can you tell???!) that they sell this as a doctor enforced product when it is something that can add to an allergic reaction in later years.. as you&#x27;re layering your kid in multiple parabens for days on end.  The painful rash I got from such an innocent looking product was the icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Works good, extra thick, makes your face and body look a little white-ish.  It&#x27;s called protection.  But you don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
    <li> Not sure if we got a bad batch.  We seem to burn with this cream.  I made sure to put it on 20 min in advance, not sure that helped.  We do spread on a lot -- goes on thick and white and absorbs with time...</li>
    <li> Simply the best for children and also for you, that love being in a pool or beach! No tears! Long time lasting!</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Kids Sunscreen kept my skin from tanning or burning on our beach vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compliance is the biggest problem we have with sunscreen and it&#x27;s always a challenge to find one product that meets all of our needs.  On our recent vacation I used the Banana Boat on my body and the kids used it on their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one complained of stinging or burning.  Everyone went in the ocean and dove under the water.  The sunscreen didn&#x27;t run into anyone&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the cream is a little thick and sticky upon application, but clears up once you rub it in.  After 15-20 minutes the stickiness goes away and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re covered in sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve started wearing it on my arms and legs daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the most important thing is sun protection and Banana Boat Kids protected us all quite well.  We did reapply after our trip to the beach.  And when I sat on the beach for a break I could see the water beading up on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a cream that will stay in the sunscreen rotation!</li>
    <li> Our 3 kids burned at the pool in Florida despite application on the hour every hour. SPF 50 my foot. Plus they complained of burning eyes as well. Please buy another brand, kids, vacations, and health are too important.</li>
    <li> This product is effective as a sunscreen but leaves a noticeable white film that&#x27;s difficult to wash off. Will not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> received today in perfect conditions</li>
    <li> Very waterproof, stays on several hours while swimming. Rubs in clear as well. I highly recommend this product.  Good for kids and adults.</li>
