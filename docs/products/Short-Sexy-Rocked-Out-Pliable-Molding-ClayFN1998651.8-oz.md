      <li>Quick shipping!!!!</li>
      <li>Great hold without being greasy looking.</li>
      <li>Bravo Sexy Hair!!</li>
      <li>Order 2 jars because the price was good and the product is being discontinued by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;One jar appears to have been used.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Great product at a fantastic price.</li>
      <li>This is the best by far.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>It works really well for faux hawk styles and has good hold without being too sticky!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad you had this</li>
      <li>It smells OK, although I&#x27;d prefer no smell at all.</li>
      <li>Love this hair gel/wax.</li>
      <li>I bought this b/c I wanted to find an alternative to Aveda control paste, which was becoming too pricey (in my book).  </li>
      <li>I really rub it in good with my finger tips like shampoo.</li>
      <li>Make sure you really rub it into your palms before putting it in your hair or you will have a nice glob</li>
      <li>And no annoying fragrance.</li>
      <li>Great for short hair and for keeping stray hairs in place in pony tails .</li>
      <li>It works great, will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I spread it all over my hand and fingers, then lightly run my hands through my hair and style it.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
      <li>not bad you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>The product had been used and wasn&#x27;t the right consistency.  </li>
      <li>Great product but hard to wash off your hands after application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different styling clays and creams and gels.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair look much fuller!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this hair gel and use it daily.</li>
      <li>This is the first wax product I ever used after deciding to let my hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Received it early and exactly as promised!  </li>
      <li>I love this product but have to be careful to not use to much for my hair style.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t spend too much time on it.</li>
      <li>It holds very well and isn&#x27;t shiny.</li>
      <li>It really has whatever I need and at competitve prices</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sticky but blends well into your hair.</li>
      <li>If you can still provide, it would be appreciated.</li>
      <li>perfect for my thin short hair.</li>
      <li>though this product works well, I decided to experiment with American Crew Fiber, and I gotta say, I like the Rocked Out better so far.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t let you smooth it through your hair at all, so I was left w/ strands that were either sticky, tacky and felt fried, or strands that were completely untouched.  </li>
      <li>flexible with decent hold</li>
      <li>so I am frantically buying up all the old stock I can find!</li>
      <li>This was old and dryed out, i will not be purchasing online again.</li>
      <li>I took a small amount (I have short, piece-y hair that is fine and really soft) and rubbed it between my palms - tried to distribute it through my hair, but UGH!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like this product because I rub it into my hair pretty sloppily, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>

<li> This was old and dryed out, i will not be purchasing online again.</li>

<li> /&gt;Overall, I like this product because I rub it into my hair pretty sloppily, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get too much or your hair will stay limp and wet feeling.    </li>
<li> Unfortunately, &amp;#34;Rocked Out&amp;#34; is no longer available</li>
<li> a good product for the base of your hair but not finish</li>
<li> A little goes a long way with my short hair, so this will last me for a while.</li>
<li> I have short spiky hair and this is the only product that holds it up without feeling greasy or dull.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other products, but they just don&#x27;t have the hold of this molding clay.  </li>
<li> A little expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
<li> The Fiber was even stickier than the Rocked Out and by the time I worked the Fiber in my hair, the other half of my hair was in the sink from being ripped out by the Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I read the reviews on Amazon and some other sites and thought this was the product for me...bad move!  </li>
<li> Other gels don&#x27;t keep the wet look on my extremely thick and curly hair for longer than 10 minutes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time now, but it&#x27;s hard to find anymore.  </li>
<li> It kept my hair spiked all day and wasn&#x27;t too hard at all.</li>
<li> if it in your hair and it will be hard to work it</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t expect a liquid gel this is considered a mold and is very thick and heavy.</li>
<li> off/out and NOT feel like I put my hand in a vat of thick glue.  </li>
<li> Therefore not a good price after all.</li>
<li> Also, the casing was cracked and broken in pieces when it arrived.</li>
<li> when you know what works for your hair, you hate to use other substitutes.  </li>
<li> The worst part is, I had to wash my hands almost three times (and my hair twice) just to get the product</li>

    <li> This stuff is awesome! It works really well for faux hawk styles and has good hold without being too sticky!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product! My hair is very fine. This product makes my hair look much fuller!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
    <li> It kept my hair spiked all day and wasn&#x27;t too hard at all. It works great, will definitely buy again.</li>

Maybe it works differently for course hair, but for me, no go.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair.  This product has been discontinued but have been purchasing from Amazon.  How come when a product is working so well they change it up.  If you can still provide, it would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Rockin&#x27; and a rollin&#x27;!!!</li>
    <li> This was old and dryed out, i will not be purchasing online again.</li>
    <li> Order 2 jars because the price was good and the product is being discontinued by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;One jar appears to have been used. Therefore not a good price after all.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not like it use to be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointed</li>
    <li> Love it. The only hair product I will use. perfect for my thin short hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different styling clays and creams and gels. This is the best by far. It holds very well and isn&#x27;t shiny.</li>
    <li> Love this hair gel/wax. Other gels don&#x27;t keep the wet look on my extremely thick and curly hair for longer than 10 minutes. In the summer I NEED this to keep my hair from puffing up into a frizzy  from the east coast humidity. The wax itself is that..wax. Don&#x27;t expect a liquid gel this is considered a mold and is very thick and heavy. I really rub it in good with my finger tips like shampoo.</li>
    <li> Received it early and exactly as promised!  Thank you for job well done.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price. Quick shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found. The place I get my hair cut used to carry this, but it was discontinued. Great hold without being greasy looking.</li>
    <li> This is the first wax product I ever used after deciding to let my hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is sticky feeling in your hands. Make sure you really rub it into your palms before putting it in your hair or you will have a nice glob if it in your hair and it will be hard to work it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product because I rub it into my hair pretty sloppily, and I&#x27;m ready to go. I don&#x27;t spend too much time on it. It smells OK, although I&#x27;d prefer no smell at all. It holds my hair all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product works well, I decided to experiment with American Crew Fiber, and I gotta say, I like the Rocked Out better so far. The Fiber was even stickier than the Rocked Out and by the time I worked the Fiber in my hair, the other half of my hair was in the sink from being ripped out by the Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried anything else yet, but I do recommend this stuff so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency, perfect hold.  I&#x27;m used a lot of these types of products and I like this one the best.  Got the recommendation from my hair dresser who uses nothing else.</li>
    <li> I have short thinner hair.  I love this product but have to be careful to not use to much for my hair style.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  I&#x27;ve used this product for some time now, but it&#x27;s hard to find anymore.  May have to shop for something else next time, but I bought three to stock up for now.    A little goes a long way with my short hair, so this will last me for a while. This product feels sticky in your hands.  Take care to rub it in your hands before applying or you&#x27;ll get big globs of it in your hair.  I spread it all over my hand and fingers, then lightly run my hands through my hair and style it.  Don&#x27;t get too much or your hair will stay limp and wet feeling.    I&#x27;ve tried a couple other products, but they just don&#x27;t have the hold of this molding clay.  I dread trying to find another product when I can&#x27;t find this one anymore.</li>
    <li> The product had been used and wasn&#x27;t the right consistency.  Should have been told this before I purchased it.  Also, the casing was cracked and broken in pieces when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I am so glad you had this</li>
    <li> Love it! Its a bit on the costly side, but damn does it look good on me! Bravo Sexy Hair!!</li>
    <li> The hold on this product is actually a 5-6&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#x3D;Rock hard&lt;br /&gt;5/10&#x3D;flexible with decent hold&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product for the base of your hair but not finish I suggest you finish your hairstyle with a stronger hair paste or wax.&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby Technical clay.&lt;br /&gt;But not bad you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but it is worth it. I absolutely love this hair gel and use it daily. Definitely worth buying!</li>
