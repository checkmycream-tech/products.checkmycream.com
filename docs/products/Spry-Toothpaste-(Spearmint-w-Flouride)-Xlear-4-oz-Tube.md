      <li>Pleasant taste of mild spearmint.</li>
      <li>Taste was not too strong, which was nice.  </li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>For those of us who still think fluoride is a net benefit, that&#x27;s great news!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Needs more Spearmint to improve.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how I can describe it</li>
      <li>I love the sort and xlear brands.</li>
      <li>Love the paste but the tube cracks at seam at about 1/2 used.  </li>
      <li>Glad it has the xylitol I was looking for,</li>
      <li>I am glad Spry is available with fluoride as this is a proven cavity fighting ingredient.</li>
      <li>Our dentist recommended this to my son, who gets cavities sooo easily.  </li>
      <li>Spry leaves my teeth shining clean and they REMAIN clean for hours after even if I&#x27;ve eaten!</li>
      <li>Your teeth feel clean after use.</li>
      <li>I used to have to remind my kids that they needed to put enough toothpaste on their toothbrushes so they could brush their teeth really good.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I noticed right away that my teeth felt cleaner longer.</li>
      <li>Studies  have shown many dental benefits when regularly consuming products sweetened with xylitol.</li>
      <li>Thus, this toothpaste is a natural holistic product that does not introduce any other more toxic chemicals to kill bacteria, and it is safe for the environment too.  </li>
      <li>Huge fan of Spry gum and mints (fresh fruit gum and berryblast mints to be specific),</li>
      <li>this toothpaste, I have to tell them not to put so much on their toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>High quality products!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the gaps in my gums as much.</li>
      <li>I found this tootpaste to be very helpful in preventing plaque buildup on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>So much that the seel at the end of the tube broke,</li>
      <li>Consistency just right - not too soft.</li>
      <li>I really love the fact that this toothpaste is made with Xylitol as the sweetening agent; not only does it take the place of sugars which have never been great for teeth, xylitol has been proven to destroy the &#x27;bad&#x27; oral bacteria, while leaving the &#x27;good&#x27; (ie.</li>
      <li>Most toothpaste tubes have a protectant cover that needs to be peeled back to open it up for usage.</li>
      <li>The Xylitol was the main reason I purchased this item.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone, DDS</li>
      <li>As a hygienist I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>(although you still taste the spearmint), and it&#x27;s certainly not something that I enjoy.  </li>
      <li>He was hesitant at first of the taste that was different than the regular, sugary, kid pastes, but he adjusted quickly.</li>
      <li>It tastes ok when you first start using it, but then it gets a weird taste.  </li>
      <li>As far as effect on teeth it is hard to say, just have to rely on the research that shows positive effects of Xylitol.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste at Amazon price.</li>
    <li> nice  looking for a non GMO flouride toothpaste - closest i have found in the states</li>
    <li> Love the paste but the tube cracks at seam at about 1/2 used.  Why I&#x27;ve no idea.  Not one time only issue.  Keep buying as I think Spry is doing my teeth and mouth good.</li>
    <li> I used to have to remind my kids that they needed to put enough toothpaste on their toothbrushes so they could brush their teeth really good. They used to say that they didn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; of the \\&quot;X\\&quot; brand toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;With this toothpaste, I have to tell them not to put so much on their toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;Before we started used the Spry products, my son had a couple \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; that the dentist was watching. After using this product for a couple months, those \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; aren&#x27;t so much \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My family now uses the toothpaste, mints and gum.&lt;br /&gt;My kids LOVE them!!!</li>
    <li> I like the products. I didn&#x27;t realize this had fluoride, I usually by the non fluoride type they sell. All good. I also use the mouthwash from this company.</li>
    <li> The product was just as expected. Taste was not too strong, which was nice.  I like the fact that this toothpaste has Xylitol in it, and also fluoride. The Xylitol was the main reason I purchased this item. As far as effect on teeth it is hard to say, just have to rely on the research that shows positive effects of Xylitol.</li>
    <li> I really love the fact that this toothpaste is made with Xylitol as the sweetening agent; not only does it take the place of sugars which have never been great for teeth, xylitol has been proven to destroy the &#x27;bad&#x27; oral bacteria, while leaving the &#x27;good&#x27; (ie. those we need for healthier gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is wonderful, light and not overpowering.  And I appreciate that Spry makes one with fluoride and one without.  For those of us who still think fluoride is a net benefit, that&#x27;s great news!</li>
    <li> Works better than any toothpaste on the market for bad breath.</li>
    <li> Taste is good. Glad it has the xylitol I was looking for, but it&#x27;s very difficult to squeeze out. So much that the seel at the end of the tube broke, so now when I squeeze toothpaste comes out both ends. We also have a cinnamon flavor that my son uses, his is really hard to squeeze out too.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste out there. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> My favorite flavor of all the spry toothpastes! I do wish I could find it in the non flouride variety. I love the sort and xlear brands. High quality products!</li>
    <li> Meet expectations wish it came in larger size</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite toothpaste. It has and does everything I need. My teeth are happy, my breath is fresh, and my tongue and mouth feel great.</li>
    <li> I expected to get an  natural tootpaste . Before you buy it, check ewg skin deep. Propyl paraben ..no, thank you</li>
    <li> I missed the Fluoride part on the labeling, but I ended up purchasing Xclear&#x27;s non-fluoride toothpaste later. Boo for fluoride, yet yay for Xclear.</li>
    <li> The taste is not to my liking . Needs more Spearmint to improve.&lt;br /&gt; Also once I found out Xylitol is also a laxative , I quit using it.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! Has a great taste. Your teeth feel clean after use.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of Spry gum and mints (fresh fruit gum and berryblast mints to be specific), but I did not like this toothpaste at all. It tastes ok when you first start using it, but then it gets a weird taste.  I&#x27;m not even sure how I can describe it but it&#x27;s not a minty taste (although you still taste the spearmint), and it&#x27;s certainly not something that I enjoy.  I will be going back to Squigle Enamel Saver even though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this from XylitolDirect through Amazon Prime. It arrived smashed and opened, looking like it had been used, despite being in a larger UPS box that was unharmed. Another reviewer had a similar experience. Mine was obviously squashed and opened BEFORE it was packaged and mailed. Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT: This sounds like a great product. Combining Xylitol and Fluoride is the best of both worlds for dental hygeine. It also has some abrasives in it, just FYI. That&#x27;s not great for electric toothbrushes and some people with sensitivities. And it has some unnecessary, bad ingredients, parabens, that you don&#x27;t want in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste of mild spearmint. Consistency just right - not too soft. Bacteria-inhibiting xylitol. I am glad Spry is available with fluoride as this is a proven cavity fighting ingredient.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 10 years ago and I was hooked. I noticed right away that my teeth felt cleaner longer. And when I go to the dentist I don&#x27;t have the gaps in my gums as much.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that breaks down plaque. My dentist loves it! Studies  have shown many dental benefits when regularly consuming products sweetened with xylitol. this is the best of the lot. The kids brush with this once a week also. People who are prone to cavities but brush and floss to no avail should pick this up. It helps.</li>
    <li> I chose this item b/c I have dry mouth problems. Whoever is selling this product is doing so without any care at all. The package took SO LONG to arrive. When it did arrive, it was in a mail envelope type packaging. The packaging and tooth paste was all smashed up. It actually looked used. Most toothpaste tubes have a protectant cover that needs to be peeled back to open it up for usage. This didn&#x27;t have a covering it was already open.</li>
    <li> I found this tootpaste to be very helpful in preventing plaque buildup on my teeth.  This was validated at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Kills bacteria that causes cavities. Good tasting and has so many benefits. As a hygienist I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended this to my son, who gets cavities sooo easily.  He was hesitant at first of the taste that was different than the regular, sugary, kid pastes, but he adjusted quickly.</li>
    <li> Spry toothpaste contains the tree sugar, Xylitol, which when ingested by oral bacteria, kills them.  Thus, this toothpaste is a natural holistic product that does not introduce any other more toxic chemicals to kill bacteria, and it is safe for the environment too.  Used regularly, it will reduce the numbers of pathological bacteria in one&#x27;s mouth and (hopefully) also reduce the incidence of periodontal disease and cavities.  Use it 3 times a day for maximum effectiveness and consider supplementing with Xylitol candies, which can be used in-between brushings:  [[ASIN:B00124WBCS Xlear Spry Peppermint Gum, 600-Count]].  Excellent toothpaste based on sound biological principles.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone, DDS</li>
    <li> I try to stay away from fluoride as much as possible because it makes me sick to my stomach AND strangely enough, makes the skin inside my cheeks slough off like they&#x27;ve been exfoliated! Spry is the perfect solution! I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s of Maine before but their toothpastes are chalky and leave my mouth feeling icky. Spry leaves my teeth shining clean and they REMAIN clean for hours after even if I&#x27;ve eaten! Great product!</li>
