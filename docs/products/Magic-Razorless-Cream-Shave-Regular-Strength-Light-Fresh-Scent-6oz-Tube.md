      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>I was amazed that it was so ineffective as I had heard good things about it.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and perfect.</li>
      <li>By the way, I have fair complexion and am in my mid-40&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>the off-label use is a good idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman, and I&#x27;d heard good things via the internet grapevine about this product.  </li>
      <li>shave I received &amp;#34;improved 4 minute cream shave&amp;#34; which is a good product.</li>
      <li>I have read reviews that this is also good on bikini lines, so I tried it.  </li>
      <li>if you want to burn the bush, so to speak, give it a try because that&#x27;s all this is good for.</li>
      <li>My experience, however, was not so good.</li>
      <li>I was at a good inbetween point and</li>
      <li>This was for my boyfriend who liked it, even though it took some convincing to even try it--but once he did, he LOVED it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just so happy with this product, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
      <li>In love with it still!</li>
      <li>Before I go, I must say to all considering Magic Razorless products, DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>The BEST part is it doesn&#x27;t carry that stinking egg smell like the old fashioned powder kind!</li>
      <li>Face experienced light burning feeling, but no visible irritation.</li>
      <li>But for the price and for something that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also kind of a pain to have to stand with your foot on the tub/toilet for 6-9 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Do not use the Aloe Vera kind or the Fragrant kind and DO NOT USE THE PRE-MIXED KIND IN THE TUBE..  </li>
      <li>Then I wiped my face of with a warm damp washcloth.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done with the credit card I then wipe my face with a warm damp towel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, this is an off-label use, so try at your own discretion.</li>
      <li>But a nice thing is that the hair isn&#x27;t all jagged and pointy as it grows in, as it would be with shaving.  </li>
      <li>and I even had a nice bald patch in my beard where I did the test.</li>
      <li>It works great with no bad skin rashes.</li>
      <li>It does not cause a reaction on my incredibly sensitive skin so that was a great great thing.</li>
      <li>thought I should try it because I like a good smooth shave</li>
      <li>I found that one to be way more effective</li>
      <li>I went the full nine minutes and loved my results.</li>
      <li>I must give major kudos to the brave lady who decided to slap this on her privates for the good of womankind.</li>
      <li>one doesnt go on very smoothly at all..</li>
      <li>Oh and it smells really badly kind of like really strong fart.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Remember your skin might be more sensative than mine and these methods may not work...</li>
      <li>As for around the top and sides of the penile shaft, it seemed to remove some stubble from trimming with an electric razor, but did not remove all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I tried 15 minutes, removed most.</li>
      <li>Decided to try Magic Razorless cream shave.</li>
      <li>A perfect middle road, in my opinion.       </li>
      <li>and I fell in love with this stuff.</li>
      <li>Enter Magic Razorless Cream Shave...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman and use magic cream about once a week.</li>
      <li>Magic cream has many uses besides those listed on the bottle.</li>
      <li>USED BY A WOMAN: I love this for my lady bits.</li>
      <li>, I shall have to quest further to find the perfect smoothest shave</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a try since I have an uncle who&#x27;s used magic shave powder for over 50 years, and my step dad using it for decades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy for people who seem to get good value from this product, but apparently it simply does not work at all for some of</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
      <li>love it!hensive thread can be found by searching \\&quot;purse forum</li>
      <li>well until a lovely aftershave product I use was applied:</li>
      <li>I use it for my whole body, including armpits and Manzilian, and it works great.</li>
      <li>I have used this porduct for many years now and it works OK.</li>
      <li>The most comprehensive thread can be found by searching \\&quot;purse forum</li>
      <li>The product could be better</li>
      <li>I like the closeness of the razor which is why I like to use this &#x27;hybrid&#x27; method, but you must ensure you are not using the razor on the areas you use the magic shave and that there isn&#x27;t a &#x27;line of hair&#x27; in between</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Thinking that with repeated use it might get better, I have continued to work with this product.</li>
      <li>tried this product before taking a shower so I could be sure to remove</li>
      <li>I will say if you want to use Magic shave, stick with the powder.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Remember your skin might be more sensative than mine and these methods may not work...</li>
      <li>most people do, I waited a week and applied a thicker coating, let it stay on longer, and scrubbed it off.</li>
      <li>I still had most (if not all) of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>So I slap some on my underarm areas and figure i&#x27;ll let it work its magic while i shave my legs.</li>
      <li>A greater fraction of it came out.  </li>
      <li>This my 5th time using this product and love it.</li>
      <li>Just made my skin slightly more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I have been using Magic Shave for years for a close shave without the razor bumps.</li>
      <li>Excuse my grammatical errors, I&#x27;m not the greatest writer.</li>
      <li>I must have some kind of super beard.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this product worked perfectly in removing just about everything in my groin area (I&#x27;m a male).</li>
      <li>The smooth version works better on my bald head.</li>
      <li>you insist on using Magic&#x27;s Razorless cream products for your beard, USE THE BALD SMOOTH (the brown colored tube) Hair removing cream..</li>
      <li>The new mix does have a bit of a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; that takes some getting used to, but it does the job WITH a pleasant almost minty scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> April 25, 2015: I&#x27;m a woman a mixed woman at that and I fell in love with this stuff. I just used it and my legs are INCREDIBLY SOFT and unlike when I use Nair or when I shave no spot was missed at all! I didn&#x27;t even apply a thick amount either.  I am very pleased with this product I bought mine at Walgreens for a little cheaper than Amazon, but they don&#x27;t always have it at Walgreens I&#x27;ll more than likely be buying it here as well.  I also did a small test patch on my &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; area and I barely put any there and it took the hair off! Like I&#x27;m amazed! It&#x27;s amazing!  The product lives up to its four minutes as well. I timed it for exactly four minutes and took it off. The instructions say that if it dries just rewet it and then take it off I&#x27;m guessing? Like they did with people using the can mixture? Not sure, but anyways, it didn&#x27;t dry and the hair still came of smooth as butter!  I NEVER make long reviews, but this product was worth it. I will also be doing a updated review on how I still feel about the product as I continue to use it. This is my first impression review. I hope this helps! :)  UPDATE: May 3rd: it&#x27;s been 6 days since I have used this product and have &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; and I BARELY have any stubble at all and I&#x27;m impressed no ingrown hairs anywheres! It&#x27;s amazing! Still just as smooth and soft as day one!  In love with it still! I believe it&#x27;s worth the money less than $5 and Nair or Veet is almost 10 sometimes more. So I would rather have this product any day. I haven&#x27;t had any irritating at all.  Btw I was recommended this product by my OBGYN so that has to say something if a doctor can say it&#x27;s a great product to fight against ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I tested this in a small patch on my face and a larger one under my arm and did not notice a reaction, so applied it to my face the next day. After four minutes, it was clear it had removed nothing, so I left it on the recommended maximum of seven minutes and removed it. Essentially every bit of stubble that was on my face before I started was still there afterward. Then, it begin to burn, a lot. Leaving my face red and irritated. It did do fairly well at removing a small patch of hair on my chest, where it is lighter and finer, but aside from burning my face, it had no effect there. If your facial hair is very fine and light, you may have success, if you can stand the pain afterwards, and it may work well on other body hair. But, for anyone looking to remove a thick beard, stick with a razor.</li>
    <li> It works great. It doesn&#x27;t permanently remove the hair at least not all me. So you still have to keep replying when hair grows back. It does smell bad.</li>
    <li> Magic Shave used to be one of the best products out there for black men who have a tough time with razors which is quite a lot. Myself included. Used to be. I can&#x27;t prove this, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they changed the chemical formula about 2-3 years ago. That&#x27;s when you started seeing it in the stores with ALOE VERA and the new label. Anyone who remembers the classic bottle remembers it didn&#x27;t used to have ALOE VERA. And also the old formula felt more like a PASTE. This new stuff feels more like a cream almost liquid like. IT TOTALLY DOES NOT WORK, WHATSOEVER. Barely takes off one whisker. It&#x27;s such a shame cause this product used to be so good. Please take heed to my review and don&#x27;t buy this. Your best bet is FORMULA 103, which works great, but unfortunately can only be found online and in select stores and also is super expensive. Otherwise the people who make it would be billionaires by now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caucasian male who is tired of shaving every day and still scratching up my girlfriend whenever we kiss.  Therefore, I gave this product a shot.  I followed the directions to the tee, but it didn&#x27;t take any portion of the hair off of my face.  Not one.  I was amazed that it was so ineffective as I had heard good things about it.  I must have some kind of super beard.</li>
    <li> As a volunteer at a local homeless men&#x27;s shelter I mentioned the high cost of facial depilatory to one of the residents.  I knew that most black men used a depilatory instead of shaving with a razor and couldn&#x27;t figure out how the men could afford the brands most white women are aware of.  Travis tipped me off to Magic Shave and recommended I try the cream first since it is less harsh.  I left it on for 20 minutes (more than the recommended time).  It came off easily, didn&#x27;t have that awful smell of most women&#x27;s&#x27; facial depilatory products, and didn&#x27;t burn the skin on my face.  The lack of skin damage made the price a simple bonus factor.  I do need to use it once every 5 days which is more often than the smelly, expensive, skin burning brands so I think it&#x27;s worth the trade off.  But it does dry out my skin so I use a moisturizing mask after I wash the last of it off.  It even works on the area above my nose so that my eyebrows have stopped holding hands with each other.  I&#x27;m surprised how few white women know about this product but I tell everyone I know about it!</li>
    <li> As ordered !!! Great Product !!!</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x60;t work, it irritates skin.  If you need a similar product, buy a powder and mix with water to make a cream, its much less irritating and much more efficient.  I use it all the time, again buy the powder not a cream.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t read the label close enough. i am not a black man, but a white woman sooooooo.... yeah. my bearded lady issues need a different approach.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff recently, based on recommendations from the Internet, because I was tired of shaving.  I applied it once, and some of my hair came out.  So I followed the directions, and applied it again after 24 hours.  A greater fraction of it came out.  The third day, I applied it again, and it got pretty much everything.  I&#x27;m quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that you get better results if you scrape the cream and hair off with a piece of plastic first, rather than just wipe it off with a washcloth.  So buy one of those plastic razors that come with lesser hair-removal products, and then use this stuff.  But be persistent.</li>
    <li> This is my first review, and normally I don&#x27;t write reviews, but when something is this ineffective it needs to be known. Let me break this down, good and simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It stinks&lt;br /&gt;-It only removes a couple of beard hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Was a waste of about 20minutes of my life (No, not all in one sitting--I can read directions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I should try it because I like a good smooth shave and if I can get it without a razor, then why not? So I bought the product hoping I could achieve this desired smooth shave without the razor. When it came I did the little test area to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have some horrid reaction to it. And my skin was fine with the stuff and I even had a nice bald patch in my beard where I did the test. I thought: \\&quot;Ooh! This is promising!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I waited the obligatory 24hour period before going at it. I covered my beard area in the smelly stuff... waited... and removed it as directed. It took maybe 10 little bits of beard out. Compared to how much beard I have on my face... this was a disappointing result. And no, I didn&#x27;t let my beard grow out grizzly adams style before using this--nor was it after a day old shave. I was at a good inbetween point and literally nothing substantial happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I shall have to quest further to find the perfect smoothest shave I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Shaving 24 hours after using this (so I can have a clean shave for work) required an extra pass I don&#x27;t normally require with a fresh razor and I got all sorts of fun cuts probably from micro bumps caused by the product. My face feels horrible... well until a lovely aftershave product I use was applied: The Real Shaving Co. Post Shave Soothing Balm ... fantastic for after any shave be it a good one or a bad one.</li>
    <li> I have used this porduct for many years now and it works OK. The problem is that I leave it on for 30 minutes at a time. If I were to leave it for just 6-9 minutes, I would have zero results. A touch up with a blade is necessary but with the smoothness of the shave afterwards, its not that bad. The product could be better but I have not used a blade alone for the vast majority of my adult life.</li>
    <li> This caused slight chemical burns on my skin and caused be to itch for a few days. I had to wash it off due to the burning. Even then it did little to remove my hair. It smelled horrible, like every other hair removing chemical, and the smell lingered on everything for quite some time. This product is definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I will say that the bottle clearly says &#x27;Formulated Exclusively for Black Men&#x27;, so I do take a little blame, as I am a white male. However, I did not expect the reaction to be so severe. After scraping this gunk off my face, first I noticed that most of my facial hair was still there, and I don&#x27;t have a thick bunch of facial hair to begin with. But soon after the disappointment, I noticed the pain. The parts of my face that didn&#x27;t burn were numb. And I know what you are thinking... he should have done the sensitivity test. Well, I did. The small spot I was directed to try it out on seemed okay the night before. Please, just use caution with this product. Hell, the razor didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this one after the similar Magic product in the brown labeled tube didn&#x27;t work.  Same result - it didn&#x27;t remove my beard but burned my face.  Wasted my time and money.</li>
    <li> Have had no skin problems using this item. Hair gone for at least 5weeks or more. I now recommended to my 18yr old grandaughter to use instead of a razor. Just sent her 2tubes today.</li>
    <li> I left it on for 4 minutes, without any efficacy.  So I then left it on for 8-9 minutes, and all I got was skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This was for my boyfriend who liked it, even though it took some convincing to even try it--but once he did, he LOVED it! The BEST part is it doesn&#x27;t carry that stinking egg smell like the old fashioned powder kind! That stuff brings back horror memories as a little girl in the late 60&#x27;s &amp; that choking, STINKING smell permeating my nostrils leaving or entering our apt.because the dad used next door! ROTFLOL. My 6 yr old self thought I was gonna pass out!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
    <li> I gave this cream a try. I tried it twice.   It didn&#x27;t work.    I&#x27;m a male with very thick beard that grows very fast.  I followed the instructions to the letter.    It did NOTHING to my beard. And it didn&#x27;t remove any beard hair AT ALL.    Yes, it did burn my skin, had discomfort, and bad-looking skin for a week but it wasn&#x27;t too bad, i.e.: not a big deal.    I wish it had worked. The idea is great!    So...    If you hair is thin and slow to grow, this MIGHT work for you.    If you are a man or woman with a REAL BEARD: forget it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this like every other day for the past 2 weeks and for the past 4 days i used it every day.  My beard isn&#x27;t that thick but i guess my hairs are strong or something cause it isn&#x27;t working.  It takes off a little hair but that&#x27;s it.  And i even left it on for like a half hour today.  However if you really load it on there like a LOT of it. It takes off a decent amount.  It ex foliates your skin too.  I MIGHT get it again after i use up this tube.</li>
    <li> This product easily removed hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other products out there.  No ingrown hairs, no itching.  Great!</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick hair (but not a really dense beard). I followed the directions exactly and tried it 1.5 after my last shave; it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair (not one!). All it did was leave a red spot. Maybe the extra-strength red powder works (not for sensitive skin I&#x27;d guess ;-))?    2 stars because it clearly works for some people. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> This thing is like putting acid on your face. It burns the crap out of your skin. My face has no feeling in it now and it literally took some coloring of my skin aka chemical burn. This should be banned and the people behind it should be horsewhipped!</li>
    <li> I am a mixed half-African half-White male. Whenever I shave with a razor I have a thick shadow, and it looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;I put a generous portion of this product my face and left it on for 7 minutes, the maximum time. It removed much of the hair, however it did not remove hair close to the skin, so I could have got a closer shave by shaving. And my skin was mildy irritated afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me trying to get rid of your mustache that you can&#x27;t \\&quot;shave away\\&quot; look elsewhere, this doesn&#x27;t remove close to the skin and certainly not anywhere deep near your follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this on a hot summer day, I was sweating a bit, and my house has no air conditioning. I still don&#x27;t think it would work though.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gag gift for a friend. Of course he was afraid to use it so I kept it sitting in the cupboard for a while. But after suffering the excruciating time and effort to clean myself up \\&quot;down there\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d try this product. Well, needless to say I could have turned up a fool with a chemically burned sack. Fortunately, this product worked perfectly in removing just about everything in my groin area (I&#x27;m a male). There are lots of complaints from people who were burned, if you use common sense and follow the 6-9 minute time limit you should not have a problem. I went the full nine minutes and loved my results. It does smell pretty unpleasant, but I would rather do this than continue shaving down there by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fast, efficient, painless&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smell, and it makes somewhat of a mess</li>
    <li> My dislike of this product is twofold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) It didn&#x27;t work.  My hair is, admittedly, very coarse, but the Magic Cream didn&#x27;t even take a couple hairs off.  It left them equally as prickly and present as I had started, even after leaving it on for a little longer than the directions stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) The smell is overpoweringly repugnant.  I deal well with most smells, such as cleaning supplies or spoiled food when cleaning, but the smell of the Magic Razorless Cream was so awful that by the time I washed it off I was nauseous.  My friend, who is more sensitive to smells, opened the bottle and had to leave the room.  I&#x27;m not sure what creates the smell but even if this cream worked, I would be unlikely to use it due to the smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Much easier for me than the Magic powder, and much much less aromatic - practically scentless. I use it for my whole body, including armpits and Manzilian, and it works great. Experiment a bit with timing on it and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> So this is a little embarrassing, but why not disclose this... it is the internet, right? I use this to get rid of unwanted hair. This includes but is not limited to: Groin, back, and chest hair. It works great with no bad skin rashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Black. I put this on my face for about 6 mins. Didn&#x27;t get all the hair off my face. I put more on about 3 mins and it left my face red. It&#x27;s was burning and I could see a little blood from using this product. Never again I will use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Magic cream has many uses besides those listed on the bottle. I&#x27;m a woman and use magic cream about once a week. You do go through quite a bit of it, but at the price, it&#x27;s well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it smells a little weird, but so do most depilatory creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve attached a photo taken of my chin after the product was used for the maximum time of 7 minutes and the hair was rubbed vigorously with a wet warm wash cloth. As you can plainly see, the product doesn&#x27;t work. (What you can&#x27;t see is the lingering terrible odor.) This product has no tamper-proof seal under the cap. Mine arrived in shoddy packaging and the lids were popped partially open on both containers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Native American. My facial hair is sparse but I get razor bumps easily. Decided to try Magic Razorless cream shave. Regular Strength. It opened up my pores and burnt my skin only had it on for 6 minutes. My face upper lip area is covered in clotted blood and razor bumps galore. It looks Like I have herpes! Very Embarrassing. Not only that it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair! Not one!! I will never use this product again!</li>
    <li> This is an off-label use for this product but it has worked for me for over 7 years. Instead of a painful waxing down in that area, I use this the Magic Shave Cream to get rid of unwanted hair. Smells a little strong but this one isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as some of the other varieties. No pain from waxing and saves quite a bit of money and time from not having to visit a salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is an off-label use, so try at your own discretion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Magic Shave since 2006.  Do not use the Aloe Vera kind or the Fragrant kind and DO NOT USE THE PRE-MIXED KIND IN THE TUBE..  Get the Regular funky kind in the silver, white, blue can that you have to mix with water. lol  Your house will smell like sulfer/boiled eggs but it works and the scent goes away after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use the tube of pre-made and my face got irritated and it looked like my hair broke off instead of pulling out.  So the bumps and irritation came.  I tried the scented kind and had the same issue--- the aloe vera kinda worked a little better; but i have to use this every 3 days to keep my hair away-- with the aloe and scented this will cause irritation-- with the regular can.. no irritation, it just works.  no bumps... no scars, no burns...</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am a woman who has been looking for hair removal creams for years! I have tried Nair, Sally Hansen, and a number of other products that never seemed to work for my courser textured hair. 6 minutes of this stuff and it was as if the hair just melted away - legs and other areas too!! I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I have read reviews that this is also good on bikini lines, so I tried it.  It just left patches of hair on my bikini lines and legs.  It made my skin itchy after an hour I used it.  I guess, that&#x27;s why this is originally made for men only.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of reviews where people say it doesn&#x27;t work on heavy beards. I have to disagree. It&#x27;s possible that those users are missing a piece of info not on the instructions. You have to get the product down to the root of the hair. In other words, if you have a beard or longer hair in \\&quot;other\\&quot; places, you have to trim or lift the hair so that the product is right against the base of the hair. I know that it seems like smothering all the hair should work, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip number two, you have to keep it moist. The cornstarch in it dries out so you must spritz with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip number three, you have to scrape with a plastic card, some men i&#x27;ve seen on youtube use a dull butter knife. You go over each spot ONCE, against the hair grain. Rubbing it off with a washcloth can really irritate the skin IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it takes more than 4 minutes. You can leave it on up to 7. For my personal area I leave it on up to 9 minutes. I have very sensitive skin. Shaving my legs with a razor leaves horrible red bums and itchy, irritated skin. Bikini Wax? Forget it! The last one I&#x27;ll ever have, left me looking like a crime victim, with huge purple bumps and ingrown hair. This product CAN burn your skin, so rinse with clean water immediately following. If i&#x27;m doing my legs I use the magic shave and then jump right into the shower. BEst part of using Magic Shave, you can get all the weird angles without cutting yourself with the razor AND it has something in it to clear up ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not as strong as the powder, this is true, but the powder takes much longer due to the mixing process. If the cream isn&#x27;t working you might want to try the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My BF is a sensitive ginger with a curly beard. He started using the product 2 years ago on his neck and has never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you it works, but it&#x27;s worth looking at some video tutorials or online threads before trying it on yourself. The most comprehensive thread can be found by searching \\&quot;purse forum pain free hair removal\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!hensive thread can be found by searching \\&quot;purse forum pain free hair removal\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the powder version so i tried this one out. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to cut through my beard. Went back to powder.</li>
    <li> USED BY A WOMAN: I love this for my lady bits. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require me to fold myself in half to clean up my lady bits. The product does have a stronger smell to it when it is working and you do need to be generous with it but it definitely gets the job done and makes my life much easier. Oh and it saves me even more time in the shower because I can apply it shortly after getting in, take care of everything else and rinse it all off when it&#x27;s done! Definitely recommend for all women!</li>
    <li> I am a female and heard this works well for the bikini line. It didn&#x27;t do a great job and smelled the same as Nair or any other similar product.</li>
    <li> You guys changed the formula.  Before it was a smooth cream but now it&#x27;s either water coming out  or a gritty crystalized mess that doesn&#x27;t work as well in the past.  I have worked with is product for over ten years but with your formula change I&#x27;m afraid I must move on.  Before I go, I must say to all considering Magic Razorless products, DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
    <li> Tried this product after first reading reviews on amazon. Fortunately I came across the recommendation to let the solution stand for 6 minutes and use a butter knife to skim against the grain of the hair you are trying to remove. I did just that. Then I wiped my face of with a warm damp washcloth. Worked like a charm. My face is smooth and no razor bumps have popped up.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Left on for time directed (6-9 minutes) and nothing came off so I left it on longer (25 or so minutes) as advised by the comments. The product barely worked and left my neck blazing red and bleeding. I&#x27;m caucasian / white with thick facial that is prone to ingrown hair and was hoping this would help me. It didn&#x27;t. If you have thick cactus-like facial hair then this product will not work for you.</li>
    <li> What a dud. Follow directions to a t and used plenty of product. First squirt out to the tube was a cloudy water thick liquid. This was followed by a white cream. I slathered a thick layer on my beard and set timer for 4 minutes. Cleaned a small area off with a damp cloth per instructions and nothing happened. Waited it out for maximum of 7 minutes. Nothing. Whiskers still in mint condition. Sooo....cleaned this crap off, jumped in the shower and shaved with Creamo shave cream. That turned out to be the 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only result of this product was minor chemical burns on my neck and upper lip area.</li>
    <li> I was very happy this product arrived on time.  My son really likes this product it has a real strong odor but it really works for shaving bumps. When my son is happy that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I&#x27;d heard good things via the internet grapevine about this product.  I decided to try it, and I was pleasantly surprised.        The odor is pleasant, nothing like other hair removal creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, even as it&#x27;s &#x27;working&#x27;.  Application is simple, but it MUST be applied VERY generously.  You will have to &#x27;touch up&#x27; with a razor if you don&#x27;t apply it thickly and evenly.  I used this all over &#x27;down there&#x27; (not just bikini line), and I was pretty pleased with the results.  It removed the hair, and it didn&#x27;t burn or cause any irritation (and I have sensitive skin).  The only downside is that its effects last about as long as shaving.  It&#x27;s also kind of a pain to have to stand with your foot on the tub/toilet for 6-9 minutes.  I decided to use it once a week, as it also doesn&#x27;t seem as effective on very new regrowth.  But a nice thing is that the hair isn&#x27;t all jagged and pointy as it grows in, as it would be with shaving.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed any itching as the hair regrows, as I would with shaving.        My husband has also used it &#x27;down under&#x27;, and he liked the results as well.      So it&#x27;s got some upsides and downsides, but I much prefer it over the ingrown hairs, possibility of painful nicks, itchiness, and jagged regrowth of shaving.  And though (I&#x27;ve heard) it doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing, it&#x27;s PAIN FREE.  A perfect middle road, in my opinion.       I must give major kudos to the brave lady who decided to slap this on her privates for the good of womankind.</li>
    <li> Like a few others said, don&#x27;t bother if you&#x27;re a man with a thick beard.  I followed the directions closely and it made no noticeable difference on my chin where the hair is thickest.  I wish it would work because I can&#x27;t shave without getting bad ingrown hairs but I might as well be putting lotion on my face as this stuff.</li>
    <li> I will say right here and now that I did not use this for its intended use, which by the container says is beard removal. I&#x27;m a lady and read many reviews by other women that said it was a good product, and as I get razor rash I decided to give it a try. It does not cause a reaction on my incredibly sensitive skin so that was a great great thing. It works pretty well for legs, arms, facial hair, etc, but you need VERY thick layers of this stuff to remove a lot, and even then the job can come out patchy, so you might want to go over spots with a razor or tweezers. The other thing was that it truly smells awful. I got &amp;#34;scentless&amp;#34; and it was hard to take in the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty well, but the smell is hard to get past.</li>
    <li> I used it on my lower men&#x27;s region and it works ... No chemical smell and no stinging!  Used a wash cloth to remove the hair after 8 minutes.  It was very mild and easy to use.  No bad smells and no burning.</li>
    <li> The powder works great but don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I have sensitive skin and razors tend to leave bumps on my face and neck. The first time I tried it most of my facial hair was not removed. Plus, it smells like burnt hair after removing the cream. I have tried it three times with similar results. You can not even wash your face hours after using the product because it will burn.</li>
    <li> Think liquid so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the actual lotion stuff but it didn&#x27;t work at all, and had a burnt hair smell!</li>
    <li> i wish i could give this 0 stars! first off, im a female and wanted to use this on my bikini area. i read reviews that people said it worked. what it does do is break the hair at the surface of your skin leaving you with the illusion that the hair is gone, but when you touch it, its all rough and stubbly! i have gotten a closer shave with an old dull razor. if you are looking for the baby smooth feel after you just get done shaving, this is NOT the product for you!</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and this product did not work.  I used it for 5 days straight before giving up.  There were a couple days where it seemed to take away some hair, about 20% maybe, and shorten others, but no where near appearing to be a shave.  This product may work if you have a regular or thin beard, but did not work on my thick beard.  I am unaware of the ability of other products offered by this company, but this specific one did not work.</li>
    <li> I am a caucasion female but I use this instead of having to pay $50 to get a brazillian wax and it works great. I leave it on a few extra minutes but it totally takes off hair.  You have to goop it on pretty thick but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all so it&#x27;s not a problem. I do find that if you use soap straight after, then it burns a little bit so I use a washcloth to get it off and then wait a bit to shower so that the soap doesn&#x27;t sting. It smells like perm at a salon so not that fantastic but definitely a cheap solution to avoid expensive waxes (although waxing lasts longer.)</li>
    <li> smells like  rotten eggs.</li>
    <li> It sucks. I&#x27;m a guy with medium coarse beard and mustache and even if you &amp;#34;apply a good amount to cover completely&amp;#34; as the instruction says there will always be beard leftover. It gets about 75% of my beard after letting it sit for 6 mins. Even worse, I got more razor bumps than usual using this. The advertising of less razor bumps it&#x27;s useless. Then it said if there&#x27;s left over beard to wait 24 hours before applying again. I learned the hard way. Frustrated, after the first application didn&#x27;t get everything I re applied anyway because it said not to use a razor afterwards to get leftover hair. The second application caused sores that were bleeding and inflammation that hurt when touched or if wind blew on it. Now I see why they said don&#x27;t apply twice in a row. It&#x27;s a crap product. I had less razor bumps from a razor than this product and not to mention A Razor never burned my skin after two applications like this cream did.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff to use when shaving because you get no bumps on your face after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy for people who seem to get good value from this product, but apparently it simply does not work at all for some of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a caucasian male, and I tried to use it on my beard.  I have now tried it twice (plus the small \\&quot;test patch\\&quot; to make sure I&#x27;m not allergic to it).  As far as I can tell, neither attempt removed any hair at all.  I do not have a particularly thick or stiff beard; I&#x27;m just tired of shaving (and cutting, and scraping) my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and now I&#x27;m curious.  Is this product really only intended for other parts of the body, and I should have known that (wink wink)?  Are there different beard chemistries?  Do I need to be using three times as much product?  Enquiring minds want to know...</li>
    <li> I rather use this than shave due to ingrown hair problem.</li>
    <li> This is great for woman who are too scared to get a Brazilian wax like I am. Hair comes right off. My husband also used thi son his chest with great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the powder form of Magic shave since 2007 when I want to get a super close shave. I bought this cream crap, and it was a complete waste of money. I applied it and when it was time to wipe it off, it did not remove all of my unwanted hair off my face. In addition to that it burned my skin. I tried it again and used more cream the second time around and applied it faster to make the 4min mark as directed. It still left hair on my face and I still have minor burn marks. I will say if you want to use Magic shave, stick with the powder.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions, down to timing how long it was on the test area, and all this acheived was making me smell like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most people do, I waited a week and applied a thicker coating, let it stay on longer, and scrubbed it off. Nope. Just made my skin slightly more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, now i have 5oz of bad-smelling cream. No magic to be found here.</li>
    <li> an online group recommended this for hair removal &amp;#34;down south&amp;#34;... it does work well, but burns if youre not careful where you get it!  ouch!</li>
    <li> This along with the other variations of Magic Shave are all about the same - this is the review I wish I had read when I first started using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is 4 stars because it works but it smells and the instructions are wrong, test and try and see what works for you, this is what works for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some secrets to using this product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use MORE than you think you need. You want a thick layer covering the entire area for hair removal, Should be completely white... if you see dark spots you need to apply more to that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leave on for as long as needed (without burning yourself) I tried 4 minutes, it did nothing. I tried 10 minutes, removed some. I tried 15 minutes, removed most. I tried 20 minutes, removed almost all. Finally settled on 25 minutes and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-go PAST the hair line.  If you go only to the point where there is hair, there is likelyhood that you will miss spots and that is not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply to my neck area (where i get razor bumps)while that sits, I shave the rest of my face with shaving cream and a razor. At about 20-25 minutes I use an old credit card to remove the magic shave cream and use a wash cloth and shower to make sure all is removed.  Afterward I apply which ever razor bump ointment i&#x27;m using at the moment (which usually burns but I don&#x27;t feel right not doing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I can use a razor on my face and cream on my neck is a testament to this product.  Magic shave doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough that visually there isn&#x27;t much difference. I like the closeness of the razor which is why I like to use this &#x27;hybrid&#x27; method, but you must ensure you are not using the razor on the areas you use the magic shave and that there isn&#x27;t a &#x27;line of hair&#x27; in between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get over the idea of a &#x27;quick shave&#x27; and like the idea of a &#x27;close shave without razor bumps&#x27; I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember your skin might be more sensative than mine and these methods may not work... I only state what works for me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember your skin might be more sensative than mine and these methods may not work... I only state what works for me.</li>
    <li> This was for my son and he loves it and that all matters</li>
    <li> The old formula worked.  This stuff is a joke.</li>
    <li> First off, the fact this product is designed for non-Caucasians should be indicated on the front of the packaging. Instead, I found a small mention in fine print on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried applying the test portion and found it did not take off any hair, but also didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I true again the next day, applying a more generous portion, and let me just say... Owie! I wiped away the product with a hand towel to find my face bloodied up and chemically scorched. Just as the time before, very few hairs came off my face, but plenty of skin came off. Worse yet, I was left with a beet red, sporadically bearded face and my skin was in no condition to shave off the rest to even it out. Embarrassing. A full day later and my face is in extreme discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to call customer service but was instead connected to a \\&quot;free\\&quot; cruise timeshare scam operator instead of the actual company. Avoid at all costs! Unless...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I had read that the stuff worked well in the nether regions, so I slapped some on my crotchal region fearing the worst, but saw surprisingly effective and pain-free results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to burn the bush, so to speak, give it a try because that&#x27;s all this is good for. I, meanwhile, will walk around with a patchy red face and bald balls.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete scam. I followed the instructions and it does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I have this and the gold powder and I have been experimented with both.  The powder takes a few minutes to mix and it starts to dry on your face requiring you re-wet your to keep in from drying.  The cream is cold and easy to apply and unlike the powder it can stay on you face for some time a still remain soft but then again, it needs to stay on your face a lot longer than the time allotted in order to work.  The powder requires you to scrap off and the cream wipe off with a wet cloth.  Although not perfect, it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m assuming that most people bought this product online and didn&#x27;t see the small label that said \\&quot;Formulated for Black Men\\&quot;. The product is by no means intended to racially exclude non-blacks, the cream is specifically design for blacks for biological reasons. You&#x27;ll see a lot of low-star ratings from reviewers who are non-black which is understandable because their hair type and skin is different, so the results from the product will be more harsh on them. It worked for some non-blacks, but very few. I read that some of them used it on their genital areas.    ONTO the review. I got this product from Dollar General for $3.75, I was a little bit skeptical of buying products targeted towards black people because they usually seemed ineffective, or did less (or none) of what it says it can do.    I&#x27;m a 20 year Black male that suffered from extremely bad razor bumps, and bumps from clippers. I was literally in so much pain and itching. Even when I still attempted to shave, the hair kept growing on the bumps. This product is meant to burn off the hair, unlike clippers and razors that pushes the hair back in and is harsh on your skin. Here&#x27;s my method    1) I lathered about 2-3 coats of this on my face  2) Let it sit for 10 minutes, 4 minutes didn&#x27;t work for me (if it starts to itch or burn wash it off)  3) Wet my whole face  4) Wash it off with raw Ghana African soap  5) wipe off  6) optional : I used face lotion to soothe my previous razor bump irritation.    And what do you know?! It works! No dryness, no irritation. I literally stood in the mirror for over 2 minutes rubbing my hands across my neck and the side of my face. It leaves your face hairless, and smoothe. My face feels like it was 6 years ago (2008) when I was 14! I might be going through a quarter-life crisis which is why I enjoyed the after effects of this product. Makes you feel young, and look younger. I highly recommend this product to any black person suffering from the pain and ugliness of razor bumps.    Excuse my grammatical errors, I&#x27;m not the greatest writer.</li>
    <li> Bought this from my local pharmacy and tried it out today. Since my skin is rather tough, I decided to leave it on for 8 minutes rather than the recommended 4 minutes in the instructions, due to reading other reviews on numerous websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Face experienced light burning feeling, but no visible irritation. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to remove any of my stubbly beard. (I have a light beard that I can shave with a razor every other day, but am tired of the razor burn, which is why I tried this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Then decided what the hell and tried it on my nether regions. Seems to have removed some hair from the scrotum, with some burning discomfort, but again, no visible irritation (yeah, I looked in a mirror). As for around the top and sides of the penile shaft, it seemed to remove some stubble from trimming with an electric razor, but did not remove all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not interested in the mess from the powder version, so debating about using a stronger version of the premixed cream. Also, considering a tube of Formula 103, a more expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> Ok.. Ive used this product for awhile..  It comes in three different strengths and this particular one (Regular) is BY FAR the worst..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im an African American guy.. My beard hairs tend to be somewhat nappy so I struggle with ingrown hairs.. Razors usually mess my skin up after the first couple of days or so..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesnt go on very smoothly at all.. The smell of lye (used in perms and relaxers) in this one is REALLY pungent.. It&#x27;s awful, to me anyway.. and the bottle tells you not to use soap afterward, which sucks because that smell lingers on afterward.. like at least for a couple of hours.. Honestly I would use this cream at night before going to bed and then  wash your face the next morning.. After the time interval to wait for the \\&quot;magic\\&quot;, your hairs dont even come off cleanly either.. I found that in some areas all the came off but in others very little did.  So you pretty much have to be generous with the amount you put on your face, which given the odor is very unfortunate.  I use a blunt butterknife to slowly remove the cream and then a wash cloth to finish off.  Also the chemical effects kick in a bit early on this one, compared to the Mild and smooth versions.. By 6 or 7 minutes out I started to feel the slight burn.. This one really irritated my face later on after cleaning off all the applications..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The REAL value of using this comes after about a week or so, because I really did notice a substantial decrease in the amount of ingrown hairs I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on using Magic&#x27;s Razorless cream products for your beard, USE THE BALD SMOOTH (the brown colored tube) Hair removing cream.. It is way less abrasive, goes on a lot smoother, and after 10 minutes leaves you with the closest shave you could possibly have.  It smells too, although not as strong as the Regular one..  I found that one to be way more effective</li>
    <li> Well, by now after reading all the reviews by the other White Guys, it&#x27;s probably becoming quite comical that yet another White Guy tried this stuff with the same lack of success as the others. I too followed the directions exactly. Test spot, time limits and all I got was a hairy face and a lot of burning pain. No way am I going to expose my Joy Toys to this. As one of the other White Guys said, this is a great idea as I too am sick of scraping my face and trying to reach over my belly shave my boys. I&#x27;m sick of the bumps, nubs and ingrown hairs from shaving. I&#x27;m Italian and have very course hair and I really was hoping this product was going to work. I recommend the manufacturer put a White Guys Don&#x27;t Use warning on this product and then set out making a product for us. Are there any White Guys out there that have had better success with other manufacturers of razorless cream products that they would recommend?</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t give this product the lowest rating as i am not sure i gave it a complete chance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product smells really really bad (and i am not a chronic complainer. check my reviews)... can&#x27;t stress this enough. i can still smell it an hour after washing it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seems very harsh and didn&#x27;t remove stubble (i would only use this in lieu of any razor use, not as an adjunct). seemed like my skin was breaking out but half hour later it was fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe the off-label use is a good idea. you wouldn&#x27;t have to use it too often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; do most hair removers smell bad?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; hope this is the same exact product i bot... it is same family for sure</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It works. I would give it 5 stars but there is a learning curve, which can be a bit painful. I decided to give it a try since I have an uncle who&#x27;s used magic shave powder for over 50 years, and my step dad using it for decades. I tried the smooth version on my face but that&#x27;s a bit too strong. The smooth version works better on my bald head. My routine is as follows: I put it on my face with my fingers, let it sit for 7 minutes, then start taking it off with an old credit card with small quick swipes being careful to not dig too deeply in my skin. Normally I swipe with the grain but sometimes against or even across the grain. When I&#x27;m done with the credit card I then wipe my face with a warm damp towel. This takes off the rest. I don&#x27;t feel any pain, just a bit of a tingle....and the key point - NO BUMPS!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to save me some shaving time, and thought this would work.&lt;br /&gt;I am white Caucasion, with rregular beard growth. Not heavy, but I need to shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product before taking a shower so I could be sure to remove all the product.&lt;br /&gt;I let it work for 6 min, wiped it off and there was all my beard still happily on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Next day I tried 9 minutes, same effect..beard still there.&lt;br /&gt;The last try I did in the morning, for 7 minutes and the results were the same, except i didnt shower after.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG MOVE, even though I rinsed my face well, it began to burn and i was forced to shower to get the stuff off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> Even though i didn&#x27;t like da smell it still works very well</li>
    <li> This product got rid of some of my hair. However, my face is now swollen and bright red. For a short period before putting on lotion my face was also bleeding. Had hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> Made for African American men, but with my curly hair I have trouble shaving with a regular razor. This is fantastic and reducing razor bumps and acne after shaving.</li>
    <li> the first time I ordered razor less cream  shave I received &amp;#34;improved 4 minute cream shave&amp;#34; which is a good product. I then reordered only to receive &amp;#34;regular cream shave&amp;#34; which is weaker and takes longer to work. Please make it possible to choose when ordering.</li>
    <li> This my 5th time using this product and love it. I use it under my arms, under my chin, and I&#x27;ve also used it on the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; areas lol if you can read in between the lines. Even the tennis balls hahaha it will leave a cool sensation just saying</li>
    <li> But it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I&#x27;m a [[ASIN:B0048ZIFA0 Magic Shave Shaving Powder Gold - 4.5 oz]] user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to take a business trip and didn&#x27;t want TSA groping me after assuming it was cocaine or something (the powder looks a LOT like illicit drugs, unfortunately).  The canister also was not very X-ray friendly.  I was going to buy some after I arrived at the destination, but because the powder works so well, you really only need to use it like every 2-3 days or so, which would have been a waste to sit there mixing so much for so brief a trip.  So I got the cream, figuring it&#x27;d be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the instructions tell you to apply it thick.  But the cream is so watery that it just didn&#x27;t want to apply like that at all.  Not for nothing, because even with what it did apply, I got some removal.  Nowhere near what the powder did with the same instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is that it burned the living (blank) out of my neckline just below my beard line, where the bend is when you look down.  And yes, I used a pre-shave, and no, I didn&#x27;t wash my face before hand.  A red, swollen line right across.  It looked like I&#x27;d been hanged - and being African American that&#x27;s not a look you want to go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I had no redness or burning anywhere on my beard area.  I&#x27;m not sure why there was this reaction, the area in question was constantly exposed to the powder version with no ill effects.  I&#x27;m thinking it was the crease itself that the cream just overreacted to, though I&#x27;m not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on the first hand, it didn&#x27;t really work that good, and on the second it burned the living (blank) out of me.  (thanks to a post shave balm, the redness did go down after 2 days or so).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate to get something - anything - to alleviate the horrible irritation (razor bumps, ingrown hairs, frequent nicks and cuts even after following all of the &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; that exist everywhere) of shaving and heard about depilatory creams like this. My wife&#x27;s step-father used to use this, and said it worked well. My experience, however, was not so good. In fact, it&#x27;s actually *worse* than just scraping my face with a dull razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this not remove or even soften a single hair, it burned my skin and made it dry and flaky about 4 minutes after complete and thorough removal of the product, following the directions of course. In fact, along with my now dry and painful skin (which isn&#x27;t red, strangely) my facial hair seems to have only gotten more prominent and coarse. I highly recommend not using this product.</li>
    <li> Works well even for women! I use it in place of nair and it works really well. I left it on a little longer then suggested and scraped off with a old credit card. Smooth and perfect. Seller sent me the wrong version so I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;bald head&amp;#34; one.</li>
    <li> Works a little, but not to the degree a razor would (from my experience at least) so i don&#x27;t use it all too often</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Black male who suffers from ingrown hair when I shave. I have been using Magic Shave for years for a close shave without the razor bumps. I like the new Magic because it removes my beard in less time than the previous mix. The product clearly states that it is designed for Black men, so I&#x27;m not sure what results White users were looking for. If you don&#x27;t suffer from razor bumps, the product isn&#x27;t targeting you. The new mix does have a bit of a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; that takes some getting used to, but it does the job WITH a pleasant almost minty scent.</li>
    <li> I can only give this a neutral review, despite what it did to me, &amp; 3 stars means just that, I can&#x27;t call it good or bad. I didn&#x27;t read the label closely enough for my own good - made FOR COARSE BEARDS ON BLACK MEN. I am white and genetic male. My boyfriend had it sitting around in the bathroom though he hasn&#x27;t used it in a long time. He even told me how it had given him a body rash for a month. So I slap some on my underarm areas and figure i&#x27;ll let it work its magic while i shave my legs. Had it on only there for somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes leading up to showering. Yes, absolutely smooth finish. After 2 or 3 days, this rash took hold and has spread to my whole body, save for below the belt to my upper thighs. Several trips to the drug store and sleepless nights later, I am still scratching alot. Cortizone cream, benadryl pills, aloe vera gel str8 outta the fridge, showers, wash cloths, etc.... This is miserable !!! Only want to share this so others don&#x27;t suffer same as I am. I&#x27;ll stick to the razor on my face, thank you. By the way, I have fair complexion and am in my mid-40&#x27;s. Hope others will learn from my mistake. READ THE LABEL, INSTRUCTIONS, &amp; CAUTION STATEMENT B4 USING. The CAUTION area should be printed larger than it is.  Hope my rash doesn&#x27;t last as long as his did.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review, but I have nothing negative to say about this product(so far).  I applied it and went to watch tv for lack of nothing to do for 9-10 minutes. When it was done, I rinsed off all the cream and scrubbed all the hair out in the shower. Not only did it remove all the thick, coarse hair down there, but it left my skin extremely soft which is great. I never realized how soft my skin can get and I love it. No irritation, and my skin is still soft (16 hrs after application).&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing(totally my fault) is that I mistakenly got the cream on the sensitive skin, so it burns slightly, nothing unbearable. I&#x27;m just so happy with this product, and I&#x27;m glad I found it. Oh and it smells really badly kind of like really strong fart.</li>
    <li> Normally I would give this a 5 star review, however this time it&#x27;s a 1. As I was putting the cream on I felt hard chunks. My tube is full of plastic mixed in with the cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I ran out and used some Nair in a pinch and it sloughed off layers of skin. Ouch! This stuff is a bit stinky, but it does the job, wherever you have hair! It is great to use if you have been keeping warm all winter, LOL! One tip-do not wipe this off before 6 minutes....you will have a mess, half-melted hair, and you can&#x27;t re-apply for 24 hours. Don&#x27;t worry about whether or not it is working.....it is!</li>
    <li> Left on for 9 minutes. Once it was off I still had most (if not all) of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;But I had an uncomfortable burning face for about 20 minutes afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. Burned my face and did nothing to my beard. Had to be get out the razor to finish the job. I will be filling a complaint with the FDA.</li>
    <li> I tried this to get a smoother shave.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  My first attempt, I left it on for the full nine minutes. After scrubbing it off with a washcloth, I found that it hadn&#x27;t removed 95% of the hair on my face. I tried again the following day with the same results. It&#x27;s useless but at least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Thinking that with repeated use it might get better, I have continued to work with this product. This is what I have discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a smoother shave than with a razor alone if I apply this product, leave it on for 10 - 12 minutes, then use a Gillette fusion razor with a new blade cartridge to remove the product just as if the product were regular shaving cream. The shave does NOT last longer, though so I still must shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the point?  For those special occasions, I do get a smoother shave than normal. Not sure it is worth the trouble or expense, though.  I did bump my review up to 2 stars though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing this product, I have switched to an old fashioned safety razor.  Shaves are close, ingrown hairs and razor burn are a thing of the past.  I&#x27;ll pass on this product in favor of an old fashioned solution.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t review much. But, this product has revolutionized my life. Back story, I&#x27;m a white guy from Montana. My skin is pretty sensitive and hates me when I shave (if my face had it&#x27;s way I&#x27;d always have a full beard). I&#x27;ve tried lots of different things to help prevent razor burn and ingrown hairs to no avail. Enter Magic Razorless Cream Shave... I read all the reviews, searched the internet, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. No one seemed to say that it caused serious bodily injury (even the women using it in oh-so-sensitive areas), and for the price why not. Well, if you read reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work, they probably didn&#x27;t do something right. You have to remember that this product is made for stubble. If the hair you want to remove is longer than stubble, it&#x27;s going to be spotty. Best advice, buy a beard trimmer or something similar and take the hair as far down as possible before trying this stuff, then it will probably work great (well maybe great for a $2-5 product). It didn&#x27;t irritate my face, didn&#x27;t dry out my face, and I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs since using it. Would I say that it works 100% of the time, no. But for the price and for something that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I used the red magic powder once, and it burned my face really bad. Therefore, I was skeptical and apprehensive when I used this cream for the first time yesterday. On the one hand, I was scared of putting my face through hell again; on the other hand, I doubted that the cream would remove any of my coarse yet slow-growing beard. Having previously used another razorless cream that was utterly ineffective, I decided to leave this cream on my face until the onset of discomfort to increase the odds. Well, guess what? It stayed on my face for almost 30 minutes, and I felt absolutely no discomfort. Then I vigorously rubbed the area with a wet microfiber towel to remove the cream and the &#x27;melted&#x27; hair. The result? It worked! It gave me a close and smooth shave with no irritation whatsoever. And I have sensitive skin! As I write this review 24 hours later, I still have no irritation, and my face feels smooth and exfoliated. To summarize, my success factors were #1: I left the cream on my face for almost 30 minutes; #2: I re-wetted my face with wet fingers whenever I felt the cream was drying up; and #3: I vigorously rubbed the hair off with a towel at the end. My shave would have been less smooth and more uneven if I hadn&#x27;t rubbed the hair off with a towel, going over my face a few times until there was no beard/mustache left.</li>
