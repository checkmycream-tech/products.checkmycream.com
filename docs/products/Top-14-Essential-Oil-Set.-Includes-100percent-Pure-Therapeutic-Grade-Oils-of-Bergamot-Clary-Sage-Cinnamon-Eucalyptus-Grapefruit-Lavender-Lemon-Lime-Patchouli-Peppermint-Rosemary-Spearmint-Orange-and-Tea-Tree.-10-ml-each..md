      <li>fantastic,,,love love it,,,will order again</li>
      <li>Buying the package seemed the best value, rather than purchasing individually.  </li>
      <li>Still learning but enjoying my attempts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and am so pleased with Plant Therapy EO quality.  </li>
      <li>They are a fantastic company!  </li>
      <li>I bought these because I had run out of many of my staple essential oils and figured a mix pack would be the best bang for my buck.</li>
      <li>As I learn more uses, I will update.  </li>
      <li>High quality at great prices.  </li>
      <li>When I found these I decided to take a chance and order them since the reviews were pretty good.</li>
      <li>I love that each bottle is labeled with what that particular oil is good for - anxiety, energy, headaches, etc.  </li>
      <li>and so far, they&#x27;re great.</li>
      <li>The internet is a great resource for all the uses of essential oils and there are many books out there too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are also quite strong.</li>
      <li>They have the name of the oils on the top of caps and a description of oil uses on the bottle&#x27;s label, too cool.  </li>
      <li>I took one out to smell it, and could tell it was nice and pure.</li>
      <li>also would like to mention the wonderful combinations that can be made from this little set.  </li>
      <li>It contains some of the most popular and frequently used oils.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge savings if you compare buying these as separates.</li>
      <li>These are great essential oils.  </li>
      <li>These oils do not smell cheap like some do.</li>
      <li>This assortment has several oils that smell great.  </li>
      <li>fault I bought because it was cheap</li>
      <li>I think this is an excellent starter set, if like me, you are new to essential oils and eager to learn their uses.</li>
      <li>This company is pretty reputable for their quality</li>
      <li>She is excited about using them instead of OTC medicines and remedies.</li>
      <li>I had all but given up on scented things until i got into essential oils and now we, and our house smell amazing :)</li>
      <li>oils are every bit as much comparable to the oils I already had from the those other two companies - and I WILL be buying from Plant Therapy EOs again - thank you for a great product!</li>
      <li>These smelled true to me.</li>
      <li>Good quality essential oils all in one box!!  </li>
      <li>sure you google what oils are safe to be applied directly to skin and which need to be diluted first.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the assortment of essential oils in this package, as I am just learning.  </li>
      <li>This is good because you do not need more than a few drops, but you must use caution!</li>
      <li>They are very pure &amp; true to scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is defintely worth it.</li>
      <li>Oils are fresh, well-sealed and store well in their box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, if it is cheaper to get the kit than to get just the oils out of the kit that you want, it&#x27;s worth going bulk.</li>
      <li>No guessing which bottle is which in my cases, the names are right on the cap,</li>
      <li>Every scent is right on.</li>
      <li>Great kit of oils people use essential oils somewhat regularly...</li>
      <li>I have definitely used the lavendar oil most often.  </li>
      <li>About a week after getting the set, my son splashed some hot oil from a pan on both of us.</li>
      <li>A 1/4 THE COST, GET REAL!</li>
      <li>Putting the peppermint and bergamot oils in coconut oil makes a nice rub for headaches and other aches and pains.  </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied, but do take this opinion as coming from someone that doesn&#x27;t know much about essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give it a go because of the positive reviews.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I store my oils in a bamboo box and can only see the tops of them and it  makes it easy for me to know what I&#x27;m grabbing.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at first by how many drops (of the grapefruit especially)</li>
      <li>I still didn&#x27;t think they would be very high quality, because of the price.</li>
      <li>I put just one drop of each of the peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary, and lemon in the water of the diffuser and it fills the air; everyone loves it and says that it really helps.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about them, but am learning a bit.  </li>
      <li>It is makes using them really convenient.</li>
      <li>15 drops lemon, 10 drops each eucalyptus, rosemary, cinnamon and 5 or 6 whole cloves.  </li>
      <li>I have been slowly trying to build my own collection, but haven&#x27;t found the right brand for me.</li>
      <li>they do not aggravate my husband&#x27;s sensitive allergies or my sensitive skin like most commercial products do.</li>
      <li>This is a good starter set if you&#x27;re looking to start working with essential oils, though I&#x27;ve found there are a few scents in the box that even after a year I have never used.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time purchasing pure essential oils, but my mother has been using them for a while now</li>
      <li>My son is on many medicines for seizures, and I thought I would try essential oils to see if they would help in addition to his prescription meds.  </li>
      <li>What a fantastic set of oils, especially for anyone just starting out using EOs.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything that can&#x27;t be made better with a little oil!</li>
      <li>Be sure to disperse the oil in some kind of carrier, and a little goes a long way (another indicator that these are not cheap oils).</li>
      <li>Also can be used as a household cleaner when mixed with vinegar and hot water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad someone put this together in one small set for newbies.</li>
      <li>These are nice smelling, but overall pretty weak in the odor intensity department.</li>
      <li>The product info says: &amp;#34;100% Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil-</li>
      <li>and I can definitely tell that these oils are the real deal.</li>
      <li>So far, I have used them to help with my family&#x27;s congested noses from allergies, and to make rubs for aches and pains.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate descriptions and uses on the back of each bottle</li>
      <li>I searched quite a bit before selecting this assortment and found it to include the best-of-the-best; meaning these seem to be the most commonly used oils.  </li>
      <li>In order to test that, I tried to see how viscous the patchouli was, and it poured of the bottle really quickly, which is highly suspect given that patchouli is known for being hard to get out of a bottle with its high viscosity.</li>
      <li>far I have used these: in a diffuser; in homemade lotions, oils, and body scrubs; in bath water; in homemade laundry detergents and fabric softeners; as a substitute for VapoRub and BioFreeze; as air fresheners; and in cleaning products.&lt;br /&gt;I have found ZERO difference between these and brands such as DoTerra and Young Living except a much lower price, and no pressure to become a local distributor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I am just starting out in essential oils, but so far I really like this set.  </li>
      <li>Nice packaging, in nifty little box with cotton batting to protect the little bottles.  </li>
      <li>I am new to essential oils and wanted to buy an assortment that included Clary Sage, which this set does.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suspect that these oils are diluted in at least some amount of a carrier oil based on the strength of the odor.</li>
      <li>I grew up with a mother who is every big on natural healing and essential oils.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been involved with EOs for over a decade (with the top two multi-level marketing EO companies) and was always afraid to try anything else - until I spoke with a certified aromatherapist - he advised finding a supplier who sells 100% pure oils as the United States has no governing body regarding &amp;#34;certifying&amp;#34; essential oils at this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the oils are great,,,they are fantastic,,,love love it,,,will order again</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the assortment of essential oils in this package, as I am just learning.  I searched quite a bit before selecting this assortment and found it to include the best-of-the-best; meaning these seem to be the most commonly used oils.  I also read other peoples&#x27; reviews and found that Plant Therapy is a trusted brand.  Buying the package seemed the best value, rather than purchasing individually.  I purchased a diffuser and have been experimenting with each of these oils.  I set the diffuser timer for 2 hrs when I go to bed and enjoy the beautiful and calming effect as I drift off.</li>
    <li> Because these are relatively inexpensive, I was hesitant to buy them as I wondered about the quality. I decided to give it a go because of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used these: in a diffuser; in homemade lotions, oils, and body scrubs; in bath water; in homemade laundry detergents and fabric softeners; as a substitute for VapoRub and BioFreeze; as air fresheners; and in cleaning products.&lt;br /&gt;I have found ZERO difference between these and brands such as DoTerra and Young Living except a much lower price, and no pressure to become a local distributor.&lt;br /&gt;This set is packaged well, and a great starter set. I think it would also make a great gift because the box is cute.&lt;br /&gt; The oils smell fresh and appealing and best of all they do not aggravate my husband&#x27;s sensitive allergies or my sensitive skin like most commercial products do. I had all but given up on scented things until i got into essential oils and now we, and our house smell amazing :)&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you google what oils are safe to be applied directly to skin and which need to be diluted first. The internet is a great resource for all the uses of essential oils and there are many books out there too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering from this company again and I&#x27;m so glad I now know I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune for quality product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Love them all! I really appreciate descriptions and uses on the back of each bottle</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy Oils!  High quality at great prices.  This makes a great starter kit for your collection.  It contains some of the most popular and frequently used oils.  I love that they are labelled on the top of the lid too.  I store my oils in a bamboo box and can only see the tops of them and it  makes it easy for me to know what I&#x27;m grabbing.</li>
    <li> Since two of my best friends sell and swear by DoTerra, I hope they never stumble across this review...&lt;br /&gt;I love these oils! They work just as well as Doterra and I find myself finding any excuse to use them...from relieving allergies, to cleaning, to helping with cramps...I can&#x27;t think of anything that can&#x27;t be made better with a little oil!</li>
    <li> I grew up with a mother who is every big on natural healing and essential oils. Anytime I had a headache she would make me put peppermint oil on my forehead instead of using something like ibuprofen. I thought it was annoying, but eventually realized how amazing oils really are. I have been slowly trying to build my own collection, but haven&#x27;t found the right brand for me. When I found these I decided to take a chance and order them since the reviews were pretty good. I still didn&#x27;t think they would be very high quality, because of the price. When they showed up they were neatly packaged in the box shown in the picture on here. I took one out to smell it, and could tell it was nice and pure. I am very happy with these, and i think it is an amazing deal. Plus I think this is a great mix of oils, and perfect for someone just getting into oils.</li>
    <li> These are great essential oils.  I am very happy with my purchase.  They are nicely labeled and packaged.  I bought them to use in a diffuser and in rubbing oils.  So far, I have used them to help with my family&#x27;s congested noses from allergies, and to make rubs for aches and pains.  I put just one drop of each of the peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary, and lemon in the water of the diffuser and it fills the air; everyone loves it and says that it really helps.  Putting the peppermint and bergamot oils in coconut oil makes a nice rub for headaches and other aches and pains.  Each of the oils smells wonderful and pure.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This has all the basics. I only wish they made another box of different oils to complement this one.  Oils are fresh, well-sealed and store well in their box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is defintely worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had run out of many of my staple essential oils and figured a mix pack would be the best bang for my buck. These are nice smelling, but overall pretty weak in the odor intensity department. I was really surprised at first by how many drops (of the grapefruit especially) I needed to add in order to even smell it in a blend. I strongly suspect that these oils are diluted in at least some amount of a carrier oil based on the strength of the odor. In order to test that, I tried to see how viscous the patchouli was, and it poured of the bottle really quickly, which is highly suspect given that patchouli is known for being hard to get out of a bottle with its high viscosity. The product info says: &amp;#34;100% Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- no fillers, additives, bases or carriers added.&amp;#34; There is absolutely no way that undiluted patchouli oil would be as runny as I just observed it to be without the addition of a carrier or filler oil. They are clearly falsely advertising.</li>
    <li> I did research after the fact and found that if it is only for external use it is not a pure product.&lt;br /&gt;My fault I bought because it was cheap</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH THE PRICE! I BOUGHT THE SAME STUFF AT WALMART A 1/4 THE COST, GET REAL!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my essential oils. Thank you</li>
    <li> This set is what my wife wanted and after lots of research I found this with almost all her oils she wanted! She is excited about using them instead of OTC medicines and remedies. I&#x27;m glad someone put this together in one small set for newbies. I will be getting more to add to my wife&#x27;s&#x27; &amp;#34;medicine cabinet&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This is a good starter set if you&#x27;re looking to start working with essential oils, though I&#x27;ve found there are a few scents in the box that even after a year I have never used. Still, if it is cheaper to get the kit than to get just the oils out of the kit that you want, it&#x27;s worth going bulk.</li>
    <li> I am just starting out in essential oils, but so far I really like this set.  It is the &amp;#34;basics&amp;#34; that everyone getting started should have.  I have definitely used the lavendar oil most often.  About a week after getting the set, my son splashed some hot oil from a pan on both of us. I applied lavendar oil to his burn and mine, not only did it take the sting out of the burns, the burn on his arm did not blister.  Since then I have used peppermint oil when he was suffering from nausea and vomiting (flu) and I have used the lavendar oil for a sunburn. No peeling and almost immediate relief of pain.  I am sure there is so much more I could be doing.  As I learn more uses, I will update.  The oils seem to be excellent quality. They are therapeutic grade.  I think this is an excellent starter set, if like me, you are new to essential oils and eager to learn their uses.</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils and wanted to buy an assortment that included Clary Sage, which this set does.  I don&#x27;t know much about them, but am learning a bit.  This assortment has several oils that smell great.  I am completely satisfied, but do take this opinion as coming from someone that doesn&#x27;t know much about essential oils.  BTW, I wanted the clary sage as I read that it could help with seizures.  My son is on many medicines for seizures, and I thought I would try essential oils to see if they would help in addition to his prescription meds.  So far, his seizures have not been helped, but he does like to have the spearmint or peppermint rubbed on his tummy with some grapeseed oil.  I like it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/20/12:  I love that each bottle is labeled with what that particular oil is good for - anxiety, energy, headaches, etc.  It is makes using them really convenient.</li>
    <li> Great kit of oils people use essential oils somewhat regularly... least according to this newbie. Still learning but enjoying my attempts.</li>
    <li> Every scent is right on. They are very pure &amp; true to scent. I feel good about inhaling the purest, grade A oils out there. I&#x27;m afraid to try anything less!</li>
    <li> with EOs, one must be careful, there are a lot of unscrupulous sellers out there - I&#x27;ve been involved with EOs for over a decade (with the top two multi-level marketing EO companies) and was always afraid to try anything else - until I spoke with a certified aromatherapist - he advised finding a supplier who sells 100% pure oils as the United States has no governing body regarding &amp;#34;certifying&amp;#34; essential oils at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these oils are every bit as much comparable to the oils I already had from the those other two companies - and I WILL be buying from Plant Therapy EOs again - thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I am not an essential oil expert, but I have been using essential oils for 15 years now. These oils do not smell cheap like some do. Some oils smell fake, and some can smell old too. These smelled true to me. They are also quite strong. This is good because you do not need more than a few drops, but you must use caution! Be sure to disperse the oil in some kind of carrier, and a little goes a long way (another indicator that these are not cheap oils).</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oils all in one box!!  Nice packaging, in nifty little box with cotton batting to protect the little bottles.  Great deal!!&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to mention the wonderful combinations that can be made from this little set.  For example, when you have a cold, try warming Thieves Oil blend in an oil burner with a little sweet almond oil as a carrier.  Thieves Oil Blend:  15 drops lemon, 10 drops each eucalyptus, rosemary, cinnamon and 5 or 6 whole cloves.  Allow to sit for at least 24 hours.  I don&#x27;t know if claims are true that it cures a cold or virus, but I know from experience it clears the sinuses and soothes sinus headaches!!  Also can be used as a household cleaner when mixed with vinegar and hot water.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic set of oils, especially for anyone just starting out using EOs.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and am so pleased with Plant Therapy EO quality.  They have the name of the oils on the top of caps and a description of oil uses on the bottle&#x27;s label, too cool.  I find it so helpful to have these features.  No guessing which bottle is which in my cases, the names are right on the cap, and I didn&#x27;t have to buy separate labels to make it so.  They are a fantastic company!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome. It&#x27;s my first time purchasing pure essential oils, but my mother has been using them for a while now and even she approved! I&#x27;ve been using them daily since I bought them and so far, they&#x27;re great. This company is pretty reputable for their quality and I can definitely tell that these oils are the real deal. The price is unbeatable. It&#x27;s a huge savings if you compare buying these as separates. With essential oils, a little goes a long way. So even though they appear to be small, I have a feeling it will be a while before any of them are empty!</li>
