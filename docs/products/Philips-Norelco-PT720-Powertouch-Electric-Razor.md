<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As stated. had to return it. I like the design. But it was nicking all over my face(no blood but little fine lines/cuts all over). yet there was still stubble.</li>
    <li> I miss having the comb attachment on this razor, otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity through Amazon Vine to review two of Norelco&#x27;s lower to mid-range electric shavers - this one (the PT720) and the PT730. At first glance, they seem to be identical except for color, the pop-up trimmer on the PT730, and the $20 price difference at this writing. However, upon use I find that there is indeed a difference in the way they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers allow you to use them corded or cordless and both shavers can be rinsed clean under water. (You could actually use these razors in the shower, but rotary shavers perform better on a dry beard.) Both shavers feature the same, replaceable, flexing heads - which are amazing in their ability to follow the curves of your face while giving you a close shave. Both shavers last about 40 minutes on a single charge and both have an indicator light for battery status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences are that this shaver features Comfort Cut, which gives a gentler shave, and lacks the pop-up trimmer. The PT730 features Super Lift &amp; Cut (which picks up longer hairs and shaves them smoothly), DualPrecision (which lets you shave even the shortest stubble cleanly), and a pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying both on my husband and sons, I found that for my husband, who has a heavy beard, the PT730 gave him a closer shave than this shaver on his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. For one son, who is in college and shaves infrequently, the PT730 picked up the long, scraggly hairs much, much better than this shaver. However, for another son with a heavy beard but very sensitive skin, this shaver was much more comfortable and he said he would ONLY use this one. I was shocked to see such a big difference because the two shavers really do look identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is just one press of a button and the head pops open. Then you can rinse the whole thing under the tap! Very easy and convenient. Norelco recommends replacing the head every 12 months for optimum performance. Also included is a little cleaning brush anda plastic head cover to protect the heads between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and are looking for a mid-priced, electric, rotary-style shaver without a lot of whistles and bells, this shaver is worthy of consideration.</li>
    <li> I have long been a fan of the Norelco shavers, but this one is a bit disappointing.  While it still has the familiar three shaving rotors, it does not have the pop up trimmer which was great for getting into hard to shave areas (like under the nose and around the ears).  It was a great price, but I should have read the description before I ordered.  My bad.</li>
    <li> The old Norelco shaver this new one replaced shaved closer and the battery charge lasted 4  times longer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The razor is significantly better than my old Norelco and I appreciate the nice, smooth shave that it gives me.  It holds a charge for many weeks.  It is comfortable to hold while shaving.  I have had other razors that just did not fit in my hand very well.  Easy to clean and care for.  Thanks Norelco and Amazon for the great razor at a very nice price.</li>
    <li> when you register this product online, they give you extra time towards the already two year warranty on the product.  You can wash the shaver head under water to clean it and it&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
    <li> I have used other razors before, some were not Norelco, and I think this does the best job of all for me. My other Norelco lasted me a long time. more than 6 years. I think that is why I trust this will last just as long.</li>
    <li> quick easy clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perfect  for everyday or once a week.  good price straight forward no problems at all .  easy to clean</li>
    <li> very noisy had philips before not like this.its a real basic model the battery does hold the charge well so thats a plus</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order this again. Not oly is it noisy as heck but it doesn&#x27;t give a nice, close shave as my other Norelcos have. Guess you get what you pay for, eh? This was cheap. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of electric razors and have never owned one that I thought worked well. I bought this one because it was cheap and I had to have something to use while recovering from rotator cuff surgery. I turned it on the first time and thought it was the most anemic sounding thing I have ever heard. However, it gives a great shave!! It is by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned. I should have spent the 10 bucks more for a pop up trimmer..</li>
    <li> A very nice gift for father. It feels good when using, and convenient for cleaning. It charges very quick, around half an hour, and can be used over weeks.</li>
    <li> great close shave non irritation leaves my face feeling soft and smooth with out bumps and cuts,,,&lt;br /&gt;i like this shaver more then my 300$ Panasonic that supposedly is topp of the line</li>
    <li> works well... so far. one charge lasts a long while, which is nice! it was a good purchase, and would recommend it</li>
    <li> Still using it with over two years of shavings I haven&#x27;t needed to change anything.</li>
    <li> If you have a teen like mine, sometimes things like iPods, cell phones, etc. fall into the sink or worse places ... which end up costing quite a bit to replace. With this wonderful shaver being a little more water-proof, you will have no worries. In fact, you can fully rinse it after use without worrying about causing harm. The instructions suggest 3 weeks of usage before your face adjusts to it and you get a close shave. However, we noticed a difference in just a weeks time. My teen suffers from a skin condition that makes him extremely sensitive. Generally, you&#x27;ll see a lot of redness after shaving - dry shave or not. So far, no redness with this new razor. The razor lists for just under $50 on Amazon. The razor it replaced was $30 and not as impressive, or waterproof. It was also a Norelco. Between the two, this one is definitely the better deal despite the $20 difference. We are happy with the results and hope that this Norelco continues to work well into our son&#x27;s adult life.</li>
    <li> This razor takes about five minutes of focused effort to (mostly) clean my face of stubble. I have very fine hair. Usually, I end up needing to run a razor over my face to get a few strays that are missed. If this is in my bag, I use it for a pre-shave after going a few days without. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need an extremely close and precise shave. This particular model lacks the sideburn/mustache trimmer that pops out on more expensive units.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job, without the frills. I enjoy the washable feature. I just rinse the shaver off when emptying the \\&quot;clippings\\&quot;, and get a fresh, clean razor every day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to loose much power as it goes through the charge cycle. Nice and functional. Good, close shave.</li>
    <li> works great. these only last a few years though.</li>
    <li> Portable and works great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this product was missing a trimmer, but it ended up to be a very good product anyway.</li>
    <li> works great going to buy 1 for friend</li>
    <li> easy to wash, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> My two sons didn&#x27;t care for the Philips Norelco shavers I sent them, but I thought I would test one for myself. I have to agree with their criticisms: the shaver just isn&#x27;t up to the challenge of anything but very fine, very short hair. It has a hard time with coarser, thick hair and if you have more just a short stubble, you&#x27;re in for a long, irritating shave. Do not try it if you are running late for work. I thought I could use it occasionally on my legs and underarms (I&#x27;m a woman) but it seems completely unsuited for larger areas. I would explore other brands before I give up completely on an electric shaver, but not another Norelco product.</li>
    <li> I needed a basic razor shaver and stumbled upon this one.  It&#x27;s perfect and doesn&#x27;t burn or cut whenever I use it.  It leaves a nice smooth shave.  It&#x27;s easily cleanable when you&#x27;re done and slips right back into the box comfortably.  There isn&#x27;t much to say except I&#x27;m happy with this and will continue to use it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I owned a previous norelco triple head. Gave me a nice shave for a couple of years. This one is a waist of time shaving. Cant even tell I have shaved. Not a close shave at all.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a replacement for an existing razor. It was a wash for the purchase. Buy a new unit or a set of replacement blades. I chose to purchase a new unit. Good performance at a fair price. Would purchase another razor from the same company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with this Norelco PT720. It does a decent job providing a close and thorough shave. If I had it to do over, I might have selected the 730, as it has a pop-up trimmer. A nice feature, and probably worth the extra couple of bucks spent.  Previously I had a razor where the three blades and the primary head all tilted. It was a bit of a wobbly mess, and didn&#x27;t seem to shave as nice as this razor. The fact that just the individual blade heads pivot seems to provide me with a cleaner shave. I do like the fact that its rechargeable, though I typically leave the razor plugged in. And while I haven&#x27;t tried washing it out under the faucet, its nice to know it is an option.  Cosmetically the PT720 is a good looking razor. Its not going to be the primary reason that anyone buys it. That said, the blue, silver, and black color scheme is pretty sharp. At the end of the day, if you&#x27;re in the market you could do a lot worse that this Norelco. Or spring for the next model up to get the pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and can say it&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  It shaves fairly well.  in terms of battery life, I charged it overnight the day i got it and it&#x27;s still going.  However, i dont&#x27; use it everyday.  Anyways, i keep this one in my office.</li>
    <li> My other half has been using electric razors (predominantly Norelco) for approximately 20 years, so this review isn&#x27;t about electric vs. blade as much as Norelco vs. Norelco. With this in mind, this model shaves as well as the Norelco 7810XL, which this current series replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep this short and to the point, let&#x27;s just say that it does everything the product description says and I&#x27;ll simply highlight the good bits (as reported by the resident expert)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly redesigned body fits comfortably in the hand. In addition, this version uses a Comfortcut shaving system which feels slightly gentler on the skin than the lift and cut system of the older model. The best feature of the PT720 is the Battery Low/Full indicator. You now have an advance warning system for when the razor is about to conk out, as compared to the old system which often quit unceremoniously with half the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint about this model is the lack of the invaluable pop-up trimmer, which you&#x27;ll need if you&#x27;re not in the habit of shaving thisclose. So, if you love you some stubble or just need a little facial pruning, and you need a trimmer then maybe you should consider getting the PT730 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, April 18, 2012</li>
    <li> Warning: This shaver has no trimmer.Can you imagine a shaver without a trimmer? I did not!I searched for the trimmer, but couldn&#x27;t find out how to activate it. I finally realized, no matter how illogical it was, this shaver actually had none!</li>
    <li> The product was a gift for some dear family members. One has conveyed his pleasure with the electric shaver. Haven&#x27;t heard from the other yet.</li>
    <li> Does not cut well enough for the price. For $40 I expected a much more thorough job. Just glides over the hairs without actually cutting them all. Maybe I&#x27;m old fashioned but I would expect an electric shaver to actually remove all the hairs in a remote area &amp; not just the few it chooses to cut. I could probably do better or atleast just as good with a disposable. Great design, It removes some hair obviously, but for the close shave I was going for, this is nothing special hence the 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have previously owned a Norelco shaver so I thought this one would work as well as the others I had.  Big mistake, the razor didn&#x27;t even make a dent in my overnight growth.  The shave was uneven and didn&#x27;t even feel like I shaved.  Would not recommend this to anyone.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my father after his previous Norelco broke.  According to him, here are the highlights:  This razor is very easy to handle and runs quietly.  It removes stubble very close to the skin and does not leave a burning effect on the chin.  It cleans easily.  It requires far less recharging then other electric razors.  Overall, an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> My father and my husband is very like philips, for it is very convenient, and comfortable, they are philips fans.</li>
    <li> My husband is a happy guy with this razor - and we&#x27;ve tried quite a few! It&#x27;s not a very complicated/advanced model, but does the job well and provides a close, relatively gentle shave. Can&#x27;t complain about the price either - the fancy models like SensoTouch will cost you 3 times more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lithium Ion battery holds the charge well. The box claimed that a full charge lasts up to 14 days - we haven&#x27;t tested it for that long, but it worked for a week just fine. A 3-minute charge is just enough for one shave - good for anyone in a rush. The shaving head is easy to clean and the cleaning brush is a nice accessory, although not really necessary as you can clean without out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the full 2-year warranty on this razor.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity through Amazon Vine to review two of Norelco&#x27;s lower to mid-range electric shavers - this one (the PT720) and the PT730. At first glance, they seem to be identical except for color, the pop-up trimmer on the PT730, and the $20 price difference at this writing. However, upon use I find that there is indeed a difference in the way they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers allow you to use them corded or cordless and both shavers can be rinsed clean under water. (You could actually use these razors in the shower, but rotary shavers perform better on a dry beard.) Both shavers feature the same, replaceable, flexing heads - which are amazing in their ability to follow the curves of your face while giving you a close shave. Both shavers last about 40 minutes on a single charge and both have an indicator light for battery status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences are that this shaver features Comfort Cut, which gives a gentler shave, and lacks the pop-up trimmer. The PT730 features Super Lift &amp; Cut (which picks up longer hairs and shaves them smoothly), DualPrecision (which lets you shave even the shortest stubble cleanly), and a pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying both on my husband and sons, I found that for my husband, who has a heavy beard, the PT730 gave him a closer shave than this shaver on his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. For one son, who is in college and shaves infrequently, the PT730 picked up the long, scraggly hairs much, much better than this shaver. However, for another son with a heavy beard but very sensitive skin, this shaver was much more comfortable and he said he would ONLY use this one. I was shocked to see such a big difference because the two shavers really do look identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is just one press of a button and the head pops open. Then you can rinse the whole thing under the tap! Very easy and convenient. Norelco recommends replacing the head every 12 months for optimum performance. Also included is a little cleaning brush and a plastic head cover to protect the heads between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and are looking for a mid-priced, electric, rotary-style shaver without a lot of whistles and bells, this shaver is worthy of consideration.a plastic head cover to protect the heads between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and are looking for a mid-priced, electric, rotary-style shaver without a lot of whistles and bells, this shaver is worthy of consideration.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Panasonic ES8103S shortly before receiving this and although they are feature wise different levels, I&#x27;ll focus on what they share for comparison.  I have used both for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel in hand and aesthetics:  Norelco is like a disposable BIC and the Panny a Mach3.  It&#x27;s very light, has the feel of inexpensive hollow plastic.  Ergonomically the shape is comfortable though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave: First shave with the Norelco was very nice.  Glided over the chin, jaw very easily.  Since you use rotating motions instead of a up-down paintbrush motion with the straight Panny, it&#x27;s much faster and finished basic parts in 1/3 the time.  Under the nose though was annoying and the lack of a trimmer really was annoying.  LACK OF A TRIMMER MAKES THIS USELESS as a sole razor in my opinion.  You can&#x27;t make a straight line like with any other razor electric or not.  Also while the first trim was fast and pleasant, after a few weeks I noticed that it started pulling once in a while which I&#x27;m assume is due to the blades getting duller already.  This was rather disappointing.  The Panny I&#x27;ve used longer but blade feels just as sharp as day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads:  $24 for the Norelco vs $17 for the Panny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: you open up the head and wash it out, then brush it with an included brush.  There were a lot of crevices where hairs got stuck and was a pain to get out.  Also when I sat it down, water poured out the other end where the charger plugged in.  Given it&#x27;s NOT a wet/dry shaver, this was a bit disconcerting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:  There are none.  It&#x27;s as basic as you can get.</li>
    <li> This Philips electric razor charges fast and it shaves good for the price.  The thing that I didn&#x27;t like was I had hoped it would have a trimmer to trim the sideburns.  Also, when I open the cover to clean the inside, it pops out entirely ever so often so I would have to put it back in to connect the opening/close section of the cover.  Good for the price  :)</li>
    <li> Son 17 uses this one. I have the better one....with pop out mustache blade which this lacks... but this cuts light beard or any heavy growth off quickly..... use aftershave with aloe... these give light face burn if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for over fifty years.  The Norelco PT720 is the best one I ever had.  It shaves fast and smooth and is a pleasure to clean.</li>
    <li> The best Norelco razor that I have ever had.  This is also the best razor of any company that  I have ever owned.  The price is good and the design is the best.  I can clean it with one hand.</li>
    <li> Great razor, easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I like Norelco razors.  But this model cuts too many corners.  I recommend the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Black/Silver]] instead for a few dollars more.  The most obvious difference is the PT730 has a pop-out trimmer, which is especially handy for longer hairs and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is also an important difference in the combs (which is what Norelco calls the screens which touch your face) as well.  The PT720 has \\&quot;Comfort Cut\\&quot; combs which have standard slots all around, whereas the PT730 has 8-series \\&quot;DualPrecision\\&quot; combs with little holes that allow for a closer shave.  When you buy [[ASIN:B000068PBT HQ8 replacement heads]] for any of these models, they come with the better 8-series combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after using this model for about a month, I noticed my shave wasn&#x27;t as close as my 10-year-old [[ASIN:B000050B65 Norelco 6885XL]].  The 6885XL has Quadra Action heads with the little holes, so I got the replacement HQ8 heads and sure enough, that was the difference.  Now my PT720 shaves just as close as my old 6885XL.  As an aside, the other shaver brand I like is Braun - I have an older battery-operated Braun travel shaver similar to the [[ASIN:B003FO4SD8 Braun Mobile Shave (Model M-60)]] that also shaves nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do the holes make a difference?  I am not sure, but when the Quadra Action shavers came out, I read that since the holes are smaller, the comb can be thinner in that area.  A Norelco rep also told me that the holes will hold the hairs straighter (think of pushing a stick into a pipe vs. a mail slot).  Whatever the reason, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends replacing the heads annually.  About 2-3 years after I got my old 6885XL, I went into a razor repair shop and asked for replacement heads.  Even though they sold them, the old repair guy told me not to replace them unless I had problems; he said they were self-sharpening and lasted many years for most people.  Sure enough, 10 years later they still cut as well as my new HQ8 heads.  Admittedly, I may have lighter facial hair than others, and spend only 90 seconds or so per full shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time for the PT720 is 8 hours for 40+ minutes of use.  This seems excessive to me because my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time.  I don&#x27;t really mind though, because you can just plug it in and use it, and I usually charge it overnight anyway - it won&#x27;t overcharge.  While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in.  I did this not long ago with my 6885XL and it took about 20 minutes - you just need a screwdriver, soldering iron, solder and solder wick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models.  Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically.  I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes so the shaver will sporadically turn off while I&#x27;m shaving.  Unfortunately, the PT730 has the button in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT720 and PT730 both come with a cleaning brush, protection cap, and plug-in charger, but no stand or case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT720 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading at least to the PT730.</li>
    <li> this shaver works great at this point. i&#x27;m 78 yrs old with a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;i like the shaver, hope it will last a good while.</li>
    <li> Received it right away and it comes with a handy nose trimmer.  The person I got it for loved it</li>
    <li> Again do not like this form - please change.  As to product - Add did not indicate that the item did not have a trimmer.  Would not have purchased if I knew this.</li>
    <li> It was great, Thanks It was greAT, iT WAS GREAT.That&#x27;s all foke.  I&#x27;lm not a writer so I have to keep writing until lt says stop.</li>
    <li> I procured this shaver for my husband. He is very fussy about shavers, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a rave review from him. He actually loves the razor and has been using it every day since it arrived. He especially likes the close shave that it delivers both on the face and neck. (This particular model does not have a pop-up trimmer, FYI.)</li>
    <li> the one I used before was also Philips and so far both exceeded my expectation. Works smoothly, and specifically the battery lasts very long. I bought one from another brand and  had to return very soon as the battery could not hold. This one is totally different- literally no need to charge for quite a while.</li>
    <li> It was in the description but i didnt realize that i didnt come with a trimmer for long hair, it was advertised correctly just make sure this is what you want</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY these products! The have changed the way you open the blade housing and clean them. I had one for YEARS and it was so so easy to open it and clean the blades. Now, it is SO SO frustrating to get the housing back together. I have tried a total clean twice now and both times I can&#x27;t get it back together. Oh and google this you will see others has same issue.&lt;br /&gt; DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> He received it and said it works great and he likes that it is so easy to clean. Very Happy with it</li>
    <li> good product for the money. have had other norelco razors but this is good for the money. would buy another one</li>
    <li> In testing this razor, I found it to be comparable to the Norelco I have had for almost a year as far as shaving capability.  I have pretty much used Norelco products for much of my adult life and have always liked them.  I had never tried one of the water cleanable razors so when this product came up on the Vines program I thought I would check it out.  I was surprised to find out that it did not come with a trimmer, which would have deterred me from purchasing this unit in the store.  The trimmer is a necessity for keeping my sideburns even and little touch-ups in my shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;As to being able to clean the razor with water, I found that my previous routine with my other shavers is more convenient on a daily basis.  Rinsing the shaver out is great, but then I have to rinse the hairs that accumulate in the sink until they go down the drain afterward, which sort of defeats the convenience of that process.  With the typical Norelco, or any other razor, I would blow on the blades and get rid of the bulk of the hair stuck in them, and then use the brush every few weeks to clear it out of any persistent residue.  I reverted to this process with this razor after one time running water over the blades, since it added a couple more minutes of rinsing hair residue out of the sink.  I guess if I used it in the shower, it would be a different story.  I would say that being able to rinse the unit is probably better than being forced to do a full cleaning with the little brush, but again, I only do that every so often anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The charge seems reasonable.  I tend to charge my razor once a week, and did so with this one, and it seemed to do just fine without a reduction in shaving power.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an adequate razor, though I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product myself.  There is a similar model that comes with the trimmer, which would be my preference.  Being able to rinse it clean with water was not as nice a feature as I thought it would be, though I am sure it will save time for a lot of folks out there.save time for a lot of folks out there.</li>
    <li> After years as a Norelco user, I became dissastified with expensive shavers that sustained unrechargable batteries after only a few months of use.  For several years, I have gone through some Remington shavers, both expensive and cheap and a few off brands.  I was never satisfied with any.  I tried this one Just because it was water washable  ad inexpensive.  I forgot what it was like to be able to shave; even with a few days growth, without pain.  SUCH A COMFORTABLE SHAVE.  Even if the battery in this one doesn&#x27;t laast as long as I would like, I will be totally happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for three years and still uses it every day. He claims it gives a close shave without any burning.&lt;br /&gt;He always choses Norelco razors when one needs replacing. So, I would say he recommends it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006GQYSFA Philips Norelco PT720 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Blue/Silver/Black]]  This PT720 shaver is the best i have ever had.It gives a close shave so better have some aftershave when you finish.I like the rotating blades that give a good contour to your face and adjusts to it.It has several conveniences which i like such as washing it out when you finish shaving in just a matter of seconds,a sleek design of blue,white,and black with a good steady grip handle,and the choice of being cordless or corded when you need it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago, and it seems to run soooo slow,&lt;br /&gt;i thought maybe after a full charge or two it would start to run faster, but that is&lt;br /&gt;not the case. but it does do the job as needed. one good thing is that it is lightweight,&lt;br /&gt;so it doesn&#x27;t tire you out from shaving, but it is a better product so far&lt;br /&gt;than the Remington foil shaver i just threw out. i just hope the heads last longer&lt;br /&gt;than my previous Remington shaver, for the money it is worth the price, just plan on it&lt;br /&gt;taking longer to do the job.</li>
    <li> for the $40 that i paid for it, my relatives overseas loved it, and as expected, it came in sturdy packaging and is very functional</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco PT720 PowerTouch Rechargeable cordless razor is great!  I have a fancier model, a SensoTouch 3D that was over $100 at Costco, and it has a popup trimmer, but it&#x27;s nearly useless.  It also doesn&#x27;t shave me very close; maybe I need to replace the head. This PT720 shaves very close.  Another issue I have with the SensoTouch is that I don&#x27;t see any way to remove the cutters to clear hair and do a good cleaning; they are clogged with hairs that I would have to pull out one by one with tweezers were I so inclined.  The PT702 cutters are removed simply, with a single screw knob. So I&#x27;m very happy with the new one -- it&#x27;s not as pretty as the SensoTouch but it gets the job done!  Holds a good charge; can be used five days in the car then recharged on the weekend.  Easy to grip, light to hold, quiet to run, cleans quickly in running water.</li>
    <li> First...I am blond with very fine hair.  Using a blade, I get the best shave after 30-36 hrs.  I don&#x27;t get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow until 10 or 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works adequately.  It does hold charge well.  I like the ease of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news (as far as I was concerned):  no trimmer; doesn&#x27;t shave close.  The head is fixed - not a lot of movement to stay with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it for the convenience.  And the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy blades every month.  But I am not amazed or excited by the shave.</li>
    <li> This is an acceptable electric shaver that will give a good shave, lasts for about 5 - 7 shaves on one charge, can be used plugged-in, and is easy to clean. The reason for me giving it only three stars are mainly the lack of a trimmer and the time it takes to get that good shave.  Also, the head is bulky, making precision shaving and shaving of the non-flat areas in the face cumbersome. When I read the instructions two notes stood out: 1) it takes 14 days for the skin to get used to the shaver and 2) pressing too hard could lead to skin damage. So I tried it for the 14 days and even though the shave was good at the end, it must have done something to the skin because the aftershave stung much more than usual. What I did appreciate was that it easier to shave a three-day beard with this. That was certainly a plus. But in the end it took longer to get shave that was good, but not as good as my regular electric shaver. To sum it up, I am glad to have it as a backup shaver and like the fact that it works while charging. But as a main shaver I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for our son at Christmas and he did the research on what razor he wanted this was it so we ordered it and it arrived as expected</li>
    <li> I had the luck to find this shaver on Amazon Vine, and since I use shavers, this was perfect for me!  I&#x27;ve previously bought a Philips Norelco 7310, [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]], but to tell you the truth, they&#x27;re quite similar (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, mind you).  Uses the same heads, slightly different contour, but even the cleaning brush is identical.  The main difference is that the 7310 has a pop-up trimmer (similar to the Norelco PT730 [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Black/Silver]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I liked about this.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium ion batter is good, which means it won&#x27;t have problems with frequent use and recharge, and also means you can use as a travel charger, since the battery won&#x27;t self-discharge too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  Pop the button on the bottom of the head, and the head/screen flips up (but is still connected to the shaver).  This allows you to clean the head and blades without losing or dropping the head.  I&#x27;ve dropped the screen a few times using Braun and Remington screen shavers, and have almost cut myself wiping those blades.  Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so likes:&lt;br /&gt;No pop-up trimmer.  I use this trimmer to take out stray whiskers, so not having this trimmer was enough to knock down a full star for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t attach to the shaver, so you KNOW I&#x27;ll be losing this brush in a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pouch/case/bag/anything.  Usually, I&#x27;d at least get a vinyl bag or plastic case, but here, nothing.  Maybe the retail version will come with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t need the pop-up trimmer, this would be a recommend.  If you DO use such a trimmer, though, spend the few more bucks and get the Norelco PT730.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I would consider the Norelco PT730 [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Black/Silver]], which goes for about10-15 bucks more, but you get the pop-up trimmer (it&#x27;s also supposed to come with a lift-cut system, but considering that it uses the same replacement blades as the PT720, I&#x27;m thinking that both do the same thing).  And there&#x27;s always the Norelco 7310, which is still sold at Amazon via Reseller.</li>
    <li> This handsome blue shaver is fast, safe and fairly quiet, plus it&#x27;s light and can go a long time without recharging.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many many years and compared to the old ones this is a revelation.  For an electric shaver novice like me, I was happy to discover that the blades were behind a metal mesh so that the actual blade never touches your skin, but it also doesn&#x27;t let you get quite as close a shave as you could get with a traditional razor.  But it useless for things like sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.</li>
    <li> clogs to easy but gets the job done</li>
    <li> I choose the standard shipping, but the package arrived in two days.  I was very surprised and pleased.  Items arrived in good and new condition.  I bought these as gift for my dad and uncle.  So far they had not complained.  I guess these are some very good products</li>
    <li> This razor is very comfortable to use, good quality and will recommend to my friends to buy.... people also is right choice</li>
    <li> Fits my needs just fine.  Needed cordless.  Now if it would have a charger for my truck use, it would be even better.  Thx</li>
    <li> Last one lasted me over 3o yeRS, HOIPE THIS ONE WILL ALSO.like it.like it.like it.like it.like it.like it.like it.like it.</li>
    <li> I have mostly been a manual razor guy for most of my life because I have yet to find a quality electric shaver that gives as good or as comfortable a shave as a blade.  But I like to keep one on hand just when I need a quick save because I do not have time for shaving cream and all the other rituals that come along with a blade.  This Philips Norelco Shaver gave me a more comfortable save than other electric razors I have tried.  Unfortunately it still gave me some post-shave numbness that comes with other electric shavers.  It also has the same flaws that I have experienced with other electric shaver like it is hard to shave the hair on the upper lip just under the nose and the shave is no way near close as one you get with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had other rechargeable razors that have a clock to tell you how much charge you have left; unfortunately this razor has no such feature.  It does have a flashing light to let you know when you are low on power, and if you do manage to run out of power mid shave, you can shave while it is plugged in.  And a full charge will only last you approximately forty minutes (most others I have used will go a full hour).  It is also easy to clean, just wash with water, while the head is supposed to last you a year before it is suggested you replace it.  Also the instructions claims the product has a trimmer attached to it, but either this model does not come with one or I am really not as smart as I think.</li>
    <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 1 year and it has worked great. Shaves close and holds charge a long time. Best razor I ever owned.</li>
    <li> This razor is just about perfect.  It&#x27;s lightweight, comfortable in the hand, non slippery and easy to use.  I used it to shave my legs and it worked like a charm.  My husband, who hates cordless razors gave it a try and said this is the best of the bunch. He gets a very rough 5:00 shadow and it made him baby smooth.  He tried it in and out of the shower and it worked just as great in both.  This is a real nice razor and I wish I had known about this around Christmas.  It would have made a great Christmas gift for a few male relatives and friends that I have.</li>
    <li> GOOD SHAVER I HAVE EVER USED AND ITS PRICE TAG IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE FOR ME SO I GIVE A POSITIVE TO IT</li>
    <li> have tryed several others and found this works great eazt to charge and clean would recomend this for any one</li>
    <li> Norelco has been my favorite electric razor for years.  This new model has added to my product enthusiasm.  The floating head gives me a close shave and a quick rinse cleans my shaver and I am on my way.  The fully charged battery allows me to shave for a couple of weeks without recharging &amp; is compact for travel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that is really worth the extra money so you can just rinse the head under water without worrying about it shorting out the the little cheaper model.</li>
    <li> This was a gift....works great and he loves it. Well worth the extra money for this razor. It gives a great close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years and even though it shaves pretty close, I would have liked to have known that this shaver DOESN&#x27;T HAVE a trimmer. Luckily I still have my old shaver for that use. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> I liked it because its a good buy for the money. Does the job as advertised,tho the more expensive models are even better quality and give long-life performance. Ya gotta wonder how they make such an intricate shaving head and blade,and price it so low.</li>
    <li> Why there is no zero star? The outside pack and inside pack were well sealed when I got it. But when I opened it up, there were thousands of someone&#x27;s beards in the machine! That was DISGUSTING! What I bought is a new one from Amazon.com, not a used one or refurbished one! So guys, do NOT buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Good price except missing the trimmer. I was under the impression that most Norelco electric razors comes with a built in trimmer. Otherwise it performs well designed to do it&#x27;s function.</li>
    <li> THE BUTTON FOR OPENING THE SHAVER IS SO SMALL, ONE CAN BARELY GET THE SHAVER OPEN! OTHERWISE IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING PROPERLY.</li>
    <li> The style is suitable for me and I used it freely!I want to use this brand later and tell all my relatives and friends about the quality!</li>
    <li> After having my old Norelco shaver for 19 years I decided it was time for a change, I&#x27;m glad with my decision this one is really better than the very old I had. I congratulete myself for the desicion and the good investment I did. Shaves perfectly and batteries last almost two weeks before needed to recharge again.&lt;br /&gt;Besides , the cost of replacing blades an betteries is much higher than a new one. Recomendable</li>
    <li> this razor let my face smoother than a baby butt, easy to clean and easy to handle, very happy with it</li>
    <li> It is ideal for men with a light growth.  The shaver is easy to use and has a battery that lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in April of 2013.  Went with Philips/Norelco because my dad had one back in the 70&#x27;s, made in Holland, that was a great twin head unit.  I even used it after he passed away and never did buy a new head for it.  Over the years I lost it and bought other brands, so when the time came to purchase a new one,I thought I would give this shaver a go.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick. I like it but would not buy another one. Cons: Doesn&#x27;t come with a case to put it in.  Charging chord isn&#x27;t the coil type.  The plug is large due to the multi voltage option.  The end that plugs into the shaver isn&#x27;t a tight fit, I have to make sure I place the shaver just so so that the chord doesn&#x27;t come out.  Pros:  Length of blade life is low.  I grow a beard 3 months out of the year, and I am amazed at how short the life span on the blades is - and my shaving times are at max 1 minute long.  I know some guys massage their faces with it but I have better things to do.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Remington Titanium before this one.  Lived overseas in the tropics.  The transformer for 110/220 was built into  the shaver and not the plug and it came with a case and coil chord.  The blades lasted over 5 years!  I&#x27;ll be going back to Remington next time around.</li>
    <li> Gives a really nice close shave, perfect for the son&#x27;s first shaver</li>
    <li> I selected this razor based on ratings and am very happy with the results. Using it saves me time and the mess of conventional shaving.</li>
    <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
    <li> Seen this in a Wal Mart and then went home to look on line. Great Deal and saved money. I actually bought 2 one for my son as well</li>
    <li> I was surprised how smooth, comfortable and quiet this razor was.  There were many razor choices available and this one turned out to be a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. It is easy to use and pretty safe. One charge can last for couple months (I dont shave everyday). great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful machine, Had to stop useing razor because of bleeding caused by warferin. almost as good as the razor</li>
    <li> Norelco has been around a long time so they are doing something right, first time a electric razor for me and it is quick and easy if you ujst follow the directions</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price. Very light weight and seems to be made well. Would order Philips Norelco Razors again</li>
    <li> Ok, where to start?  It works, it shaves me.  Not the best shave of my life, but with tenacity (a second or third pass), it seems to complete most of the job.  Feels great on my hand and even better being cordless.  The battery has been a solid performer (LiON, not NiCad).  Being able to clean it under the faucet is also very nice.  The recharging cord and electric wart (2 prong) connecting to the AC outlet are well designed and the right length (cord) and size (wart).  I have another one of these, but corded and have used it for many years.  I believe this unit of Philips is still under the Philips company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion on this product is that for the price it is worth having for everyday, normal job work.  It works well even for 2 or 3 day stubble.  If you work on television under intense lighting, you may want to look around a bit more.</li>
    <li> I had a Phillips Norelco for many, many years without changing the blades, but finally something happened to the electric razor and my face felt raw after shaving; so I ordered another Philips Norelco, and I like it, my face likes it!  This electric razor is smooth running, shaves closely, and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Clean close shave - no bumps and very thorough. No reason to pay more for a solid electric razor which is water safe and rinsable. Only gripe is that it has no sideburn trimmer attachment. Battery life seems to be holding up too so far.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband in fact he has two.  They work very well and last a long time.  The cost is great.</li>
    <li> I have bought my husband many razors over the past 18 years and this one by far has been the best. Also I was able to use a coupon on your site so I got it for much lower than anywhere else I looked.</li>
    <li> Loving the 6 foot cord and the fact that you can use it with or without the cord.  and there is no need to unplug when its done charging.  The cut is as good as any other rotary razor (not as close as a blade).  There is no trimmer.  The warrenty is for 2 years but extends another 6 months if you register.  Battery charge lasts about 40 minutes.  Lights show status of charge (good enough, 5 minutes left, charging, done charging).  Takes about 8 hours to fully charge.  instructions reccomend wait till drained to recharge.  Can rinse this under running water but not charge while wet.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I have heard no complaints so far. The price was right and my husband seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Have had Norelco razors for decades. Thought this one was priced really well. When it came I was surprised it doesn&#x27;t have side burn trimmer that I thought was a standard feature. Further, it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my old Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware fits here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers my whole life, I bought this one at a reasonable price (around $28 plus tax was 32) after my last one broke down and was immediately concerned about its ability to shave long hairs, and neck beard. Not to shill out for the product but this shaver really exceeded my initial expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comfort cut technology is not being oversold, with my old shaver razor burn was always an issue, with this one I barely felt it cut against the grain of my face. The blades were incredibly efficient, I hardly had to run over a difficult to cut area more than once. As for the long hairs? well I had been unshaven for about a week, and the razor had zero issues mincing them down to near nothing. It also carved through my neck beard with ease. This was probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in over a decade. Cleaning is pretty straight forward, hopefully if the razor heads stay fairly cheap this will be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that gets the job done with a few extra features that&#x27;ll make the whole process of shaving a little easier on your face this is your buy.</li>
    <li> I was new to the electric razer world and sure am glad I started here because this razor leaves your face smooth and not agitated like a traditional razer..</li>
    <li> The fully Washable Design very Convenient  to maintain, 100-240 V worldwide voltage let me to use it when travel around.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. He uses it every week and until now it works pretty well. But when he is washing it, he must be very careful so that the electric circuit would be wet.</li>
    <li> After somewhat over one year, the power switch failed.  Now, the shaver cannot be turned off.  This is quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> gives a clean shave,and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Even when I first used this razor, I could tell it didn&#x27;t have the power of my other razors I&#x27;ve had.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t read the box closely enough when I bought the razor at Walmart, but I was surprised there was no trimmer.  I&#x27;ve bought cheaper models in the past which had a trimmer; I would think this would be standard item.  The head finally fell off the razor body in less than a year.  I&#x27;ve been so unhappy with this model I won&#x27;t be buying a Norelco razor for some time.</li>
    <li> nice razor, but doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer</li>
    <li> 3 Heads increase the shave area and save much time. However, it shaves not so deep as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price is good , it worth the money.</li>
    <li> The razor was for my brother. He thinks that it works fine. It was a reasonable price. It was easy to purchase through the internet.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a very good job.  With about any electric razor I feel like my whiskers aren&#x27;t cut as short as they should be with a razor but everything looks fine.  No one accuses me of not shaving.  Shaving with this razor is so very quick, easy and trouble-free that I have been using it every day since I bought it.  I keep thinking I should use a regular razor sometimes but then I grab this shaver and am done with shaving before I can even think about it.  I wish this razor had a trimmer on it but that is not a big deal.  This is an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> great buy and fit my dad perfectly.. nice material and length! Went back and bought another in a different color!</li>
    <li> Works a little better than one I bought over one year ago (I maintain two houses and want two razors.) Only possible issue I see is that it seems to have less &amp;#34;water proofing&amp;#34; in construction, as when I rinse it, some water drains all the way through the razor. No indication of any problem from this water however.</li>
    <li> Love this shave. Came just in time before I went to St. Louis!</li>
    <li> Great product. love it</li>
    <li> I think if you have fine hair (caucasian or asian) this would work great. I have coarse indian hair. So i am still left with a grainy feeling even after vigorously using it.&lt;br /&gt;But its satisfactory, esp days when you just dont wanna shave or you are out of shaving cream or razor</li>
    <li> not built to the quality of former norelcos</li>
    <li> Works great. It was just what my husband needed. He&#x27;s had a Norelco electric razor which served him well in the past so I saw no need to try a different brand. We were both satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had really worn out the blades on my old Norelco, and Amazon (with coupon) was offering this razor for less than new blades. It is light and my shave is obviously much closer now. A lack of trimmer is not big deal as I still have the old shaver! Love it so far.</li>
    <li> I like the Norelco shaver.  It is quieter than the old one I had for a long time.  They still make a quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I found this electric razor pretty good but it&#x27;s nothing special to me. I had to get an electric one because I have super sensitive skin and a regular razor irritated my face. This does the job but it has left little cuts under my chin a few times. I don&#x27;t like that part.</li>
    <li> I needed a shaver that could be used in a hurry to give me a nice clean shave.  It does just that!!</li>
    <li> Nice using experience. It&#x27;s a good quality product, as good as expected, well fitted with the brand, Worth to have it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a gift for a family member.  I could tell that the razor was high-quality since I had one similar to this model several years ago.  Tested the razor and it shaved very well.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver.  Wish it had a trimmer. gives smooth comfortable shave.and holds charge long time  Long time required to fully recharge.</li>
    <li> No trimmer or accordion plug wirel kinda cheap</li>
    <li> It shaves well enough, with a quick 3-minute charge. Catches the whiskers that my non-rotary shaver has trouble catching, especially around the larynx. It&#x27;s easily cleaned by running water through it. Note, though, that it does not claim to be waterproof, unlike the AT series. Nor is it meant for a wet shave or gel. Feels solid enough, with a nice curvy grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does not include a trimmer. So it comes down to how much you&#x27;ll miss that. If you have a beard, you&#x27;ll probably have something like the [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] to get a straighter shave around your cheeks, anyway. But as I said earlier this type has trouble around the throat. So the PT complements it. If you want the built-in trimmer, spend the extra $10 or so for a step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating is based on someone looking for a decent shaver ... with no trimmer. If you&#x27;re out there.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco model 4414 electric razor of similar design for a number of years.  It did a good job, but THIS razor makes the old one pale in comparison.  Like my old model 4414, this Norelco features the triple rotary floating heads.  But that&#x27;s pretty much where the comparison ends.  Differences and improvements are multiple.  The most important being the improved \\&quot;flotation.\\&quot;  Whereas in the old razor, the heads floated in a plane, in the new model, the heads float in a spring loaded surface which varies its contour.  In other words, no more scrunching up your face or inflating your cheeks to keep the heads in contact with your skin.  This is most noticeable when doing the chin area.  A concealed push-button on/off switch replaced the previous sliding switch.  My old model was a corded shaver, this model is cordless.  Charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time--multiple shaves for me.  I always favored a razor with a cord as it&#x27;s always ready when you need it and you never have to remember to charge it.  But, I can also see the advantage of cordless.  You can shave anywhere (hopefully NOT while you&#x27;re driving!) and aren&#x27;t tied to an outlet.  THIS model features LED lights which, among other things, flash orange when you have 5 minutes of shaving time left.  It will also \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; in 3 minutes to supply a five minute shave.  Best of all, it shaves with ZERO pressure, doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin and shaves closer than ANY other electric razor I&#x27;ve used in the last 25 or so years!  S-M-O-O-T-H!!!  WOW!  Cleaning is easy.  The top on this model is HINGED.  Rinses clean under water.  On my old model, the whole head assembly was a separate piece and required brush cleaning.  I&#x27;m thinking the hinged head assembly is an improvement, as the old one sometimes got away while brushing and required hunting around on the floor behind the toilet!  I&#x27;m not too keen on washing whiskers down the drain, but a quick shake in the trash can seems to dump out most of the debris, keeping it out of the sink trap.  This razor DOES come with a brush, for \\&quot;extra-thorough\\&quot; cleaning.  This model (PT720) LACKS the pop-up beard/mustache/sideburn trimmer.  Personally, I&#x27;d probably spring for the extra $10 or so to get the model PT730 that does have the trimmer.  My old razor has one and it does come in handy when you get too busy to shave for a while and get that longer than usual 1/4\\&quot; stubble that can snag in the rotary blades and get ripped out of your face (OUCH!).  There is an intermediate model PT725, but the owner&#x27;s brochure doesn&#x27;t indicate what the difference between the PT720 and PT725 is.  It does indicate (as noted above) that the \\&quot;top-line\\&quot; PT730 has the pop-up trimmer which does NOT come with the PT720 or PT725.  All in all, I&#x27;d give FIVE STARS to the NORELCO PT720.  Closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s as close as a blade because I&#x27;ve never, in all my life, shaved with anything but an electric razor.  But my face feels BABY SMOOTH to the touch after shaving with the PT720, something I&#x27;ve never been able to say about any other razor--EVER!</li>
    <li> I waited to rate this product, as I wanted to see how well it would do over the long run. So far it holds as good of a charge as it did when it was new, which is around 2 weeks. When it needs a charge, I clean it out very well with compressed air and use Remington Shaver Saver to lubricate the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will miss the omission of the pop-up trimmer, and for that there is another model with that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star for the lack of a pop-up trimmer and that it is not the very closest shave to be had... but you have to keep price in mind. I feel it does very well for the price.</li>
    <li> bought as giftfor my brother he is very happy with it gives a good shave easy to use and clean would recommend thank you</li>
    <li> Works very efficiently and is very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three of these for my husband over the past couple of years (one went out the window of his moving vehicle; don&#x27;t ask, and he went back and got it, put it back together and continued to use it until it finally fell apart), he left one behind in a hotel room, and I got him a new one this past Christmas.  I&#x27;ve given my father (in his late &#x27;70&#x27;s) one for a gift (he always has me rub his cheek to check how smooth it is), and my 21 year old son uses this newest one now.  It is a rechargeable, cordless product that does a great job and has made my men happier in the shaving department.  Considering the price of primo shaving blades these days, this product is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> I have it use for more than a year and has work just fine all this time</li>
    <li> Yep, I got what I paid for.  I went cheap thinking;\\&quot;How much difference can there be?\\&quot;  Apparently a big difference.  Do yourself a favor, get a more expensive and better shaving razor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Some times simple is better and that is the case with the Philips Norelco PT720.  This is a basic, down to earth, electric razor that straight out of the box does what it is suppose to; deliver a good shave.  So what if this electric razor does not have a side burn trimmer.  In all of the 25+ years that I have been shaving with an electric, I probably can count the number of times I have used the trimmer on one hand.  I doubt that most men reading this review use the side burn trimmer on their current razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn this razor on for the first time after charging overnight, one will notice that it has a powerful sounding motor that delivers performance.  The razor glides fairly easily over the face and I found that it worked exceedingly well on the lower neck and jaw line which are problem areas for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that I did not purchase this great razor from Amazon.  There is an available Internet coupon that can be used for $10 off on the purchase of any Philips Norelco, which I took advantage of.  Since I was replacing a very expensive Norelco which performed poorly, I did not want to make a major investment in another electric that might be a \\&quot;dud.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the words of the old Gillette Super Blue Blades jingle: to look sharp every time you shave, grab the PT720.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 Sep 12 - This razor continues to demonstrate why it is a great bargain.  The initial charge lasted 25 days which was beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product. arrived in excellent condition</li>
    <li> A VERY NICE ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
    <li> It is too light,  difficult to hold in your hand.  the shave is merely adequate,  it does hold a charge.  I would not recommend it to anyone who wants good shave.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to buy one of these in a while, my last one worked for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it so far.  Clean shave at a good price.</li>
    <li> My grandfather loves the razor.  He is wheelchair bound and to have an electric razor of good quality with no cord is great.  He uses this every day.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Norelco Shaver PT720. When it arrived I opened the package only to find that the razor did not have a pop up trimmer which is a very important item for me. The description did not say this, otherwise I would not have ordered it.So I returned it for a refund which I already received.Thank you, case closed.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my boyfriend.  He always complained when he used a razor and wanted one of these instead.  I don&#x27;t know much about these, but after reading a couple of reviews decided that this should be good.  He loved it even I use it myself.  Very easy to use and cute.</li>
    <li> This is another great product sold by this company. I have used this type and brand of electric for many years and this one holds to the others high standards, Very nice company to do business with. Overall great transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors all my life. Gives a relatively close shave (for an electric razor). And I&#x27;ve always been impressed with their durability. The one thing lacking with this model is that it doesn&#x27;t have a sideburn and moustache trimmer. Experience has taught me that, depending on use, battery life is between 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> It gives me a smooth shave without any pulling or discomfort.  I would recommend it to any or my family or friends.</li>
    <li> Shaving was clean, but the detail is not very thorough, and need to be repeated several times.Even a slight scratch my skin.</li>
    <li> He has used Norelco for years. I thought I had ordered the one with the popup razor for trimming. This did not have it.</li>
    <li> I had a Emerson (Just bought a cheap one for trying, normally i use razor) and I did not like that much. This one is definitely better (bit costly too) but I got is cheap during thanksgiving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thanksgiving gift for my boyfriend. He loves it.It&#x27;s a good choice for gift. Nice price and work well.</li>
    <li> Smooth, close and comfortable shave. Good battery life. Easy to travel with. No fancy options. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> as opposed to the Black and Decker coffee maker I did send this 1 back. It was the worst shaver I have ever owned.  Norelco is supposed to be good but I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon or if these are just junk. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, I would not recommend it, and I would not even give it away. Fred T</li>
    <li> It is hard to make save by this razor. This is not good product. I don&#x27;t like this product. this razor does not meet my expectation.</li>
    <li> It is great it shaves good and keep the battery for a long time, great product over all and i like it.</li>
    <li> It works well, and its price is attractive. I cannot tell any wrongs now, and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> It is a good choice for the suitable price and beautiful appearance, and easy to use. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> This is good value for your money. Shipped right away. Pretty close shave as per expected from an automatic shaver.</li>
    <li> The razor does not have the power to get a close shave that I hoped for . also the charge does not last long.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a Panasonic ES8103S to this Norelco because the Panasonic&#x27;s cut too close and left my skin irritated.  The Panasonic&#x27;s shape also did not allow for getting the areas underneath my nose.  Norelco&#x27;s head shape allows for better cutting underneath the nose.  Although it does seem a little flimsy due to the light plastic case, the lack of weight has no bearing on the quality of the cut, which is just right for me.  The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the Panasonic, but then again, I felt a little intimidated every time I put that Panasonic to my face lest it take off more than I desire.  The Norelco is a great shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> In my 50&#x27;s. My first electric razor. It is convenient although it takes time. Not a close shave like a blade, but probably no electric shaver is. I just don&#x27;t like shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Norelco electric razors for my husband for years. This one works great and, if it&#x27;s anything like the others, it will last for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers and it is one of the best. It met all my expectations. It works great (e.g. shaved cleanly, use friendly, etc.) The item was delivered ahead of its schedule.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift from my wife. it runs silently and smoothly. I feel very comfortable. it&#x27;s good value for its price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite good along the chin line , under it, and around the Adams Apple..but for basic shaving I&#x27;m going to stick with my Schick Power Select 3 or 5 blade version.</li>
    <li> Cuts great and very easy to use. I like the beard trimmer and this particular model does not have it. Other than that it cuts nicely and is a close and comfortable shave. It is worth the money I paid for it, just wish it had beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is so far the better quality shaver than other brands i have tried using before. Feels my money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have been using so far, its worth a shaver kit for such a price. I love it and it gives goo clean smooth shave</li>
    <li> MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PT72O HAS REALLY SUPRISED ME EARLY ON WITH IT&#x60;S SMOOTH OPERATION AND LITTLE IRRATION TO MY SKIN.  SO SURPRISED WITH THE QUIETNESS OF THE MOTOR AND IT&#x60;S ABILITY TO PERFORM A MUCH BETTER SHAVE THAN MOST OTHERS I&#x60;VE TRIED.  NEVER THOUGHT THAT TRYING FOR THE FIRST TIME WOULD RESULT IN SUCH A CLOSE SHAVE, GIVEN THE LOW RESOLUTION/SPEED THAT THE SHAVER OFFERS.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND .</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver is quiet and shaves closely without any irritation.  It cleans up very easily and I will continue to buy Norelco.</li>
    <li> just right, satisfied with razor,  I do wish it would have came with a base and an option of colors.</li>
    <li> Husband says it  gives a close shave for an electric razor. Battery holds charge for a long time.  Would suggest to others.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and great. It&#x27;s wonderful satisfaction my need. IF you have similar product, contact me please through my email</li>
    <li> I bought it on sale, thus the price is good, and the quality is also enjoyable. I like it ;-)</li>
    <li> Very Good!&lt;br /&gt;And with Coupon it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it to my father in law, hope he will like it.</li>
    <li> lo recomeindo ampliamente, pueden comprar con confianza, el articulo fue el esperado o solicitado, la compra se efectuo sin problemas, el articulo llego en el tiempo estimado, sin contratiempos.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my son-&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase-my son loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend -great razor for an awesome price!!</li>
    <li> Since Jesse started using this thing he really does a better job of keeping his beard neatly trimmed and stylishly sculpted.</li>
    <li> for my father&#x27;s gift, he loves it very much for my father&#x27;s gift, he loves it very much for my father&#x27;s gift, he loves it very much</li>
    <li> i have to shave every day for my law enforcement job and this really does the trick! no more messing with razor and tiny cuts, it can easily take down 2 days of growth down to an almost razor like smoothness. i chose this over the next model up only because i did not need the trimmer. it take only less than 2 minutes to get a nice smooth shave and be ready for work</li>
    <li> easy to carry, easy to charge and easy to use. fully charged razor can use around 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The power is ok, not as powerful as my old wired razor but is enough for my beards.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are almost the same price as this shaver.  It does not have the trimmer but you may not need it. Cheaper than using a blade but not as close.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price, easy to clean, light weight.  As expected quality from Norelco.  Almost as cheap as buying head and cutters</li>
    <li> Great razor, especially for the price... Relatively close shave (after a few swipes) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all... Very quiet... Seems easy to clean... Not as nice as the sense-touch, but for $30-50 less, its a deal!</li>
    <li> This shaver cannot be charged.&lt;br /&gt;Charging indicator light of the razor does not shine.&lt;br /&gt;the razor cannot use.&lt;br /&gt;I  never meet such situation before.</li>
    <li> The performance of this razor comes close to matching even the much higher priced Norelcos.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it at 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have the pop-up clipper.  This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> It is good for the price I paid...battery  also lasts longer than I expected ...I really like it very much ...</li>
    <li> I am dissapointed in the Norelco that I purchased online. We have used Norelco Electric Razors for many years, in fact have never used another brand and been very pleased with them. This one does not have the same quality that I am accustomed to.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because Norelco products have reduced the quality or if it is just this particular model of razor.</li>

    <li> Replaced an older model. Bought for my husband as part of an anniversary gift. He seems very pleased with my choice.</li>
    <li> This razor seems kind of low power to me. But seems to be Ok if you don&#x60;t go more than 2 days without shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Not really a lot of power. It&#x27;s much lighter than my old Remington, but the cutters run much slower. I like the capability of washing/rinsing with water, but I think I should have spent twice as much and bought one with more power and quality. Like many reviews of electric razors, you get what you pay for one.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco for years with great satisfaction -- very quiet compared to the straightline shavers, good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it died, I bought myself another for this last Christimas - -the 720, and boy am I sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT shave closely any more -- I have to go over and over and over the same area, and never end up with a clean shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why. I am in the market for a replacement now, two months later. But what do I buy instead? Are the more expensive models better? Or has the product-line quality gone down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is no help -- I complained in a followup survey and got no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are *so many models* it&#x27;s confusing -- at $20 increments, with unclear differentiations. Shall I buy the $39 one? Or the $49? or the $59? $89? $99? $129? $209? Who knows?? What level do I have to go up to in order to get a good shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the idea of having to go to a straightline shaver like a Braun, with all that noise, but what can I do?</li>
    <li> It is a fine shaver and I am very pleased with its operation.  I should have bought the model with the side-burn trimmer.</li>
    <li> Norelco triple-headers have been my go-to shaver for 45 years, but now it looks like I have to start reading a little closer. Even the cheapest models I&#x27;ve owned have had efficient little pop-up trimmers. Not this PT-720. If they&#x27;re going to change the brand that radically, it should say so up front and on the package, not three-quarters of the way down the page. Caution--no trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;Back it goes.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time, and it was as described.  I would do business with them again without hesitation.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as a superior razor..it is good in most aspects but the speed is much too slow am returning product</li>
    <li> I have just used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good working with smooth ride on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy..</li>
    <li> What do you need?  A shave, why spend $150 to $200 when this does the job.  You will be very happy.</li>
    <li> This is an OK razor.  The only reason I&#x27;m keeping it is because I don&#x27;t think I can return it.  It does not have a side burn trimmer.  Next time I will be more careful when buying a razor.</li>
    <li> he said it did the job.  but it didn&#x27;t have a side burns edge. Which is what we paid for..</li>
    <li> Phillips razor is definitely good product. But it may not fit anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have much beard, which grows very slowly, so I use it only twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth buying this.</li>
    <li> This works better than my top of the line razor.  I use it daily, it is quick and gives a pretty close shave.  I am sure I will buy another!</li>
    <li> Works just fine and has long life before recharging.  Service and shipping was excellent.  I am very pleased and it is really handy when you are short of time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months, it works great, I only charge it about every 45 days and only because I think I should, battery life is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&amp;#34;T PULLl!!!!</li>
    <li> great shave and price.Battery has long charge and gives warning orange light the last 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;this has been my best Norelco in 40 years.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable product. My friend have used this shavor for about 1 month now. Everything goes well.&lt;br /&gt;This meets our needs.</li>
    <li> best price i could find. it gives a smooth comfortable shave fast. i would definitly recommend this product to anybody who now uses a electric shaver or a blade.  its soooo easy..</li>
    <li> I spent $24, too value, can put the water wash, I will need the function, bad is, work sound a little bit big</li>
    <li> Good product and was very effective. The pricing was a bit high. I noticed same product in stores over the holiday for less money.</li>
    <li> Works well, though I wish I bought a model with a trimmer. At this price I cannot complain though.</li>
    <li> Price was a steal. Can&#x27;t wait till next year and Black Friday sales and cyber Monday. Holidays are a great time to buy.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and smooth even after a couple or three days of not shaving.  This especially helps in the heavier beard areas as it never pulls a piece of stubble as some of the other brands do.  I like the grip as well.  The charge seems to be a little better than advertised.</li>
    <li> It stays sharp and the battery stays operable for a good length of time. The only thing is I wish it had a trimmer</li>
    <li> This is a perfect substitute for someone who is lazy and doesn&#x27;t like to shave with a razor, wouldn&#x27;t try on a full beard but that&#x27;s your call.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED  THEM IN TWO MONTHS IN VENEZUELA BY ASESORIA POSTAL (IN MIAMI). THE ELECTRIC RAZORS ARE OK. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Great product! As someone who uses it often because I keep a bald head; its easy to clean; love that its water-resistant; and very easy to clean</li>
    <li> The PT720 may be on the low end of Norelco lineup but this does not mean cheap. I did not need the pop-out trimmer or lotion dispenser, etc, just a basic high-quality shaver. This model is very quiet, has long battery life, and work great.</li>
    <li> I have used several Norelco razors over the years and this works fine for me. I miss the side trimmer of previously owned models, but can do without it. The razor gives me about two weeks. of shaves between charges</li>
    <li> you got what you paid for. just ok ....I got  another Philip but much better than this one. Its not a good deal it all.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this Norelco.  For the price of the replacement blades, you can get a new shaver,</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the dollar. Our only disappointment was that iit didn&#x27;t have trimmer. I gave to my wife, so now it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a beard wearer for the past few years, so I haven&#x27;t had much use for shaving equipment.  Since I&#x27;ve used a straight razor (like Sweeney Todd) to clean up the edges on my beard, I haven&#x27;t really kept up to date with the advances in shaving technology.  However, due to my recent change of employment, shaving become a requirement and I was looking for a way to do it quickly and without much damage to what I assumed would be very sensitive skin after years of not being touched by a blade.  When I had the chance to try this Philips Norelco PT720 shaver, I didn&#x27;t think twice.  I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good about their previous electric razors.  And with good cause.  This is a GREAT razor.  After my first shave, I did have a bit of sensitivity/redness in places, but with a bit of lotion &amp; cool water, it was cured quickly.  The instructions for the razor even warned about this since the skin needs to become accustomed to the new razor.  Perhaps the best element of this razor is that it can be used dry. . . no need for shaving cream, water, or anything.  So, if you&#x27;re late for work or need a quick shave before a date, you can just pull out this Norelco and look clean-shaven in just moments.  There are only two elements I think are needed to make this a perfect razor.  First, it needs a straight edge to trim sideburns.  Not having this is kind of a problem because it means you need to always have another razor with you or risk having unruly sideburns.  Second, it needs a stand.  Perhaps have it double as a charging dock.  For now, it just lies there which is rather unsightly.  Overall, this is a good, simple razor that works well.  It could have had some more add-ons to boost its uses, but if you&#x27;re looking for something solid &amp; reliable, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price. My fiance previously owned a razor that was almost $500 and in comparison, this one does just as good of a job for way less money. It gets a very close shave on the face and neck. And it didn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin which is a major plus! If you are looking at razors, save your money and go for this one, not the really expensive ones!</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for about a month now, and it has been working great. Best part is the battery life, I charged it once and still have not had to recharge. It does have a tendency to collect bits of hair on the cutting blades, so regular cleaning is must if you want to get a close shave for more than a week. The included brush makes cleaning very easy, though putting all the pieces back in the right place takes a bit of patience and a bit of practice. The older version of this razor had a pop up trimmer, it was left off this model and replaced with a grip that I find makes this model much easier to hold if I&#x27;m using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a razor and don&#x27;t need the pop up trimmer, this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;Couple weeks later the battery finally needed to be charged, this will be a great razor to take traveling. A nice feature I noticed a few days before the battery completely gave out, the charge indicator started flashing orange during use and for a brief time afterwards. Good to know that you need to charge it before it completely dies on you, though the speed of the blades did slow down noticeably several days before this indicator came on.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, rechargeable, easy on the hand.Lightweight,practical,useful. My husband uses this as a travel  shaver,my  sons also use this model Norelco, and have nothing but praise. Be careful of razor burn if you&#x27;re new to electric razors. recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was in a nursing home.  It was so easy for him to remember how to clean it and it shaved very close.  He love it.</li>
    <li> A great razor at any price but even better at Amazon&#x27;s price. It is amazingly quiet and the battery goes longer than my previous shavers. A great improvement.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for Father&#x27;s Day and I simply love it. Close and confortable shave at a very reasonable price. Battery lasts at least 5 weeks between charges. Quick and easy cleanup. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> the greatest razor that i have ever used !! you can clean it easily, and it is close to the skin.</li>
    <li> I was under the assumption that this razor was equipped with a trimmer and was disappointed to find there was none on this style.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my boyfriend as a gift to replace his older much more expensive one and it was a hit. He loves the design, the fact that it&#x27;s in his favorite color, and it get the job done painlessly and efficiently. Solid product.</li>
    <li> Generally, it is a good product, but not so comfortable as i expected so four stars is given to it.</li>
    <li> As im using this it works grat and very easy to clean and use this Philips Norelco Electric Razor everybody this is very good for the money.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it still shaving strongly. Comfortable to grip.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely weak machine. I bought it because I got tired of shaving my head with razors every morning. The shave is not close enough and it takes several tries to even cut normally.&lt;br /&gt;And cleaning it is a pain in the ass too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting  hair on your face is painful and it doesn&#x27;t cut right. I tried it and i got nothing. My face just got red and itchy. I have straight and soft hair that is easy to cut so if it can&#x27;t cut my facial hair then it can&#x27;t cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results are expected for the price so don&#x27;t bother even buying this. Use $1 razors for your shaving needs. That is my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the more expensive ones do a better job but this one is a bust.</li>
    <li> Good shave and no razor burn - which I get with some electric razors.  Good price too - just as good as cheap as Walmart.</li>
    <li> great shave but you can&#x27;t reassemble when cleaning it. had to throw it away after one use. shame ,it gave such a good quiet shave.</li>
    <li> He needed a new razor and my husband has luck with his Norelco brand so we purchased for my Uncle.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my grandson for Christmas and he loves He says it doesnt pull the hair on his face and he is really happy i got it for him . He likes the shape its easy to handle .Says he loves it</li>
    <li> I like it very much, it is a present for my father, and he likes it very much too. It is good!</li>
    <li> My first shave with this razor surprised me. My face felt like a babies rear end and it took less time than my expensive Braun series 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the razor was shaving around my mouth to get the same smoothness that I got on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I also miss the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very ergonomic design, easy to use and has a comfortable grip that conforms to your hand like a leather glove.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many tri-head razors in the &amp;#60;$50 category.  You cant go wrong with this one.  It is water washable and gives a good shave.  The side burn trimmer is NOT included on this model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Norelco, so it works for an alternative solution to actual shaving.  Would have preferred to get it with the trimmer option.  Battery life seems to be okay but I haven&#x27;t tested it out much.  Been a while since I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver, surprised how much time has gone by, so have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a great price and I have been really happy with how well it works, and how long the battery has lasted (between charges.)  will recommend this one to others.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving a gift certificate to Amazon, found this a reasonably priced alternative, shaves close and compact in size. Arrived promptly and works as advertised</li>
    <li> cool razor, low weight, VERY QUIET!!!, shaves sufficiently clear and does not irritate the skin. Recommended, especially for such a \\&quot;good\\&quot; price ;-)</li>
    <li> This is a product not worth the money it broke the 3rd time it was used. Won&#x27;t by another one.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase.  gives close shave.  low price.  aa+ aa+ aa+ aa+ aa+ aa+ aa+ aa+ what more can I say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the deal. It seems to do a better job than my previous Norelco rotary razor ever did!</li>
    <li> As someone with not a huge amount of facial hair but with enough that it becomes irritating, i found that it did not produce a clean shave, and i was left with quite a bit of stubble. But it is hardly noticeable and otherwise it is quick and the pivoting heads are great. The charge is more than enough to last for a week without charging shaving daily. And also it very easy to clean given that it comes with a handy brush and a cap to protect the blades. Overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> This shaver is as good as any $80 shaver that i have had. I have to have two shavers due to my dual residency so i know what I am talking about. I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> My husband travels and has found that this electric razor holds it charge, is easy to store, and is light weight.</li>
    <li> When I asked my husband if he liked his new shaver for Christmas 2012, he happily replied, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had..... it reaches and removes the longer hairs just under the chin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there we go... get one.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a replacement for another Norelco that I had. So far this has met expectations. The price from Amazon was the best I found also!</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT20 is an excellent no nonsense light-weight, basic easy-to-use razor.  This shaver gave me a repeated clean shave for the features (or lack thereof).  The cutting speed is moderate for those who are NOT in a rush to get a close shave.  It&#x27;ll give a quick 3min. charge for one shave or full 8 hour charge for a longer shave period with the convenient attachable cord (US current) charger.  There is no sideburn trimmer...although others have reported owning an upgraded Norelco model with a built-in trimmer but is barely adequate cutting at best.  I didn&#x27;t need this feature since I own an excellent professional sideburn/beard trimmer instead.  For my shaving needs I chose not to pay over $150 for a shaver brand with all the high-tech bells and whistles.  After owning a high-end Braun and Panasonic in the past, this silky smooth shaver gives me the best bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Works very well, you might have to pull your skin to tighten while you shave, but I haven&#x27;t had any pulls or irritation during and after shave. The reason I would suggest to get the more updated one with aquatec is the charge time. The PT720 has a charge time of 8 hours but the one with aquatech is only 1 hour but a bit more costly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED NORELCO SHAVERS FOREVER, BUT NO MORE.  THIS NEW ONE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A POP-UP TRIMMER.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!  GOING BACK TO TARGET TO FIND A BETTER SAVER.  OH YES, IT DOESN&#x27;T SHAVE AS GOOD AS MY OLD NORELCO.</li>
    <li> Excellent product this is my third norelco</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive shaver that uses the same HQ8 heads as much more expensive models, so it saves the same.  I bought it as a second shaver for travel.  The only drawback is that it soed not have a pop-up trimmer like its big brothers.</li>
    <li> Very supprising when open. It runs quiet but good. Just some tiny things that it falls short of.&lt;br /&gt;1. Very plastic. It doens&#x27;t seems to last. However, it is impossible to get steel for this price.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not quite confortable to hold if your hand is not big, espacially for most Asian people. It takes a while to get use to it.</li>
    <li> This razor works really well. There is no pulling on whiskers, so there is less irritation. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was so easy to shop for the razor on line instead of looking around in several stores.  The razor was exactly as pictured and described.  It arrived in a short time and I was very pleased with the transaction.</li>
    <li> China： ￥499  usa： $29.99  It works very nice.I like Philips more than Panasonic, because I am a Chinese 。I love it!</li>
    <li> works good not as close as regular razor but good enough when you are in a hurry. Easy to clean and holds charge good.</li>
    <li> It works very nice. it is good to clean and it is also very easy to clean.I like that its water-resistant.</li>
    <li> all shavers I&#x27;ve purchased from this in the netherlands located company have good charge times and batteries with a decent life cycle.</li>
    <li> I pushed into China, is actually made in china. I&#x27;m very disappointed, bought a home on the price. Waste time.</li>
    <li> I have had the same Philishave for 25 years, and am still using it (I was previously employed by Philips).  I wanted a backup because I had decided not to have this one repaired when it fails next time.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with its weight, so I will be using it when I travel instead of my &amp;#34;old reliable&amp;#34;.  It does not have all the bells and whistles but then I only need a shave occasionally.</li>
    <li> The product works fine but it lacks a trimmer head which is usually part of the Norelco ekectric shaver, and the description of the product did not disclose the absence of this feature.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The last Norelco had the blades replaced and finally stopped working in less than a year. So this is a throw away! Works for a year and then needs another one! But that&#x27;s true of all the shavers they are designed to fail in a year.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for a few months now and find it very outstanding in every way.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a side burn clipper, however I don&#x27;t ever use one anyway so the much cheaper price makes that purchase well worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimers</li>
    <li> This razor does its job, but I was disappointed to realize that it had no beard trimmer on the back.  If you read the specifications carefully, it never claims to have a beard trimmer, so I can&#x27;t complain about false advertising.  However, a beard trimmer is something I have a hard time living without.  I like the fact that you can use it either cordless or plugged in, and that it can be used even while charging.</li>
    <li> I have couple of Norelco shaver both Electric and Batteries. This model is really good and I like it for my own use and for my travel</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone who needs a pain free quick shave. The product I recieved runs too slowly to give a clean close shave. It runs quiter than other electric razors I have owned, but it just isn&#x27;t as effecient. Having said this, it could be I got a lemon, I just don&#x27;t have any way to know for sure. I am just relating my experience.</li>
    <li> Though this is definitely a no-frills product, the basics are terrific.  The battery lasts weeks before it needs re-charging, the electric motor is very quiet, and it shaves well and comfortably.  A fine buy.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, very good. My order arrived on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> This takes a little getting used to and initially your shave might not be as close, but after about two weeks it should improve. For fellow chrome-domes, this razor works very well on my head, gives me an extremely close shave. With a razor I can only get this close a shave on my head by shaving against the grain. .</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I bought a corded model of, basically,  this same razor which was more expensive. I had trouble using it because the cord is so tightly curled, I had to stand right by the outlet or it would pull out of the razor. This one, I can use anywhere, as it is cordless. The charge is long lasting, and it gives a closer shave. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This shaver, for the cost, is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s very quiet and really cuts well, WITHOUT the cuts and nicks you get from manual shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this product in time and it is a good product as described. I would recommend others to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Works ok - very close shave - no trimmer available - did not notice this on initial order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave than my old ones, but this is probably due to new shaving heads.</li>
    <li> works great.completely satisfied.this is a very good product and would recommend to my friends and family.handy,easy to clean and just great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but it doesn&#x27;t shave the smaller hairs :x it&#x27;s really easy to use though! But I rather get something that does its job.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor but missing the sideburn shaver option.  Charging light is helpful if you use this infrequently.  Battery lasts longer than expected.</li>
    <li> Had been needing a new razor and this one is perfect. It&#x27;s lightweight and holds a good charge for weeks! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very,very nice, great product! Prompt shipping!Very good price !Quality+++++++ Brand name! My grandson&#x27;s first razor!!He was really proud of this Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Much much better than my old Brown razor. So comfortable and quiet. I bought it for my dad, and start to use his from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I bought for my uncle and myself. So great a product.</li>
    <li> Looked all over this is the cheapest price found. Works great . Service was good received as stated no delays</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor that I have bought. So far I have used it once this morning (right after it arrived). The shave is as close as I have gotten with a straight-razor shaving with the grain. I would recommend this shaver to people who have sensitive skin. It provides a close-enough shave with NO IRRITATION. Also, Phillips-Norelco is an All-American company.</li>
    <li> At $24, it works well.  It&#x27;s been a while since I got a new shaver so I was getting some burn/stubble.  This shaver leaves my face very smooth for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is no flip-up trimmer.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the razor. It is a great product buy another one in the future and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This razor does a fantastic job. I bought it to replace one that lasted me twenty years, by changing out the cutter heads yearly. The Lithium-ion battery on the old one finally petered out after twenty years. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this one five stars is because the one it replaced had a flip-up side burn trimmer. This one does not. But for the price, an OUTSTANDING product!</li>
    <li> was not happy that there was not a sideburn trimmer, but that was my own fault because I did not read the description carefully enough.</li>
    <li> es un buen producto facil de usar facil de limpiar y sobretodo y lo mejor de todo es duradero, muchas gracias</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of hair, then I would recommend for your daily usage. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you want to look young like 20 years ago. It doesn&#x27;t provide the deepest shave one could ask for as it just glides the top of the beard/mustache leaving hair residue behind. I&#x27;m so sad I had to return this product as it looked so promising.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor that I have ever owned. It cuts clean and close. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> The price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so heavy and easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
    <li> My last electric was a norelco, similar cutter style. Works the same but it is very light and has improved the overall grip and cuttings access that makes this bargan price item a very competent device. Next year I will replace the cutters with the next model up which [I checked] will fit this model to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Replaced my ancient Remington with this Norelco. Only negative I can find after a few weeks is I wish it shaved just a bit closer like my Remington. That said, it gives a far more comfortable, non irritating shave than my Remi. Can clean it with running water, it&#x27;s relatively quiet. I would purchase again, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;After several months I&#x27;m even happier with this razor. I shave my head as well as my face. It holds up well, cleans incredibly easy, wish I&#x27;d given it 5 stars now!</li>
    <li> I have had this electric shaver only since October 3, 2012. It no longer works. I charged it, but it is completely silent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my friend. A few months ago, I also bought one and found it is useful. And  I am sure my friend will love this product.</li>
    <li> convenient to use, comfortable with the skin, reasonable price. Would recommend to a friend for everyday use. One drawback is that there is no trimmer on the razor!</li>
    <li> i like it it is very nice .very well.a good gift to my friend.it is really very good.the item is nice.</li>
    <li> My Norelco PT720 Razor is a good razor.....The only thing I have against it, which is my fault, it doesn&#x27;t have a sideburns trimmer......Since 1955, I have used nothing but Norelco Razors.....</li>
    <li> It works as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just prefer a blade. I thought it would take less time to shave with an electric razor but it takes about the same amount of time and it&#x27;s harder to clean an electric razor than it is to clean a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient to be able to watch TV and shave at the same time, but how often would you do that?</li>
    <li> My husband has no complaints about this shaver.  He loves the fact that it doesnt need frequent recharging, but then that&#x27;s why he keeps using Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> You get a close shave with no irritation. With its flexible, soft touch head, it&#x27;s the best shave. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake with this unit.  I should have paid more so that the unit would have the little clipper on the side for side burns.  I accept the blame for the selection</li>
    <li> got this for my teen son as a xmas gift. he figured out how to use it on his own (big plus for me), &amp; he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with it yet after 4 months of use.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product, I got it for one of my friends as gift, he like it.</li>
    <li> Ive had 10 dollar electric razors that have worked as well as this one , takes a good 10 min to shave to get a smooth shave. Not real powerfull</li>
    <li> I phase forgotten that I use the trimmer on my sideburns. I think it should be specifically noted that this shaver has no trimmer.</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco of 15 years died.  It was a &amp;#34;given&amp;#34; to order another as I knew what a pleasure it was to shave with it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had noticed that it does not have a sideburn/mustache trimmer.  Other than that I like it.  It is very quiet.</li>
    <li> I got it today and MAN! what an astonishing machine! I literally shaved in like 6 mins. Effortless, light and smooth. Love it and will keep it for a long long time. This is better than a razor! Idk why it&#x27;s getting 1 and 2 stars, b/c this is incredible!</li>
    <li> Five stars  - Great razor, easy to clean - affordable - good grip - very close shave with little effort!</li>
    <li> may friend ask me buy it for him ,he like it,so nice work and  cheap .he  will recommand another one,hope more man have it,and save your time everyday for shaving.</li>
    <li> The razor works good and is easy to clean.  Charging is easy. Next time I need to replace the razor I will get one with more features.</li>
    <li> this is the third one I bought. good price.good performance............^v^.good service. I like this shave.but why I cant submit the review</li>
    <li> I baught this razor as a gift  for some relative . can t review about its performance as  I have nt used it. Apparently as described</li>
    <li> I tried it and its soo good i think i will buy another One for my brother cuz he asked me alot about it</li>
    <li> My husband has not wanted an electric razor because they never worked well on his face. When he got this new Norelco Powertouch electric razor, he was so surprised and grateful! He loved his first shave with this razor. I&#x27;m so happy that I bought it for him. He&#x27;s been cutting himself too often with his blade razor.</li>
    <li> My dad is 84 and has cognitive issues. I bought this after looking through as many razors as I could find that would be easy for him to use and rechargeable. This is just perfect. He used it upon opening it on Christmas morning. And the extra discounts were an extra blessing.</li>
    <li> The price on this is fantastic and the charge holds for a long time. I would recommend this to anyone! Very close cutting too.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a tremendous price. Simple to use and clean. Bought for my 90+ year old uncle and he says &amp;#34;it works good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  So good, I look forward to shaving with it every day (which was not the case with my previous similar one made by another manufacturer I won&#x27;t mention)</li>
    <li> From the first shave,I knew that I had bought another great razor from Phillips. This was a replacement,for another Phillips,that had served me well for more than twenty years. Would highly recommend this razor or any of the Phillips razor line. Unit is very light but cuts my tough beard with ease. Would make a great gift. I say buy it you wont be sorry,or who ever gets as a gift.</li>
    <li> The advertising was not clear that the razor did not have a sideburn clipper on the back of it as my old razor has.  Would not have purchased this model had I known otherwise.  JEM</li>
    <li> Never used a electric razor before and im surprised by the results.  The whole battery issue is rather weak but it does give me a nice close quick shave before work.  Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts so it&#x27;s all good in my book.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, and he loved it. His face was silky smooth  and clean when he first used it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have some problems with sideburns and mustache to shave completely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dfsdfsdf&lt;br /&gt;sfsdfsdf&lt;br /&gt;dfsdfsd&lt;br /&gt;sfsdf&lt;br /&gt;sdfsdf&lt;br /&gt;sfsdf&lt;br /&gt;sfsdf&lt;br /&gt;sfsf&lt;br /&gt;sfsd</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenaged son.  He seems to like it and has not complained about it (and he&#x27;s a complainer). We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for the previous model, the 7310. The older one still worked fine even after 2 years of use but this one is upgraded to a li-ion battery which is a major upgrade. Li-ion batteries have inherently little leak down so it holds a charge a long time. Li-ion batteries also do not take a &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;, which means they will continue to fully charge and discharge for the life of the battery. You get a nice sharp new set of blades when you buy a new one, and it&#x27;s quiet smooth and sharp like the older model. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a base. It holds a charge so long it doesn&#x27;t need one taking up counter space. There may well be better electric shavers out there, but for the money, this one works just fine, thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my son. He said that we wished he could have gotten a closer shave, his beard is very course, He let my other son try it and he really liked it. Said that it was the best shave he had. His brother told him thats because your facial hair is soft and fine. Overall it is a really good shaver and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> A good priced product with a goos quality. Great for my teenager who is just starting to use a shaving machine.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor for the price, its actually a great value. I found it cheaper on Amazon than Walmart sells it for! It gives an average shave but does not have a sideburn/mustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> low price with coupon and can clean it by using water  I LOVEE IT . feel comfortable during the shaving</li>
    <li> I get a good clean shave and it is easy to maintain and clean.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I often wonder why one would want to spend anymore for a razor. This one totally does the job.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased specifically from Amazon because of lower price, and I use it to keep my head shaved. It shaves my head clean even with three days growth. No more buying haircuts!!  I would buy again</li>
    <li> The only problem I had with purchase was it came in a plastic container that was very had to open  I had to go to my nearest hardware store for them to open it up for me&lt;br /&gt;It works very nice&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the pre and after shave lotions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few electrics with the hope of getting away from the traditional razor and shaving cream method.  This has been among the best, and I find it gives a closer shave than a foil type razor such as the Panasonic ES-LT41-K which I compared it to.  However I still can&#x27;t get as good a shave as the traditional razor with any of them.  So I recommend this relative to other electrics, but it still doesn&#x27;t get all the way there to replace the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Battery was almost dead</li>
    <li> I have used it for a year and it has been very good.</li>
    <li> My husband really like this razor. He gets a close shave without the nicks.  The only thing that we did not notice when we order this razor is that it does not have the mustache trimmer. But since my husband does not have a mustache or bread, he does not really need it.  We have always had Norelco razors, big fan of them.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like it, especially when you forget to shave. Does tend to irritate my skin if used daily.</li>
    <li> I have Cerebral Palsy.  This razor is easy for me to hold. It is light weight.  It shaves great too.</li>
    <li> Very good, very clean, scraping&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;However, is less scraping sideburns.This is not as good as the previous two blades</li>
    <li> He is 13 and very excited about shaving it was a great getting him started with something he won&#x27;t cut his face on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver. If I want baby face smooth, I follow it up with a regular razor. I can get many months of use out of a manual razor that way.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas because my parents said I needed to shave more often. And im glad they got me this. It is quick and easy to use. And it also has rechargeable batteries and its portable. It does a great job and cuts very even.</li>
    <li> My son likes this product. I chose it for him because I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about it getting wet.</li>
    <li> I an 89 years old and done have full control of my shaving hand -so the electric shaver decision. Norleco is reasonably priced, functions for several days on a battery charge, anddoes a clise shave with no problems</li>
    <li> Great razor until the blades wore out.  Replacement heads lasted 2 months.  Had to throw it out.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a scaled down, inexpensive razor that shaves close but lacks a pop-up trimmer.  With the Xmas $10 off coupon, this deal was well worth the price.  BTW, it cleans with water, a real plus.</li>
    <li> This Item is perfect, very good results.  Fast work and perfect finishing. I&#x27;m using it each 3 days and my face is always clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to replace an older Norelco that he had liked quite well.  It was on sale and there was an additional savings, so I bought it for $26.  Great bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does not have the sideburn trimmer which another model PT730? has, and he does miss that.  But that model was over $10 more in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the part of my that loves a bargain price is quite happy, but the hubby who uses it is satisfied.  By the way, he keeps it plugged into the AC all the time even though it is a cordless model.  Can be used either way.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews -- I have been a blade man for 30 years and decided to switch.  This does the job that I need it to do</li>
    <li> My husband really liked the Philips Norelco Razor that I got him for Christmas.  He has used this brand in the past and likes it.  He was disappointed that it did not have a trimmer on it :(  He will have to use the trimer on his old razor.</li>
    <li> So far the razor works great.  We always buy an inexpensive Norelco and replace it after a year or two, since the cost of replacement blades is almost the same as the price of the razor.  If you require and purchase a more expensive model, perhaps the replacement blades make sense.</li>
    <li> I suppose this is a reflection of the disguised inflation in the economy, where the cereal boxes have the same price and box size but half as much cereal inside. I have been using the basic Norelco shaver for a long time, buying a new one every two years or so. I opened this one only to discover that they have eliminated the pop-up trimmer, and you have to buy one of the fancier models to get it. Color me disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I now realize what has happened. They simply raised the prices on all models about $10. So, I used to be able to afford the one with the trimmer, but now, for the same price, I&#x27;m getting the lower model which does not include it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that there  wasn&#x27;t a blade for edging; however ,Razor performs very well. Good product for it&#x27;s price and value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for a quick shave but it isn&#x27;t going to get you even close to what a higher-end razor or blade will. Also doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer, which for me is a must, good thing I kept my old one that had a trimmer. All in all, not bad for a cheap raxor.</li>
    <li> The price is very good, The whole body can be washed,to send friends new year gift, friends are like,Next time to buy</li>
    <li> I have always used Phillips Norelco electric razors since 1967. I was used to having the build-in trimmer. This model does not. This is the only reason I gave it only three stars. I should have looked closer at the photos to see if it had a trimmer, All my previous ones did have the trimmer. I really think the manufacture has lost their edge with technology. If you are looking for Phillips Norelco razor, be sure you look closely to see if it has a trimmer build-in.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my father, he says it works very well and he is glad he got it.</li>
    <li> this is actually the fourth razor i bought for my friends and families, we like philips, the battery last extremely long and it cuts clean and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband for Christmas. He doesn&#x27;t grow a lot of facial hair :) He hasn&#x27;t had to recharge it since the initial charge back in December and he said it works great for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years and would have no other.  This one is smooth in use and quiet, The battery lasts a long&lt;br /&gt;time between chargings. A very good product</li>
    <li> If you have skin that is prone to ingrown hair, (thanks Dad!) then this razor is for you.  I have problems with shaving with manual razors on a daily basis.  They irritate my skin and can cause ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After comparing this model with the next step up, the Philips Norelco PT730, I determined that this was what I needed.  The ComfortCut does not give you the absolute closest shave, but it is adequate for looking professional. It does not cut the hair under the skin, which is the problem I sought to avoid. The next style, the Super Lift &amp; Cut, would be too close a shave for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all you with tough skin, this will help to avoid those pesky ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. It charges good and lasts for awhile without the charger. Its a smooth shave. Hubby has yet to have any issues with this razor.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe how close to a blade shave this is. I would say that this is good for traveling and touch up. It takes longer to get a smooth shave than by using a razor, but you definitely can get a smooth shave. Never had an electric razor that I thought gave a good shave before.</li>
    <li> Though little expensive.. not so bad&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to clean and is ok to use in China&lt;br /&gt;220V 50Hz</li>
    <li> Good shaver and at a good price.  Recommend to anyone needing a value priced shaver with good quality.  Works great</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything I need and is very efficient.  It&#x27;s low cost makes it a bargain and is well made.</li>
    <li> First, my qualifications:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned about 4 or 5 other shavers - Braun, panasonic, remington etc.. Rotating cylindrical cutter type, foil (remington) type etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington was not very good - noisy and annoying to use. It was not even wet dry at that time.&lt;br /&gt;The panasonic and braun - both were wet/dry - gave very close shaves and were nice.. but my skin is used to Norelco. I am more comfortable norelco - only because I am used to its rotary heads.. If you are just starting out, the Braun and Panasonic would work just fine for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to Norelco..&lt;br /&gt;History: There were no \\&quot;floating\\&quot; or \\&quot;flexing\\&quot; heads. No wet/dry. Those type of norelcos worked very well, even dry. They were a bit more \\&quot;bulky\\&quot; compared to current gen models but they worked just fine, dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave with rotary norelco is more preferable to me. I bought into the hype of \\&quot;new generation\\&quot; norelcos for past 10 years and have been dissatisfied with them.. I don&#x27;t like this fully flexing heads.. the flexing actually makes shaving more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned these \\&quot;contouring\\&quot; type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006W2SYHG Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor, Frustration Free Packaging]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the predecessor to this&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006W2SYHG Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor, Frustration Free Packaging]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First.. The 3 dimensional contouring is, in my opinion, a detriment. They flex too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse is the new norelco design which where the 3 cutting shields are now half with line pattern and half with hole pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the fully diagonal line pattern is preferable to me.. The tiny holes are making me miss hair and I have to go back and forth over and over, much more than the older design of the 100% diagonal line pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY.. I was pleasantly surprised to see this model.. for only $42.. and it has the old type cutting shields.. I used it and it works very well! It&#x27;s head does not \\&quot;float\\&quot; and it gives me better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that, when you wash it, it actually holds more water in the cutting chamber - which drips onto hand and counter.. How ever, I find it to be far superior to the $100 to $200 norelco models.. Yes, those are more \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; and \\&quot;sleek\\&quot;  but this cheap model, I find, is much better than those.. Norelco&#x27;s marketing team seems to have messed up the original, well working design.. Hey Norelco.. in case you actually read amazon reviews...  when it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it! You had an amazing shaver and you screwed it up.. 3D contouring? Come on.. Fortunately, you came up with this cheap model - as good as your original!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, that norelco got me, with their marketing hype, for past 10 to 12 years.. with the newer models! I guess they won.. because they sold me 5 or 6 expensive models..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks.. don&#x27;t be concerned that this is cheap. Don&#x27;t fall for the gimmicks of floating heads or 3D contouring etc.. This cheap Norelco, is one of the best of my recent memory.. even if it is less \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; looking.. In fact, I bought a second today, for my travel kit..</li>
    <li> Does not have trimmer which I miss from my last one. Does a good job on beard and quieter.&lt;br /&gt;Fine if you just want a shave and no trim.</li>
    <li> purchased this for my husband who uses it every day-and hasn&#x27;t complained&lt;br /&gt;We were happy to find it for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> It operates well but seems a bit bulky. Sideburn trimmer would have been helpful. It is very similar to an older model I possess. The older Norelco works well but I felt a backup would be helpful.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an electric razor for convenience and this definitely works great. Water seems to go into the razor and come back out but i guess it was designed that way. It still works fine after many rinses. Gives me a smooth shave and it stays charged a good amount of time. Makes me wonder why i never got an electric razor before. After clipping coupons and using amazon credit I was able to get this for a nice deal of about $15.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son as Christmas gift - he loves it - so convenient - especially for a neophyte shaver!!</li>
    <li> i choose 5 star because this razor is really great, is perfect for travels and easy to transport. amazing value</li>
    <li> I love it and use it all the time, and it was a great for me to use.I do recommened it to all.</li>
    <li> I used to have a similiar razor but it had more bells and whistles than this one.  I thought it was a good buy.  Does the job reasonably well.  Can use this many times before you have to recharge it.  I would defintely buy another when the need arises.</li>
    <li> The description doesn&#x27;t warn you, but this razor has no trimmer for your sideburns. I had to return it and pay the return shipping. Amazon, how about better descriptions, including what features things don&#x27;t have?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one in the last 12 years, that&#x27;s pretty good these days. This basic model actually shaves better than the last one I had. I use it on head. And face daily. Holds a charge well and a minimum of bells and whistles to go wrong. Buy a new blade set annually and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I use this and it provides a good shave, but really miss the trimmer of my old razor. The unit charges fast and will shave for weeks before another charge.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaver for my 15 year old son.  He doesn&#x27;t have much to shave, mostly a skimpy mustache and sparsely populated hairs across the remainder of areas normally shaved.  He does he have to shave often, maybe once a week at this point but he certainly does have to shave without looking like a bum.  But it does a very good, comfortable job for him.  Needless to say it&#x27;s easier for him to learn with than a razor.  He has a mild issue with acne at this age.  An electric shaver allows him to NOT use creams that agitate the acne and does not irritate or cut the bumps.  A great razor for a young man at a very low price.  Vendor did a good job of packaging and shipping.  Everything expected from a vendor online.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money,works just as good as $200,00 razors!!You will not be dissapointed!Try it,you will see for your self!</li>
    <li> it should have a trimmer I have had three Norelco shavers and they all have had a trimmer I don&#x27;t care for the pt720 for this reason</li>
    <li> Shaves about as close as I would expect for an electric.  Probably takes longer than a razor because I have to go over the stubble again and again to get it all.  Holds a charge amazingly long.</li>
    <li> The Name.I Picked up another shaver and it Stopped running in one year.This one has a three year replacement .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say yes buy one.Its GREAT.  MIKE</li>
    <li> I have never owned any razor other than Norelco - I am a solid believer in their razors.  However, i went less expensive on this purchase and am paying the &amp;#34;price&#x27; for not doing so. Reminded me to buy the top-of-line series and not a less costly one.  It is a BASIC only electric razor.</li>
    <li> More cheaper  than in China .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better qulity than in China as same brand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it can be washing........amazing......</li>
    <li> This Is a really nice shaver. It&#x27;s light and feels nice In your hand. The on/off switch sometimes gets In the way but after you get used to It you will automatically avoid It.&lt;br /&gt;This thing has one of the longest charging batteries I have ever come across. Sometime I don&#x27;t remember the last time I charged It. It goes on and on just like that rabbit drummer does.&lt;br /&gt;I have not regret buying It and for me right now It was a bit pricy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice machine,</li>
    <li> Use this almost daily, refuses to quit, and blades still are sharp !!&lt;br /&gt;Looks like Norelco does NOT want to sell me another one because this will last forever !!&lt;br /&gt;Thax.</li>
    <li> nunca habia usado afeitadora electrica y decidi probar con esta y me encanta es pequeña y muy practica tiene lo  basico</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers, in the past, and always thought &#x27;more money means a better shaver&#x27;. Not so this shaver. Other shavers costing 3 or 4 times more are not as good. They may have more bells and whistles, but I don&#x27;t need a shaver with &#x27;power windows and air conditioning&#x27;. I just want one that shaves my face comfortably. The pt720 fulfills this requirement.</li>
    <li> Good basic rotary razor. No trimmer included, but it shaves great like I&#x27;d expect from a Philips Norelco. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I got my first Norelco shaver in 1967 as a Christmas gift and it gave me many years of excellent shaves.  Had a few other Norelcos since that were excellent.  NOT this one!  I don&#x27;t want a five-o-clock shadow a couple hours after I shave.  My face is rough immediately after using.  Unfortunately I misplaced my receipt so can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Expected a close shave machine and did not meet my expectation and I had to shave twice a day plus there is a odor  to it which I did not care for.I have owned Norelco before and those were fine.I have owned it for a month and I am returning it.</li>
    <li> This popped up one day in my email.  I looked it over and thought \\&quot;why not\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Lightweight - says it all&lt;br /&gt;  Ergonomic - easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;  Efficient Power - recharges fast&lt;br /&gt;  Friendly - easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  No pop trimmer&lt;br /&gt;  Miss my old coiled cord&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t care for the shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a disposable razor in the shower.  I can run my hand over my face and know where I missed.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On rare occasions, I need a quick shave and a shower isn&#x27;t an option.  This is when I turn to the Norelco.  It does not shave as close as a razor, and I really wanted the pop-up trimmer.  I poured over the ad before ordering, and the information was ambivalent, that is, unclear as to whether it had a trimmer or not.  Guess that makes me an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has been a good razor, just not good enough.</li>
    <li> I bought it in 24 $, good price. The product was made well, good gift for father. I am thinking to buy another for my father- in- law.</li>
    <li> still prefer shaving with a razor, but useful for a quick shave late in the day or when I am not taking a shower</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased and I love this kind of shaver. First, It is convenience and tough that I can carry around without charging it for few days . Second, It is very reasonable price to afford.&lt;br /&gt;After few uses I can open shaver top cover and rinse it with water.&lt;br /&gt; My first one I still using since 2007 and have no problem at all.This Norelco brand is absolutely a true brand shaver. This is the one I will recommend it for anyone who looking for an affordable shaver and last longer than expectation&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon &amp; I rate it for incredible shipping and delivering item right on Christmas Eve</li>
    <li> It is so nice , my husband  uses it everyday from the day we received it. He loves it so much</li>
    <li> Does a great job,on sale cheap and well worth the money,,Holds a charge for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were to break would buy another</li>
    <li> I liked the price for a good name brand razor. My Dad loved it! So far it has been giving him a nice clean and easy shave.</li>
    <li> Wit the $ 10.00 instant coupon it was a good deal, I did not realize that it did not have a built in trimmer, my fault for not reading the page better, but my last 4 razors all had them so I assumed that it was pretty much a standard feature. Other than that it shaves well and that&#x27;s what its suppose to do</li>
    <li> I purchased this item just before Christmas.  I knew it was not a top of the line shaver, but needed something cordless for quick shaves.  The battery life is great, lasting many shaves.  BUT, IT IS TERRIBLE AT SHAVING.  I have to go back over my face many time for it to shave any beard, and even then, it still leaves stubble that every other razor I have used over the past 45 years has gotten.  I contacted Norelco and chatted with one of their reps., Richard, who kept just telling me what was written on the box about flexible heads shaving close and were washable.  Evidently didn&#x27;t think I could read what was written on the box.  He never did address the problem.  Choose a different model or brand if you want a shaver that works and don&#x27;t expect much from Noelco if you have a problem.</li>
    <li> I love Norelco shavers and this one does not disappoint</li>
    <li> Light and noiseless shaver.....Do a pretty good job in shaving those contours in the face...Good for the price and reliable</li>
    <li> Its good but the quality of material is not good. Also would like that its not that good for harder hairs......</li>
    <li> Nice Razor for the price  However, it doesnt have the trimmer attachment (for sideburns etc)  like the last model I had did (I assumed they all had this feature)  Guess I will read b4 I buy next time......always a good idea anyway</li>
    <li> Great fast and clean cut.  Cheaper to purchase a new razor every other year than to bury replacements blades. ***</li>
    <li> best shave i&#x27;ve gotten in a while. Brings me back to the days when i was smooth like a baby.</li>
    <li> Use is still very smooth, the charging time is a bit long to do?Should initially choose AT810.But I still give 5 Star Rating.</li>
    <li> Great razor and a great price. I bought it for my husband and he is very satisfied with it. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my son, and he seems to really like it.  He is very picky so I was a little concerned that he might not like it.  But he told me that it&#x27;s just been great, and gives a nice close shave.  Without cutting him.  I purchased this shaver from amazon.</li>
