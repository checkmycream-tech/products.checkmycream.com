    <li> Love this, sorry to hear that is is discontinued! Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the small amount of salicylic acid - it keeps my face from being oily.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for my oily skin. I use it everyday and my face does not peel. I carry it everywhere I go, for it&#x27;s more practical than using a special soap. Not to mention also faster.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Mary Kay but serves is slowly mailed.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to order, price was great and arrived on time and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect toner for oily skin. It removes all the dirt that stays in the pores even after washing your face several times and prepares the skin for moisturizer. I could compare it to clinic lotions from 3 step skin care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MK for many years since the 90s and will always use their wonderful products.  The best thing about the company is that they DO NOT USE ANIMAL TESTING and I will buy and endorse them for life.</li>
    <li> Love this great stuff. My pore look so much smaller the next day looks like I have flawless skin</li>

    <li> I HAVE CHOSEN THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE MY SKIN IS VERY OILY DURING THE SUMMER.&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH MY SKIN IS SUPER SENSITIVE, SINCE THE SUMMER MONTHS INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION. IT IS WONDERFUL. I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH TWO EXTRA LAYERS OF OIL ON MY FACE. MY CONFIDENCE HAS INCREASED SKY HIGH, I AM BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Definitely not new (which is what I ordered).  The liquid is not all the way to the top of the bottle, and I wonder how much water or alcohol was added to it.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Mary Kay. All my face products are Mary Kay. I use this twice a day and it really seems to help. I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> this toner is the BEST. i love it. use it twice a day. nothing compares to it . will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only toner that I use on my sensitive dry skin. The product is as described and portrayed in the image. I use it on my freshly cleansed face at least twice a day as a recommendation from SHANEL COOPER SYKES. This product last me for at least 4 months.</li>
    <li> Zaps zits like nothing else!</li>
