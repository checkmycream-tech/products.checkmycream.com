      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>For those who reviewed it and said it didn&#x27;t cover certain areas, I think they may not have wrapped it correctly because it worked great for me!</li>
      <li>What an amazing change for my hair routine as well as for my nightly sleep.</li>
      <li>If you heat up the gel packs per the directions it takes awhile for them to warm</li>
      <li>Nice product for the price.</li>
      <li>Also, the pads don&#x27;t seem to get as warm as I&#x27;d like them to.</li>
      <li>do my own color at home between getting the bleach touched up to save money and this thing is an A+ for me.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use in the shower.</li>
      <li>I like using this better than warm towels.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!</li>
      <li>It is very comfortable the way it is designed to wrap around with the straps.  </li>
      <li>Heated up easily and kept warm on my head for quite some time.</li>
      <li>but I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>a final note I would like to thank both Nikia and Michelle from Brushlove for all their wonderful help and support.</li>
      <li>So I was wasting time heating towels and wrapping it making sure it didn&#x27;t get in my face while I was doing things around the house and all that jazz.</li>
      <li>Hmm, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>and I love treating my hair with &#x27;goodies&#x27; on a weekly basis.</li>
      <li>On top of all this I use a microfiber towel followed by the Hair Therapy Wrap.</li>
      <li>Perfect for deep conditioning my hair while Im on the go getting things done around the house</li>
      <li>I feel like the mask penetrates better.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I needed heat in my regimen and its better than the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Though I liked this just ok it takes special skill to use.</li>
      <li>The heat packs stay nice and toasty for the amount of time I use the wrap, which is about 20 minutes, and since you wear a disposable cap underneath, the wrap stays clean.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good</li>
      <li>Delivery came very quick.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use and truly aids to moisturize your hair</li>
      <li>They were easy to insert with tongs into the wrap.</li>
      <li>So easy to use I&#x27;m doing this every week</li>
      <li>Pretty good conditioning cap, heats up quickly and stays warms for about 1/2 hour but does the job well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly what it says and it does an amazing job.</li>
      <li>There are 2 ties that you have to wrap around the cap to secure it.</li>
      <li>You are free to walk around and do whatever you need to.</li>
      <li>It should fit anyone - my situation is really unique</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot on the top, and doesn&#x27;t wrap as per the photo</li>
      <li>Also when you warm it up it gets warm in sections and not really all over.  </li>
      <li>great for hot oil treatments or deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>My hair loved it but the next day I would feel like I have run an all night marathon...</li>
      <li>Very convenient to be able to walk around etc.</li>
      <li>This hair wrap works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and not difficult whatsoever to tie.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s only for one hour and since the Hair Therapy Wrap allows you free movement one hour passes rather quickly while catching up with house chores.  </li>
      <li>After messing about with hot towels, hair dryers, and table-top hood dryers, I wish I&#x27;d discovered this years ago!</li>
      <li>It is affordable and worth buying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can put the entire wrap in the microwave to heat, without having to take the heating packages out.</li>
      <li>it was worth the prices too.</li>
      <li>It works greats and this makes my hair soooo soft and healthy..</li>
      <li>My hair was soft and moisturized and I felt this was easy to use and clean up.  </li>
      <li>and then the don&#x27;t seem warm enough on the head.</li>
      <li>You could probably get the same effect if you wrap your hair in a warm towel.</li>
      <li>I have used this product once and so far I love it.</li>
      <li>This was very much worth the money.</li>
      <li>It stayed fitted on my head just right as well.</li>
      <li>With this wrap I am able to condition my hair more often and with a lot less hassle.</li>
      <li>With such great customer service I will definitely shop again with confidence.</li>
      <li>My hair felt very conditioned and soft after using it and I imagine that any conditioner I use will be better if I use this wrap.</li>
      <li>but you probably don&#x27;t need it as hot.</li>
      <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as an overhead hair dryer</li>
      <li>I recently tried boiling the packets instead of heating them in the microwave, and the results were much better (heat-wise).</li>
      <li>Seemed to heat all over pretty evenly.  </li>
      <li>then it will be too hot and burn your ears.  </li>
      <li>I suggest getting the Gold N Hot Conditioning cap that plugs in.  </li>
      <li>I do need to place it in the microwave for a longer duration than when first got it, but it works for what I need it for.</li>
      <li>That overhead always hurt anyways...too hot.</li>
      <li>After applying my hair oil treatment I put on a shower cap first which secures my hair in place, followed my cellophane wrap and another shower cap.</li>
      <li>This works exactly as it says...</li>
      <li>I saw the difference after the first use, my hair was a lot softer, shinier and freeze</li>
      <li>I was able to do home cleaning while doing my deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>This product is a good idea, but one size does not fit all.  </li>
      <li>Just wearing this for one hour after applying my hair oil treatment gives even better results than having to twist and turn all night long with a double sized head :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like peroxide hair dye in that the longer you leave it in and the more open your hair pores, the more vibrant &amp; longer lasting the color.  </li>
      <li>Much easier than a hot towel.</li>
      <li>Now, I have very long hair and the foils make it so that the wrap does not make it 100% around my head - more like 80%.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So easy to use, while at the hair salon effects, such as taking care of&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
      <li>Although it was still a little warm to the touch (hand not head)</li>
      <li>Cap was delivered rather fast.</li>
      <li>so i was very upset.</li>
      <li>,that&#x27;s why i gave it a four, i love pink</li>
      <li>I really like this wrap.  </li>
      <li>I am Caucasian with a waist line dyed blond and naturally straight hair</li>
      <li>It makes using heat-activated conditioning treatments SO much easier.</li>
      <li>I have used this for a few months and the gel packs don&#x27;t spread evenly over your head and they don&#x27;t feel too warm either.</li>
      <li>I DON&#x27;T make a turbie when putting the microfiber towel on, I just place it on my shoulders and then wrap the right and left sides flat on top of my head.</li>
      <li>The microfiber towel will not only keep in the heat longer but it may also offer a good solution for those with sensitive ears who may find the Hair Therapy Wrap a little bit on the hot side when first putting it on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product at least once a week to do a hot coconut oil treatment on my hair. I love it!!!!!!!!! Much easier than a hot towel.</li>
    <li> It works great with any conditioner, oil, hair home brews, etc.  I used it with a leaving in conditioner and it work great.</li>
    <li> The instructions were a bit difficult to understand but once I figured it out it was great! Heated up easily and kept warm on my head for quite some time. I only kept it on for about 30 minutes but could have kept it longer as the heat was still there. I plan to use this every week when I wash my hair. My hair felt very conditioned and soft after using it and I imagine that any conditioner I use will be better if I use this wrap. It stayed fitted on my head just right as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this wrap.  It does exactly what it states on the package and it covered my whole head of long hair.  For those who reviewed it and said it didn&#x27;t cover certain areas, I think they may not have wrapped it correctly because it worked great for me!</li>
    <li> Delivery came very quick. Used it the same week. I was able to do home cleaning while doing my deep conditioner. So easy to use I&#x27;m doing this every week knowing I can do other things at the same time. I even did a youtube video about it on Jeanica2Natural channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I wait this long to order it??</li>
    <li> I have used this product once and so far I love it. The product is easy to use and truly aids to moisturize your hair</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months and the gel packs don&#x27;t spread evenly over your head and they don&#x27;t feel too warm either. You could probably get the same effect if you wrap your hair in a warm towel.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once.  I boiled water and let the gel pads sit in the water for 4 mins.  (Scared to go to long at first). They were easy to insert with tongs into the wrap. I then put it on my head for about 15 min. Although it was still a little warm to the touch (hand not head) I decided to then insert the entire wrap in the microwave and heated for about 30 secs and then replaced on my head for and additional 10 min. My hair was soft and moisturized and I felt this was easy to use and clean up.  It did the same as a professional steamer would do.</li>
    <li> Hmm, it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s definately not for someone with a big headful of natural 3c/4b curls. I used it on my prepoo and it didn&#x27;t reach to the back of my head. I do like that you don&#x27;t have to plug it in. You are free to walk around and do whatever you need to. I will definately give it another chance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really done heated deep conditioning before, but I&#x27;ve been experimenting to find something that can help tame the frizz and strengthen my hair. While the concept of the cap is nice, it seems poorly designed. Contrary to what&#x27;s pictured, it&#x27;s open in the back and has a strap on either side that you cross in the back and wrap around to velcro in the front. However, the heated pads that you put inside only really run along the top and sides, so the back doesn&#x27;t get the heat, which is my biggest problem area. I have pretty long, very thick hair, and the heat isn&#x27;t getting evenly distributed to all parts of it. Also, the pads don&#x27;t seem to get as warm as I&#x27;d like them to. While I suppose I could heat them in the microwave longer, I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll burst every time I heat them. On the plus side, it&#x27;s practical to use, and I can just stick it on and go about my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** I recently tried boiling the packets instead of heating them in the microwave, and the results were much better (heat-wise). The design still sucks, but at least it gets sufficiently warm, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them blowing up in the microwave.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Perfect for deep conditioning my hair while Im on the go getting things done around the house</li>
    <li> Pretty good conditioning cap, heats up quickly and stays warms for about 1/2 hour but does the job well. Cap was delivered rather fast.</li>
    <li> I use this product to do deep conditioners and oil treatments on my hair. Great product. Performs just as indicated.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed heat in my regimen and its better than the blow dryer. Does the job. I got it when I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy a hair steamer as well and having this and noticing the difference in my scalp encouraged me to also invest Ina steamer. That being said this wrap still will be in my regimen mainly for its convenience.</li>
    <li> This wrap does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot on the top, and doesn&#x27;t wrap as per the photo but I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can move around and not sit in one spot while conditioning my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Need something that was simple to use and could be carried during my travels.  Love this, simple and easy to use and still allows me to get my weekly deep treatment with little hassle.</li>
    <li> It sucks. it is difficult to evenly warm the gel packets and the wrap does not wrap around your hair evenly so a patch of hair is always left out in the cold. Complete waste of money, I should have gotten a hooded dryer....</li>
    <li> I bought it to add a extra flare to my clients while they were at the bowl with conditioner in their hair, but It doesn&#x27;t get hot evenly and it burns their skin... I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy on the head which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Also I have extremely long hair so that might be another reason why it&#x27;s a bit heavy once I tuck all my hair up. I like using this better than warm towels. I feel like the mask penetrates better.</li>
    <li> I saw a review on this on YouTube and had to buy it. It doesn&#x27;t exactly what it says and it does an amazing job. I wish it heated the back of my head too but switch it around it gets to it</li>
    <li> I use this to deep-condition my hair but it is a &amp;#34;bit of a pain&amp;#34; to use. The size says&amp;#34; fits all&amp;#34; but it is too big and no matter how tight you try to get the velcro strips, it slips down. I have to heat it twice in the microwave as it needs to be turned over and re-positioned to get all of the heat packs done evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I have to hold it in place the entire time that it is on as it will slip and flop around. It could be made a little different to stay on the head.</li>
    <li> I like the wrap, there is definitely a difference with oil treatments. Works great when warming pads are heated in steps (just like the instructions says).</li>
    <li> Though I liked this just ok it takes special skill to use. If you heat up the gel packs per the directions it takes awhile for them to warm and then the don&#x27;t seem warm enough on the head. You then have to unzip them from the casing and heat up longer, guessing how it will actually be on your head. Unfortunately like many others after about my 7th or 8th use I burned one of the pack squares. It was otherwise convenient to use and not be tethered by a cord</li>
    <li> Who likes sitting under the hair dryer? I don&#x27;t. With this wrap I am able to condition my hair more often and with a lot less hassle. This was very much worth the money. Of course it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as an overhead hair dryer but you probably don&#x27;t need it as hot. That overhead always hurt anyways...too hot.</li>
    <li> I like the hair therapy wrap, it stays heated for about 20 minutes. But you have to reheat it if you want to go longer than 20 minutes. Nice product for the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold heat long.  Really heavy.  Really awkward and cumbersome to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really hated it.</li>
    <li> As a curly girl, I&#x27;m thrilled to have discovered this product! It makes using heat-activated conditioning treatments SO much easier. The heat packs are warmed in the microwave; I heat mine for the maximum 80 seconds to reach the desired temperature. The heat packs are placed inside the wrap for heating, then you wear the wrap over a plastic shower cap. The heat packs stay nice and toasty for the amount of time I use the wrap, which is about 20 minutes, and since you wear a disposable cap underneath, the wrap stays clean. After messing about with hot towels, hair dryers, and table-top hood dryers, I wish I&#x27;d discovered this years ago!</li>
    <li> I just used this product today. I made the mistake and did not insert the middle heat pack correctly. Once i figured it out how to work it was wonderful. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hate this product.  I have a big head and it did not cover the front or the back of my head.  Also when you warm it up it gets warm in sections and not really all over.  If you heat it up again so it can heat up all over then it will be too hot and burn your ears.  I suggest getting the Gold N Hot Conditioning cap that plugs in.  Now that is a good one.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers mentioned, the heat packs do not come down far enough to cover the whole back of the head, but there is enough room to pile hair up on top and get the heat that way. It&#x27;s nice that you can put the entire wrap in the microwave to heat, without having to take the heating packages out.</li>
    <li> No need to sit under the dryer...just heat the therapy wrap and off you go!  This works exactly as it says...great for hot oil treatments or deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> This product is a good idea, but one size does not fit all.  If you have long and / or thick hair, this cap will not fit ! ! !  This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ask for pink one and i got a white one,that&#x27;s why i gave it a four, i love pink so i was very upset.</li>
    <li> This hair wrap works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and not difficult whatsoever to tie.  It&#x27;s relaxing, particularly when things are cold around the house.</li>
    <li> Great for those that need to condition and keep moving.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day. I have not used anything else but I am very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> It works greats and this makes my hair soooo soft and healthy.. A great product and it was worth the prices too. I would so recommend this product to the world</li>
    <li> I am an African American female with natural 4b hair. My hair tends to be very dry. After using the heat cap along with my deep conditioner, my hair was very soft and manageable. I definitely prefer using the heat cap and skip the hasle of sitting under a hooded dryer. I highly  recommend this product. It exceeded my expectations. I absolutely love it! It is affordable and worth buying.</li>
    <li> This item IS NOT the same. There are 2 ties that you have to wrap around the cap to secure it. It&#x27;s not tight enough for my head. Also, I have to wear the cap incorrectly to get heat to all of my hair and even then, there will ALWAYS be a part of my hair that doesn&#x27;t get heat because of the poor design of the cap. I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product but I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should post a picture of the back of this cap. It does not get heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product IF you would like your entire head of hair to receive heat.</li>
    <li> After second used it burn a hole wild being in the microwave for 60sec un reuseable. :-( lesson learn next one I buy will be electric.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian with a waist line dyed blond and naturally straight hair and I love treating my hair with &#x27;goodies&#x27; on a weekly basis. Overnight hair oil treatments used to be somewhat of a nightmare having to sleep with shower caps, cellophane wrap and towels over my head. My hair loved it but the next day I would feel like I have run an all night marathon... all until I discovered Hair Therapy Wrap. What an amazing change for my hair routine as well as for my nightly sleep. Just wearing this for one hour after applying my hair oil treatment gives even better results than having to twist and turn all night long with a double sized head :-) I saw the difference after the first use, my hair was a lot softer, shinier and freeze free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I manage to maintain the heat for at least 45 minutes by using a microfiber towel which is thin and thus allowing the cap to sit on my head perfectly. I am normally a size M/L in hats. After applying my hair oil treatment I put on a shower cap first which secures my hair in place, followed my cellophane wrap and another shower cap. On top of all this I use a microfiber towel followed by the Hair Therapy Wrap. The microfiber towel will not only keep in the heat longer but it may also offer a good solution for those with sensitive ears who may find the Hair Therapy Wrap a little bit on the hot side when first putting it on. I DON&#x27;T make a turbie when putting the microfiber towel on, I just place it on my shoulders and then wrap the right and left sides flat on top of my head. It is indeed quite a heavy ensemble but it&#x27;s only for one hour and since the Hair Therapy Wrap allows you free movement one hour passes rather quickly while catching up with house chores.  I am actually thinking now about getting a microfiber or a fleece/cotton blend beanie/skullcap to replace the towel and thus reducing the weight on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure to follow the heating instructions for the gel pads with no more than80 seconds total heating time. I microwave the gel pads inside the Hair Therapy Wrap slots for 30 seconds, then I wait 30 seconds, I microwave them for another 30 seconds, give it another 30 seconds break and then a final heating session for 20 seconds. During the 30 seconds breaks I turn the Hair Therapy Wrap in the microwave to ensure an equal heat distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you will have an accident with the gel pads during the heating process you can always purchase a new set from brushlove.com, the Hair Therapy Wrap manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note I would like to thank both Nikia and Michelle from Brushlove for all their wonderful help and support. With such great customer service I will definitely shop again with confidence.</li>
    <li> This hair wrap works great!  It is just what I needed to start deep conditioning my hair.  It is very easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about year now and it still works well for deep conditioning.  I do need to place it in the microwave for a longer duration than when first got it, but it works for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> To be a genius and the person who created this&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use, while at the hair salon effects, such as taking care of&lt;br /&gt;Look at the microwave in 1 minute and 30 seconds, turn the head on TV or write a book.&lt;br /&gt;No need to change the batteries do not have restrictions on the movement. There&#x27;s no need to charge</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars because this cap is great.  I purchased it to use with my black castro tropical oil hair growth product.  It is very comfortable the way it is designed to wrap around with the straps.  I place cap in microwave for 45 seconds and put over my shower cap so I don&#x27;t get the oil all over the cap.  It fits comfotable and snug.  You can adjust to your specific needs.  I recommend this cap for anyone that uses deep conditioning or hot oil treatments that require heat.</li>
    <li> I use Manic Panic to semi-permanently dye my hair blue.  This is the PERFECT product for that process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not familiar with the process of the \\&quot;funky\\&quot; hair colors, you have to have your dark hair lightened to blonde then you apply the color dye.  It&#x27;s not like peroxide hair dye in that the longer you leave it in and the more open your hair pores, the more vibrant &amp; longer lasting the color.  It works like a conditioner almost.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to wrap their head in cling wrap &amp; sleep in the color...  we&#x27;re not called \\&quot;DYE HARDS\\&quot; for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cap&#x27;s awesome.  At the salon, the process is faster because they park me under a dryer for 30 minutes.  For this item I just put my hair in foils, put 2 shower caps on, then heat it up with the wrap.  Now, I have very long hair and the foils make it so that the wrap does not make it 100% around my head - more like 80%.  To solve this, and since the process is longer, I just reverse the cap every other \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; - 30 minutes face front, 30 minutes face reverse, repeat 2x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing&#x27;s so awesome.  I won&#x27;t even get into how I tried heating up my hair at home without a salon dryer - it&#x27;s too embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my own color at home between getting the bleach touched up to save money and this thing is an A+ for me.  It should fit anyone - my situation is really unique an it does have a work-around so still 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female with 4a/4b natural hair and whenever I deep conditioned my mother always told me to do it &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; since we didn&#x27;t have a dryer. So I was wasting time heating towels and wrapping it making sure it didn&#x27;t get in my face while I was doing things around the house and all that jazz. I purchased this and it&#x27;s no hassle at all!!!! Just heat it up strap it on and go about your business! I love it and I feel like I&#x27;m getting the same amount of heat treatment as if I was under the dryer!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! Every female in my house is thinking of buying one now! &amp;#60;333</li>
    <li> Was just what I expected.  Works pretty good but only holds heat for about 10 - 15 minutes.  I had to re-heat.  Seemed to heat all over pretty evenly.  Very convenient to be able to walk around etc.</li>
