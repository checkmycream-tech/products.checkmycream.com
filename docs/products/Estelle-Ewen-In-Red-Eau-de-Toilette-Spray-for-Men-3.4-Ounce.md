<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. I SMELLED IT IN THE STORE AND IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME. I AM VERY SADDENED BY THE SMELL OF THIS. LIKE PEPPER! :(</li>
    <li> Like the smell is not very strong so you have to put on a lot</li>
    <li> Very weak fragrance. I can&#x27;t smell it once I put it on.</li>
    <li> I smell nice and girls of all ages stand close to me when I wear this. Great buy</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne! And on Amazon, you get it for the best price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I live it and my bf loves it. He wears it everyday. This is amazing everyone should get it. It came on time and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but is a little more subtle than I would like. Doesn&#x27;t last particularly long, maybe on the short side, but for how good it smells the price is good, just be sure to spray lots of it very often!</li>
    <li> I have brought this fragrance from them in blue and it is just as nice,  thank you</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell. This is a keeper, long term. I like to find those unique smells and this is a great adult scent.</li>
    <li> Delicious manly smell</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume. Heard of it from a friend of mine, bought it without even smelling it. Best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever had and super cheap. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Smells really good , boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> The product smells devine. I was going to get it for my boyfriend, unfortunately I never received it. I have waited for almost a month to receive the product, I have emailed the seller, I have done everything I can think of to get it, but it still hasn&#x27;t come. Buy this at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Its okay smells good not to strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because this is his favorite!  Oh boy does it smell wonderful to!! wow wow</li>
    <li> I love unique smells and lets be honest... Mens cologne pretty much all has the same undertone of manly-ness that is boring to women. A lot of cologne that smells like a teenage boys surf shop (Pac Sun, i&#x27;m looking at your line-up of cologne, and cough cough* Hollister) and a lot of cologne (no matter how expensive) smells like dollar store \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; cologne, which to me just smells like cheap, alcohol with cowboy undertones that burns the nostrils with its overbearing musk. And then there is the middle ground of Adidas cologne which is aimed at the sporty type. Too me it just reminds me of a mens locker room. I&#x27;ve used Curve all my life. It is one of those rare colognes that girls of ALL ages love, it isnt overbearing, and it lasts hours and hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I was walking through the mall this russian sales lady talks me into trying out some cologne. She asks me if I was picky about cologne. I told her not really, which is an obvious lie, as you can tell from my intro paragraph. She tells me to put out my arm and tells me to see if I like \\&quot;In Red\\&quot;. She says it is all the rage in France right now, which I think is probably not true at all but it was one of her selling points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells amazing. I have been searching and searching for something to replace my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent of Curve, which I have been using since 7th grade (I am now a junior in college). The moment my nostrils inhaled the sweet, yet manly scent I was hooked. There is not a lot of ways to describe it. It is sweet in a way like girls perfume, but it is also manly. My girlfriend took one smell and she was sold. The nice Russian lady was trying to sell me a bottle for $50. So I did what any sensible American would do. I told her no and came to Amazon and bought some right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne is simply perfect for me. I am 22. I do not want to smell sporty, old, cheap, or overbearing. I want to smell delicious. And In Red does the trick.</li>
    <li> Ive gotten a few compliments while wearing this. Great unique smell with a great, unique price! Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is what works for me.  To tell the truth, I only wish it came by the gallon.  haha  peace</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my fiance.  He said that he used to wear this years ago and has not been able to find it....but I did! Great price, well packaged, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I hardly wear it.  Another case of a store brand or avon brand cologne.  Nothing special to me.  You get what you pay for.  Fair.</li>
    <li> The scent was so light for the first second, I couldn&#x27;t tell what it was. After that initial scent, it just smelled like rubbing alcohol. I don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch, but this stuff is worth about .25. Packaging is nice, but the product is terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne a long time ago , together with Carlos Santana at the kiosk at the local mall. I&#x27;m sure I paid around 65 to 70 for both. Let me tell you this cologne is very good. I own creed , bvlgari, Burberry. If I was to compare this I will compare it to lacoste in style red. In other words this is a safe buy for everyone.</li>
    <li> smells good, ladies like it.</li>
    <li> Showed up as expected and product just as I expected. Would buy again. Completely satisfied with this purchase. . ..</li>
    <li> A few girls complemented the scent of this cologne when i wore it, so that&#x27;s good enough benchmark for me :)</li>
    <li> it smells good after a while once you spray on your clothes &amp; gonna stay for couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This cologne drives every girl that smells it crazy.  She can&#x27;t keep her hands off me :)  My new favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> Get this scent!!! It lifts me up with every application!</li>
    <li> I feel like they watered the cologne down compared to what it smelt like when we first purchased this product.</li>
    <li> You can wear this anytime any place a must have this is buy far one of my all time favorites</li>
    <li> This cologne was recommended by a friend.I absolutely loved it so much I purchased 2. Great package,great service.Will purchase again.PM</li>
    <li> This product smells fine, it&#x27;s a sort of generic fruity smell with a little bit of a darker undertone. That&#x27;s it though, no real depth, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t so much develop, like other colognes, as disappear.  I put this on after a shower, one pump on my wrists and a couple on my chest... by the time I&#x27;d walked 15 mins to work and asked my co worker about it, she said &amp;#34;er... are you wearing anything?&amp;#34; I tried a bit more the next day, still nothing, I applied more after the gym and shower, I asked my girlfriend about the smell, she gave me a blank look an hour later.  Certainly not in the same league as the bigger brands who sell more potent and longer lasting fragrances with layers that develop over time.</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments when girls smell it, but the scent is kind of weak so don&#x27;t use this if you want to be that guy who just reeks of cologne.  That&#x27;s not me, so 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I was looking for. It was very fast shopping! It came in quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about anything.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Delivered quickly and as described. Will buy more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> This produst is very good. I am not a man that often wears cologne. Although this produst gives me a reason to with its sweet yet manly scent. I really like it.</li>
    <li> It is a very strong scent...VERY strong.  Maybe I have a sensitive sense of smell, but even when I put just one spray on my skin, I feel overwhelmed.  And I have yet to get a comment or compliment when I have worn it.  That is not the case when I wear Angel By Thierry Mugler For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray Rubber Bottle 3.4 OZ</li>
    <li> Smells awesome!!! A tremendous bargain considering the retail price! I would recommend this fragrance for anyone that is grown and sexy!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Very similar to a lot of smells though.. I can never tell the difference in like any colognes. lol</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Good Quality and Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> i ALWAYS GET lots of compliments with this smell. Very unique. Def worth a shot and the price is right.</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorites! Im gonna wear this for years to come. Everybody loves it, especially ladies.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell great than buy this! Put on about 5-8 sprays and love you life!  Buy it already.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a man that has girls swarming all over him. Like I do now that I wear it. But seriously, it&#x27;s a great smelling cologne and is very high quality, especially for the price. My only complaint is that I wished it lasted just a little longer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Low price for a quality product. I would definately do business again. The cologne smells great. I think the scent stays on longer than some customers have been stating.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I get complimented on it.  Only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne....hands down.  Found it years ago in a little shop and hadn&#x27;t been able to find it again since....I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now and always get nice comments from people. It&#x27;s clean with a slightly floral scent.  Not femininine at all though.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Worst smelling cologne ever. Don&#x27;t even try it!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes I&#x27;ve tried in the past few years and on Amazon it&#x27;s too cheap to pass up. I agree with many of the other reviewers that say it&#x27;s scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as others and that holds true. The low price in my opinion makes up for it so i&#x27;m giving it 5 stars instead of 4. If it were pricier it would be a different story. One of my go to colognes since last summer. One tip i&#x27;ve learned on cologne forums is to spray one spray on your scalp. It works for me, might be worth trying for anyone else wanting their cologne scent to last longer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells Excellent! Speedy Delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. I just love the smell and he really liked it too. What i liked most about it was the price. Very very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It smells really good just use an extra squirt because its not that strong.</li>
    <li> smells nice and sweet</li>
    <li> i found this cologne in the mall for $80, its the same scent for so much cheaper. i will buy this again</li>
    <li> I question the noses of the women and men that LOVE this cologne. To me, it smells cheap, it doesn&#x27;t have a lingering scent and I asked my husband that maybe he needs three sprays of cologne rather than his usual 1 &amp;#34;spray and walk through&amp;#34; routine. Blah, don&#x27;t bother with this one, pay more and get more on something else.</li>
    <li> I got this purfume for my son in law and he loved it.  I read the review and they were good so I took a chance.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really not that great. Kind of smells like cranberries. Not really a fan</li>
    <li> Smells really good, Professional and women giving me so many compliments on the smell. So, I guess its going to work out then.</li>
    <li> smells good, but aroma doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by Chris from GoodLookingLoser, who claimed it was the best cologne he&#x27;s ever smelled. This naturally piqued my interest as it&#x27;s so cheap. So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m not exactly a cologne connoisseur and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m incredibly picky. However, I was a little disappointed at first. It smells kind of sweet. More so than I would normally want. But the more I used it, the more the smell has grown on me. I haven&#x27;t asked anyone for feedback (maybe I&#x27;m not wearing enough for them to notice), but for the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying. Certainly worth having around as a back-up if you don&#x27;t want to deplete your high-end cologne too quickly.</li>
    <li> Going off some raving reviews about this product due to the individuals range of knowledge of colognes I bought this for the $15 thinking no biggie. I&#x27;m generally very picky about what scents I purchase through my own research and sampling. This stuff is a waste of $2. Which is the price you&#x27;d pay for the company or a &amp;#34;date&amp;#34; wearing this. Luckily I was able to vigorously wash this off of me, and also had great smelling colognes I can use. This is the first cologne I ever wore that went against it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Out of all the cologne I own, this is my go to. The ladies love it. I love it. It smells awesome and it&#x27;s dirt cheap. I keep a bottle in my house and in my car. Use this stuff with confidence, it will get you noticed.</li>
    <li> I like the scent very much, but it&#x27;s lacks any staying power on the skin or even when spraying on clothes. Although priced for value, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying extra to get the scent to stay throughout the night. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> Great smell at an even better price. It does wear off pretty quick but for the price it more than makes up for it. Buy some but dont tell your friends or any chicks that complement it, we don&#x27;t want this stuff to become Aqua di Gio. Good stuff and highly recommend</li>
    <li> In Red is the best smelling cologne I own and the price is right.</li>
    <li> My husband and I had bought this previously at the mall. Couldn&#x27;t believe I had purchased it for over $70!! Can&#x27;t believe I found it for so cheap online I will buy this again smells great. A perfect gift</li>
    <li> It smells good, but I put on like 8 squirts, and its not too noticable, but that can be a good thing if your looking for something thats not overpowering its preferance, its got a nice citrus scent to it</li>
    <li> smells heavenly - it is perfect for the 16 year old young man who wants to attract the ladies in school</li>
    <li> I rated this 3 stars because it was a great price. Nothing spectacular about the smell. But not terrible. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have many notes other than the 1st note and it last about 4 hrs.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as scheduled and in perfect condition. The scent smells like Joop cologne but not as overpowering which is what I like because strong scents make me sneeze! It&#x27;s unique and subtle with a earthy, leathery, floral after tone. Gonna test it out tonight at the bar and see what the ladies think. Definately going to buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This smells incredibly sexy, my boyfriend&#x27;s go to</li>
    <li> The price was pretty low for the size of the cologne.  I never got to see how much it was in department stores or perfume shops because I had gone and done a &#x27;test&#x27; run of some colognes and never asked how much it was to compare, but overall i think it was a good deal and it smells nice. I&#x27;d recommend it for someone looking for a new or different smell then what they normally go for.</li>
    <li> Great product.  By far my favorite cologne, and at a great price.  Buying this from a retail store will cost almost $80.  Was delivered promptly and on time, without hassle or damage.</li>
    <li> I could never be happier. This is a 70$ bottle, and Its such a good price on amazon. I love this, and so do all the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Smells great. It only takes a few sprays and I&#x27;m good to go. It gets the ladies attention for sure.</li>
    <li> Sweet and hint of Apple&lt;br /&gt;Girls love it when they smell it</li>
    <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
    <li> smell good but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last long !!!!</li>
    <li> Read some good things, but personally do not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything&lt;br /&gt;Not strong&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t Last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, and even asking someone to smell me she could hardly smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing good about it (warranting 2 stars) is that it&#x27;s cheap enough to take a gamble on.</li>
    <li> this was recommended in a you tube video. Not overly fragrant. Has a nice clean smell to it. Women like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I never see this at Saphora or Macy&#x27;s. Great to find and it was not too costly. Im happy i bought it.</li>
    <li> Gave this cologne as a gift to my boyfriend and he loved it. The smell is just amazing. Recommend it for the gents</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it!!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> bought this from a fragrance store and loved it , even for the 45.00 price tag . found on here for way less than i had purchased at fragrance . love the scent ,hands down my favorite . ordered on friday and delivered on monday,great shipping speed is a bonus.</li>
    <li> In Red is great. I first discovered it when one of those annoying people at the kiosks at the mall wouldnt stop harassing me. It was actually so nice that I bought it. It&#x27;s about $30-40+ in stores so get it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I&#x27;ve bought it online-- it smelled EXACTLY the same as always did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between In Red and a good expensive cologne is THE PRICE and that it stays on your clothes for about 4-8 hours instead of 24+ hours. The mark up on cologne is like 40000% - so don&#x27;t think that the price is a reflection of the quality- every cologne is super cheap to make, some are marked up a ridiculous amount.</li>
    <li> Smells like a sexy dream! Self-esteem +10000. Confidence +9200</li>
    <li> bought same cologne for less than half privce on Ebay.  otherwise great cologne.</li>
    <li> I heard about this cologne from the website Good Looking Loser and since I trust the site&#x27;s owner, Chris&#x27; judgment and recommendation for this product I gave this a go. It&#x27;s definitely a polarizing cologne as some people have said I smell amazing and sexy. Other&#x27;s... not so much (okay one made face that looked like she smelt a fart but she&#x27;s always negative so I&#x27;m not counting that as a strike against it). It has a peppery smell to it which I like but I think some people who expect cologne to have more of an Aqua Velva smell or who want their cologne to be extremely masculine may be a little put off by the scent. Not me though. I&#x27;d recommend it although I wouldn&#x27;t say its the be all end all of smells that sites like GLL say it is. Give it a shot. For the price you can afford to.</li>
    <li> Smells great especially at the price point.</li>
    <li> Smells great and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> I am a twenty five year old male, my roommate manages a fragrance store inside the mall so I have tried many different brands and fragrances most of which are about triple the price of this product. This is by far may favorite, and for some reason I am always complemented when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I was leery of ordering cologne online at first. Glad I went for it because I love the way this smells. Very distinct, very masculine. Love it.</li>
    <li> THIS COLOGNE HAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED SMELL TO IT. I WEAR THIS SPRAY WHEN IM GOING OUT TO A NICE DINNER WITH THE FAMILY OR SOMEWHERE FORMAL.&lt;br /&gt; I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COLOGNE TO ANYONE WITH CLASS AND STYLE. ITS A VERY NICE, MANLY SCENT. ONE THAT A GENTLEMAN WOULD BE WEARING.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE PRICE IS AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT AND YOU&#x27;LL SEE</li>
