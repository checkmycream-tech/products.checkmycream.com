<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well for me, but not quite as well as the Proraso soap in the green tub.  I find the eucalyptus smell a bit more pronounced in this than in the Proraso soap, which I like very much.  Like other creams, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as soaps on my face.  I am using it up on head shaves...It works well on my finer head hairs.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite after trying so many others. We used to purchase it on the yearly trip to Chicago and have not been able to find it the last couple years. I was quite happy when it showed up with Amazon. He states that you only need a little to have a good shave job. He shave his whole head and rarely gets nicks with this cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and (the art of shaving) cream for approximately four years. I find that there are only subtle differences in the texture and lathering properties of these two creams. But both of them satisfy my needs equally. A tube of this cream goes a long way, even when applied liberally (a dollop, the size of a quarter). It&#x27;s normally recommended that one use a dime-sized portion. But  Why be conservative at the expense of a thick lather and great shaving experience. I hope this shaving cream sticks around long into the future.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream ever. A must if you like a gentle, but close shave. Blades last longer too. Used only one tube since Christmas.</li>
    <li> Lasted a long time.  Very good quality, great smell, good lubrication for a nice, comfy shave</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s shave cream completely by chance, and decided to give it a try.  By way of background, I use a safety razor, so I&#x27;ve tried to look for high quality shave creams to make sure my face doesn&#x27;t take too much abuse.  I previously alternated between Jack Black Beard Lube and Jack Black Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather, both of which I was very happy with, but both of which were a bit more pricey.  I saw C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s lower price and high reviews, and decided to give it a shot... so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather -- Works up nicely into a rich (but not overly foamy) lather that spreads evenly and stays in place on my face. One bit of advice, be sure to use a little extra water than just wet hands when working up the lather.  The extra water helps thin out the lather so it doesn&#x27;t clog up your razor, which I had a problem with until I started using more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Reaction -- Ooh, that tingles! The eucalyptus oil gives this shave cream a nice cooling tingle when you put it on your face, which makes the shave pretty enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viscosity/ Lubrication -- I didn&#x27;t expect it to create such a smooth glide with the razor, because it didn&#x27;t feel as slick as the Jack Black products I had previously used.  Very pleasantly surprised -- the blade glides very easily through the lather and over the skin, and makes for a great shave. The thing that really pushed it over the edge for me and has solidified this product as my go-to shave cream is that I have not had ANY razor burn since starting to use C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s Shave Cream -- none whatsoever, after about 5 weeks of using it 5-6 times per week.  I used to get somewhat raw around the base of my neck by mid-week, but those days are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture -- If I had one complaint about this shave cream (and I&#x27;d be stretching to say this is a serious complaint), it&#x27;s that it rinses away and leaves my skin feeling very \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; of natural moisture.  Oddly enough, itdoesn&#x27;t actually dry out my face, it just feels like it strips my face of moisture.  That said, unless you&#x27;re cultivating a mug like a catcher&#x27;s mitt or trying to become the next Clint Eastwood, you should be following up your shave with a moisturizer, which I do, so I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall -- Highly recommend.  I have used Gillette shave gel, Nivea shave gel, Jack Black Beard Lube and Jack Black Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather, and C.O. Bigelow Shave Cream is by far the best overall shave I have gotten.  On top of that the price is right at just $10 a tube, which has lasted me over a month now (and still going).</li>
    <li> I will not be buying any other shaving cream after trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the menthol feeling.  It shaves great.  It lathers great.  It helps protect from nicks.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I stole this product from my husband.  I use it to shave my legs, great creamy lather, close shave, no razor burn, silky, silky moisturized legs!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great quality, no spray can, you can usually get it through the airport if you&#x27;re traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, it smells good, and it lasts for much longer than any can.  More convenient than a bowl and brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to using only this product.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best shave cream I have ever used.  Worth every penny.  It helps give the most incredible shaves.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream - for a bargain!  I previously used Cremo Cream for shaving (with a cartridge razor) and was looking for something that provided as close of a shave without leaving a slick, oily residue after rinsing.  This product (which is made by Proraso) provides a great shave and rinses cleanly.  Moreover, the eucalyptus and menthol provide a great scent and cooling effect that energizes your skin.  Proraso has been a classic for years with good reason.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried this with a brush, but will soon do so.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaving cream I have ever tried. After reading the glowing reviews I was astonished how poor this product works.     It is a very poor lubricant, requires a substantial amount of shaving cream and it dries on your face way too quickly.    I now use Art of Shaving shave cream (Unscented) and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great menthol shave cream especially when used with a good badger brush. It is also available in a 1.7 ounce tube so you can carry it on an airplane. It is made by Proraso and is essentially the same thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;Not great . It&#x27;s a world better than the drugstore variety</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for 45+ years and used everything from straight razors to disposables and shower soap to expensive gels.  This is, in my opinion, the best in terms of how it leaves your face feeling, overall value, and performance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as Proraso, in fact it&#x27;s made for Bigelow (Bath &amp; Body Works) by Proraso in Italy.  I buy mine at a local Bath &amp; Body Works for $10 - a  tube lasts about 3 months.  The only downside is that I need to actually go into Bath &amp; Body Works.  The odors in those stores is simply overpowering, and it&#x27;s hard to feel too manly when surrounded with all those other froo froo womanly items.      But, it&#x27;s worth it - I typically shave every day in the shower.  I first apply some Noxzema cleanser, rub that into my face, then put the Proraso shave cream right on top of the Noxzema.  There&#x27;s something about that mixture that gives me a great shave - I work it until I&#x27;m baby bottom soft.      Top that off with some Geo. Trumper after shave, and that&#x27;s about as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried, others...but nothing for me comes close.  This has the slickness, moisturizing, and cushioning properties every body looks for in a shave cream.  (for those of us who don&#x27;t try and spend under 1 minute to shave)  I buy mine also from Bath and Body Works for $10.  Pick it up if you haven&#x27;t, use hot water and a badger shave brush and you&#x27;re set to go.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks I have used it for last 5 years with my electric shaver and it makes my face feel great and the shaver work better.  I give it as gifts</li>
    <li> I DO NOT USE A BRUSH TO LATHER AND APPLY THIS SHAVE CREAM. Instead I just put a small amount in my hands and work the cream into my wet beard/stubble. I work the cream for about 20 seconds or so and stop when the cream has changed consistency. Trust me, you&#x27;ll know when so stop and start shaving. I only bring this up as I want first time users or users that don&#x27;t own a brush and want a great shave to buy this product!    I agree with the other reviewers, this stuff is the best! Just try it once and I have no doubt you will give up what you were previously using. And no, I don&#x27;t work for this company. It&#x27;s just that if I am going to put a razor sharp blade across my throat I am going to use the best product to protect and sooth... this is that product.</li>
    <li> I have use this now for over a month.  I switched to a safety razor over 6 months ago and will not go back to the multi-blade razors.  I use a metal bowl and a dab of this product with a badger brush.  It makes a silky smooth cream and spreads evenly on the face.  As with any brush soap combination, you must get the moisture right or any shave cream or soap may dry out too quick, as was the result of the earlier reviewer.  If you have mastered the old ways of shaving, then this product will rate high on your list. I recommend this and/or the Poraso tub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many different kinds of shaving products - from cheap foams and gels to expensive (and time consuming) multi-step scurb-oil-shave-aftershave routines.  CO Bigelow&#x27;s gives me the quickest, most luxurious and comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had.  This product is available from Bath &amp; Body Works and is the same as the famous Proraso cream from Italy.    This is my daily routine:  WARNING - it is unorthodox, but it works for me!  1. I soak my face with HOT water.  2. I take a SMALL dot of shave cream in my fingertips and thoroughly work the product into my skin with a hard deep circular motion - my goal is to soften and lift the hairs.  I splash a little water on my face to keep the cream moist.  You really don&#x27;t need more than a thin layer of wet cream- any more is a waste and just clogs the razor.  3. I use an inexpensive, sharp 2-blade plastic disposable razor (anything fancier is a waste of money).  I make short strokes with the grain, washing the razor with HOT water between each stroke.  This cream makes shaving so easy - the razor just glides on my face.  I change razors after 4 or 5 shaves.  4. If I want an even CLOSER shave, I repeat the above steps and shave AGAINST the grain.  I know against the grain is considered a shaving no-no, but nothing else gets my face super-smooth.  5. I rinse my face with warm water.  My face usually feels soft and smooth, but if I have razor burn, I work a tiny amount of cream into my skin and let is sit for 1 or 2 minutes.  I rinse with warm water and towel dry - you&#x27;ll feel a nice, soothing and tingling feeling - no need for aftershave!    This routine takes me only 5 or 6 minutes - try it for yourself - Good luck!</li>
    <li> lathers better than the regular proraso but is a bit more expensive. there are other more expensive creams out there that are better but again I can&#x27;t justify paying a fortune for shaving cream. I might stick to this.    Due to good lather, I&#x27;m also using less than what i used with proraso.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream. The smell is pleasant and subtle, and it lathers up easily with a good shaving brush. The lather is about the finest I&#x27;ve used in my time as a wet shaver. I bought a 1.75oz tube of it at Bath &amp; Body Works at a local mall for $5. Used properly even a small tube will last for a good long while. I&#x27;ve been shaving with the one I have for upwards of two months.    A little history for you fine folks- C.O. Bigelow Shaving Cream is just a re-brand of Proraso, and Italian shaving cream. They&#x27;re identical in smell, lather, performance and chemical composition.</li>
    <li> I have stopped paying for the extortionate Fusion brand and gone to a DE razor shaving regime.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first cream purchase and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is manly and makes a smooth lather, I have tried shaving soaps but always come back to this cream.</li>
    <li> This seems to be soap-based, which may be part of why it gives a good shave.     Pros: Nice smell. Very few ingrown hairs (a big problem for me).    Cons: It&#x27;s rather drying to my skin. I need lots of lotion after using it, which I rarely need with other shaving creams. It also seems to \\&quot;react\\&quot; with the lubrication on my Schick razors, creating a \\&quot;slime\\&quot; layer much bigger than razor with other creams or this cream with other razors. That makes me wonder if it is \\&quot;using up\\&quot; the razor&#x27;s lubrication faster than the manufacturer intended.    Overall: I&#x27;ll keep using what I have, but I&#x27;ll continue to search for the perfect shave cream. Zirh&#x27;s shave cream was an absolute favorite until they changed the formula to something more lightweight a couple years ago.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream performs at a level of a cream much higer priced. It creates a good lather and helps with a a close shave when combined with a pre-shave oil. The eucalyptus is a bit stronger than I expected, but it is all but gone post shave. So are there better shave creams out there?..Yep. However, few provide such a great value.</li>
    <li> This is one of the items i get that i would never in a million years think to buy. Now i am hooked on it after receiving it from my wife a few years back. The smell is awesome, the lather is thick without needing to use an entire bottle, and the price is right. Foam is for your grandfather get with the times and use shave CREAM!</li>
    <li> This is a good shaving cream, pretty much the same (or at least very similar) to the Proraso cream, it&#x27;s actually made by Proraso. I actually prefer the shaving soap and only bought this to travel since it&#x27;s more practical than taking along a tub of shaving soap, brush, etc.</li>
    <li> This is the best all-around shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.  It lathers up well with a brush, and does a great job of lubricating the skin to prevent nicks.  The scent is very mild, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with any other products you might use, and is probably not noticeable on the skin more than a few minutes after shaving.  The menthol is not very noticeable to me - I&#x27;ve tried other menthol shaving products that bothered me with the amount of menthol. I have reviews of several other shaving creams and soaps on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve tried many other shaving creams and soaps, and none is better than the C.O. Bigelow cream.</li>
    <li> I have tried soaps, cheap can stuff, other jars, all of other brands... this is by far my favorite.  It smells fantastic.  The cream adds a great tingle to your face even after you are done shaving.  This is my future choice for all my shaving needs.</li>
    <li> Started shaving with the brush and soaps about a year ago. I purchased my first cream Arko Comf and Arko Cool. The Arko Comf is decent but i found it lacking compared to the soaps. The Arko Cool left me with slightly more irritation than normal. Happen to have a credit with a Vendor which came out to be about the price of this so i decided why not. Must say it lathers and performs better than the Arko almost as good as soaps. Its made by Proraso which is the world leader in old school shaving products. One thing about this and i knew when i purchased it is loaded with Parbens and a few different ones at that. Other than that the product performed wonderfully for me and i enjoyed the scent and the ever so slight cooling effect. While it doesnt dry my face it probably could use a dash of Vitamin E/Aloe or some other moisturizer. For this and the fact that is loaded with a ton of Parabens i had to knock a star off.   * My shave routine in case anyone is interested*  Shower lightly scrub my face with wash cloth to clean and exfoliate at same time. I usually use a Aloe based bodyr wash. Soak my face with hot wash cloth and wet face with hot water. I build my lather and when i done i again splash my face with hot water as by this time the water has dried some. With the grain shave, against the grave shave and (sometimes) i may make another pass. Splash cold water on face put cold wash clothe on face a couple times. I then use an Alum block slightly wet whilst i clean up my area i keep the Alum on. After about 2 minutes soak wash cloth in cold water and remove the Alum traces. Splash my face with cold water a few times. Let face air dry then apply Aubrey Vegecol Aloe moisturizer and im done. Sounds like a long process and it is somewhat but take me about 20 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brush-based shaving creams over the years but since finding C O Bigelow Premium Menthol w/eucalyptus oil I don&#x27;t need to look further. Foams nicely, great shave - enough said.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is just as good as the tube of Proraso cream I just used up. I was afraid the menthol and eucalyptus would smell funny, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Bye bye Burt&#x27;s Bee shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best non-aerosol shave cream I have tried and I have tried a lot.  Great shave, high quality and you feel great after.   Perhaps not quite as good as gel for me but I use it when traveling since I don&#x27;t like the big cans.</li>
    <li> The only issue had to do with the condition of the tube. It was packaged in bubble wrap and put into a box, but it appeared as if somebody had been kneading the tube because it was squished and creased all over the tube.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me a small tube and I was reluctant to use it but after the first use of this stuff I was hooked. All you need is a small dollop of cream and apply to the face and you&#x27;re good to go.    I also recommend to get a shave brush as well to get the best use of this cream.      My method of shaving.  - Wet the face with hot water  - soak a shave brush with hot water and remove access water  - apply a dollop of the shave cream to the brush and mix in a shave bowl till the brush is ready  - use the brush to apply on face  - shave with the grain of you beard  - apply another layer of cream to the face (should not have to add anymore cream)  - shave at an angle or against the grain for a baby soft felling  - Splash cold water to the face and pat dry  - add after shave.  - enjoy your day.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve bought. Works well with or without shave brush. Tube being aluminum is a little annoying but not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> I tried this one and got good results. Smooth skin and close shave. Delivered as per my expectations. Now the ingredient part. The cream is loaded with parabens and sls. These chemicals has been debated in scientific community for the harmful effects it may create for humans. So, if you give less importance to the ingredients, then this is for you. If you are very conscious about the ingredients then you may be in for a disappointment. A tricky situation. On one side you get a shave you desired (smooth, close, non itching ....) and on other hand the ingredients makes you feel jittery. I honestly feel that the company should have opted for organic chemicals (like essential oils) to these chemicals. This is my own opinion and yours may differ than mine after you use it. Also note that this is the same cream Proraso but with different label. So 4 stars for the performance and minus 1 star for the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Below is the list of ingredients from Bigelow&#x27;s website.  I won&#x27;t buy again due to the heavy use of parabens and other chemicals, but to each his own.  I found a natural product elsewhere which I really enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water,&lt;br /&gt;Stearic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;Coco Nucifera (Coconut) Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Hydroxide,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hydroxide,&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin,&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate,&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Menthol,&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptol,&lt;br /&gt;Boric Acid,&lt;br /&gt;Camphor,&lt;br /&gt;PEG-150 Distearate,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Metasilicate,&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethylcellulose,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Borate,&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;Ethylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;Butylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;BHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;///// IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL REQUESTS, I&#x27;VE UPDATED MY REVIEW /////&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All, sorry to have taken so long to respond to your requests.  I don&#x27;t often revisit my reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I revisited this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Liggett&#x27;s Shaving Foam.  I have been buying it through my co-op, but I see that at least one amazon Seller is listing it as well--at less than what I&#x27;ve been paying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really lubes up well for a foam.  One caveat: I do not have a heavy beard, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liggett&#x27;s Shaving Foam ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Saponified Olive Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Castor Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Safflower Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Almond Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E,&lt;br /&gt;Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;Natural Fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sb</li>
    <li> My dad loves it.  He likes the strong eucalyptus scent.  He uses his hands to rub on the cream and a disposable razor to shave.  He doesn&#x27;t like the smell of Cremo but younger men might like it.</li>
    <li> strong, inescapable smell of chemicals.  i&#x27;m not sure what the manufacturer thinks the ekalyptus smells like, but whatever it is, this shaving creme is nowhere close to it.</li>
    <li> Was using Creamo cream before trying this.  I think this is hands down a better shaving cream.  It&#x27;s actually packaged under the CO Bigelow brand by Poraso.  Same formula, same quantity.  Just a tad cheaper.  The stuff is luxurious, and smells great.  I like it because it seems to have a more oil in the formulation than Creamo.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am old and old fashioned, and have used a lather shave cream with brush for 20 years. This is one of the best delivering a clean, slick shave consistently. I like it.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m floored by how great this stuff is. If you buy your shave products at Target or Walmart, spend the extra 5 dollars and pick this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, and you get a close shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving cream out there, unless theres some top secret cream NASA&#x27;s working on. Ive tried almost every brand Walmart carries and never found one that worked this well.  I used to be in the military and that required me to shave everyday. With a inferior shave cream my skin would get very aggravated and I got at least three or four cuts each shave, and thats with Gillette Fusion Blades(best blades out there). This cream has a almost magical consistency that  coats your face with a barrier that protects the skin while shaving. The menthol is great since it gives a cool refreshing clean feel. All I know is this cream tops anything in the local stores and is worth buying online. Also it only takes a \\&quot;dime\\&quot; size spot of this stuff to lather your entire face and then some. So this tube will last at least 4 months if not more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different \\&quot;boutique\\&quot; shaving products from other companies like eShave and The Art of Shaving and was generally pleased with the shaves they&#x27;ve produced.  The last few months though I was using some non-boutique cream and really noticed a difference, mainly with more razor cuts and less smooth shaves.  And then I saw a review of this product on Yahoo and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.    Well this morning was the first time I used it and, without changing any other variable (same razor, same brush, same temp water, and same aftershave lotion), I noticed a HUGE difference.  No nicks or razor burns, and a smooth, close shave.  My skin feels great, the best it&#x27;s felt after a shave in a long, long time.  Granted this was only my first time, so I am hopeful the great shaves continue.  But if they do, and this wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I think I&#x27;ve become a lifetime user.</li>
    <li> This is classic, old-school shave cream. Great stuff. My face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt and smells like a 1920&#x27;s barbershop right now. You think you can beat that?</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving cream I have used as I am new to the DE arena. I LOVE IT! Fresh pleasing smell, a great shave. Going to be heard to use my soaps after this experience.</li>
    <li> Upside: It&#x27;s made by Proraso so you know what you are getting. It&#x27;s readily available and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: Some creams are slicker.  I recommend adding some glycerine or glycerine soap, to make it a more protective lather.  Neutrogena soap will do it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the menthol may seem over the top at first.  It is a high quality product</li>
    <li> I will never try anything else...  For the best shave of your life, do the following in your shower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash face&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply this shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;3) Shave in downwards (with the hair direction) only&lt;br /&gt;4) Reapply this shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;5) Shave against the grain&lt;br /&gt;6) Apply an after shave or lotion post shave</li>
    <li> I have used many a cream for my DE shave. I love this stuff and is one of my favorites. I do use the green Proraso green pre-shave along with this C.O Bigelow cream , a Feather razor and blade, some Proraso aftershave and I am ready to start my day!&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a nice cool feel and allows for a close shave and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> A nickel sized dollop of this shaving cream in a bowl, whipped up with a brush will produce enough lather for three complete shave passes. A dime sized dollop will get you two plus. Smells great, and protects your skin. It does everything it is supposed to do, and does it very well, and won&#x27;t gunk up in your razor. No more canned foam, or gel.</li>
    <li> It was eye opening to use this. I no longer cut my face, I no longer have a huge buildup of shaving cream on my razor, and I no longer feel like my face is melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about every other day and one tube has last me about 3 months so far. I don&#x27;t use a brush to apply it. I just squeeze a bit out of the tube and rub it between my hands with a bit of hot water, and repeat until there is a plentiful lathery bunch to apply. I then shave with cold water. The after effect is a lingering cooling feeling provided by the eucalyptus and it is enlightening. If you don&#x27;t start to enjoy shaving, then it&#x27;s your own fault.</li>
    <li> Been using it for several years. Amazon is the only place I can find it. I only shave about once a week or less, so a tube lasts me about a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve various levels of shaving cream ranging from the those ubiquitous brands available at pharmacies to other small-batch, apothecary-inspired products. This one provides the best shave yet! The scent is understated, yet masculine, and I experience no irritation after I&#x27;m done shaving. I probably should have started using it sooner given that my uncle was a barber in Italy and spoke highly of Proraso products.</li>
    <li> I was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> A good shave with this product (put on with a natural bristle brush, of course) is a wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Great cream to bar it&#x27;s not available locally</li>
    <li> Being an italian girl, I&#x27;ve spent my life battling shaving woes like ingrown hairs and razor burn. This has been so worth the price. It performed way past my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in 20 years, I can shave without pain, bumps or knicks.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fantastic, creamy lather with which to shave, look no further. [[ASIN:B002O7UI18 C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 147g/5.2oz]], (which is exactly the same product as [[ASIN:B00837ZOI0 Proraso Shaving Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 150 ml, New Formulation]]) is clearly my favorite shaving soap. I prefer it even to [[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation]]. Simply because you can achieve a far thicker and richer lather. All this without the skin-drying propellants that one finds in commercial, canned shave cream. Shaving should be an experience to be enjoyed, not endured; and with this shave cream; a quality DE Razor, such as [[ASIN:B004E5GV82 Feather All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor]] and a invigorating silver tip badger shave brush, your shave---and your entire day will get off to a great and comfortable start. Now go get your shave on!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and it works well with his sensitive skin. Smells good too. His only complain is the tube is a little difficult to squeeze all the product out of.</li>
    <li> Good soap .. Very similar to the proraso in a tube. Does not perform as well as others.</li>
    <li> Of all the shaving soaps and creams I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far my favorite. Made by Prorasso, who has been in the shaving business in Italy for a long, long time, C.O. Bigelow shave cream is easy to lather and comfortable to apply. I have been using this for about two months now. I don&#x27;t think I want to use any thing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having a bit of an issue before, where I was not using enough water in the lathering process. This caused the lather to be a little tacky, which in turn caused the blade to skip over my face instead of gliding smoothly over it. The end result was a few nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I figured out what I was doing wrong, this product became my favorite thing in the medicine cabinet. I look forward to shaving every day. The menthol scent is a really nice start to the day, too. Its sort of a pre-coffee pick me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do end up using more than some people recommend (I&#x27;ve heard you should start with an amount the size of a large almond - I double that at least, but theres enough for three latherings), but it works out fine for me, and I have yet to go through my first complete tube. I much prefer this to the tub variety. Its pretty much the same thing, I guess, but the cream is easier for me to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for a fellow beginner, or anyone who wants a better shave.</li>
    <li> I had difficulty finding my usual shave cream (tube variety, not from a can), and decided to look at some reviews of other shave creams and to try these three and compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 5.2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man Jack Shave Cream for All Skin Types-6.7 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin. The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves. The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely. I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation. The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent. The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather. And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I would have to say I preferred the C.O. Bigelow and the Cremo. I think I would get the Cremo again because I like a less scented and less tingly feeling shave. The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
    <li> Good product. Provides great lather and a smooth shave. I use it with brush from art of shaving. Would have no hesitation to recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Made by Proraso, which is a great Italian shave cream manufacturer. Search Poraso shave cream and try their Sandalwood shave cream in a tube.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not just smelled that makes does shaving cream excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many shaving creams from the Art of shaving to Gillette. This beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creates rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduces razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you a shaving brush and this goes really well with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Prorasso shaving cream which I don&#x27;t think is as good as the CO Bigelow brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even pay $30 for this tube but thankfully it&#x27;s quite cheap.</li>
    <li> I started off shaving with a sample size version of this cream and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since. So far I have not found a better alternative than this. Smell is nice and lather is good as well.</li>
    <li> I mean, you would think, \\&quot;come on, it&#x27;s shaving cream, how good can it be?\\&quot;.  Easy.  It&#x27;s the BEST.  Now, I know everyone here will think \\&quot;how do you know?\\&quot;.  Being middle-eastern, we tend to grow facial hair at the age of 11, so I started shaving at 13 or so.  I&#x27;ve used every conceivable shaving cream out.  Oddly, Barbasol foam is what i used the most because it did not dry my skin out.  Anyhow, after 20+ years shaving, this stuff is hands down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it, you only need to use a dime&#x27;s worth (1cm).  Let the water and aeration do the rest...you can use a badger brush or just your hands if you&#x27;re in a rush.  Smoother shave, no matter which blade you end up using.  This stuff is the real deal, and another small perk is that it that you really don&#x27;t need aftershave--the Eucalyptus oil works wonders.</li>
    <li> Well, here I am...the latest of the mostly &amp;#34;me, too&amp;#34; club with this product. As an older guy, I&#x27;ve shuffled just about every variable in the shaving game (thankfully, there are few). I&#x27;ve spent a ton on razors and on creams and such. It can be an expensive game if you buy into shaving &amp;#34;systems.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for the &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; deal, I ran across the accolades for C.O. I&#x27;m a fan of eucalyptus and the price was right, Prime to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived just in time for me to try it before work and I&#x27;m a fan. Little dab lathered up enough and my Dollar Shave Club cheapie razor raced glided across my face like Dorothy Hamill. I didn&#x27;t find the euc too powerful (in fact, I&#x27;d like it to be more prominent) and I don&#x27;t miss the awkward-sized, occasionally rusty(!) can in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of sounding weird, I also like the &amp;#34;gentlemanly&amp;#34; look of the packaging!</li>
    <li> Not impressed, poor lathering.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with generic stuff or nothing at all, but after using this i&#x27;m never going back. I love the smell of it after a shave, and it simply makes shaving that much easier. The size is also pretty good for the price, since i just use a dab every time i shave.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding ?? I buy 2 tubes in local Bath and Body Works (not real crazy about walking through that store) for $20 and get a 3rd tube free! Seriously, 3 tubes for $20. As opposed to my favorite Taylor of Old Bond Street where one container is $17. Stuff lathers up great, feels great and smells great. Remember; the greatest trick the devil ever played was making us believe &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; was money saving!! This stuff is an absolute bargain and works great!!</li>
    <li> Using this cream has helped my skin clear up, as I don&#x27;t press as hard when shaving, and I don&#x27;t have to make a many passes over my skin. I like the cool feeling I get when I rinse with cold water, very refreshing in the morning.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy on the skin and perfect to use with a DE razor. I recommend picking up a decent pre shave oil to use with it. You can buy them at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; online or in store.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Product good,  smell great, but it is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up as &#x27;something special for shaving&#x27; from the recommendation from a friend, and I like it, but that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with the product, but for me, it is not special enough to warrant a stellar rating.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product!  It really does not lather up very well, and it also irritates my skin.  I would approach the use of this product cautiously.</li>
    <li> This shave cream consistently does the job it is supposed to do. You can&#x27;t go wrong by starting your shaving day with this cream.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy him other brands to try, and he won&#x27;t even open them.  He loves this basic shave cream with a mild scent from C.O. Bigelow.  Another guy I talked to said the same thing.  Once he tried this, he won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
    <li> If you want a shaving cream that makes you feel like your face was just shaved by a Koala, then by this Premium Shaving Cream with eucalyptus oil. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> For the money - this may be the best shave cream that you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is how thick it is. It is a really great lubricant and puts most shave creams to shame. The thickness makes the shave very smooth and easy, although you have to rinse your blade more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of much that I dislike about this product. It is a great product at a great price. I&#x27;ve used comparable shave creams that cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> This is worth the extra couple of bucks.  The way this makes my skin almost exceedingly soft is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve been using the gel-type shave creams that come out of a can for most of my life.  This is a step-up.</li>
    <li> This really works best using a shaving brush.  It takes amazing little cream to generate a great lather and a great shave.  I am a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3+ years.  Love the shave I get from it and it leaves my skin cool, and relaxed after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaving cream for 5 years. It gives one of the smoothest shaves of any product I&#x27;ve used. You can apply it directly with your fingers or with a shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend awhile back because he gets really irritated and red by any shaving creams that you can purchase at the market. I bought it from Bath and Body works and his face doesn&#x27;t get irritated and he loves how well his skin feels after wards. It is totally worth 10 bucks. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> The shave cream goes on thick and smooth, makes the skin feel cool and leaves your face feeling pretty great after the shave. Just make sure you use enough water to thin it out or it&#x27;ll gunk up your razor and give you a pretty bad shave. It&#x27;s still \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, regardless of how awesome this stuff holds up.</li>
    <li> Until you have tried this product you haven&#x27;t lived. you don&#x27;t need a brush and dish to use this but it does help to give the full effect. CO Big also makes this in a can which works well as well if your in more of a hurry.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple different premium shaving creams along with brand name creams from the store.  I have to admit that after trying this product, the rest started gathering dust.  With a small quarter size drop with a wet brush, this goes a long way, provides a quality lather, and helps provide a quality shave.</li>
    <li> I think the razor glides better with Proraso.. People say they are the same.. which is why I purchased this.. but something felt different.</li>
    <li> I love it. If you like a bit of menthol or mint cooling with your shave, this has it. It foams up and softens the beard very well. I like it better than the much more expensive British stuff I&#x27;ve been using and it is great for travel. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> best shaving cream for men! my husband swears by it. he only uses that kind and nothing else. take a chance on it you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought thinking it was the smaller tube. It is not. This stuff is dope. Great for shaving with any blade. Bought for use with a straight razor for my boyfriend. but he bought it for a friend who uses a disposable and said it was great, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really, really good. It&#x27;s made by Proraso, but it&#x27;s a little better than their branded stuff. It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s available perpetually at Bath &amp; Body Works for $6.66/tube (when you buy three). My wife makes me go with her, so I grab them about every chance I get. I gave a lot of shaving stuff to family last Christmas, and everyone loved the Bigelow shaving creme.</li>
    <li> My face feels really great after using this shave cream. The Eucalyptus oil adds a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; that makes your face feel very fresh and clean. However, this cream leaves a residue on my razor (Mühle double-edge safety razor), which does not simply rinse off. I have to disassemble the razor and rub/scrub/wipe the residue off after using this shave cream. Other shave creams and soaps do not give me this issue.</li>
    <li> This product offers the best shave you likely ever have. The razor just glides on your face and the shave is so close you will be very surprised. The scent gives you a good clean feeling too</li>
    <li> I bought this from Bath and Bodyworks to try out with my DE razor. It offers good amount of lather and provides an OK shave. I did get some razor burn in first few uses but I would put that down to my own inexperience rather than the cream. However, I have a very sensitive skin. I use Cetaphyl gentle skin cleanser for my face wash and have been using Gillete sensitive foam for shaving. Those two do not dry out my skin. This cream however, dries out my skin really fast after shaving. The skin feels tight (but smooth).  I went back to Gillete sensitive foam. I am going to try out the Proraso shave soap for sensitive skin and hope that gives a good balance of being gentle and good lather.    Update: Try the Proraso shave soap for sensitive skin (white jar with white lid). That is the best thing to get if you have sensitive skin. Gillette foam is OK if you are in a hurry but the soap is the best thing for your skin. No pimples, blocked pores, ingrown hair or redness. Just make sure you shave properly with safety razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out saying I love Proraso and everything about their products.  This is a rebranded proraso green line product with minor changes.  I love this cream and it is very traditional italian barber shop feeling.  My only gripe is the price.  Bath and Body Works sells this for $10 a tube all the time and usually has a buy 2 get 1 free online.  I don&#x27;t feel that this is a competitive price and I wish I had known that before I purchased this on here.  However, this cream is fantastic, cooling, just the right amount of menthol and eucalyptus, and it smells super clean and manly.  I recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> whips up a great lather and just makes shaving with a old style safety razor a great experience. It brings me back to the old days when there was not disposable razors. I went to Bath &amp; Body Works and purchased the large tube 5.2 OZ. for $10.00. This is a great deal that you must try. Think about it 1.7 OZ for $5.00.  It would cost you $15.29 to get the 5.2 OZ tube. Buy the 5.2 OZ tube and save $5.29. Good stuff</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shave cream from Bath &amp; Body Works and was very excited to try it. I have been a DE shaver for quite awhile and I have used various creams and soaps in the past and always willing to try something new. This is one awesome shave cream!!! I honestly have not tried anything better in my life! The scent is somewhat different than expected but not in a bad way, some may not like it, but I find it to be refreshing. I have tried more $$$ creams (like T.O.B.S.)but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with them as I am with this cream. It lathers easily and very well with my Omega Boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;The cooling sensation is great, it really \\&quot;wakes\\&quot; up your face and I had no problems with it drying out either.&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is that this is the slickest lather I have ever tried, even with an old blade I still get a BBS&lt;br /&gt;shave that amazed me!&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream one day and then went back to an old favorite for the next shave and there was no comparision,&lt;br /&gt;I had to go back to the C.O. Bigelo cream!&lt;br /&gt;I think I am hooked for life! No other cream or soap comes close!&lt;br /&gt;As for cost, you can go online or instore and get a \\&quot;buy 2-get one free\\&quot; which is a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shave cream. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream with no sulfates</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good! minimal smell and makes my face feel really &#x27;fresh&#x27;. Really recommend; a little goes a long way! I do recommend and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> There is a significant amount of eucalyptus which feels really nice after shaving.  It isn&#x27;t just for the face, either.  I&#x27;ve never experienced a closer shave, even with a blade that isn&#x27;t new.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful and really works great.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got a bad tube, but this product smells awful.  It smells like it is moldly.  Maybe some of the ingredients turned, but this tube is going back or in the trash.  I am pretty bummed out, because in general I like C.O. Bigelow products.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a bunch of searching for an alternative to grocery store products.  It works well has a decently good smell to it, some people may not like the eucalyptus in it if you have sensitive skin although it did not bother me.  A surprisingly small amount of this is needed for each shave and while I havent done the math I think its a better value overall than regular shaving cream.  I use this primarily for double edge razor shaving.</li>
    <li> And IMHO better than its Italian original I believe it rebrands. Only a tiny amount needed. Would love a smaller tube for travel.</li>
    <li> I used this shaving cream at my brother&#x27;s house and from that time on I was hooked!! It leasve you with a cool sensation of a real shaving, I shave my head and believe me my brain feels it too.. : ). I love this shaving cream !!!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream by far, and a tube lasts you longer than cans and cans of the garbage they sell at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Love it smells very good</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaving lather I have had the chance to use. It takes under 30 seconds for me to work it into a very smooth and full lather, and it dissolves in water easily for cleanup. My girlfriend is constantly complimenting the smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube that the lather is in is very pleasing to look at, which is uncommon with most lathers.</li>
    <li> Not for me. Smells bad. Doesn&#x27;t lather well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy colonel conk, 1/3 of the price and does a hell of a job.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave at least once a day. This smells great, feels great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. For the price this is a great buy. It&#x27;s a great product, works for a long time, and has a great price.</li>
    <li> this stuff not only wakes you up but its the first time i haven&#x27;t burned my skin put a dime size amount in a Lather Bowl and whip at it for a good creamy lather and your good to go trust me all the hype is true GET THIS STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> Of all the shave creams I&#x27;ve used, this is the best!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only shaving cream my husband will use.</li>
    <li> The tube is convenient to use and has a very classy look. I don&#x27;t use a cup to make the foam, I make it directly on my face. I put a 3/4 inch dollop on my natural shaving brush. This cream is not too slick. The cream protects the face but is not slick after a pass of the blade. So when I shave a strip on my face, I can touch the skin and tug on it to shave difficult areas. For example, to shave the Adam&#x27;s apple area on the neck, first I shave the easy part of the neck, then I tug and shave on one side and then tug and shave the other side, never having to actually go up and over the Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
    <li> I used to dread shaving. I was one of those guys who would maybe shave every third day if I had to. When I did shave, I would end up with ingrown hairs and razor burn. I even tried the permanent scruffy look for a few months, using an electric razor to trim my beard. Eventually my wife had just about enough of it and refused to kiss me for fear of being stabbed by tiny coarse hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I decided to give traditional wet shaving a try and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now look forward to shaving every morning and this product (the first shave cream I tried) has a lot to do with this. C.O. Bigelow carries quality products that can be found at reasonable prices online and in retail stores. This product is no exception. Here are some of the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a wonderful, not overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;2) It gives a slight tingling sensation when applied.&lt;br /&gt;3) Lathering with this product is a breeze. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;4) It does not leave a residue on the skin and is easy to wash off the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have expanded my collection of shave creams and soaps, but this will always remain a staple in my collection.</li>
    <li> I have many different types of shaving cream.  I need to use it all up, but I find that I always use this first. I only have to use a little bit and it does the job.  It is very refreshing on your face and seems to protect your face well.</li>
    <li> Leaps and bound above anything else. I feel I could shave with a rusty butter knife and still get a close, nick- free shave with this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK shaving cream, but having read the glowing reviews I expected a better shaving experience. I still like the Art of Shaving shaving cream better&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000FGWU0M The Art of Shaving Shaving Cream, Lavender Essential Oil for Sensitive Skin 5.0 oz, (150 ml)]]</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  Everyone I know that uses it says it&#x27;s the best they&#x27;ve ever had.  It will last forever because it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather.</li>
    <li> excellent cream.  i love it. it is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> A friend at Bath &amp; Body Works gave this to me as a gift.  I have ordered this shave cream multiple times for myself and others.  It offers the most comfortable shave with great moisturizing after to leave skin soft and smooth.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I originally bought it to use with my safety razor, as I was going to attempt to switch from regular blades for a closer shave. No need for that! This has to be the best shaving cream I have ever used. I no longer buy Gillette or Edge cream, I use this with my normal razor and really works well. The Eucalyptus oil gives a nice tingle, and you can really feel a closer shave. I even got a tube for my father to try, thats how much I liked it. Just remember, if you specifically buy the C.O. Bigelow cream, they may send you Proraso instead. Rest assured, the Bigelow is rebranded/repackaged Proraso cream. When I originally bought Bigelow, I got a tube of Bigelow. But when I reordered, I got a tube of Proraso. Its the same thing, as the Bigelow tube even says its made for them by Proraso....so dont think you got the wrong product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t give a lot of five stars, but this stuff is worth it.  If it seems pricey at first glance, keep in mind a marble size dab (or less) will easily lather up enough to cover your whole face.  It feels great, and it smells awesome.  I hate perfume and chemical smells, and this has neither - a nice, natural, masculine scent.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  And a fantastic deal: under $12 for a 5.7oz tube.  This may sound pricey, but this large tube will last a very long time because only a quarter to half-dollar size amount is enough for a nice thick lather (use a brush for maximum lather).  I have very sensitive skin and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for a close, clean shave with no irritation.  The type of razor is important of course, but I&#x27;ve had success with both a disposable and a double-edge safety razor when using this product.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product -- for the first time in ages I&#x27;ve given myself a close shave without the resulting painful stubble and irritation.</li>
    <li> Pricy...but worth it and a little bit is all you need.  An excellent addition to the daily shaving experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK shaving creme but I&#x27;m going to try another brand.  Finding an old fashioned brush-on shaving creme is quite a task as most products of this type are sold in Europe.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good enough, but the cream is too thick, too hard to dissolve in your hands and the tube can be very slick when wet.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy, fast-growing  beard. I occasionally - like on a weekend when I know I&#x27;ll be @ home, let it go to scruff for a couple of days. Occasionally, I let it go longer into a goatee or full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower using cheap twin-blade disposables. And I have very sensitive, and easily nicked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow works great. Very close, very gentle shaves. Economical, only a little is needed, worked into a lather with the fingers, then applied. The eucalyptus scent is faint, which I prefer; the menthol cooling effect is subtle and pleasant, even for shaving \\&quot;personal\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically Proraso, I gather, in a different package and less costly.</li>
    <li> Clean smell, good (but not great) lather. I like it because it has a clean smell. I could do without the toothpaste, metal container. The lather could be better, but I have re-ordered the product more than once because I love the smell and feel of it.</li>
    <li> love this stuff for summer  time</li>
    <li> Smells great, soothes as you shave. It&#x27;s given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Never going back to drug store shaving foam.</li>
    <li> I liked the Proraso products, and I saw that this was made by them for Bigelow, so tried it out... Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff!  I especially like to mix a dab of this in the &amp;#34;Super Lather&amp;#34; fashion with hard soaps like williams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit different than the Proraso cream... More of a fresh breeze effect, cooling.  I would say proraso should try altering their formula to be more like this one!</li>
    <li> stop looking...this is it......the best shaving cream i&#x27;ve ever used......you won&#x27;t believe how great this feels.....by far, this is the best.....</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> This shave cream does a really good job and is worth the money. I use a Merkur razor and change blades every time I shave. I like the smell and how easy my razor moves with this shave cream.</li>
    <li> This product works very well shaving and smells really good.  It is very gentle on my skin and very compatible with my razors.  Love the cool effect while it stays on my skin. Great so far.  Will buy again before I ran out.</li>
    <li> This one the better shaving creams I have tried.  It lathers very quickly and shaves very smooth.  A great shave over all.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. Only a small amount needed; it looks like these tube will last me the better part of a year. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s favorite shave cream.  Smoothest and closest shave out there</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It smells good and lathers even better. And it lasts forever.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product. Always leaves skin feeling smooth, soothed and clean. Lasts a long time (half year in my case, but I don&#x27;t shave but 3-4x/week).</li>
    <li> They used to sell a can of this which was much larger and cost effective although not as smooth. This is great but I go through them so fast.</li>
    <li> good shave lotion.  may be too minty on some skin</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  His face is so smooth and his shave is so close.</li>
    <li> I just had my first shave with this product.  I squeezed out about 2 inches of product on my hand and applied to my face.  I shave in the shower because I have a stiff beard and the steam helps. When the water hit this it was like shaving with liquid graphite.  It has a pleasant barber shoppy smell to it.  Next time I will use a smaller amount.  I thinks this tube will last quite a while.  The only downside is dealing with the product cap in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Jack Black Beard Lube which is a great product.  I have to give Bigelow the edge.</li>
    <li> Best cream out there. Why do you have to keep writing I have no Idea, but it is annyoing  .</li>
    <li> I found this shaving cream to be somewhat middle of the pack. It lathers up much better than some poorer quality creams, but not nearly as well as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it has no obnoxious scents, but is rather neutral in that regard.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff, I pair it with the Philips norelco 2D and to be honest it wasn&#x27;t any better than $5 Nivea cream. But with a blade, this stuff is great. :)</li>
    <li> This product used to be the well-liked Proraso shave cream, but it was recently rebranded.  It is designed entirely to feel great on your skin and protect it from the razor you are sliding across it.  The menthol gives a very strong cooling effect (like a brisk fall breeze), and the lather is thick and protective.  Unfortunately, all that menthol give the product a scent that is heavy and medicinal, like menthol cough drops, though this cream will be just as soothing on your face as cough drops are in your throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream for new safety razor shavers.  It is reliable and not too expensive while you figure out how to lather.  More experienced shavers might have other preferences, but this is great place to start.</li>
    <li> As others have noted, this Bigelow Shave Cream is identical to [[ASIN:B001L2U61E Proraso Shaving Cream]], as it is made by them. Whether it&#x27;s Proraso or this Bigelow Shave Cream, I get a first-class shave when I lather up with my trusty Col. Conk badger brush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the beer shaving cream I have ever used. I allows for a close shave with no friction...and no knicks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Gives good protection for your face and a close shave. It only takes a small dab so the tube last a long time. Highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this at bath and Body to try a cream after using Foam for a while. It is so good, far better than foam. It gives good lather with very little cream, and shaving is very easy. I would seriously recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!  I wouldn&#x27;t know since I don&#x27;t shave but he will never go back to drugstore brands!</li>
    <li> Proraso has been impossible to get for a few months and there seems to be a backstock of this stuff, which is exactly the same and made in the same factory. A favorite shave cream of mine, especially for the summer months. Take a hot shower with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap and have a good shave with this for a great time.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for any one. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Best in the market.&lt;br /&gt;i am going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 5 years. Got it as a present and was quite skeptical, since it didn&#x27;t foam and smelled too &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;. One shave later and I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes such a small amount for a single shave, a bottle this size lasts me 6-12 months. The lack of foam means I can see exactly what I&#x27;m shaving, not just plowing through a mountain of foam. It feels great, very little irritation for me (less than my old foams). It didn&#x27;t take long for me to love the smell, perhaps because I love how well it functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also buy a 3oz (or less?) size for flying.</li>
    <li> wow this shave is the best there is for the price it makes you feel like a million bucks and more!</li>
    <li> For the last few years I&#x27;ve been using a Trader Joe&#x27;s brand of Mango shaving cream, which worked fine while I was using Mach 3s. But then I switched to the Merkur Double-Edge Razor 38c and the shave was so close (with Derby razors), that my face felt dry and stung a bit after I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a better shaving cream so I did some research and came to the C.O. Bigelow with Eucalyptus Oil. The oils apparently help because now after I shave, my face feels moisturized and doesn&#x27;t sting. I also love the refreshing smell. Another plus is that this is affordable. A small dab is all a shave takes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is rough on guys with sensitive skin or skin allergies. Felt great going on and provided a good shave but I had an allergic reaction to the ecalyptus oil and menthol that made my lips swell up weep and caused bad acne along my jawline and under my beard. Pretty much anywhere the cream came in contact or where residue was left in hair I had a break out. A look on line showed that others had experienced problems with Bigelow&#x27;s formula. I had to shave off part of my beard to treat the affected skin. For me it was not a good experience. Use with caution gents!</li>
    <li> I tried this but decided I couldn&#x27;t spend this much regularly on shaving cream.  However, it was amazing.  I wish I  could justify spending this much.  I used it with a Merkel long handle safety razor and Feather blades.  I tried this as a result of significant praise on online forums, and it did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to shaving cream again. This actually makes shaving tolerable. I hate shaving. This makes it easy and less irritating. Don&#x27;t have to use alot, i&#x27;ve gone through half a tube in 2 months.</li>
    <li> I bought a small tube of this at a mall retailer to put in my travel kit a year or so ago. I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. Well, I was starting to run low and I was so pleased with this item, I thought I&#x27;d get more for everyday use. A trip back to the mall yielded no luck, as the retailer no longer carried the shave creme. Happily, I was able to find this item for sale through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way! A 1/4-1/3 inch amount from the tube is all it takes. The more you work the lather into your beard, the better it gets. I have a medium scruff to shave in the morning. Makes a nice &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; lather, and allows a very close and smooth shave.  The razor glides nicely over my face. Makes your skin very smooth afterward. A sharp razor really helps, of course. Smells nice, too. Beats anything I&#x27;ve ever used before! Try it.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving cream for christmas this year and its definitely one of the best things i got. i know that sound weird but it completely changed my wet shaving experience. this product has a great smell, easy to whip into a great lather, and a great price.I highly recommend this to anyone even considering it.</li>
    <li> Much better than shaving cream out of a can.  Made in Italy - great light scent - gives a close shave and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> The last tube I bought was substantially thinned out from the others I have used for the last 2 years.  In other words, less product.  With that being said, it is still the best shave cream I have found, especially if you shave your head.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on clearance after Christmas at Bath and Body works and now my husband cannot live without it so we order directly from the manufacturer. It is fantastic. My husband has a very heavy beard and he loves it. Gives him baby smooth skin and a super close shave. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Background: 20 years of experience shaving this face in over a dozen countries from an outdoor sink in the jungle, to out of a cup in a desert, to five star hotels in Asian capitals, to locker rooms in big name gyms in North American urban jungles.&lt;br /&gt;I like a great shave, so I&#x27;m willing to try different shave gels or creams to get the smoothest shave with the least irritation.  I placed the C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream up against three contenders.  I looked at a couple of characteristics - Lather and feel on skin, scent, blade lubrication, and harshness/drying effect on the skin.  I&#x27;ll comment on the container and why that matters, and lastly, I&#x27;ll comment on value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00596VEP0 Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream, 5.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]: Smooth feel and low lather - not foamy, with a slight tingle from an oil of some type (mint?/menthol?).  Clean but gentle scent - not overpowering.  Blade lubrication is awesome, with the ability to shave against the grain and repeat strokes to get every last stubble without putting on more.  This one leaves my face less dry than the others and was a big selling point.  Comes in a synthetic tube, which is smaller than a can, flexible, and doesn&#x27;t freeze and explode if left in a gym bag in your car in winter, and you know when you&#x27;re running out.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the second place contender, but it lasts a long time and the benefits outweigh the cost in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002L03N74 C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 5.2 Oz.]]: A CLOSE SECOND place - Smooth and silky feeling cream on the skin, very cooling (strong) with eucalyptus oil, and some lather.  A sophisticated masculine and slightly herbal scent, definitely not a teen-aged pop smell.  Blade lubrication is really good, even against the grain, and I am able to go back over missed spots a second or third time without reapplying more.  The ONLY downside to this product is that it leaves my skin pretty dry.  Comes in a metallic toothpaste-like tube, compact and easy to carry on a plane or toss in a gym bag - doesn&#x27;t freeze and make a mess as explained above, and you know how much you have left.  This is an expensive shave cream, but again, it lasts a long time and has a lot of benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00A0J08H6 Axe Shave Gel, Chilled, 7 Ounce]]: A more distant third place - smooth and foaming gel, cooling and soothing feel (uses menthol) with a more active/sporty/youthful but definitely clean smell.  Blade lubrication and skin drying effects are where Axe fell short.  If you miss a spot, you will need to apply more before retracing your path with the blade.  The gel also left my face quite dry, but not as dry as the last contender.  The container is aerosol, solid and aluminum - which means it won&#x27;t leave a rust-ring on your counter or in your shower/tub like the steel of our last contender.  The aerosol aspect means it&#x27;s not going in your carry-on luggage, and it will make a mess if you let it freeze in your gym bag in your car.  You also don&#x27;t know exactly when you&#x27;re going to run out.  Value wise, it&#x27;s about half the price of the first two competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000530MS The Gillette Series Shave Gel, Ultra Protection, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]]: Forth out of four.  Good ole Gillette - one of the oldest names in the shaving business.  I used it as a teen-ager and was issued it in the U.S. military.  It&#x27;s a good, very inexpensive shave gel that gets the job done.  It has a smooth gel feel and a simple, clean but sporty scent.  It is the least effective blade lubricant of the four competitors listed here.  It severely dries out my skin and necessitates applying lotion after shaving.  Lastly, the container is aerosol and will make a mess if it freezes, and is made of steel, which rusts and can leave a brown-red ring in your shower/tub or counter if left wet.  Value wise, it is the cheapest of these products, but it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, spenda few extra dollars for a high quality shave cream like this one!a few extra dollars for a high quality shave cream like this one!</li>
    <li> THIS is what shaving should be. After going through several cans of shaving cream that ran out of propellant, but still had plenty of cream left, I decided to try this shave cream instead.&lt;br /&gt;Just tried it for the first time. My face feels like I just snuggled an entire tundric pine forest. As cool and fresh as if a glacier is licking my face. My skin is as smooth as an alpin lake, just as the sun peaks over an adjacent cragged, snow capped mountain. It&#x27;s like this tube is full of magic genies that only know how to do two things: 1. Magically, painlessly and effortlessly remove facial hair. 2. Turn your ordinary day into an incredible one.</li>
    <li> With all the positive reviews I thought this shave cream was going to be amazing. However after several uses I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s not terrible, but not great. Ingredients list is a little questionable, and I don&#x27;t find the lather to be as nice as Taylor of Old Bond Street creams. Maybe your experience will be different though, everyone has their preferences.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for way too long..this cream give me the best most constant shave - time after time!&lt;br /&gt;A real winner--and it last and lasts &amp; lasts..much better buy than canned products.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Love it. Used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is made by Poraso for Bigellow.  It has that faint Poraso moldy smell.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to regular shaving cream.  Smells like a man should too.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 7 years and even bought it in their stores when they had them. I switched to Art of Shaving when I moved and had a light bulb go off - I should check Amazon to see if they have this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on par with Art of Shaving, except half the price, so if you use that you&#x27;ll know what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet shave but am no means a shave snob. I&#x27;m  sure there are creams out there with the finest hints of grape seed, only produced in 60% humidity and are farm-to-brush, but this gets the job done and does it well.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Absolutely the best shave cream I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used several other premium shave soaps and creams, but this is the best. Wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other shaving creams. This is by far the best. I use double edge safety razors and get the closest shave of my life. My cheeks feel like they did in middle school.</li>
    <li> Practically no razor burn, there isn&#x27;t a lot slipperiness or foam to it, but it really help the razor glide. Nice fragrance, very light but pleasant. All their products I&#x27;ve been very pleased with</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!  Unbelievable lubrication. This cool really wakes me up in the morning. This was originally given to me as a Christmas gift from my brother-in-law.  This is a no brainier quality gift for a decent price for that guy who is hard to buy for.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by accident. I was traveling and my wife purchased this for me and now I will not use anything else.</li>
