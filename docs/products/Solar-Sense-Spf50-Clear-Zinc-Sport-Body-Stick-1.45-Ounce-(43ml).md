<li> Previous purchase of this sunscreen actually was clear.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought it in the past and it works very well for Sun Block.  </li>
<li> If your skin is at all dry, however, it will look chalky, so I moisturize before I apply it.  </li>
<li> Zinka has less white residue but is more expensive and you get less product in the bar.</li>
<li> warning, though, do not wipe your face with your technical tee after a run, as the product tends to stay on the fabric even after a wash, and if you tumble dry your t shirt, it could leave dark stains on it...</li>
<li> I noticed with the other it wasn&#x27;t keeping her patch from spreading.</li>
<li> Ill use it as long as I can find and buy it.</li>
<li> Tends to whiten my skin and it&#x27;s hard to rub off.</li>
<li> I tried using a type that wasn&#x27;t as heavy of a cover and didn&#x27;t have this white base.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You sent this out in an instant! I believe that it will stay on longer than lotions. Clear zinc is the safe way to go!</li>
    <li> The stick is so convenient to use.  Delivery went smoothly.</li>
    <li> We cannot find this product in our area stores. My husband finds it easy to use and reliable.</li>
    <li> The ingredients were changed from the last time I bought this item last year.  The packaging states &amp;#34;Clear Zinc&amp;#34; but the zinc is actually white and cannot be rubbed in.  Previous purchase of this sunscreen actually was clear.  The zinc content has now been changed and should not be advertised as &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; zinc.</li>
    <li> This stick seems to protect me. I love the feel and consistency. It has a nice smell and there is no perfume odor. This product works for me in the tropical Hawaiian sun.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Clear Zinc for a while now, and it&#x27;s a great sunscreen. Really stays on. I just wish it were more clear. But it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s truly easy for my kids to use at camp. The size and shape of a deodorant stick.</li>
    <li> Zinc sunscreens have come a long way since the days of solid white noses on lifeguards.  This product doesn&#x27;t go on clear, but it does dry to a relatively clear &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; pretty quickly.  If your skin is at all dry, however, it will look chalky, so I moisturize before I apply it.  Ease of application is a real plus, especially compared to gooey lotions and creams.  This glides on like a stick deodorant and is scent-free.  After melanoma surgery last year, I am a faithful user!</li>
    <li> Purchased 4 of these for my girls and I they&#x27;re long last, great coverage, and great price.  We only use on them on our face.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, good coverage from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Most other products too greasy, too light, not enough protection etc&lt;br /&gt;Immediate delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I would keep ordering this from Amazon</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply for certain parts of body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my dog who has discoid lupus. It has been working fabulously! It has really helped to keep it at bay and from spreading any further.  I tried using a type that wasn&#x27;t as heavy of a cover and didn&#x27;t have this white base. I noticed with the other it wasn&#x27;t keeping her patch from spreading. What a difference and she doesn&#x27;t try to lick it off, either, like she did some of the lotions I tried.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but I can use this on my face. I originally got this at a box store, loved it so much I came on here and bought it in bulk. Goes on clear. Not greasy. No residue .LOCKS OUT THE SUN.  It&#x27;s great. Ill use it as long as I can find and buy it.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of white residue... Zinka has less white residue but is more expensive and you get less product in the bar.</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  I&#x27;ve bought it in the past and it works very well for Sun Block.  I just wish they would come out with the Spray format again, also very effective.</li>
    <li> Good protection from the sun for my arms and neck...</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Walmart, but they apparently quit carrying it!

It is a balm, so it has a bit of a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel at first. Once you rub it in, it feels great. I love how it feels moisturizing while protecting you from the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has significantly less ingredients than most other sunscreens. If you want something that is more natural, yet effective, this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that it came in a bigger size as this size lasted me about three weeks (I was on the beach for one of those weeks).</li>
    <li> I wear it almost every day before a 6 mile run, and it stays put.. Great Price too and very convenient presentation...&lt;br /&gt;One warning, though, do not wipe your face with your technical tee after a run, as the product tends to stay on the fabric even after a wash, and if you tumble dry your t shirt, it could leave dark stains on it...</li>
    <li> Tends to whiten my skin and it&#x27;s hard to rub off.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on easy. Easy to see where you applied it but not overly white like other zinc based sunscreens</li>
