<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer. Not because of any technical or quality reason, but because my dentist recommended. I buy the year&#x27;s supply to get the very cheap sonic cleaning piece with it. If you aren&#x27;t aware, the sonic part simply vibrates the solution (with your mouth-guards submerged) to clean in a way that you just can&#x27;t. I bought a large &amp;#34;denture&amp;#34; toothbrush to use when I rinse my mouth-guards after using this solution.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fast and easy way to clean your retainers. I put mine in the shaker for 15 minutes and they come out fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Great quality product.  We have used this on our Invisalign trays for almost 3 years now.  It works great on jewelry, too!</li>
    <li> Love it! It works great for my invisiline retainers and really gets them clean!  I Would recommend this product and I will be buying it again!!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I wouldn&#x27;t use the sonic cleaner without these tablets and I often use the tablets without the sonic cleaner. I find the sonic cleaner a bit gimmicky and unnecessary. The tablets, however, are quite necessary. They keep my Invisalign aligners fresh, clean and clear removing all staining and plaque. I would recommend that if you have clear aligners, buy the product without the sonic cleaner. It&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than expected.  The product is fantastic!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These work well and remove the film that can form on aligners.</li>
    <li> There have been some negative reviews on the sonic cleaner, but I&#x27;ve found that it cleans my night guard, and my whitening trays beautifully.  Great for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Retainer Brite for years.  The product came on time and always does the job.</li>
    <li> The Retainer Brite Cleaning Tablets are amazing. My dental appliance is incredibly clean after using the tablets. However, I&#x27;m not sure of the value of the sonic cleaner. It is cheaply made, uses batteries, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. I recommend the tablets, but skip the sonic cleaner.</li>
    <li> been using this product for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these on retainers/Invisalign for about 6 years. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff has kept my nightguard clear and smelling fresh where other products fail. The little vibrating cup is surprisingly effective.</li>
    <li> I still wear a retainer at least once a week to keep my teeth straight as they tend to shift when I don&#x27;t wear it. I have been purchasing these tablets for a few years now and they do work great at keeping my retainer smelling nice and looking nice. I don&#x27;t use the battery operated tray except to put my retainer in. I don&#x27;t turn it on or waste my time with that. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work anyway. But it makes a nice holder. The tablets last me a long time and work better than sitting there trying to brush my retainers with a toothbrush. Keeps everything clean and when it needs to go back in my mouth -- you need that! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the battery operated tray. Seems wasteful. Why not just give me a retainer tray instead?</li>
    <li> I like the cleaning tablets, but quit using the sonic cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t like the noise and didn&#x27;t see a difference in the quality of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for cleaning a night bite guard. It does the job and in 15 minutes as advertized. I find it does a good job on my SoniCare toothbrush head &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; as well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These are a great product for cleaning retainers.  With this supply I received the sonic cleaner which works really well.</li>
    <li> Retainer Brite was recommeded by my Dentist. Works on Invisalign and is a great product.</li>
    <li> These sanitizing tablets work great to clean and disinfect oral retainers in under three minutes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my retainer looks like new.  Just a warning, though, if you don&#x27;t soak it long enough, it can give you mouth sores.  I let mine soak all day.  The only problem I had was when I was supposed to wear the retainer 24/7. I would clean it and put it back in my mouth too soon. Other than that, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
    <li> We bought this to restore our night guards that had become, well ..... nasty.  The tablets in conjunction with the sonic cleaner did the trick. They look like new!  I leave mine in for about 30 minutes at a time when I clean it.  Maybe on other types of mouth appliances it would work faster.  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve also tried it without using the vibrating sonic cleaner and it did not work as well.</li>
    <li> These are alright, but Efferdent tablets are effectively the same thing, and you can actually buy them at the local drug store. The included sonic cleaner is basically worthless. It spins and buzzes, but adds no obvious cleaning action. If you do keep buying these, just get the tablets.</li>
    <li> Eliminates odors promptly in my bite guard, leaving it inoffensive and clean.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the sonic cleaner but the tablets are great to use.</li>
    <li> The retainer brite cleaning tablets work fine. The &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; cleaner is a very cheap addition that I fell for, hook, line and sinker.  It is 100% plastic.  It &amp;#34;walks&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s turned on, and sucks the juice out of the two AA batteries in less than a week.  If any water gets on the sonic cleaner (which is water you use to clean your mouth appliance), it goes straight to the batteries and leaves an ugly copper colored stain on your vanity, sink, etc.  It&#x27;s from the water soaking through to the batteries.  You have to put it on something that you don&#x27;t care about (washcloth).  So, based on the number of batteries I&#x27;ve gone through, and the mess from the batteries, I am getting a more expensive sonic cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great value and it works really well.  I can&#x27;t believe how long the batteries will last.  Sometimes my son forgets to turn it off and its still been running strong about a month now.</li>
    <li> Retainer Brite does exactly as the name implies.  I notice that when I don&#x27;t use it my night guard gets a sort of yellowish tinge to it. a 20 minute soak in Retainer Brite and it looks brand new.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> Super cheap &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; cleaner. Would not order it again and it also says it comes with two AA batteries as seen in the picture.  It didn&#x27;t. No batteries. Keeping the package because the deal on the tablets was good and they are authentic. The sonic cleaner, NOT SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with just using a toothbrush to clean the retainers for invisiline.  They were still dull and after a week I did not want to put it in my mouth!  The Retainer Brite Cleaning tablets used daily made all the difference in the world!  I use them everyday and they remove all residue.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It cleans my mouth guard and there are not many products available to do that.</li>
    <li> Retainer brite does a great job at cleaning your retainer</li>
    <li> This product does a WONDERFUL job with the retainers. I think that it is necessary to still use a toothbrush on your retainers in between Retainer Brite cleanings. This product really does a good job of getting rid of the calcium build up on the retainers and keeps them looking new.</li>
    <li> The price is right for the tablets, but the machine is cheap.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.  A built-in shut-off would have been convenient instead of using a kitchen timer but for the cost this is a good value.  Wish my previous dentist would have told me about this product.</li>
    <li> They clean well and are a good price for a 1 year supply of keeping my teeth straight.</li>
    <li> I wear Invisalign and they have to be cleaned all the time.  Every morning I clean in this little system while I have my cup of joe...what a convenience!!!</li>
    <li> The Retainer Brite Cleaning Tablets are good, however, the Sonic Cleaner had no instructions on how to use it or batteries that the box container said were included!  Please check on these type of things before shipping!  With this, you have rated poorly!</li>
    <li> Very, very effective!  It does the job in a very short time.  You won&#x27;t need to go to your dentist anymore to clean your retainer. I was SHOCKED that the battery operated sonic cleaner runs so long without the need to change batteries.  I&#x27;ve used mine for over a year and it is still running just fine.  : )</li>
    <li> These are effective and affordable and I like the &amp;#34;shaker&amp;#34; that you use with it</li>
    <li> Works well. Sonic cleaner works great.</li>
    <li> The product works well and comes nicely packaged.  Consistently clean over time and provides a needed service for those who need it.</li>
    <li> Perfect device for keeping retainers clean for a fraction of the price. Just have a package of AA batteries handy.</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner is nice and quiet, works well to agitate the liquid, and my invisalign aligners come out nice and clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I think the cleaner container is extremely cheaply made.  Of course, it is made in China, and I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but anyway, I am disappointed in the quality of it.  The cleaner tablets seem to be all right, though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based off of other reviews on Amazon for use with my new Vivera retainers.  I&#x27;ve been using the product daily for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the months I was wearing the Invisalign braces I used only hydrogen peroxide to soak them in daily.  By the end of the two week timeframe for each set of trays I found the trays to be slightly yellowed (even though I never ate with them in and only drank water).  And the refinement trays would smell after a few days (it seemed like the material of the trays had changed from the initial sets I had).  So, I was concerned about caring for the retainers when they came in since they are supposed to last a few months each.  After 3 weeks, I am very pleased with the Retainer Brite.  The retainers are still clear (no discoloring), there is zero smell associated to them, and they feel very clean.  That&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, I have not used the Sonic Cleaner.  It sits on the shelf in the box it came in.</li>
    <li> Daughter really loves this.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it really works!  Trying to keep her retainer clean/smell free before getting this was awful.  So glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> This was a really good price for the cleaning tablets as I purchased them last summer and spent more from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It does a good job of cleaning my retainer and my grandma&#x27;s dentures.  It is quick and easy to use no matter where I am.  I would recommend this product anyone.</li>
    <li> The cleaning tablets in conjunction with the sonic cleaner work great. My retainer was dirty from years of use and now it&#x27;s nearly spotless.</li>
    <li> i bought this knowing that ill be getting a new retainer to replace my temporary one.  Came a day early AND works amazing.  allthough, didnt come with batteries for the sonic cleaner.  i enjoy having it because i can clean my retainer while taking a shower and brushing my teeth, wash it off and then im good to go. :) recommend to anyone who has retainers.</li>
    <li> I really like the unit as it cleans the retainer very well and all in only 20 minutes. Best to follow the instructions and use warm water to be sure tablets dissolve quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the vibrating cleaner - what you are really paying for is the year supply of the cleaning tablets. I wore invisalign for nearly two years and never once saw the the plaque buildup that I was told would occur, despite never brushing the aligners themselves and relying solely on leaving them in this cleaner for 30-60 minutes a day. I&#x27;m now using them for my retainers - they just leave them smelling and feeling great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Machine doesn&#x27;t work too well</li>
    <li> GREAT product GREAT value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years with the same clear retainers and they are as clean as they were when I first got them. Since mine are all plastic, I just leave them soaking all day rather than just the 20 minutes or so and it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
    <li> The retainer brite cleaning tablets are great. However, the sonic cleaner appeared used instead of being brand new. The batteries that were supposed to be included (per information on the package) were missing.</li>
    <li> The retainer brite works well - if you follow the directions..no complaints there.  However, the box for the sonic cleaner indicated that the batteries were included - they were not.  There are also NO instructions on how to use the sonic cleaner, with the product, whether it be for a night guard, or for jewelry.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The Retainer Brite product is great but the &amp;#34;sonic cleaner&amp;#34; is a piece of crap. Shakes, spills etc. Will not replace when it dies</li>
    <li> This works great with my aligners and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either!  I use it every day to clean my invisalign.</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner apparently had been used by someone before , and it does not has the battery it say it should come with in the manual</li>
    <li> I have not begun using them yet.  Friends who purchased them really like the product more than others in the stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 1 year supply of Retainer Brite from this merchant because it also included a sonic cleaner.  I had no idea that the sonic cleaner was so poorly constructed to the extent that it would cease working after only 2 minutes of use.  The box that the sonic cleaner was packaged in was also missing the two batteries that were supposed to have been included.  Sadly the sonic cleaner will now be sent to an overburdened landfill.</li>
    <li> Cleaning devise is just a toy. it is a joke, mfg some where else. cleaning tabs works good in a bowel</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and used to pay a fortune.  Your price was so reasonable I read the fine print.  However, it was the exact same kit I&#x27;ve been buying for years just at a price I could actually afford.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 to 6 weeks now. It appears to work. I don&#x27;t have a way to test the bacteria that may be left on it, but It appears to be clean. I&#x27;ll keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> Got this package because I use this for my retainer and the price of buying in bulk is cheaper.  Since they throw in the sonic cleaner for free, I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the sonic cleaner that often - it seems to work fine, but the difference in clean before and after using it is fairly subtle.  I can&#x27;t say that the cleaning is any better than using a toothbrush on the retainer.  The other drawback is that there&#x27;s no shut off timer on the device.  You have to keep track of how long you&#x27;ve let it sit in the cleaner (instructions recommend 15 minutes), then go and shut it off.  If you&#x27;re prone to walking away from things, you could easily forget this is on and run down the batteries.</li>
    <li> I searched for the best price - huge difference in pricing!  I highly recommend using retainer brite instead of toothpaste.  We were not informed @ the orthodontist&#x27;s office that toothpaste will dull the retainer and my son kept his in the plastic case given to him, instead of keeping it soaking in water when he&#x27;s not wearing it.  My son sets the microwave timer so that he doesn&#x27;t forget to brush it and rinse it after 15 minutes of soaking in retainer brite.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. Shipped and received on time and as described. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product if you wan tto keep your mouth guard clean at all times this is the product to purchase.</li>
    <li> They are great with Invisalign!  Keeps them clean and fresh.  Container is very convenient for soaking.  Order came as described.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised. This was recommended by my Dentist for my flexible Dentures. The Tablets alone are worth the price so the Sonic Cleaner is a bonus. The Sonic Cleaner has a bad reputation but it works up to a point.</li>
    <li> I have used retainer Brite for years for my mouth appliance. My dentist, Dr Gayle Steelman, recommended I use this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased because son had braces removed.  He likes how it works and is fast, hopes with getting out for school on time.</li>
    <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my daughter&#x27;s retainer.  Easy to use and keeps the retainer sparkly clean. She will use these for many years.</li>
    <li> The tablets work wonderful for my retainers, However save yourself some money use a cup, the sonic cleaner is not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> The perfect item for a person who wears a retainer or Invisalign braces. The ultrasonic cleaner ailong with the retainer brute tablets does an excellent job cleaning your device&lt;br /&gt;The items arrived in just two days!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  I have used it before and this cot was a significant saving.  It was a good choice.</li>
    <li> My new retainer will be clean for at least this year.  I have a new retainer, one after braces and was unsure how to keep them clean, no fears now.</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner was cracked and broken; I wish they were more cautious when shipping. The cleaning tablets themselves are pretty good though. I</li>
    <li> Great product but size of battery compartment of the cleaner should have been designed to be a bit larger. batteries barely fit into space.</li>
    <li> These are great, and the little soaking container was just an added bonus. I keep it right on the sink so my son doesn&#x27;t forget to wash them. I don&#x27;t know if the vibrating container really helps, because the Retainer Brite product is really good.</li>
    <li> The service was fast and a good value.  I searched the web and this was the best price for our needs.</li>
    <li> For a year supply of these + the cleaner this is a great deal!  My dentist was charging $30 for a month&#x27;s supply...this is a whole year plus a replacement cleaner (after about a year you really need to replace them).  This is the second time I have ordered this bundle.  It is a great deal!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these to clean her nightguard that keeps her from damaging her teeth due to grinding them in her sleep. Retainer Brite was recommended by her dentist. This was by far the lowest price available online, so we bought a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
    <li> This product is what our orthodontist recommended. The package was a better value than what I could get at the store.</li>
    <li> I love feeling that my bite plate is germ free!  The appliance that it comes with is great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.Black</li>
    <li> I like the way the tablets dissolve and it cleans the retainers well and can be used more than once during the day.</li>
    <li> Great value for cleaners, horrible cleaning case!</li>
    <li> Really keeps retainers clean and fresh.  I have recommended retainer Brits to friends and they all approve I&#x27;m glad  I was recommended this product</li>
    <li> Retainer Brite was recommended by the orthodontist to my son.  The product seems to be maintaining his retainer&#x27;s color and the Sonic Cleaner is helpful with this product.</li>
    <li> The orthodontist recommended these for my son&#x27;s retainers.  This was the best price anywhere.  He has not used the sonic cleaner but it was still cheaper to get this kit than others without it.</li>
    <li> While the tablets for cleaning the braces are fine, the &#x27;sonic cleaner&#x27; is a cheap piece of overpriced plastic. It did not even come with any instructions and we had to guess on how to make it work. Save yourself some money and just put the retainer in a glass of water - it will be just as clean!</li>
    <li> Tablets do the job as expected. Soaking container is very messy. You are better off just using a cup or glass.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Does a great job. My kids have been using this product for over 6 years.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipment, and great price!</li>
    <li> The cleaner is a piece of garbage but the tablets work great.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist; does the job needed.</li>
    <li> Product was recommended. By dentist for the care of dental appliances. So far it has worked as promised.</li>
    <li> My bf got this to clean his retainers and loves it. The only down side is when the sonic cleaner is on a hard surface it&#x27;s a little loud but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I really dislike the way the tablets&amp;#34;dissolve&amp;#34;.  The liquid appeared murky.  Even with running the little machine the tablets did not fully dissolve. I am sorry I bought such a large quantity.</li>
    <li> The tabs work fine I guess but the machine is basically worthless.  Just mixes up the solution.  Fair price, quick ship.</li>
    <li> I have severe TMJ and must  wear a device while sleeping. The dental device must be cleaned each day and the Sonic Cleaner with Retainer Brite Cleaning tablets does a fabulous job. The sonic cleaner works on batteries and I would prefer the ease of plugging it in, but with that exception, it works beautifully. I also like that I was able to buy a years worth of cleaning tablets at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a retainer or TMJ device, I highly recommend the Retainer Brite Cleaning Tablets and Sonic Cleaner.</li>
    <li> The cleaning tablets were fine, just want I wanted.  But the sonic cleaner was broker - I returned it and I have not heard anything in the way of replacing it....still waiting.</li>
    <li> Use these tablets daily.  Needed to stock up and saw them here on AMAZON.  I will order this item again.</li>
    <li> I was having to brush my sleep apnea mouth piece every morning before placing in my storage container.  With the Retainer brite system, I just rinse it in the sink, and place it in the retainer brite storage container, after I have filled the container with luke warm water and one of the retainer brite tablets.  It feels squeaky clean every night when I take it out of the container and rinse it off.  Great product, and it makes my life much easier!  I would recommend this to anyone who has a mouth piece, dental appliance, or dentures they need to clean.</li>
    <li> They are not fresh. So far each one is already broken and falls apart as you open them.  The cost was OK so I guess that is why they are not fresh.  When I&#x27;m finished with them I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The cleaning tablets provide effective cleaning for the retainers. They are a bit pricey, especially when three people in the household have retainers. I do recommend them, as these are exactly what our orthodontist recommends and uses for his patients.</li>
    <li> Smooth easy transaction and its the best product I have found for daily use to keep retainers in like-new condition.</li>
    <li> works well alone but works great with sonic cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t think it would make such a difference.  I use it twice a day with my invisaligns and my mouth feels SO much cleaner &amp; fresher :).  Very pleased with the results &amp; price.  BTW, since I no longer brush them, the opacity and &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; I was used to by the end of a two week cycle is completely gone!</li>
    <li> They were really good</li>
    <li> The tablets are working fine. But if you bought a one year supply, you received a Sonic Cleaner. The only problem was that the Sonic Cleaner did not come with any instructions. So I have no idea as to how it works which is a total waste.</li>
    <li> it works wonderfully to clean</li>
    <li> Does not stop plaque from depositing on the appliance.</li>
    <li> I bought this system on the recommendation from my orthodontist and it really works. More cost effective to purchase in quantity.</li>
    <li> The package included the sonic cleaner and the package indicated that batteries were included - they were NOT.  There were NO instructions in the packet as to how to use the product and they mailing did not include a receipt so that if necessary, there would be a problem in returning the items.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use my retainer anymore but when I did, I trusted the tablets do keep them clean. The sonic cleanser gets quite dirty so if you are not planning on cleaning it regularly, don&#x27;t even get it. Be careful with the tablets because they start dissolving the moment they come in contact with water.</li>
    <li> the the machine that cleans it sucks. dont waste your money on that buy the cleaning tablets instead and put it in a cup of water with your retainer for 20 mins while you are getting ready in the morning and the take it out and rinse and lightly brush your retainer with your toothbrush</li>
    <li> This product is 2 thumbs down. First off, the brite cleaning tablets do a POOR job cleaning. This is coming from a person who was using POLIDENT. POLIDENT cleans 100X better. I just gave this a try and i regret it. It leaves my retainers cloudy and not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND OFF!- the &amp;#34;sonic cleaning&amp;#34; battery area was not properly made.... Water would touch this area and it produced a nasty green/black liquid ( from the battery area). LIKE REALLY?!?! That is dangerous! I had to throw that out. And honestly this &amp;#34;sonic cleaner is trash.... it just vibrates.... no real action in cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sad i spent my money on this..... BACK TO POLIDENT!</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans my appliance while I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just over over the half way point with my Invisalign treatment, and recently bought a replacement supply. These work well and remove the &amp;#34;night mouth&amp;#34; taste from the aligners. Will probably continue to use these when I switch to a retainer when the treatment is complete.</li>
    <li> One negative, the tablets break easily before removed from package.</li>
    <li> Works great with invisalign &amp; retainer...still need to scrub, but gets initial &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; off.</li>
    <li> Product works well. Would recommend it to others. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Retainer-Brite works pretty well for both top (hard plastic) and bottom (plastic and wire) retainers. Can&#x27;t give 5 stars because still get buildup on the top retainer. Really like the year&#x27;s worth package.</li>
    <li> Tablets are great, but not worth the price with the sonic cleaner. Sonic cleaner was not satisfactory. It was cheap, battery operated, and didn&#x27;t clean my retainers any better than using an ordinary glass with a cleaning tablet.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years now.  I use a mouth guard at night because I grind my teeth.  I fill the white holder with water and one of the tablets then throw my guard it in every morning and it has stayed nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  Keeps her retainers sparkling clean.</li>
    <li> I had a retainer that I washed as the ortho had advised. I even went over board and was scrubbing the retainer every morning with it&#x27;s own private tooth brush and some serious cleansing agents. When I started to get out breaks on my skin that started to spread I went to the dermatologist. They took a culture and said it was a certain kind of bacteria. I asked them what it was from but they just gave me an antibiotic. That cleared up the skin issuers until 10 days after I&#x27;d gone off of the antibiotic. I called the derma back and they gave me another antibiotic. A stronger one. I asked them again what was the cause of the bacteria. I even asked them if it was from my retainer. They said they didn&#x27;t know and that if the next round of antibiotics didn&#x27;t clear up my skin issues they would have to send me to a disease specialist. I didn&#x27;t even bother to go get the prescription for the new antibiotic. I looked up the kind of bacteria that forms in the mouth. It was candida, which I have already been tested for and don&#x27;t have and Staphylococcus aureus. I looked at the lab results from the culture they derma had taken from my skin outbreak and it was the same exact thing. Proof that my suspicions that my retainer was to blame for my skin out breaks. I quickly research, via Google, something to help clean the retainer and found Retainer brite. It has been over a year now since I started to use the Retainer Brite. The time I&#x27;ve had the slightest out break was if I was out of town and forgot my Retainer Brite tablet. Now if I forget a tablet I just don&#x27;t wear the retainer that night. Mine flushed out through the skin but other people will have other symptoms from a heavy over growth of Staphylococcus aureus which will happen if you wear a retainer and don&#x27;t clean it with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Good deal. The little machine that comes with it sucks, but I use it as a second travel machine. Get yourself a better machine. The tablets are a good deal</li>
    <li> The tablets are great they get my invisalign nice and clean and of course smelling great,  the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34;  cleaner in my opinion is junk like another reviewer has said,  I&#x27;ve tested with and without the Sonic cleaner and I see no difference in the results but still a great buy for a one year supply</li>
    <li> I got a box from my Dentist to try on my retainers and it really cleaned them well.  It comes with the sonic cleaner which is battery operated and really cleans well.  I recommend for retainers, but don&#x27;t know how well it works on dentures.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this daily and loves it. It works perfectly and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> The tablets are great.  The sonic cleaner is a joke, however.  Does absolutely nothing to help clean the retainer.  Should have skipped the sonic thing and just bought the tablets.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004EKAF2K Retainer Brite Cleaning Tablets 1 year Supply + Sonic Cleaner]]  This is a no-brainer!  In the past, I have used products to clean my retainers that are made specifically for all type of dentures.  Sounds like a good idea, huh?  Not according to my Dentist.  He told me about Retainer Brite tablets, and said that this product is specifically manufactured for retainers; it is not as harsh as those products that I had been using.  Now, here&#x27;s the good part:  When you order a one year supply (under $60.00, or $5.00 per month), the people at Retainer Brite throw in really neat Sonic Cleaner that works off of batteries.  I was pleased to note that this offer was the same my second year, so I now have two Sonic Cleaners.  One I can keep at home, and one I keep at our river house.  You can also just keep in in the cabinet as \\&quot;back-up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Books are in excellent condidion..actually all items are in great condition.</li>
    <li> This item works great for ivisalign.  It cleans them out and gets them back to a fresh taste in your mouth. Works great</li>
    <li> Cleans my retainers beautifully. Quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Sonic cleaner doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning my bite guard,</li>
    <li> These work great.  Much better than brushing.</li>
    <li> Great product and good deal!</li>
    <li> Great for invisalign retainers.  Recommended by my ortho.  Use them everyday to keep my aligners clean.  Now sure about the sonic cleaner.</li>
    <li> Second time I have ordered the year supply  -  Works great</li>
    <li> Still cannot quite believe the price of these. Getting the sonic cleaner was a bonus. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work well, but it&#x27;s actually not bad.  the tabs themselves do a great job. I have had Invisaligns for 3 year - just wish I&#x27;d found these in the first year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated May 27th 2013: So, for the last year, I have been USING JUST HALF A TABLET - which means this box lasts twice as long. Now it really is even more of a bargain!</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner came with no instructions, and no batteries (the box says batteries included), however I am very happy with the retainer brite tablets. My retainers look awesome and it keeps them from being gross. I have clear retainers that are sort of like invisalign trays, so it&#x27;s important to be able to keep them clean without scratching them, and these work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son&#x27;s retainer. It cleans very well and was a better value than others I looked at.</li>
    <li> Tablets dissolve well. I use hot water, but dissolved in any temp. Does not tear well at perforations.  Keeps retainer as white and clean looking the day it was received, so feel the retainer is quite clean. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and love the product! been using it for years!</li>
    <li> its a good as they get, jh</li>
    <li> I had the retainers in the ultrasonic cleaner for a half hour. Nothing came off. The retainer brite solution is the same thing as Polident, but less expensive.</li>
    <li> The tablets do an incredible job with my Invisalign braces keeping them clean and fresh without fogging them or dulling them.</li>
    <li> it is a great product to clean my night guard @ a good price.  i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the cleaning tablets, but the Sonic Cleaner came with a defect in the battery compartment. Upon further inspection, there were two-in-one metal spirals overlapping each other. A random factory defect which made it difficult to insert a battery, so I took tweezers and managed to guide one of the spirals out. It wasn&#x27;t major so I didn&#x27;t send it back for replacement. Now it&#x27;s all better and the batteries fit with ease. Even though the Sonic Cleaner feels a bit cheap, it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great product - repeat purchase.  Have been using this product to clean my retainer for several years.  Easy to drop into the water with the retainer, bubbles up and keeps the retainer clean and smelling good.  Don&#x27;t use the sonic cleaner that comes with the purchase, but that works well on my wifes jewelry - so it&#x27;s a win-win.  Also, getting the years supply is a great idea.  Save you money in the long run and these are small enough to store.</li>
    <li> My son has been using Retainer Brite tablets to clean his retainer for over a year. It&#x27;s not easy to get a teenager to keep things clean. But this product seems to interest him to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;This makes mom very happy to know it least his retainer is clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Leaves my retainers feeling clean.  Have yet to use the sonic cleaner, but don&#x27;t really feel the need for it.</li>
    <li> The cleaner itself is totally cheapie - doesn&#x27;t even have an auto shutoff, but it works. I like knowing my invisalign trays will be clean.</li>
    <li> Simple product. Does the job well. Easy to tell when product is done cleaning as color of water changes from blue to clear.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 1 month, my $300 TMJ night guard started disintegrating!  I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The power cleaner is crap, I only use the cup to fill with water. The tablets do clear regular mouth smells but other smells like tobacco are impossible to remove from the retainers with just the tablets. Also the tablets dont keep clear the retainers just smelling better. I use Invisalign btw.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist recommended this product 10 years ago and I have used it weekly for my retainer since then.</li>
    <li> It works great, so glad I bought this package deal. The vibrating cleaning cleans it quickly. I would recommend this to other customers.</li>
    <li> The cleaning tablets work well on Invisalign. And, for the Amazon price, you can afford to use one every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonic Cleaner is so weak that it is worthless; just look on it as a freebie that is worth what you paid for it.</li>
    <li> Makes my retainer clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I use a tablet every day. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the sonic cleaner... I used it once and it chipped my appliance :/</li>
    <li> The Tabs r fab ...the cleaner is ok.... I use it no matter what... Would recommend this product if u have retainers</li>
    <li> Think cleaning them with a toothbrush and paste works better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! If you wear Invisalign, it&#x27;s a must! I use it every day to clean my aligners.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried sonic part yet. The retainers are clean and smell fresh. Still need to brush.</li>
    <li> Works great for my night guard.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our orthodontist, this is far better than the standard denture cleaners.  Much more effective in cleaning retainers especially the invisalign style.  This cleaner doesn&#x27;t develop  the cloudy build up other like other denture cleaners.</li>
    <li> my retainers smell better and appear to be keeping clean with continued use of this product this product added to brushing the retainers seems like a good match</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I also use it on jewelry and it does a better job than many products that are sold for that purpose.</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner and cleaning tablets are excellent.  Am very pleased with the quality of the cleaner and am very pleased with the 1 year cleaning tablets.  Use it every day</li>
    <li> My order was received promptly and correct. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> We bought this product because it is cheaper than using mouthwash. One tablet a day is simple and cheaper than bottles of mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have been using invisalign for 6 months now and I dont know how I would have got through without these awesome tablets, yes a bit of light brushing is needed before I soak the aligners into the cleaner but once I take them out they come up a treat!&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the 1 year supply, even though I only have 6 months left of treatment I will then be using it to clean the retainer they give you to wear at night once I have finished wearing the invisalign trays.&lt;br /&gt;I dont use the sonic bath, I just use my own cup - works the same.</li>
    <li> Product performs as promised. It&#x27;s fast and easy although cleaner tablets sometimes crumble and particles are lost before they can be properly dissolved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It works very well. I hate to be without it. My appliances are clean with no strange smell or taste.</li>
    <li> Amazing little gadget - Easy to set up, just add two AA batteries and off it goes (just flip the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch). With warm water and one tablet, it cleaned my retainers beautifully. It says to run for five minutes. I did eight because my toothbrush hadn&#x27;t been doing such a great job so far. Really, really happy with this purchase.the perfect</li>
    <li> The retainer cleaner and tablets came the very next day! My daughter says the tablets leave her retainers tasting fresh and clean. I don&#x27;t know what the cleaner does other than vibrate, but it helps my child remember to clean her retainer.  So, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Rembrant cleaner is great however the sonic cleaner is a total piece of garbage.  It is not water/moisture proof and allows the batteries to rust within a month or two of purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used all the other cleaners safe for retainers, but none work like Retainer Brite.  It cleans your retainer thoroughly in about 30 minutes completely killing any odor, but doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue build up.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works well on cleaning my oral appliances.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Good product</li>
    <li> I bought this product after deciding that I would do Invisalign treatment and after reading all the rave reviews about it. In my experience so far, the tablets work pretty well but I don&#x27;t care for the Sonic Cleaner. On my first day trying the tablets, I used the Sonic Cleaner that came with them and decided right away that it didn&#x27;t really work that well. It was kind of noisy and it still moves a bit on a flat surface despite the fact that it has a suction cup at the bottom (it sort of rotates around the suction and it my case that almost caused it to fall off the edge of my bathroom counter when I came back to check on it). When I pulled my aligners out, they were dirty still and I ended up brushing them anyway. What I do now is just use a cup with about 8oz of water (the directions say warm water, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to matter much - I&#x27;ve used warm and cool) and drop the tablet in. I put the aligners in right away and swirl the cup intermittently. The tablet makes the water turn blue but it also seems to clear fairly quickly. When I swirl it, it becomes blue again. So I just leave the aligners in for 15-20 min (although I&#x27;ve done it longer a couple of times after forgetting about them but they still seem fine). Then I take them out and give them a thorough rinse and they seem clean. Sometimes there is a little gunk left especially if I&#x27;m cleaning in the morning after waking up, but it&#x27;s not too bad. And perhaps I&#x27;m just being picky and noticing things that other people wouldn&#x27;t. So I use the tablets, especially as a quick fix, and I still brush the aligners fairly often, too, just to make sure. Between all this, my aligners seem to stay pretty clean. Oh, and one last note about the Sonic Care thingy - the little dark blue pull out tray thing is a convenient place to keep my aligners when I&#x27;m just hanging around the house. This tray now sits at the side of my bathroom sink and holds my aligners while I&#x27;m eating or brushing/flossing my teeth - like a soap dish. That&#x27;s been it&#x27;s only use since the machine part sucks. Other than these small things, I recommend the tablets. I use them almost every day (but I think every other day would do, too, if you&#x27;re on a budget or something and would rather not buy a year&#x27;s supply).</li>
    <li> Having a retainer for a couple of years now, this cleaner is taking off all the build up. I like using it in the Sonic Cleaner once a week and seeing the build up clear off after ever cleaning.</li>
    <li> I just got Invisalign for my 13 year old son. Knowing that he is not meticulous in the cleaning/hygiene department, I decided to purchase these tablets as a simple and sure-fire way to keep his braces clean. He has used them daily for two weeks. He lets them soak for about 20 minutes (he uses the agitator that came with the tablets, but I think it adds nothing) and finger cleans them with hand soap the other times he removes them. Anyway he just had an orthodontist appointment, and the doctor was not pleased with the cleanliness of his trays. Our orthodontist recommends cleaning the trays with toothpaste and a toothbrush. I had read that toothpaste can scratch Invisalign, so I was wary of having my son do it. From now on, he will!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product I was expecting.  The price was right for the product ordered. I now own three of these one for each child.</li>
    <li> Great price. As far as the product goes, works extremely well. The &amp;#34;Sonic Cleaner&amp;#34; simply vibrates and would be one of those items you wish would have a more aesthetic design. Does the job though!</li>
    <li> I use about 1 a day in the morning and fill up a small cup with luke warm water and drop the tablet in. I then wait about 15 seconds and drop my Invisalign into the cup and wait until the blue water turns clear and give them a rinse and a quick brush and put them in. Since I began using Retainer Brite my trays have not been stinky at all like they had been before no matter how clean I tried to keep them. I don&#x27;t use the sonic clear because a simple cup gets the job done just fine. If you have clear retainers or invisalign then this is a must get and this is by far the best deal out there for keeping them odor free and clean!</li>
    <li> Love these cleaning tablets for my clear plastic retainers!</li>
    <li> Will buy again later.</li>
    <li> This is the simplest and most effective cleaning process. My teenage so uses it every night at dinner time to clean his clear retainer while he eats dinner. He has been using it daily for 3weeks now and it does an amazing job keeping the retainer stain-free.  A definate must-have for the clear retainers!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the sonic cleaner, but I really appreciate the cleaning tablets.  Wish I had known about them&lt;br /&gt;a couple of years ago when I started with retainers.  The sonic cleaner did not come with instructions.</li>
    <li> It did a good job while it lasted, but quit working after about 2 years of regular use.  Priced cheap.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely on my A list. I use these tablets daily on my acrylic retainers to keep them fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist gave me a few months supply of the cleaning tablets when I got my braces off. It worked great but then I ran out. This seemed to be the easiest/cheapest way to get more.</li>
    <li> Tablets work great for my mouth piece. The sonic battery powered cleaning device is a pile of CARP... Otherwise 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean my Invisalign and it&#x27;s the only thing I will use. It gets them clean and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, perfect condition, as advertised.  Great set at a great price.  Cleans invisiline retrainers great and the amount of packs lasts the whole year of using it every night.</li>
    <li> I have been using retainer brite once a day (in the mornings) for my invisalign trays.  I haven&#x27;t used the sonic cleaner yet, I usually just soak the trays in a plastic container and that works fine.  I soak them for about 15-20 minutes every morning.  I have been using them for about 4 weeks now and they leave my trays look clean and with a refreshing scent.  I would recommend retainer brite for anyone with clear aligner trays or retainers.  The retainer brite is less harsh on your trays then denture cleaner also.</li>
    <li> The Brite does not clean as well as claimed, and the ultrasonic cleaner is not very effective! Additional manual swabbing of the Retainers is required to clean them.</li>
    <li> I was an adult when I first had braces, and it isn&#x27;t an experience I want to repeat. Being such, I still try to wear my retainer at least 1-2x per week (almost 5 years later!), and these really keep my retainer clean. Once, when I ran out of the tablets and got lazy about reordering, I quickly regretted it, as I got cavities between my teeth from a dirty retainer (I just couldn&#x27;t keep it clean without the tablets!)  I will never let myself run out again!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a good job cleaning also tastes an smells good my daughter can do it all by herself</li>
    <li> The Retainer Brite Cleaning Tablets work amazing well on my Invisalign braces. Great deal with the sonic cleaner. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my kids retainer&#x27;s and it works well.  Construction quality is only average, but the functionality appears to be fine.  Importantly, my daughter is very happy with this.</li>
    <li> If you wear retainers this product is essential for maintainence....Drop your retainer into the cleaner, drop in a table and presto - sparkling clean!</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quickly, will use again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the maker of my night guard.  After trying my own ways of cleaning the guard, I decided to order this and I&#x27;m glad I did - it is so much easier to clean it with this and I know that it is not going to harm the guard.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time.  Easy to use and leave retainer very clean.  If you are looking for something easy (no scrubbing) these are great.  Just put one in a glass and it will do all the work.  The sonic cleaner is cheap and not needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Cleans and sanitizes very well.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a number of years and I am very happy with the product.  It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works very good on my retainer</li>
    <li> Great for my Invasalign</li>
    <li> A necessity fulfilled, Brite tabs work their magic to any dental appliance without introducing yellowness or degrading the material</li>
    <li> It is so nice not to have to take the time to brush my retainers each time after brushing my teeth! The retainers clean themselves while I&#x27;m eating, and with a quick rinse afterward, I&#x27;m ready to go! I am using rechargeable AA batteries. I received this a few days ago. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Buy only the tablets.  The device will break as other comments have said and it is useless.</li>
    <li> if you have a retainer then this is the perfect cleaner. a great way to clean  your expensive retainer&lt;br /&gt;save money and get a years worth</li>
    <li> I ordered this as my previous supply ran out. I had tried another cleaner available at stores but it really did not clean as well as this product does.</li>
    <li> I had an ultrasonic cleaner and needed more tablets.  The Retainer Brite tables work well on my clear retainers.  The cleaner that came with them worked fine, but it was noisier than my old one, so I gave it and some unused denture cleaner to a friend who just got dentures.  Don&#x27;t use denture cleaner on clear retainers--it turns them white.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Arrived in timely manner. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The retainer brite might seem like an ideal appliance for those who have retainers and want to keep them clean. One thing to consider it&#x27;s not for heavy cleaning. Overtime you might notice white spots on your retainer but the retainer brite won&#x27;t take them off compare to the SonicBrite. Also the Retainer Brite tablets mention in the box, the tablets will leave a minty taste on after the retainers have been cleaned. WRONG! It doesn&#x27;t give a minty taste, it doesn&#x27;t even give a taste at all. I know it might not seem important but if you want to are like me. I prefer to have a minty taste to give me a satisfaction my retainers have been cleaned. Last thing I found interesting is there would be times the retainer brite wouldn&#x27;t dissolve completely in the water. How do I know? Well when I would clean the appliance you can see bits of the tablets or even half of the tablet just sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I would recommend the SonicBrite because it&#x27;s a heavy duty retainer cleaner. The last thing I want it to have a dirty retainer.</li>
    <li> After using Retainer Brite for years, finding this at such a great price was a real treat.  I don&#x27;t go a day without using Retainer Brite with my splint.  I think it keeps it fresher.</li>
    <li> Great deal on Retainer Brite. Don&#x27;t look for the battery powered cleaner to be any good. It is complete junk.</li>
    <li> Great deal and the sonic cleaner works well</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner does a fair job of cleaning my Invisalign braces but one must use the cleaning tablets otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work well.  The sonic cleaner came without any instructions or the two AA batteries, which the box stated were included, a minor inconvenience. I like it because I don&#x27;t have to brush those braces everyday anymore.  For the price of only the sonic cleaner this package came with a whole year&#x27;s supply of tablets! So I have no reason to complain.  At the rate of one tablet a day, one year&#x27;s supply of Invisalign tablets would have cost me $180 instead of the $38 that I paid for this package.</li>
    <li> bought for my daughters retainer and it really works good. it was turning yellow and when we used the pills it did the job.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and was recommended by my dentist.  Works much better than other&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning tablets.</li>
    <li> My son uses this every night</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL FOR RETAINERS</li>
    <li> I have a real ultrasonic cleaner. It pretends to be that in the advertisement, when in reality it is a piece of junk plastic that doesn&#x27;t even seal in the contents so if you bump it while it cleans you can spill the cleaning fluid. It takes two double a batteries and sounds like it has a noisy cheap motor or vibrator built in. This will do NOTHING to assist in cleaning. It&#x27;s a gimmick.  However you can get a decent Ultrasonic cleaner online and use that with these tablets or polident and your clear retainers will sparkle clean.  But truth be told, either tablet if used regularly will get rid of 99 % of the build up. The ultrasonic cleaner that I bought is great but no longer available on amazon. Beware ANYTHING that simply says &#x27;SONIC&amp;#34; cleaner. It&#x27;s junk. If it doesn&#x27;t say ultrasonic (meaning in the ultrasonic range of sound waves it will do nothing. And beware any ultrasonic cleaner that has a hinged lid as the wires break inside the hinge inside of 3-4 months of daily to multidaily use. That model which I have 3 defective ones is the Ultrasonic Jewelry Eyeglass and Lens Cleaner  and they are typically under 30 dollars. ONLY buy the ones with a removable lid, because they have only one moving part to wear out (the ultrasonic driver, and in 4 years, it has not gotten tired at all. I use it everyday for my retainers, sometimes 2 or 3 times. Ebay still carries mine if you search for NEW PRO LARGE 60W ULTRASONIC ULTRASOUND CLEANER JEWELRY</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Just keeps my mouth guard clean and moist.</li>
    <li> The Brite Retainer Cleaner works as advertised.  The cleaning unit does not move significantly when vibrating and the sound is low.  The tablets do not have an obvious taste, so once I rinse the braces after cleaning, I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Great to have so many on hand, but wish they took everything off of my night guard so I didn&#x27;t have to scrub it &amp; put in the ultrasonic cleaner weekly.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very effective, shipped and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all my patients who have any type of oral appliance.</li>
    <li> Anyone who wears a night guard knows how icky icky they get.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t help it.&lt;br /&gt;But now when I get up I just put it in a glass with one of these tablets, and a short time later it&#x27;s clean and fresh-smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I found out about it from my periodontist.</li>
    <li> If you read the bottom of the Retainer Brite cleaner...it has exactly the same ingredients as the denture cleaning product you can get at Walgreen&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer has said  the sonic cleaner is a plastic piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money just buy Denture cleaner.</li>
    <li> This product was received in time as my son was running out.  Each tablet for cleaning retainers is sealed and the product was received in excellent condition in a timely manner.  I would order again in the future.</li>
    <li> We used the Retainer Brite tablets before and they were exactly what we expected!  The Supply and Sonic Cleaner we could have done without.  It didn&#x27;t work as far as we can tell,  Just jiggled the water.  We&#x27;ll probably just throw it away so it doesnt sit around cluttering our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we got what we paid so we&#x27;re happy with the transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these.  They are cheap enough and come in a year&#x27;s supply.  I like the price and quantity.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my 15 year old who is getting used to his retainers after having his braces on for about 2yrs.</li>
