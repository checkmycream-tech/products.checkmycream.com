      <li>so they are going to smell very strong and potent.</li>
      <li>I wish the Germ Fighter was a bit more spicy smelling, like DoTerra&#x27;s On Guard, because this one is very strong of tea tree, which I think smells like a nursing home, but for the price difference and resulting value I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>They are as good as Young Living Oils but at a much better price!!</li>

      <li>Great quality oils and love how these smell especially tranquility!!!</li>
      <li>They are strong and not as the name indicates.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took a minute to get the right thing (what I wanted to order, because some of the products are similarly-named) but once I got it, &amp;#34;Tranquil&amp;#34; alone is worth the price of admission.</li>
    <li> Very good for topical application and smell divine.</li>
    <li> I love the top 6 Essential Oil Synergies Sampler Set with the 100% pure, undiluted favorite plant therapy essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great oil blends at a great price,</li>
    <li> I love these essential oils</li>
    <li> These came in a nice simple packaging. All are in good conditions and no breakage. I love the smells right out of the tube but I find it doesn&#x27;t work so well in diffusers. No matter how much I put I just couldn&#x27;t smell it! I used it in both a himalayan lamp and a the traditional candle diffuser. The smell in the room is very faint and barely noticeable. As for the properties they claim - ie germ fighter I&#x27;m not sure if they really work. The tranquil, energy, relax, sensual smell nice if I smell straight from the tube or apply in my body directly but in diffusers so far hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found these oils!  They are as good as Young Living Oils but at a much better price!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and varieties. I took them on our vacation.</li>
    <li> These oils seem to be working really well. They arrived in a leaky box but I contacted the company and the quickly sent out a replacement. So they have great customer service which is always a huge plus! The oils smell really nice. Remember they are Therapeutic  grade so they are going to smell very strong and potent. When you dilute them either in carrier oil or in water for your diffuser the smell mellows out. I have bought many oils buy this company now and have been very satisfied with each one</li>
    <li> These seem nice, I am waiting for the diffuser I ordered but these do smell lovely and that&#x27;s nice even just for that.</li>
    <li> Great quality oils and love how these smell especially tranquility!!!</li>
    <li> Great way to get started with oils.  Nice blends.</li>
    <li> awesome product, great condition, and the best deal I have found for price.. would purchase again when I run out</li>
    <li> the oils are definitely top quality.  this proves that you don&#x27;t always have to spend a lot of money for high quality. especially when you know what you&#x27;re looking for. i&#x27;m happy with the oils :)</li>
    <li> Although I am new to essential oils, this set makes me wonder why so many people love them.  Each of the blends smell like medicine.  They are strong and not as the name indicates.  DOnt waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff &amp; company is out of Twin Falls, ID! Arrived early &amp; they all smell amazing! Great product and very convenient description on each bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband hates these scents (lol).  I can only diffuse them when he is not around.  They are not very pleasant scents--I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband and I like it very much. The oils is of very high quality and all I need is a couple of drops into my diffuser and the fragrance is all over the room.  The kit contains a great combination of blends for just about anything. I really love the oils from this company Plant Therapy I own some lavender and I put a couple of drops on me and it helps me relax and even takes my headache away. Fast shipping and great customer service.</li>
    <li> This set came as described, and prompt delivery. Have used a number of these, my favorite is the pain away. Love that they put the name of the oil on the top of the bottle, and list suggested use on the side of the bottle. Will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> all of the scents are really good,</li>
    <li> I really like all these except the germ fighter and immune-aid but that&#x27;s just my personal preference they still smell fine I just don&#x27;t care for them. I love the energy and relax. I put a few drops of energy on my padded bra strap and the smell is nice and fresh and keeps a spring in my step all day.</li>
    <li> Love these oils! And Love Plant Therapy! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> What a great way to try out some of Plant Therapy&#x27;s more popular choices.  While I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with 2 of them, it was definitely worth getting this set to try them out.  We LOVE LOVE LOVE Germ Fighter and will be ordering a larger bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant to try essential oils because of the price, this is the BEST way to get started!</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this product again. There&#x27;s nothing like relaxing after a long day while the aromatic smells of essential oils help you to release any tension. If you want a better life buy these.</li>
    <li> These oils don&#x27;t sit right with me for some reason. It&#x27;s completely subjective but I much prefer Nature&#x27;s Garden or Young Living.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oils!  These are perfect for beginner oil users.  I am using these in my cold diffuser and as I am reading and learning about how to safely use oils, these labeled oils make it able to use them right away and for the purpose needed.</li>
    <li> These oils are great! I use them daily and would feel lost without them. I started using Young Living brand essentail oils, but went looking for something more within my price range and still high quality. These oils have met my expectations and then some.</li>
    <li> I have very much enjoyed these oil blends.  They are of good quality and excellent price.  It would have cost me so much more to buy the oils and mix them myself.  I will definitely be a customer of Plant Therapy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sampler set as a way to get started with essential oils.  My sister got married several days later and I was so thankful I had the set in my purse.  We placed a few drops of Tranquil on a tissue and she carried it with her down the aisle.  Her pre-wedding jitters disappeared!  I&#x27;ve used most of the items in the set already.  Relax helped me on a flight where I was stuck in the middle seat for 12 hours.  I definitely recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Great company! I have done extensive research on essential oils because I am a cancer survivor and only want to use the highest quality oils. This company tests every batch and is well respected for their high quality oils. Having said that beware if you don&#x27;t like patchouli oil this set is not for you. The blends smell wonderful but the patchouli lingers. They were going to let me return it simply because I didn&#x27;t like the patchouli, great customer service, but I decided to keep it and just gift the ones with patchouli to friends. Great oils, great company!</li>
    <li> Every scent is very clear. Good quality essential oils. I always purchase from this company. Highly recommended for beginners because they send a little pamphlet describing the uses for each.</li>
    <li> I love this oil blend set. The sensual is my favorite. I can wear it as a daily scent. The germ fighter and immune aid offer two completely different ways to support a cold. The relax and tranquil are very similar.  Energy is similar to another brands &amp;#34;breathe easier&amp;#34;. These oils are the highest quality. They are even labeled on the top of the bottle with circular labels which makes finding a particular oil so much easier. I will never purchase from young living again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my essential oils.  Each one offers a different  effect for different uses. I especially love Germ  Fighter for minor ails and  Relax  for sleep.  Will buy again!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and delivered on a timely manner.</li>
    <li> We bought these for my husband to transition from using synthetic fragrance to something natural that is health and earth friendly. These surely did the trick, as they smell beautiful, actually have mood enhancing effects, and are of high quality. Obviously the Germ Fighter and Immune Defense aren&#x27;t being used as daily fragrances, but they are coming in very handy when the colds and coughs start spreading around. All in all, a great buy. I&#x27;ll be keeping my eyes out for other blends in the future.</li>
    <li> I use these almost daily!  They all seem to work as the labels indicate. We diffuse the Relax at night and Energy during the day. The Immunity seems to help give our systems a boost, and applying a drop of Germ Fighter in a carrier oil to the bottom of my feet definitely helped keep a cold away!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the essential oils.  Ran into a problem with delivery, and was more than taken care of, as well.  Very much appreciated!  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> A great variety of scents for a low price! Nice to have on hand when you need them. Great aroma and flavor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find blends that don&#x27;t offend or are too strong. These are really nice. Don&#x27;t put but a few drops in your water in your oil burner or it will permeate and maybe not in a good way. Just 3 to 5 drops and all the scents are very pleasant. I like this set.</li>
    <li> Great!everything as expected :)</li>
    <li> Love these oils.  They are the first I have ever used so I have nothing to compare to but they smell great and seem to do the job!</li>
    <li> Wanted the Germ Fighter before our trip to Disney, thought the assortment would be a great introduction to Plant Therapy. Had the oils expedited and received the order 2 days before our trip - yay! Unfortunately it was not the synergy oils, the individual bottles of essential oils. Austin of PT quickly responded to my desperate email and offered to send it to FL. I did not want to deal with airport security on the way back. Plant Therapy&#x27;s resolution was to give me full credit for the package,  allowing me to keep everything for my inconvenience.  Mindblowing! I did order their Relax and Muscle Aid synergy oils in between the emails with PT, which came along on our trip. I cannot emphasize how MUCH it saved us while we were there! The Muscle Aid saved us after we returned from the parks, which got sprayed/massaged on our feet and calves. Relax let me fall asleep quickly and soundly every night to be ready for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first run around with essential oils. I am excited to experience all that I can do for myself and my family with essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I am Plant Therapy loyalist!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of really nice blends in this set. I use them everyday.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  There is a good little variety to choose from.  The one that says it&#x27;s LIKE Thieves IS Thieves. It has the same ingredients. They just don&#x27;t call it Thieves for whatever reason. I think RELAX is my favorite blend out of the bunch, but I really like all of them.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase, my introduction to aromatherapy oils.  Great way to get started if you are new at this.  I read SO MANY articles, that, after much over thinking,  I finally just had to jump in and get started.  I have no regrets of going with Plant Therapy.  They have quality products.  They follow all the proper protocol to ensure their essential oils are to the highest standards.  They actually have a person that will email with you and help you get started if you are new.  I love how my house smells when my diffuser is on.  I sleep very sound with the Tranquility  blend..  and having ADD, that says a lot, and used to be a rare occurrence .  I really think the diffuser that you use makes a big difference..  mine is a Whisper Premium.  No regrets there either.</li>
    <li> I like this little sampler kit a lot.  I feel like the oils are good quality and the packaging was equal to other essential oils Ive purchased.  I will purchase more of these oils.</li>
    <li> These therapeutic essential oils seem to be high quality and just as described.  They arrived quickly and in good condition. I don&#x27;t think I could ask for anything more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to home therapeutics and essential oils. I&#x27;m the type of person who enjoys the a nice smell in the house without having to breathe in the smokiness of incense or the headache of lighting a new stick every ten minutes. Over the past years I&#x27;ve gone from glades to air wick to wallflowers. The reality is your nose grows accustom to any smell within a day&#x27;s time. If you want a whole home scent that last, this isn&#x27;t your solution. However if you want something you can use when stress kicks in and your ready to lose it then this is your thing. The way I tend to use it is on a hot plate (picked one up at bath and body works for cheap) and you add a couple drops to the plate when your ready to relax. The smell will permeate your room, however your pretty much limited to an average size room. If you want additional range then you&#x27;ll need a hotter source, like a candle oil burner. The problem is you&#x27;ll burn thru a lot more of this stuff but you&#x27;ll house will smell great for a temporal period of time (ideal for house parties). All and all I love these things and the reduced cost as compared to any of the other vendors. Save yourself the money and get these. They all smell great, some better then others. I&#x27;ll say half of them will be ideal for winding down, while the others are great for keeping you awake and alert. Energy doesn&#x27;t actually give your any more energy, but i&#x27;ll help reduce the effects of the onset of sleepiness. If you have any question feel free to ask away, I&#x27;m a big fan of these guys and I&#x27;d recommended them to anyone who want to have a sudo spa at home.</li>
    <li> These oils are deceptively good! When sniffed straight from the bottles, they kinda&#x27; stink. But...as I discovered, this is because they are SUPER concentrated. Once I place them in a diffuser or on a tissue they smell wonderful. And they&#x27;re quite effective too. A pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> I love the cute little sampler box of synergy blends! Very nice selection! I think Plant Therapy essential oils are very good!</li>
    <li> The essential oils I have used so far work beautifully.  So far I have used them all in a diffuser and they work as I would expect.  I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these synergies. I use both the Tranquil and Relax daily/nightly. they smell really nice and I would wear them even if they had no therapeutic effect, which they do. Sometimes if I&#x27;m restless when trying to sleep I realize I haven&#x27;t used my relax oil yet. I bought some roller bottles and mixed a few potent drops with grapeseed oil and the oils are strong enough that I still feel the effects with a diluted solution. I wish the Germ Fighter was a bit more spicy smelling, like DoTerra&#x27;s On Guard, because this one is very strong of tea tree, which I think smells like a nursing home, but for the price difference and resulting value I can&#x27;t complain. I just added some straight cinnamon and clove to the bottle and it&#x27;s pretty darn close now. The Sensual is predominantly ylang ylang, which I quite enjoy. I haven&#x27;t used the Energy blend much, but that&#x27;s because I tend to be anxious so I don&#x27;t want to shoot myself in the foot...I just went and put some on and it is mostly a smell of peppermint, which is making me feel more mentally awake, but not necessarily energized which is good. The Immune Aid is actually pleasant smelling and has frankincense listed first, but also has notes of tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note about the company: I was accidentally sent their top 6 straight oils instead of the synergy blends. I emailed them and they responded quickly that they&#x27;d send me what I actually ordered right away and that I could keep the other oils. Now that&#x27;s service!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy makes some of the best oils, we prefer them over YL or any of the higher priced oils</li>
    <li> I enjoy using them,  The germ fighter I use in a spray bottle, when I go to the gym.  Some of the others I use in my bath.  The immune system one, I put on the soles of my feet at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Great set, especially breathe.  I have chronic congestion and use breathe daily.  It really opens up my head and let me &amp;#34;Breathe&amp;#34;  I use immunity each day to help ward of illness and love tranquility and relax for lat evenings.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sauna, but using it now in the house. Reminds me of european saunas where they put a small amount of scented oil in the water bucket. Most smell like a men&#x27;s fresh fragrance, but definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> very cheap...they all smell the same.  i put them all in the goodwill box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will go back to spending a little more.</li>
    <li> Got these for a Christmas gift for a loved one &amp; liked them so much we ended up getting a set for ourselves. They are very reasonably priced compared to other essential oils. I recommend using them with the tear drop dispenser also found on amazon.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  I do add other oils to each one because none appeal to me straight out of the bottle.  The germ fighter contains cloves which are strong smelling so I only add one or two drops at a time.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the pricing and sampler sets from this company.  It will be my new go-to company for future purchases of essential oils.  It&#x27;s nice not to have to spend a fortune for something of equal quality to the products of the more expensive companies.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THESE ESSENTIAL OIL BLENDS!!! THEY ARE AMAZING!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t discovered the world of essential oils and their health benefits, do so.  If you have, then check out this company.  Wonderful quality and formulations, as well as a company with great integrity and purpose.</li>
