      <li>Comfortable on the pits.</li>
      <li>smell is great but definitely not invisible</li>
      <li>Each tube has 3 ounce of protection, and I bought the pack of three to get free shipping on my order.</li>
      <li>I think that is why it was so cheap</li>
      <li>I just opened it, but the quality appears to be good, no issues so far.  </li>

      <li>Not overbearing but clean</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant odor that isn&#x27;t too strong, and the anti-perspirant works as well as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>Pretty good, although the quality is not the same as off the shelf.  </li>
      <li>Amazon seems to have these 2 packs on sale every few months for a great deal</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and helps from sweat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of similar to the polo sport scent.  </li>
      <li>Good value and arrived as expected.  </li>
      <li>that the top of the line Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>This is typically $4 a tube in NYC, so the prioce with S&amp;S is good here</li>
      <li>Old Spice High Endurance Antiperspirant and Deodorant has been my favorite for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>The higher priced deodorants are designed to last for 48 hours which is ok</li>
      <li>I love the fresh scent anti-antiperspirant, lasted a long time and did not cop out when I needed coverage.  </li>
      <li>Works well on hot days.</li>
      <li>It worked, and I&#x27;m still using the first tube I opened.</li>

      <li>Its Pure Sport scent smells manly without being overbearing.</li>
      <li>Really like the pure sport scent.  </li>
      <li>is much cheaper</li>
      <li>Seemed easier than going to the store when he says I need more and hoping (with shipping delays) that he doesn&#x27;t run out and offend other people!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I switched back to my old favorite Old Spice Pure Sport High Endurance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m chewbacca&#x27;s bastard love child or not, but on the hot summer days, man can I work up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need 48 hours of protection and High Endurance</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds and none give me the performance that Old Spice does.  </li>
      <li>I picked up the Old Spice High Endurance Invisible Pure Sport antiperspirant / deodorant during a sale @ amazon.  </li>
      <li>We live overseas and this deodorant is unavailable here.  </li>
      <li>stated it went on clear and it does not.  </li>
      <li>Old Spice</li>
      <li>far from invisible.....</li>
      <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t use cologne - he uses Old Spice Shower Gel and Old Spice deodorant</li>
      <li>They should take all Old Spice off the market.</li>
      <li>At the end of the evening, covered in sweat and mud, I still smelled like the Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>Been using Old Spice High Endurance products for a long time.</li>
      <li>Just be aware when buying, I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirant and it can cause extreme rashes on my skin.</li>
      <li>I prefer the gel or clear whatever it is, the blue stuff.</li>
      <li>Ive used and tried out the more expensive versions that Old Spice and Dove for Men put out.</li>
      <li>Without the need for overtly flashy and marketing to drive up the price, this is just as effective as other Old Spice APD options as well as the competition</li>

<li> Without the need for overtly flashy and marketing to drive up the price, this is just as effective as other Old Spice APD options as well as the competition</li>
<li> The Gillette clear gel and the Dove on the other hand both last 15-24 hours (in wetness and odor control).</li>
<li> This is a white solid stick deodorant, so not totally clear.  </li>
<li> Have tried quite a number of other products, but none keep me dry like Old Spice.  </li>
<li> As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
<li> Like others have said it&#x27;s really not clear</li>
<li> I have to use my thumb on the inside of the dial, where there are some plastic ridges, with my index finger pressed tightly on the outside to get it to turn and only if I dry the dial and my hand before I attempt</li>
<li> you can see the white stains all over and it clumps like none other.</li>
<li> Relative to my other usual antiperspirants (Gillette Clear Gel and Dove Men+ antiperspirant/deodorant)</li>
<li> This stuff will leave white marks on everything that is remotely dark.  </li>
<li> , it just doesn&#x27;t have the strength to go the distance that the other two do.  </li>
<li> I dont use any other brand, this never breaks me out</li>
<li> I use this at work on days of ridiculous heat, and it keeps me dry while meeting clients outside.  </li>
<li> Old Spice is  THE most disgusting product !!  </li>
<li> The twist dial to dispense more product is really difficult to grip and turn and near impossible if your hands are wet from the shower or steam has condensed on the package.</li>
<li> It works, but seems the aroma is a bit weak and does not last long at all</li>
<li> so you have to be a little careful when getting dressed, but I&#x27;ll take it for some deo that works.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you care about your clothes and wear dark colors.</li>
<li> The dial is smooth with very shallow finger grips that are useless.</li>
<li> half wookie gives it two thumbs up!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I picked up the Old Spice High Endurance Invisible Pure Sport antiperspirant / deodorant during a sale @ amazon.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product, nor will I purchase it again.  Relative to my other usual antiperspirants (Gillette Clear Gel and Dove Men+ antiperspirant/deodorant), it just doesn&#x27;t have the strength to go the distance that the other two do.  Wetness control is on par...however, where it comes up short is odor control.  After 8-10 hours of non-active wear, odor protection isn&#x27;t there and hints of BO start appearing.  The Gillette clear gel and the Dove on the other hand both last 15-24 hours (in wetness and odor control).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m chewbacca&#x27;s bastard love child or not, but on the hot summer days, man can I work up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found on the market that not only seems to stop the sweat, but keeps me smelling nice too.  It&#x27;s kind of similar to the polo sport scent.  Not overbearing but clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This half wookie gives it two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> It makes me smell good, I have no complaints.  Therefore, the product works and can&#x27;t ask for more.  It comes in multiple scents.</li>
    <li> Been using Old Spice High Endurance products for a long time. Has a pleasant odor that isn&#x27;t too strong, and the anti-perspirant works as well as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. The best price in a store is around $2.50 each, so the multi-packs are a great deal, especially if you use subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> A handful of guys that I ride and hike with consistently give me lip about smelling good, even if i&#x27;m soaked in sweat.  Just for example, last weekend we hiked 14 miles on a day hike at about 94 degrees.  At the end of the evening, covered in sweat and mud, I still smelled like the Old Spice.  Awesome stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the antiperspirant aspect.  I use this at work on days of ridiculous heat, and it keeps me dry while meeting clients outside.  The smell is nice, sporty.. but still reminiscent of classic Old Spice. Get some of this if you normally end up a sweaty disgusting mess, or cycle from one bar/restaurant to another (I know I know, you enjoy fast service as they try to usher your stinky self back out the door quickly).</li>
    <li> stated it went on clear and it does not.  I got white on my shirt from the deodorant when I put the shirt on.</li>
    <li> Old Spice High Endurance Antiperspirant and Deodorant has been my favorite for over 10 years. Ive used and tried out the more expensive versions that Old Spice and Dove for Men put out. The higher priced deodorants are designed to last for 48 hours which is ok but their scents are entirely too strong....especially the Dove. Old Spice you pay a premium for the latest and greatest scents.  I switched back to my old favorite Old Spice Pure Sport High Endurance. I shower every day so I don&#x27;t need 48 hours of protection and High Endurance is much cheaper that the top of the line Old Spice.  Its Pure Sport scent smells manly without being overbearing.</li>
    <li> far from invisible..... you can see the white stains all over and it clumps like none other. smell is great but definitely not invisible</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen bro so that he can get his &#x27;manly man in training on&#x27;. 4 thumbs up. 2 from me and 2 from the bro.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, although the quality is not the same as off the shelf.  I think that is why it was so cheap</li>
    <li> I just opened it, but the quality appears to be good, no issues so far.  like the scent, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used Old Spice for many years and have always been happy with performance. It will last you all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for years and have never found it as inexpensive elsewhere.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a deodorant and anti-persperant. Just be aware when buying, I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirant and it can cause extreme rashes on my skin.</li>
    <li> We live overseas and this deodorant is unavailable here.  It is great to see this in a two pack available for subscribe and save.  I would buy this brand locally to ensure you like it before buying the two pack.  This is a white solid stick deodorant, so not totally clear.  However, my husband hates the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; gel deodorants so this is a perfect product for him.</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t invisible. It leaves marks on your clothes and whatever chairs you might be setting in, which is too bad. It smells nice :).</li>
    <li> Has a decent scent and does a typical job on controlling perspiration (I don&#x27;t use anything stronger like Mitchum because that seems to realy irratate my skin). This is typically $4 a tube in NYC, so the prioce with S&amp;S is good here</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I got this that it was the powder/talc version. I prefer the gel or clear whatever it is, the blue stuff. I didn&#x27;t use it because the talc feels like it never quite washes off and I feel like I smell worse because of it. The scent was great but I had to toss the sticks.</li>
    <li> Without the need for overtly flashy and marketing to drive up the price, this is just as effective as other Old Spice APD options as well as the competition</li>
    <li> I got a good deal on this Old Spice deodorant/anti-perspirant! Each tube has 3 ounce of protection, and I bought the pack of three to get free shipping on my order. It worked, and I&#x27;m still using the first tube I opened.</li>
    <li> Good for me, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like the scent. He would rather have the deodorant plus antipers. I like this one and will use it even though I am a female..</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of this deodorant for many years now. Smells great. Reduces sweat. Comfortable on the pits.</li>
    <li> Smells great and prevents sweating. Works well on hot days. Also the smell is not too overpowering like some deodorants.</li>
    <li> It works, but seems the aroma is a bit weak and does not last long at all</li>
    <li> Great Old Spice scent, smooth application to underarm, and does not mark or stain my clothing even though it goes on white and not clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have a problem with the dispenser itself. The twist dial to dispense more product is really difficult to grip and turn and near impossible if your hands are wet from the shower or steam has condensed on the package. The dial is smooth with very shallow finger grips that are useless. I have to use my thumb on the inside of the dial, where there are some plastic ridges, with my index finger pressed tightly on the outside to get it to turn and only if I dry the dial and my hand before I attempt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the dispenser gets a redesign, this would be a 5 star product for me.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to start out by saying that the smell I do like on m husband, it is a sign that is working for me!! He has troubles with any time of gels so we have to stay with the powder stuff! He works 12 hour shifts and when he  comes home it is still working!</li>
    <li> Have tried quite a number of other products, but none keep me dry like Old Spice.  Really like the pure sport scent.  Smells good without being overbearing.  Have received a number of compliments from women, wife and daughters included, &amp;#34;you smell nice.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the 2 pack via Subscribe &amp; save.  Good value and arrived as expected.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent anti-antiperspirant, lasted a long time and did not cop out when I needed coverage.  Will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for over 10 years. It is a great scent, goes on smooth, and lasts all day. As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite - great antiperspirant and deodorant protection, plus a nice fragrance. My husband doesn&#x27;t use cologne - he uses Old Spice Shower Gel and Old Spice deodorant instead - he smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant! Everyone in our household uses it and it works great without being overbearing with the scent. We have this auto shipped and it is nice to not have to pay more at the local store.</li>
    <li> Smells great, keeps underarms dry, lasts a long time. The only thing I can count off for is the price compared to generic versions.</li>
    <li> This stuff will leave white marks on everything that is remotely dark.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you care about your clothes and wear dark colors.</li>
    <li> Great, has like a powder feel to it, my husband uses it when he works out, It lasts a while and the smell is great</li>
    <li> Works the best of any deodorant. Smells fresh and helps from sweat. I dont use any other brand, this never breaks me out</li>
    <li> Amazon seems to have these 2 packs on sale every few months for a great deal so whenever I notice it i stock up.  I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds and none give me the performance that Old Spice does.  Like others have said it&#x27;s really not clear so you have to be a little careful when getting dressed, but I&#x27;ll take it for some deo that works.</li>
    <li> This product is a good value and works well.  I bought this for my husband and son and it has worked well for both of them.</li>
    <li> good item, good price, delivered on time, scent is nice, clean and refreshing.  good product, lasts well even through all day and workout.</li>
    <li> I love having deodorant and anti-perspirant combined into one stick</li>
    <li> Very effective!!! Actually lasts longer than advertized. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Ok, so the title says it all...  This went with the NFL Dallas Cowboys Mesh Shower Tote in the same box to ship.  No, I didn&#x27;t send them all at once, I sent one.  When he needs more, I&#x27;ll send more.  Seemed easier than going to the store when he says I need more and hoping (with shipping delays) that he doesn&#x27;t run out and offend other people!&lt;br /&gt;Really, what more do you say about deodorant.  The price was comparable to in-store, and I didn&#x27;t have to go get it.</li>
    <li> Old Spice is  THE most disgusting product !!  OMG !  People wearing this stink 10 feet away. Also remember: your lymph nodes (designed to protect you and grab cancer cells) are under your arm. Don&#x27;t use this product.  disgusting !!!  They should take all Old Spice off the market. Seriously....I mean.......seriously........</li>
