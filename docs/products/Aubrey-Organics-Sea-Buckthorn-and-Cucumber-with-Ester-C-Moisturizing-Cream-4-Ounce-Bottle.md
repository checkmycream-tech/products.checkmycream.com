      <li>This is a great and effective natural product!</li>
      <li>This, along with the cleanser, cleared that up real quick.  </li>
      <li>I do use Aubrey unscented body lotion, which I love.</li>
      <li>May be ok for day use, but it does have a tint to it that I do not like.  </li>
      <li>Love it, it is not creasy, keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon</li>

      <li>and my skin looks better and better all the time.  </li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>(I get better results with Ecco Bella).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not the most pleasing thing to the eye,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get breakouts, but they&#x27;ve lessened significantly since using Aubrey Organics products!</li>
      <li>I love Aubrey&#x27;s moisturizer; goes on feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>smooth soft skin immediately... and felt great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to creams, and I did not experience any redness with this one, so that is one good thing.  </li>
      <li>really want to love this lotion, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me!  </li>
      <li>my skin is definatly smooth &amp; loves to drink up this lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is nice, just cucumbers, but dissipates fairly quickly, very unisex.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>right after I wash my face, and I almost don&#x27;t want to put on make up because I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>this is a great product, I have used many moisturizers over the years, and every one of them made my face feel a little stinging... not this product.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh scent (like cucumbers)and is easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t give my sensitive combination skin</li>
      <li>After massaging it in with water, I have to say that my skin doesn&#x27;t look very much more hydrated than before, and certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as supple as I&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>Because of that, and the amazing ingredients which are natural, I will definately be buying this again.  </li>
      <li>it really feels refreshing on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Aubrey Organics&#x27; Sea Buckthorn Facial Toner and loved it.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough GOOD things about this product.  </li>
      <li>texture is awesome, very light, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry skin (although I have used it on very dry days and two layers was</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>if you use too much your skin will look more brown because of the natural color of the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer works pretty well for me.  </li>
      <li>If your skin is sometimes dry and sometimes oily, or dry in certain places and oily in others, this is a great product for you, especially in the wintertime when most people get drier skin anyway.</li>
      <li>It got rid of the dry krapy skin on my neck and leaves a nice healthy looking tint, like a slight self tanner.</li>
      <li>And you can really trust this brand.  </li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, I checked ph</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now and really like it.  </li>
      <li>I really like to use this moisturizer b/c</li>
      <li>I live in New England; for the first few minutes, my face feels clean and moisture, yet very quickly it starts to feel oily.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for that reason.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but definitely has a pleasant note of cucumber.</li>
      <li>The ONLY downfall to this lotion is that it does stain anything it comes in contact with unless rinsed out right away.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is all natural, not tested on animals and it works!</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to describe!  </li>
      <li>I have to use a little water to get it to properly absorb, otherwise it just sits on top of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin so after i get out of the shower, after shaving my legs i use it on my legs</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to colors/smells, but since this is all-natural there have been  no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face very well and partially leaves it feeling dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this is a great product, I have used many moisturizers over the years, and every one of them made my face feel a little stinging... not this product.  smooth soft skin immediately... and felt great. I am also using the Green Tea and Ginkgo moisturzing cream... also veryyyyyyy nice.....</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now and really like it.  I have extremely dry skin, especially around my mouth and eyes.  I also have an extremely oily T-zone.  Before buying this the skin around my mouth was dry, flakey, and painful.  It felt and looked sort of like pink snake skin.  This, along with the cleanser, cleared that up real quick.  And even though this is hydrating, I have not had a problem with my oiliness.  Because of that, and the amazing ingredients which are natural, I will definately be buying this again.  Oh, and by the way, Seabuckthorn oil is really good for acne.  Just thought I&#x27;d add that.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer in my opinion.  It is an orangy-peachy color, and from my experience, so are other sea buckthorn products.  I really like to use this moisturizer b/c it really feels refreshing on my skin.  I dont have an issue with the orange color.  it blends in once you put it on.  It&#x27;s creamy and i use a small amount per day.  The bottle is fairly big.  I think it&#x27;s a great price and a great product.  my skin is definatly smooth &amp; loves to drink up this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! It is all natural, not tested on animals and it works! It moisturizes well and leave no residue!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of moisturizers and ever since trying Aubrey Organics, I have been convinced, organic is definitely more beneficial for your skin.  A little goes a long way too!  I also use the serum and saw immediate results with the small dry patches of skin clear up almost immediately.  Who knew using the wrong moisturizer could be so damaging for your skin.  Check out their website to determine your skin type before you buy the moisturizer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really like it. It does not leave a peach-colored residue on the face like someone mentioned it. It is very moisturizing, I checked ph it is around 5. Will buy again, the bottle is 4oz and will last</li>
    <li> I use the facial cleanser of this and i am very pleased with this. And i use this after to moisturize my face and i also use it as a body lotion. very good stuff. i love it. i use it everyday. I have sensitive skin so after i get out of the shower, after shaving my legs i use it on my legs and it soothes my skin and i dnt get razor burn. To me it doesnt smell wonderful but it doesnt smell horriable either. It has an alright smell. But u can&#x27;t smell it anymore after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Having trouble finding the again.  Got some from an other country  formula was not the same.  The one&#x27;s I got in Am. are Really good</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this lotion.  It has a mild, clean scent.  Kind of hard to describe!  I suppose it does smell like a floral cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion comes out a thick, shimmery yellow color.  Not the most pleasing thing to the eye, but luckily I notice no residual color after application (&amp; I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorption is so-so.  I have to use a little water to get it to properly absorb, otherwise it just sits on top of my skin.  After massaging it in with water, I have to say that my skin doesn&#x27;t look very much more hydrated than before, and certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as supple as I&#x27;d like (I get better results with Ecco Bella).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to love this lotion, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me!  The scent is the best part.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works pretty well for me.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic, but 2 drawbacks are 1) no sunscreen properties, and 2) if you use too much your skin will look more brown because of the natural color of the moisturizer.  Overall though, I like it.</li>
    <li> I love Aubrey&#x27;s moisturizer; goes on feeling smooth. I use it in the morning right after I wash my face, and I almost don&#x27;t want to put on make up because I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for the past three weeks and I am not pleased with the result. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face very well and partially leaves it feeling dry. It has a nice fresh scent (like cucumbers)and is easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t give my sensitive combination skin the moisture it needs. It slightly irritated my skin. I now switched to the moisturizer I used before.</li>
    <li> I have used this for awhile now. I don&#x27;t know if they are discontinuing it or not but my local stores no longer carry it. I was so glad to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> This is such a power packed product at such a low cost.  And you can really trust this brand.  It got rid of the dry krapy skin on my neck and leaves a nice healthy looking tint, like a slight self tanner.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 10 years, along with the other Aubrey product Rosa Mosqueta. These are the only two that I can use that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Also they don&#x27;t make your skin shiny. Basically I cannot find anything comparable in quality to these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use this face lotion until they stop making it.  My husband likes it as well for after shaving (he used to use Curel sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, just cucumbers, but dissipates fairly quickly, very unisex.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is awesome, very light, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry skin (although I have used it on very dry days and two layers was perfect).&lt;br /&gt;It is a golden color and slightly thicker than typical drugstore brands.  No burning, itching, etc. and I&#x27;m sensitive to colors/smells, but since this is all-natural there have been  no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I found it very dry on my face, not moist at all.  I had to put another cream over it.  May be ok for day use, but it does have a tint to it that I do not like.  Don&#x27;t even like the smell.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to creams, and I did not experience any redness with this one, so that is one good thing.  If only it did what its supposed to do, and that is to moisturize.  Used it twice, and it sits in my drawer.  Hate to throw it away b/c it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  I do use Aubrey unscented body lotion, which I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teacher, and I used a hotglue gun, had an accident while putting up posters in the classroom and had a third degree burn on my forearm.  I used this cream as it healed and have NO scar tissue.  I highly recommend it for that reason.  Later in life, I had a Basal Cell Carcinoma on my face.  I used it on that as well and have a very slight scar where it ought to be larger.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough GOOD things about this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it absorbs quickly.  I have VERY sensitive skin and since I&#x27;ve started using Aubrey products I have no problems what-so-ever and my skin looks better and better all the time.  The ONLY downfall to this lotion is that it does stain anything it comes in contact with unless rinsed out right away.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product or any Aubrey product!!![[ASIN:B001AWG0IS Aubrey Organics Sea Buckthorn &amp; Cucumber with Ester-C Moisturizing Cream, 4-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> I used to use Aubrey Organics&#x27; Sea Buckthorn Facial Toner and loved it. Yet this lotion proved a little bit disappointing. It has nice texture, smells great and absorbs quickly.  I live in New England; for the first few minutes, my face feels clean and moisture, yet very quickly it starts to feel oily. It&#x27;s winter now, and I don&#x27;t know how it would feel in summer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is perfect for combination skin. If your skin is sometimes dry and sometimes oily, or dry in certain places and oily in others, this is a great product for you, especially in the wintertime when most people get drier skin anyway. I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get breakouts, but they&#x27;ve lessened significantly since using Aubrey Organics products! Personally, I like the smell, but it may not appeal to everyone. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but definitely has a pleasant note of cucumber. I recommend washing with the Sea Buckthorn and Cucumber cleansing cream, too. I also use the toner. This is a great and effective natural product!</li>
    <li> Love it, it is not creasy, keeps my skin moisturized.I have very sensitive skin, I do not break out with this product.</li>
