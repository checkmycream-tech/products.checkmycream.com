      <li>I was hoping this would remove course hair from my legs better than shaving.</li>
      <li>5.1 fl oz (150 ml)]]and been quite satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>After my shower I tried to inspect my legs better.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed and surprised when my \\&quot;test\\&quot; spot on my leg came out hair free.</li>
      <li>I took two benadryl and slept through most of their visit but my legs stopped itching.  </li>
      <li>I thought maybe I should wash my legs off better.  </li>
      <li>As a result, it removed most (but not all) of the hair.</li>
      <li>I prefer to pay more for a product that comes with its own spatula for a clean and easy hair removal</li>

      <li>I did one leg at a time to make it easier and make the timing more accurate.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, very nice compared to the old fashioned hair removers.  </li>
      <li>Like other hair removers, it isn&#x27;t perfect</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like roses, but it&#x27;s not horrible smelling which is great since you&#x27;ll be wearing it and exposed to the smell for several minutes.   </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and I like the results.</li>
      <li>I think the chemicals in the remover are too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Years and years ago, I used Nair as hair remover, but the strong scent of that turned me off from trying another brand until I had the opportunity to try this.  </li>
      <li>hair is on the fine side, so I use Veet for three minutes.</li>
      <li>Her hair is lighter and thinner and it takes it off just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just used to shaving in the shower every 2-3 days, and that seems to work just fine for me.y cut it.  </li>
      <li>If I have time for a luxurious bath, then this is fine.</li>
      <li>The doctor gave me a thumbs up, the skin test went fine.  </li>
      <li>Where it did work fine was on the finer hair - which it did fine removing.</li>
      <li>It removed my hair just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just used to shaving in the shower every 2-3 days, and that seems to work just fine for me.</li>
      <li>If I am that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>My legs felt smooth and soft afterward as though they had been shaved and rubbed with a pleasant lotion.</li>
      <li>It is important to follow the directions on a tube and time it precisely.  </li>
      <li>My legs were smooth and there were no nicks or razor burns.</li>
      <li>I did not think that it did that great at removing hair and the amount of time that it lasted was about the same.  </li>
      <li>but this was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>off!&lt;br /&gt;No stray hairs just smooth</li>
      <li>Legs seemed smooth and moisturized afterwards.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, a good product that I would more than likely use again.</li>
      <li>Fast, easy, painless and really works good and for a full month.</li>
      <li>The results are amazing, super smooth skin after I removed it and it feels completely moisturized.</li>
      <li>This product does work fast, definately faster than most I&#x27;ve tried.   </li>
      <li>As far as the \\&quot;rose scent\\&quot; I don&#x27;t notice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many ways of hair removal and waxing doesn&#x27;t really cut it.  </li>
      <li>I needed to leave it on for the full amount of time to get it to work.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not painful, but noticeable</li>
      <li>If you have fair skin and dark hair, I&#x27;m sure it would be easier to tell.  </li>
      <li>however, it works, is quick, and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>The bottle says do not (in bold and caps) leave it on for longer than 6 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps for lighter hair, it would work adequately.  </li>
      <li>I have to be hair-free quickly.</li>
      <li>stars from us - my daughter would rate it highly since it works for most of her hair (blond,thin) while it just did not get the job done on my darker and thicker hair.</li>
      <li>it was all easily removed with water and a gentle washcloth rub.</li>
      <li>the cream is very nice, thick and easy to apply in an even coat.</li>
      <li>I was very worried about irritation, so I applied the cream lightly.</li>
      <li>I had it on, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I expected, considering the circumstances.</li>
      <li>Not sure about how healthy it is to dissolve your hair, but I do love how quickly this works versus shaving everything.</li>
      <li>I have tried this kind of cream in the past and it always had a strong odor I did not care for.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish my tube since shaving seems to be fine for my sensitive skin, provided I use a shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all I going to try to not repeat everything that you just read from everyone else.  </li>
      <li>I like to use products like this before a trip or in the summer months when more skin is exposed regularly.   </li>
      <li>This is the first time I tried any Veet products.</li>
      <li>It looked like the hair on my knees, which is more coarse than the leg hair was iffy, I still had some.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s covering up some powerful chemicals, so you can&#x27;t really blame it).</li>
      <li>Velvet Rose scent may be better than the old fashioned cream depilatory however its still not real pleasant; its not a deal breaker either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did a decent job and did it faster than most similar products  </li>
      <li>The odor is so strong that it is the only con</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly use this again.</li>
      <li>It takes a lot to get rid of course area on a large area like your legs.</li>
      <li>Once my time was up, I wiped the Veet off with an old washcloth and couldn&#x27;t really tell if the hair was gone or not, as my skin tone is a medium shade, and right now I&#x27;m pretty tan.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does not smell very \\&quot;rosy\\&quot;, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.  </li>
      <li>Yes after two days my legs still feel fairly smooth, but I don&#x27;t expect that to last much longer.</li>
      <li>It also is gentle on skin.  </li>
      <li>Like I said - I must have unusual hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes, Veet smells horrible, even if you try to cover it up with \\&quot;velvet rose scent,\\&quot; however, it works, is quick, and gets the job done. I do wish it came with the old plastic hair remover; the bottle suggests that you remove the hair with a wash rag. I didn&#x27;t find that worked well enough and used something solid to scrape off the hairs.</li>
    <li> The product does work -- it took five minutes out of a maximum six, but it did remove all the hair on my legs. However, there is a whole slew of things you are not supposed to do for 24 hours after using the product -- swimming, sunbathing, applying deodorant, even showering with soap -- and all of those restrictions (presumably to prevent skin irritation) seem like too much to give up just to avoid the occasional nick from my razor. In addition, I found the scent rather vile, and with all the time spent rinsing out my washcloth using Veet didn&#x27;t actually save me any time over shaving. And the final straw was that my hair grew back just as quickly as it does after shaving -- so over all, I see no reason to switch to this product over my plain old-fashioned razor.</li>
    <li> First of all I going to try to not repeat everything that you just read from everyone else.  I am just going to list the basic facts as I see them.    1. Depilatories stink and this one is no exception.  It is a bit milder though.  2. The warnings look scarier because the print is large, but the warnings are pretty much the same as all of the other brands.  I have never had a problem with Veet products.  3. A little bit goes a long way. That was a big plus for me.  4. New growth is softer because of the lack of the sharp edge that shaving gives.  5. This is better for areas that are irritating to shave and where you usually cut yourself.  6. I have always used depilatories on my armpits and never had a problem with them.  7. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream. Your hair will grow back.  Mine grows a bit slower than when I shave, but I think that part of that could be the fact that you can feel stubble quicker after shaving.    Basically it is not for everyone.  It really is a matter of preference.  If you are hesitant, read the negative reviews.  Most of them will be from people who never used or liked any depilatories. If you like depilatories, you will probably like this.</li>
    <li> But this stuff did not work on the thicker hair on my legs. Forget the bikini area (no bueno on that!) Where it did work fine was on the finer hair - which it did fine removing. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad -- but it definitely has a strong odor. It doesn&#x27;t seem all too different to me from what I used in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. I gave it up then due to the fact it took time and didn&#x27;t get all the hair. This brought everything right back to me. It&#x27;s back to the razor for this girl. Like I said - I must have unusual hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I do have to note that my teen loves this stuff -- and it works well for her. Her hair is lighter and thinner and it takes it off just fine. She prefers this over the razor. Of course she can just put it on and then listen to her IPOD while waiting for it to do its job -- so that makes her happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars from us - my daughter would rate it highly since it works for most of her hair (blond,thin) while it just did not get the job done on my darker and thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I like to use products like this before a trip or in the summer months when more skin is exposed regularly.   It&#x27;s not something I would use all of the time because of the added cost and time necesary.   This product does work fast, definately faster than most I&#x27;ve tried.   I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like roses, but it&#x27;s not horrible smelling which is great since you&#x27;ll be wearing it and exposed to the smell for several minutes.   It did a decent job and did it faster than most similar products  No negatives.</li>
    <li> This product works well and smells good. However, it comes in a very small bottle. It takes a lot to get rid of course area on a large area like your legs. It&#x27;s really not very economical with as much as you have to use to get rid of the hair. Other hair removers I have used have a lot more in the bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> Veet hair removal is a great-smelling and effective removal solution for unwanted hair.  It is ideal to use on arms and legs.  If used on sensitive areas or if you use it on sensitive skin, it can burn.  It is important to follow the directions on a tube and time it precisely.  If used correctly, the results will be great, even on the coarsest of hairs.  The whole process from start to finish should take under 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I gave this one to my wife to try and am reporting her impressions.  The product works well and did not cause any irritation.  After reading the label, irritation was a bit of a concern, but there was no problem with leaving it on for the entire time (6 minutes).  There is a bit of a chemically smell, but that is to be expected. It certainly does not smell very \\&quot;rosy\\&quot;, so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.  The smell wasn&#x27;t strong or particularly unpleasant and it did not linger after removal.</li>
    <li> The bottom line is this works for hair removal on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the fine side, so I use Veet for three minutes. I remove the hair one section at a time, breaking up my lower leg into four sections and my upper leg into about six. I put on a thick coat and after about 90 seconds, I feel a very slight sting on my skin. It&#x27;s not painful, but noticeable if I think about it and it helps me remember to wipe the cream off before the six-minute maximum. The rose scent is not strong and I can hardly smell it. When I wipe off the cream, the hair is gone and I rinse the area well with warm water as the directions indicate. I can still feel the slight sting for a few hours afterward, but I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is my imagination. I have not had any bumps or redness or skin reactions after using Veet. It works for me and I&#x27;m happy to continue using it.</li>
    <li> My wife used this on her feet and legs and hasn&#x27;t experienced any of the burning or other negative reactions that some reviewers have reported. I tried it on my foot just to see what it was like and I had the same experience. I left it on for five minutes and then wiped it off and all the hair came with it without a problem. The smell is a little strong (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s covering up some powerful chemicals, so you can&#x27;t really blame it). Overall I&#x27;d say this is a great product that does exactly what it says it does as long as you follow the very specific instructions. Also, this container is pretty large so this amount will last you for a while.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I really expected to dislike this product.  My past experience with this type of depilatory was many years ago, and was not a pleasant experience.  Smelly product and inconsistent results.  Well no more!  This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;I applied a generous amount of this product to my lower leg and timed for 6 minutes.  This is the maximum time allowed per instructions, and since I have coarse hair, I figure if it doesn&#x27;t work in the max time then its worthless for me.&lt;br /&gt;When time was up, I wiped this away and all of the hair came off!&lt;br /&gt;No stray hairs just smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed this worked so well and so quickly plus it left my skin feeling soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;The Velvet Rose scent may be better than the old fashioned cream depilatory however its still not real pleasant; its not a deal breaker either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly use this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product on my underarms because if I used it on my legs all the time, it wouldn&#x27;t last long, and it&#x27;s too expensive to use all the time on my legs.  I like the smell, very nice compared to the old fashioned hair removers.  I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation as long as I didn&#x27;t leave it on too long.  I did use it once on my legs and I really liked the smooth feeling the product gives, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning, it&#x27;s just faster to shave.  If I have time for a luxurious bath, then this is fine.</li>
    <li> I was always curious about the Veet ads I have seen in magazines showing a lady and this hair remover.  What is Veet?  How does it work?  Does it REALLY work?  I am dying to know the answer!  So I finally tried it.  Veet is just a European version of Nair!  On the bottle it says it&#x27;s made in France.  I tried Nair when I was a teeny-bopper and the thing that sticks with me the most is the smell.  Yes, Veet has that same smell.  Whatever the active ingredient is, it is the same stuff.  As far as the \\&quot;rose scent\\&quot; I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tested the Veet out on my skin, a small patch for 5 minutes and there was no reaction.  When I finally remembered to use the Veet instead of my razor in the shower, I used it.  I put the cream on, and stood there for six minutes waiting for the Veet magic to work.  Six minutes is a long time to stand around waiting.  Once my time was up, I wiped the Veet off with an old washcloth and couldn&#x27;t really tell if the hair was gone or not, as my skin tone is a medium shade, and right now I&#x27;m pretty tan.  If you have fair skin and dark hair, I&#x27;m sure it would be easier to tell.  So I took a shower and tried to get the Veet all the way off, but it never really felt like it was off.  Hopefully that is the hydration that they talk about on the tube.  After my shower I tried to inspect my legs better.  It looked like the hair on my knees, which is more coarse than the leg hair was iffy, I still had some.  I did still smell that hair remover smell after the shower, even on my hands, because I applied the Veet with my hands.  I think it works, but I should have applied the Veet to my knees first, then the legs last.  Yes after two days my legs still feel fairly smooth, but I don&#x27;t expect that to last much longer. All in all, it would have been much easier to just shave in the shower.  If you have any issues with shaving with a razor blade, then I guess this would be the next way to go.  I&#x27;ve tried many ways of hair removal and waxing doesn&#x27;t really cut it.  For me, my hair always starts growing back in less than a week so that is a pointless waste of time and money. I&#x27;m just used to shaving in the shower every 2-3 days, and that seems to work just fine for me.y cut it.  For me, my hair always starts growing back in less than a week so that is a pointless waste of time and money. I&#x27;m just used to shaving in the shower every 2-3 days, and that seems to work just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried hair removal creams in the past with little or no success. They were always really messy, took a long time and didn&#x27;t work. So, about 8 years ago I gave up on them. To be honest with you, I expected the same results with this Veet Cream. I was very impressed and surprised when my \\&quot;test\\&quot; spot on my leg came out hair free. I was so thrilled that I preceded to then do the rest of my legs, my armpits and my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*legs- The Veet cream worked perfectly. I did one leg at a time to make it easier and make the timing more accurate. From the thick black calf hair to the thinner, lighter upper leg hair it was all easily removed with water and a gentle washcloth rub. My legs felt smooth and soft afterward as though they had been shaved and rubbed with a pleasant lotion. (Tip: apply naked in the bathroom with a book and timer. Apply to leg one all the way up, wash hands at sink and sit on toilet with as little movement as possible. Read your book. When the timer goes off, hop in shower with washcloth and rinse. Dry and repeat for leg two. It is a little bit of a hassle, but still easier and quicker than shaving. If you try to do both legs at once you will have more smearing and your timing will be off.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*armpits- This one was tricky. The cream only removed some of the hair, but this may partially be my fault. Have you ever tried to hold your arms up for 6 minutes without moving them? It is hard to do! I also did them both at the same time which is probably a mistake since I smeared in one armpits cream while applying the others. Overall, not worth it. It takes 30 seconds to shave armpit hair, stick with razors for this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*bikini area- I was very worried about irritation, so I applied the cream lightly. As a result, it removed most (but not all) of the hair. However, I was not irritated at all after application. I would recommend doing a small test on your bikini are before trying it there. If it doesn&#x27;t irritate you, then apply it thick and try not to move. I did have a little bit of a mishap when moving to wash my hands and some cream moved to unwanted areas without me realizing it. Yikes! I prefer saving the depilatory cream for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smell: The Rose Scent does not quite smell like roses, or at least not roses by themselves. It has a slight chemical smell, but it is more pleasant than other depilatory creams I have used in the past. While it doesn&#x27;t smell great it doesn&#x27;t make you nauseous either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-timing: It is recommended to leave the cream on for 3 minutes &amp; no more than 6 minutes. I have thick, dark hair (with the exception of my upper legs) so I left it on 6 minutes. I do admit that with some applications I went over 6 and was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-irritation: I had no irritation at all on my body. As mentioned above, I did legs, armpits and bikini area (my armpits have been known to be sensitive and my bikini area is very sensitive). My hands did sting a little bit right afterward, but I did several applications in a row without gloves, so that is to be expected. The sting on my hands did not last long. This may vary by person, but I had no problem with irritation. I even shaved one leg the next day to see if it would get irritated (the things I do for thorough reviews...) and it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-texture: While it doesn&#x27;t really matter greatly, I wanted to point out that the description calls this a \\&quot;gel cream\\&quot;. This product is a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-longevity: My hair grew back at the same speed as it does with shaving. I was hoping this product may last a little longer or at least make my hair a little thinner when it came back, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! If it were not for the price, I would use Veet several times a week. I applied the cream thick in most areas for effectiveness and after 1 application to both legs (the entire leg), my bikini area and my underarms the tube is about half full. While it is faster and easier thenshaving, I will continue to shave and only use Veet in a jam where I have to be hair-free quickly.here I have to be hair-free quickly.</li>
    <li> As the product name says, this is a fast acting cream hair remover.  It smells good - probably the best smelling product of its type that I have tried.  It also is gentle on skin.  I needed to leave it on for the full amount of time to get it to work.  Like other hair removers, it isn&#x27;t perfect - it&#x27;s easy to mess up and remove hair you don&#x27;t intend to remove or not remove enough hair.  Also, it only lasts for a day.  But that&#x27;s just par for the course.  All in all, for a depilating cream, this is quite good.</li>
    <li> Years and years ago, I used Nair as hair remover, but the strong scent of that turned me off from trying another brand until I had the opportunity to try this.  While it works well on the leg and armpit areas, I&#x27;ve had to leave it on for about 4-5 minutes each time -- and I can generally shave faster than that!  The smell of this isn&#x27;t too bad, but all of the strong chemicals in it do worry me. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish my tube since shaving seems to be fine for my sensitive skin, provided I use a shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon&#x27;s page doesn&#x27;t contain the list of ingredients, here is a list I found elsewhere online:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Thioglycolate&lt;br /&gt;Urea&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cetearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;Talcum&lt;br /&gt;Ceteareth-20&lt;br /&gt;Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;Prunus Dulcis&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Trisilicate&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Gluconate&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates Copolymer&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Caprate&lt;br /&gt;Nelumbo Nucifera Flower&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Ethylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Butylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben and Isobutylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Hydrated Silica&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;Red 21 Lake</li>
    <li> It is the first time I used a hair remover on my legs (got tired of the constant shaving)specially in FL. The results are amazing, super smooth skin after I removed it and it feels completely moisturized. The odor is so strong that it is the only con (but I can handle that), surprisingly has been decades of producing this type of products and the company did not find out yet how to get rid of the bad odor? Super happy with my hair removal without the irritation and the dryness of the shaving.</li>
    <li> So I did the little test spot, since I have sensitive skin, I even asked my doctor because I am on some prescription medications and the bottle warns that some medications can react with this product.  The doctor gave me a thumbs up, the skin test went fine.  One afternoon I had company coming and I wanted to put on some capris, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to shower and shave, figured I would use the Veet.  Initially the smell was not too bad, but then it smelled like perm.  At 3 minutes I tested a spot and the hair didn&#x27;t come off, at four minutes it did.  The bottle says do not (in bold and caps) leave it on for longer than 6 minutes.  I wiped the cream off, my legs looked great and they felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About five minutes later my legs started itching.  I mean crazy itching, where I was rubbing against the couch for relief.  I thought maybe I should wash my legs off better.  I went into the bathroom and found welts the size of quarters all over my legs, large red welts.  Mind you I had company coming.  I took two benadryl and slept through most of their visit but my legs stopped itching.  Later when I inspected my legs there were large scabs were some of the welts had been.  I went to my doctor and he said it looked like psoriasis, but since I&#x27;d never had it before they would look at it closer.  I had chemical burns on my legs.  I still have scars.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t get all of the product off.  Perhaps my timer didn&#x27;t go off at 4 minutes but instead 7 minutes, but either way, I can&#x27;t take the chance and I will not be using this again.  It did work, but at a cost.</li>
    <li> OM gosh let me tell you that this is the ultimate in hair removal products. I have tried others and was not impressed but this was fantastic.  Just 3 quick minutes and the hair is all gone and doesn&#x27;t come back remotely close to what a razor shave would do.  No worry about nicking the skin with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was more like the smell of a fresh perm but not remotely as strong.  It was tolerable even to my sensitive nose.  I was afraid at first to use it due to the issue of sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t bother me in the least.  No rash or any other problems which is a plus in my books.  My legs feel like they have had a moistureizer put on them after shaving that&#x27;s how good this stuff feels.  Yay no more dry skin after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give this the highest rating because of it&#x27;s overall use, effectiveness, no problems with the skin and a longer lasting clean look before the nubbies come back.  This is a winner in my book and something I will be using from this point forward instead of the dreaded razor.  I am picky and very leary but must say I really really like this product alot.</li>
    <li> I have always used [[ASIN:B00121O9VM Veet Hair Removal Gel Cream, Dry Skin 5.1 fl oz (150 ml)]]and been quite satisfied with it. I only tried this cream because of the \\&quot;Fast Acting\\&quot; statement on the label. The old cream normally took 6-8 minutes to remove my leg hairs and I was open to something that worked faster. This cream worked as fast and not any faster than the old cream I was using. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because    smell: The chemical smell is much stroger than I expected, especially from a product that is supposed to contain essential oils and rose scent  Messiness: This does not come with a spatula like the boxed packages of Veet. It has to be wiped off with a washcloth and that is a fairly messy process. I prefer to pay more for a product that comes with its own spatula for a clean and easy hair removal</li>
    <li> Pros: Odor not as harsh as other products. Veet, while it still does have a chemical odor, seemed to leave a nicer scent. Legs seemed smooth and moisturized afterwards. Veet worked well on Bikini area without the razor burn that I usually get with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Well, one con really, and that is that Veet isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot; for hair removal. At least not with the first application. By the next day after using Veet there was some noticeable stubble. However, this was after only one application, so it&#x27;s possible that with repeated use, that won&#x27;t be such an issue. There was also hair that wasn&#x27;t removed, even after leaving Veet on for the maximum amount of time. Again, this could be solved by repeat applications, but with just the one application, there was an inconsistency there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, a good product that I would more than likely use again.</li>
    <li> I have to admit the last time I tried a hair remover the results were spotty so I&#x27;ve been shaving or waxing for the better part of 20 years. I was hoping this would remove course hair from my legs better than shaving. It was easy to use and I like the results. It removed hair leaving no stubble. The outgrowth doesn&#x27;t have that sharp quality of razor stubble. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my daughter &amp; I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I am giving the Veet hair removal three stars because it did get rid of the hair on my legs and underarms however I had a bad reaction to it. I followed the directions carefully but my body did not agree with it. It burned really bad, gave me a rash, caused me to itch and caused my upper thigh to swell a little bit. I had to take a cold shower twice and ended up having to take two doses of Benadryl in order for the symptoms to subside. I think the chemicals in the remover are too strong for me. It felt as if I developed razor burn without the use of a razor. The Veet had a mild rose scent coupled with the scent of something that you would smell in a hair salon. It literally smelled like a perm or relaxer mixed with a bed of roses LOL. I do suffer from allergies including several medication allergies so I don&#x27;t know if that had something to do with me having a reaction. I suggest testing it on a small area of skin first especially if you have sensitive skin or have allergies. This is just my personal opinion....I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to go through what I went through.</li>
    <li> I have tried this kind of cream in the past and it always had a strong odor I did not care for.  This product did not smell bad at all.    It also worked as advertised.  I use it on my under arms and find it to be a much better alternative than shaving.  I apply it and in three minutes wipe it off with a baby wipe and the hair is gone leaving no stubble.    I have only had to use it every two weeks because the hair does not seem to grow back very fast at all.  So I also find it to be a great value.    I will definitely buy this product in the future as I don&#x27;t intend to go back to shaving under my arms.</li>
    <li> I have always wantedt to try Veet and thought that this would be a good opprotunity.  After reading the directions a few times I realized that with all the steps, it would be so much faster to just shave my legs.  The specific instructions scared me at first as it makes it sound like if you deviate in any way, you are going to do something bad to yourself.  I did not think that it did that great at removing hair and the amount of time that it lasted was about the same.  Bottom line, I know we all hate shaving our legs, but this is really not a quick fix for it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried any Veet products. I only used it on my legs because I was too scared to try it anywhere else. Maybe I&#x27;m a wuss. I dunno. If I am that&#x27;s fine. However, that&#x27;s what I did. I left it on for four minutes. It removed my hair just fine. However I&#x27;m not sure cream is for me. It felt messy and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting the right amount on.  My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and I didn&#x27;t have any red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a product that worked, but it isn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> I have previous experience in using this product ans have always&lt;br /&gt;been quite satisfied with it;s results&lt;br /&gt;When I discovered this product on line I just had to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite a savings over buying them one at a time in the local markets.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the new Veet gel would work for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.  First I tried my chest, and after following the directions and leaving the maximum amount of time Veet took off less that 1/3 of the hair.  Worse, it left my chest bright red and too sensitive to finish the job with wax or a razor.  I then tried arm hair and leg hair, with the same poor result - though those areas did not get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, Veet is probably great for someone with light body hair, but did not work at all for this guy.</li>
    <li> It got rid of my hair in 6 minutes. My legs were smooth and there were no nicks or razor burns. It&#x27;s great for behind my knees where I tend to cut myself. Some spots still had hair so I needed to shave those. I believe that was where I didn&#x27;t have enough cream lathered on. Not sure about how healthy it is to dissolve your hair, but I do love how quickly this works versus shaving everything. It says it lasts longer than shaving, but I&#x27;m thinking hours, not days.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a lark, as I get sick of shaving.  the cream is very nice, thick and easy to apply in an even coat. the rose scent is not overpowering (still some &#x27;hair remover&#x27; smell but what can you do?).  I have very sensitive skin, so expected some burning but I was pleasantly surprised - I had none.  It removed my leg hair very well, I did have to rinse quite a bit, but my skin felt moisturized afterwards, no flaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this again.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I have been epiling and not shaving, so my hair is pretty soft and sparse, so I expected great results; so I was a little disappointed. Where it did remove most of the hair in the 5 minutes I had it on, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I expected, considering the circumstances. I think the thing I disliked the most though, was having to wait 5 minutes after going through the messy task of putting the stuff on, then having to wipe it off... yuck. I guess if I&#x27;d used it before showering it would have been less messy, but there are so many warnings of what not to do, I was a little intimidated. When I epilate, I come out of a hot shower, dry off and epil as if I were using an electric razor. Fast, easy, painless and really works good and for a full month. Maybe if you shave, with shaving cream, this hair removal product would be what you&#x27;re looking for; but if you&#x27;re not use to the mess, I&#x27;d say this doesn&#x27;t work well enough (and has too many DO NOT DOs).</li>
    <li> My favorite hair removal product because it delivers.  The hair stays away for a week or more, it’s simple to apply and does not dry my skin.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark hair on my legs, and this product did not remove it in the suggested time.  Perhaps for lighter hair, it would work adequately.  I cannot recommend it.</li>
