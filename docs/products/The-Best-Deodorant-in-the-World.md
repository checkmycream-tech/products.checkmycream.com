### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, effectiveness is awesome.</li>
      <li>Excellent deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Awesome!!!!</li>
      <li>I loved this product!!</li>
      <li>It smells great too....</li>
      <li>It seems to keep the sweat in check as well which is great.</li>
      <li>WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHY?!!</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and the deodorant has a cooling feel to it, which I believe contributes to regulating my body temperature and keeps sweat at bay.  </li>
      <li>I feel good about him using this product too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pissed because this always seems to happen every time I find a product I love, and that many others love too!!!</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased and unless I find something that works as well as this one for a lower price, this will be my deodorant for life!  </li>
      <li>even made my own at home.</li>
      <li>It really is the BEST!</li>
      <li>It really is the best deodarant! ~Tanya</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m being charitable and giving it 2 stars.</li>
      <li>This is the best (natural) healthy deodorant in the WORLD!</li>
      <li>Let me just say this: I really don&#x27;t know what the best deodorant out there is, but this is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this product for many reasons - yes, it works!  </li>
      <li>Works great, lasts a long time and the ingredients are great.</li>
      <li>Comes in a great small tin that is perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>: I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for my deodorant soap and it only seemed to work okay paired with that, but then I switched to an all-natural rosemary mint soap (not sold as deodorant soap) and it works perfectly!</li>
      <li>:)  &amp;#34;The Best Deodorant in the World&amp;#34; DEFINITELY deserves its name!</li>
      <li>More work</li>
      <li>Love it and would recommend to everyone to try it</li>
      <li>More of a hassle then anything.</li>
      <li>I wear it every day, keeps the stink away for sure and feels so much better on my body to use than store bought made from chemicals and aluminum products.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My husband and I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for sure....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>But other than that this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>Easy to travel</li>
      <li>He just keeps one in his lunch box for easy access when he needs it.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, smell is clean, and it&#x27;s toxic free, safe, and organic.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about this deodorant because, let&#x27;s face it, anything labeled &#x27;the best&#x27; doesn&#x27;t always live up to its name (don&#x27;t even get me started on &#x27;World&#x27;s Best Cat Litter&#x27;).</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, all natural, does what a deodorant is supposed to do - what more could you ask for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants and have finally found a deodorant that fits that exact profile, safe and effective!  </li>
      <li>So far I am happy, and its a hot summer.</li>
      <li>It is definitely one of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>You can stop your search now for not only the best natural deodorant going</li>
      <li>My husband has a lot of stress sweat through out the day due to work, and this deodorant holds up to it and works great at masking the odor.</li>
      <li>Right away, I didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
      <li>applied this right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>As a naturopathic doctor I&#x27;m always searching for the safest, environmentally friendly and effective natural cosmetics and topical body products.  </li>
      <li>It took a while for my body to get used to not having heavy metals rubbed to my skin, but after about a week of use this works perfect, just like you&#x27;d expect a regular deodorant to!</li>
      <li>With most I had the latter problem.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my feet when I know I&#x27;m going to be in hot shoes</li>
      <li>and it was really hot and humid day.</li>
      <li>but it never fails me.</li>
      <li>THEY HAVE TO GO CHANGE IT AND DESTROY EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT IT.</li>
      <li>but it really really works too.</li>
      <li>On an especially stressful day, he will have to reapply midday but the container it hardy and travel friendly.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; like other deodorants.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for making a human and animal safe product that actually works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and a little goes a long way-</li>
      <li>I think it works ok, a little sticky, and I don&#x27;t fully trust it.</li>
      <li>It actually works - like really really works!!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and this is the first one that hasn&#x27;t given me a rash or made me constantly second guess whether or not the deodorant was working.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how well</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>Aaaaaamaaaazing your search for natural deodorant that rocks is over.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because it&#x27;s all I have right now and will probably just go back to using the product I was using before because it works the same.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, not messy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It worked really well for a few hours, then completely stopped working.</li>
      <li>So far, in this 90-100 degree weather, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
      <li>First, just to put things in perspective, I went through at least 16, yes, SIXTEEN different brands of natural deodorant before I found this miracle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You can stop your search now for not only the best natural deodorant going but it really really works too. Smells amazing, all natural, does what a deodorant is supposed to do - what more could you ask for. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this works-I even use it on my feet when I know I&#x27;m going to be in hot shoes and since my son is headed towards puberty I feel good about him using this product too.</li>
    <li> Works great, lasts a long time and the ingredients are great. The only deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found that neutralizes odor even if you are already stinky.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant.  As a naturopathic doctor I&#x27;m always searching for the safest, environmentally friendly and effective natural cosmetics and topical body products.  I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants and have finally found a deodorant that fits that exact profile, safe and effective!  It really is the best deodarant! ~Tanya Wylde</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this deodorant because, let&#x27;s face it, anything labeled &#x27;the best&#x27; doesn&#x27;t always live up to its name (don&#x27;t even get me started on &#x27;World&#x27;s Best Cat Litter&#x27;). Let me just say this: I really don&#x27;t know what the best deodorant out there is, but this is by far the best I have ever used. So far, in this 90-100 degree weather, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem. My only complaint is the somewhat musky scent, but it is tolerable and I don&#x27;t really care because it&#x27;s working. So, there you go.  Update: Sadly, this deodorant does not live up to its name. The temperatures went up and the deodorant just couldn&#x27;t handle it, I guess. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because it&#x27;s all I have right now and will probably just go back to using the product I was using before because it works the same. Oh well.</li>
    <li> The name truly does say it all! Wow! This is the best (natural) healthy deodorant in the WORLD! It actually works - like really really works!! You can count on it! It rocks! Aaaaaamaaaazing your search for natural deodorant that rocks is over. Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> Right away, I didn&#x27;t like this. It&#x27;s basically like rubbing a greasier version of Vicks on your underarms. It also irritated my underarm skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this right out of the shower. It worked really well for a few hours, then completely stopped working. Forget about reapplying. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I promptly threw mine in the trash.</li>
    <li> I wear it every day, keeps the stink away for sure and feels so much better on my body to use than store bought made from chemicals and aluminum products. It smells great too.... Easy to travel and you can reuse the containers once you are finished with it. Carry your meds, change, jewelry when traveling....I recommend it for sure....</li>
    <li> WOW. First, just to put things in perspective, I went through at least 16, yes, SIXTEEN different brands of natural deodorant before I found this miracle. Every single one of them either did not work at all or made me itch like crazy. With most I had the latter problem. I was SO relieved to FINALLY find this!! I only have to apply it once in the morning and it works all throughout the day. And I&#x27;m talking about summer in Arizona here. It It seems to keep the sweat in check as well which is great. One thing I did notice though: I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for my deodorant soap and it only seemed to work okay paired with that, but then I switched to an all-natural rosemary mint soap (not sold as deodorant soap) and it works perfectly! I am extremely pleased and unless I find something that works as well as this one for a lower price, this will be my deodorant for life!  ***UPDATE*** THEY CHANGED IT. WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHY?!! I loved this product!! I trusted this product!! It was everything and now it&#x27;s changed and it smells nasty. WHO LIKES THE SMELL OF BENGAY?!! I&#x27;m so pissed because this always seems to happen every time I find a product I love, and that many others love too!!! THEY HAVE TO GO CHANGE IT AND DESTROY EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT IT. It makes me so angry!!!! It&#x27;s getting returned. &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> My husband and I LOVE this product. The name says it all... It really is the BEST! It is easy to apply, not messy, and a little goes a long way. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; like other deodorants. It took about a week for my body to adjust to this non toxic deodorant. My husband has a lot of stress sweat through out the day due to work, and this deodorant holds up to it and works great at masking the odor. On an especially stressful day, he will have to reapply midday but the container it hardy and travel friendly. He just keeps one in his lunch box for easy access when he needs it. Thank you so much for making a human and animal safe product that actually works!</li>
    <li> I love this product for many reasons - yes, it works!  It is definitely one of the best natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  I had to stop using it, however, because my skin type was one that did not absorb the grey clay ingredient and it stained my clothes grey, with a side of oil stain.  I can&#x27;t get it out of the clothes :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used similar types of deodorant had this hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, effectiveness is awesome. But this was my experience.</li>
    <li> I would give this one star because it does literally nothing for me but I know I have problematic pits so I&#x27;m being charitable and giving it 2 stars. Tried it for a few days and STANK at the end of each day. It also arrived in questionable condition. It almost looked used. Going back to my homemade deodorant. More work but it never fails me.</li>
    <li> It took a while for my body to get used to not having heavy metals rubbed to my skin, but after about a week of use this works perfect, just like you&#x27;d expect a regular deodorant to! Although it isn&#x27;t ainti-perspicant, I found that I sweat way less now than when I used regular deodorant and forgot to put it on, for example. I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were other options in fragrance. But other than that this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I was looking for an alternative to traditional aluminum based deodorants. More of a hassle then anything. Sometimes the top is difficult to get off and then the fact I have to apply with my hands is inconvenient. I would overalls say it&#x27;s definitely an alternative but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hallelujah! THIS STUFF WORKS! I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants for years. I&#x27;ve tried them all...even made my own at home. Nothing, NOTHING has even come close to the odor protection as this product. It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and a little goes a long way- even in the summer heat! I&#x27;ve even gotten my husband to use it and it works for him, too. :)  &amp;#34;The Best Deodorant in the World&amp;#34; DEFINITELY deserves its name!</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for about 6 months!! I have never had any issues with it except one time and it was really hot and humid day. It goes on smoothly, smell is clean, and it&#x27;s toxic free, safe, and organic. Comes in a great small tin that is perfect for travel! Love it and would recommend to everyone to try it</li>
    <li> I think it works ok, a little sticky, and I don&#x27;t fully trust it. Nothing came with it, like instructions, and I bought a round sponge as an applicator.</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and this is the first one that hasn&#x27;t given me a rash or made me constantly second guess whether or not the deodorant was working.  The smell is pleasant and the deodorant has a cooling feel to it, which I believe contributes to regulating my body temperature and keeps sweat at bay.  I usually reapply halfway through the day just out of precaution and not necessarily out of need because I am still getting used to natural deodorant.  So far I am happy, and its a hot summer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. this is not the best deodorant in the world, it is the worst ever.</li>
    <li> This did not work as promised.  The product has a strange smell, and that smell was eventually mixed with a sweat smell.  Not good.  Used once, and might try again, but I was unimpressed.</li>
