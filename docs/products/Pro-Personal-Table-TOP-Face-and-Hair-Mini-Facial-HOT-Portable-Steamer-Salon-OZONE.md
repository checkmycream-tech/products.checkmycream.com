      <li>Great buy for the product, very pleased</li>
      <li>The one time I used it I loved it...</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly the first time using it</li>
      <li>it did an ok job to good job on my hair.</li>
      <li>I got this thing and it was very cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>so i enjoyed since i&#x27;m here to get one</li>
      <li>Love it , it use it almost every weeks.</li>
      <li>it is appropriately assembled...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really safe instead of using chemicals products that can damage the heating stuff  </li>
      <li>; I can&#x27;t see nothing defective, did you try to put more pressure on it?</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>and it would also be nice to have a removeable  cup to fully clean the cup</li>
      <li>and I have had pretty good results with this steamer</li>
      <li>The hottest steam I have ever experienced to the point where I have to open the holes on the top.</li>
      <li>I was concerned about the flimsiness of the hood, however, the unit was easy to put together.</li>
      <li>the only thing is to us very good qualitye watr because after 4 use with  regulartap water, the steel became full with calcaire</li>
      <li>Shipping was fine on this product...</li>
      <li>I  returned that order and reordered my primary reason for purchasing the steamer</li>
      <li>but its easier to use and gets really hot:)</li>
      <li>, it really moisturize my hair and i love th effects on my skin</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>is more clear  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>This is my third purchase of this kind of steamer.</li>
      <li>i recommend to anyone who want to have nice hair and deep conditionning your hair  </li>
      <li>However, i am able to do a facial treatment as while which is fantastic and it also leaves my face moisture&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Once I got passed the fact of only one unit, I was still excited about being able to steam my 4c hair.</li>
      <li>It would not get hot or produce steam, just a high pitched hissing sound.</li>
      <li>shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>I was only able to get it to work once as the steam button must have a shortage as it won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>and I thought I was going be able to steam my face at the same time as my hair bummer!</li>
      <li>and we are talking extremely hot water</li>
      <li>Great its smaller than the other one I had purchase elsewhere a year ago</li>
      <li>but my hairs soft is it worth it time will tell</li>
      <li>the lights start flickering but it really scared me that i might get electrocuted</li>
      <li>I was very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>it doesnt get the very back of your hair unless u sit directly under neath it like with your head touchin the top of it</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t put out enough steam, only the top of the head gets steam and it drops and burn your scalp...</li>
      <li>I love my Pro Personal Steamer it allows me to hydrate my hair and restore moisture back into me hair.</li>
      <li>Today when I tried it started up like normal for a couple minutes</li>
      <li>But the first thing I noticed (straight out of the box) was the facial steamer was dirty/stained as if it was used!!!!!</li>
      <li>however it would be nice if the hood was larger as it can be kind of awkward when your sitting under the steamer to try and steam all of your hair  if you have longer hair</li>
      <li>( it suppose to moove from left to right ).</li>
      <li>wrote to the seller and just asked them to sen a new piece....</li>
      <li>Each time I use the steamer, it makes a weird sound like air being let out of a balloon and it takes 15 mins or more for the water to boil.</li>
      <li>I have been using this steamer for a least two months to do my deep conditional treatments and it gets the good done.</li>
      <li>I currently have this steamer the first time I ordered this steamer the hood was cracked</li>
      <li>It worked a couple more times after that with the exception of a weird thing it was doing at the end of the each session it would sound like something was short circuiting and</li>
      <li>but the company was less than helpful when i asked for a refund they made me send pictures and multiple emails back and forth for weeks before finally telling me this however once I knew that I made sure to do this after every use.</li>
      <li>so if you are underneath it you are coming out with some major burns.</li>
      <li>I thought it was the company, but these are clearly all made by the same manufacturer, and none of them work!</li>
      <li>The next time i tried it the thing refused to turn on the loud beeeeeeeeeep noise would but no action from it.  </li>

<li> and it still stops after a few mins.</li>
<li> So I let it sit for a few days and tried again it was working again.</li>
<li> juste be careful do not let any children play around or pets becaus when the water boils it&#x27;s could very dangerous , put the item on surface that do not move at all and wear towel on your shoulder to avoid any burn with the hot water , we never know</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed to learn that there is only one unit with interchangeable heads (from hair to facial).</li>
<li> I am angry and want my money back.</li>
<li> I normally don&#x27;t review products but for this piece of crap i&#x27;m making an exception.</li>
<li> Unless you get pleasure in purchasing products, waiting around for them to be delivered, setting them up, having them not work even once, wasting time trying to figure out why the product doesn&#x27;t work, reading instructions that are in bad English with no troubleshooting tips, and then wasting time and money returning a defective product.  </li>
<li> Such a crap, poor quality , even if it does work its not great ..</li>
<li> When i put it together it was difficult to figure out with the instructions</li>
<li> disappointed with this product and just tired of fighting with it .</li>
<li> The unit malfunctions (beeps like mad) for no reason-</li>
<li> I was horribly disappointed.</li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s disgusting!!</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t put out enough steam, only the top of the head gets steam and it drops and burn your scalp...</li>
    <li> After one time of using it does not work anymore. Such a crap, poor quality , even if it does work its not great .. I am angry and want my money back.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed to learn that there is only one unit with interchangeable heads (from hair to facial). The photo of the item depicts two units and I thought I was going be able to steam my face at the same time as my hair bummer! Once I got passed the fact of only one unit, I was still excited about being able to steam my 4c hair. I was concerned about the flimsiness of the hood, however, the unit was easy to put together. I use only distilled water to thwart any chances of damaged from water hardness down the road.  have had the steamer for approx 30 days and have used it twice. Each time I use the steamer, it makes a weird sound like air being let out of a balloon and it takes 15 mins or more for the water to boil. Otherwise, once it boils it is on!!!! The hottest steam I have ever experienced to the point where I have to open the holes on the top. It is definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> The unit malfunctions (beeps like mad) for no reason- there is water in the damn thing and it is appropriately assembled... beeep beeeep beeeep!! I was horribly disappointed. I should have spent the extra $30 and picked up the Huetiful.</li>
    <li> I currently have this steamer the first time I ordered this steamer the hood was cracked so  I  returned that order and reordered my primary reason for purchasing the steamer was for my hair and I have had pretty good results with this steamer however it would be nice if the hood was larger as it can be kind of awkward when your sitting under the steamer to try and steam all of your hair  if you have longer hair and it would also be nice to have a removeable  cup to fully clean the cup but otherwise I would say I have had this steamer for a while and would recommend it to others since it does a great job</li>
    <li> Got this steamer about one month ago, used it once and the facial handle got stucked at the left, can&#x27;t moove it ( it suppose to moove from left to right ). wrote to the seller and just asked them to sen a new piece.... they answered me asking for a pic, sent the pic and they told me: &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t see nothing defective, did you try to put more pressure on it? I still don&#x27;tget other answer or the piece,</li>
    <li> I got this one as a replacement for my other streamer. This streamer get&#x27;s hotter than the huetiful hair steamer. But overall no real differences other than the price and small design things.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the product, very pleased</li>
    <li> Love it , it use it almost every weeks.</li>
    <li> very good product it works well. shipping was very fast. I will definitely use this vendor again if I need anything else. the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it I feel I need to be careful with it...but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products but for this piece of crap i&#x27;m making an exception. I got this thing and it was very cheap feeling. Be extremely careful handling it. When i put it together it was difficult to figure out with the instructions but i saw a youtube video that helped. The pieces feel like they will break if you force them but if you don&#x27;t it wont work. It worked perfectly the first time using it but after that it started having problems. 1. If you forget to drain it the thing will start boiling over  the hood and we are talking extremely hot water so if you are underneath it you are coming out with some major burns. This happened to me thank goodness it was only my hand but the company was less than helpful when i asked for a refund they made me send pictures and multiple emails back and forth for weeks before finally telling me this however once I knew that I made sure to do this after every use. It worked a couple more times after that with the exception of a weird thing it was doing at the end of the each session it would sound like something was short circuiting and the lights start flickering but it really scared me that i might get electrocuted but i can only assume thats what its supposed to do. 2. The next time i tried it the thing refused to turn on the loud beeeeeeeeeep noise would but no action from it.  So I let it sit for a few days and tried again it was working again. Today when I tried it started up like normal for a couple minutes then the beeeeeeeeep starts and it stops. ive tried it about 6 times and it still stops after a few mins. Im beyond disappointed with this product and just tired of fighting with it . Im not one to discredit a product online but I just couldn&#x27;t let others make an uninformed decision. I hope this helps others.</li>
    <li> i love my steamer , i&#x27;m a french citizen leaving in the usa since 6 months, and in france steamer are really expensive so i enjoyed since i&#x27;m here to get one, it really moisturize my hair and i love th effects on my skin is more clear  the only thing is to us very good qualitye watr because after 4 use with  regulartap water, the steel became full with calcaire and i cleaned it with vinegar it&#x27;s really safe instead of using chemicals products that can damage the heating stuff  i recommend to anyone who want to have nice hair and deep conditionning your hair  juste be careful do not let any children play around or pets becaus when the water boils it&#x27;s could very dangerous , put the item on surface that do not move at all and wear towel on your shoulder to avoid any burn with the hot water , we never know</li>
    <li> it did an ok job to good job on my hair. it turns off when no waters in it. it takes like 2 minutes to heat up. it doesnt get the very back of your hair unless u sit directly under neath it like with your head touchin the top of it and then it burns your for head. but my hairs soft is it worth it time will tell</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair steamer and the  unit would not work. The on button was malfunction the unit would never come on.  I was very unsatisfied. Awaiting a replacement unit. Will see how this works.</li>
    <li> This steamer didn&#x27;t work! The water boils but the steam ends up seeping out the back.</li>
    <li> I received this product asa Christmas gift in 2013.  I used it approx 4 times and it quit working.  I contacted the company--nothing they could do or offer--pass the 90 day warranty period.  THIS PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS.  MY DAUGHTER WASTED HER MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT and time ordering and it.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> I love my Pro Personal Steamer it allows me to hydrate my hair and restore moisture back into me hair. I have been using this steamer for a least two months to do my deep conditional treatments and it gets the good done. However, i am able to do a facial treatment as while which is fantastic and it also leaves my face moisture&#x27;s. Nevertheless, it does take about 3-5 business days before I received it but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fine on this product... I just received but have not tried it yet. But the first thing I noticed (straight out of the box) was the facial steamer was dirty/stained as if it was used!!!!! That&#x27;s disgusting!! I&#x27;m somewhat of a Germaphobe, so this made my skin crawl... I will send another review shortly, we I inspect and try the hair steamer.</li>
    <li> I love it it works just like the one in the shop !!!</li>
    <li> I used this steamer one time. The second time it didnt work. It would not get hot or produce steam, just a high pitched hissing sound. They only will exchange within 30 days and i was out of that timeframe so I paid $58 to steam my hair one time.</li>
    <li> Unless you get pleasure in purchasing products, waiting around for them to be delivered, setting them up, having them not work even once, wasting time trying to figure out why the product doesn&#x27;t work, reading instructions that are in bad English with no troubleshooting tips, and then wasting time and money returning a defective product.  I ordered the product on a Saturday, received on Thursday, set up to use two days later, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I wonder if there&#x27;s some scam being pulled because these machines cannot possibly be tested before they leave the warehouse.  This is my third purchase of this kind of steamer. I thought it was the company, but these are clearly all made by the same manufacturer, and none of them work!</li>
    <li> I hate the screeching noise it makes after the first initial use.</li>
    <li> I was only able to get it to work once as the steam button must have a shortage as it won&#x27;t stay on. The one time I used it I loved it... I hope I can return and replace it but don&#x27;t know</li>
    <li> Great its smaller than the other one I had purchase elsewhere a year ago but its easier to use and gets really hot:)</li>
