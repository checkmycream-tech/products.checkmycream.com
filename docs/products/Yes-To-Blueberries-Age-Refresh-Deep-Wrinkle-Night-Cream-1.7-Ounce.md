      <li>Very good feeling when you put in one.</li>

      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>

      <li>Thankfully, after washing my face, the reaction went down really quick and there weren&#x27;t any after effects, like zits, etc.</li>
      <li>I notice I broke out slightly right above each eyebrow and got a few scarce bumps on my forehead, so I try to keep it only where I need it and just enough to rub in and cover the area.</li>

<li> Disappointing: not very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t sink in, leaving a slippery film on your skin that feels uncomfortable, especially if it&#x27;s hot.</li>
<li> I was worried when I saw how small the jar is, but very little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My wife uses this stuff everyday and has no complaints.</li>
<li> It makes me really sad to say this because I LOVE Yes To products, but I hated this product...</li>
<li> Fairly thick.</li>
<li> Goes on kinda thick</li>
<li> It was horrible and I&#x27;m so disappointed that my skin reacted like that because this product seemed like it would be great otherwise.</li>
<li> and I seriously feel my skin soak it up.</li>
<li> This sucks!</li>

    <li> Very good feeling when you put in one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works better than other products that cost much more.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and the fragrance irritates my skin. Feels oily, thick but could actually probably come in pump form instead of jar.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cream compatible to Obagi Luxe.  This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I use this between my brows and on my forehead, as I noticed lines beginning to appear that didn&#x27;t go away when I came inside. I have noticed differences and it&#x27;s been about a month. I have completely erased one line on my brow and the other is kept at bay (I squint a lot outside even with sunglasses - sensitive to light). 25 y/o female. It is a little heavy so use sparingly right before bed only where you need to. I notice I broke out slightly right above each eyebrow and got a few scarce bumps on my forehead, so I try to keep it only where I need it and just enough to rub in and cover the area. Scent is great.</li>
    <li> Great overnight cream that transforms dry skin in one use!  I love it!</li>
    <li> It makes me really sad to say this because I LOVE Yes To products, but I hated this product... and it&#x27;s all because of an intense allergic reaction. I do have some fruit allergies (my throat and mouth itch when I eat some fruits with skins - like apples - and I have minor allergies to things like kiwis), but I&#x27;ve never had a problem before with any of the other Yes To products (and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch!). I even have the blueberry eye cream and I love it, so I don&#x27;t understand what I would have been allergic to in this product. This night cream made my face blotchy and red - I had raised red patches all over my skin like hives. Thankfully, after washing my face, the reaction went down really quick and there weren&#x27;t any after effects, like zits, etc. It was horrible and I&#x27;m so disappointed that my skin reacted like that because this product seemed like it would be great otherwise. It felt moisturizing and it was heavier than the Yes To Carrots night cream (which I love, but it just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough sometimes). I&#x27;ve read through the ingredients and I just can&#x27;t figure out what I&#x27;d be allergic to - my skin is NEVER sensitive to products EVER - I&#x27;ve never had a reaction before to any beauty products! This sucks! Oh well - this product is going back and I&#x27;ll be refunded by Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this stuff everyday and has no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on--it&#x27;s not greasy. I&#x27;m not sure how well it actually deals with wrinkles, but my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Yes to Blueberries is a perfect night cream</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels very nice and makes my face feel tight</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Fairly thick. Feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several creams and this one was probably the most disappointing.  I personally did not care for the scent, though it may appeal to some.  The cream went on thickly but after a little while left my face feeling dry.  There was no difference in wrinkles, though I don&#x27;t have too many to start with.</li>
    <li> Goes on kinda thick but my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It feels amazing on and I seriously feel my skin soak it up. Wake up to hydrated and refreshed skin.</li>
    <li> I find it to be kind of sticky and not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so I cannot attest to how great this product works in that regard, but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I love how my face looks and feels when I get up in the morning. I was worried when I saw how small the jar is, but very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Disappointing: not very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t sink in, leaving a slippery film on your skin that feels uncomfortable, especially if it&#x27;s hot. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product as far as promoting moisture.  I had used this product when it was in the pump version and loved it.  This is not the same product.  It remains sticky feeling after application and working into your face.  I much prefer the former  of this product.</li>
