<li> My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
<li> hair feels silky and soft.</li>
<li> so I am an avid dry shampoo user.  </li>
<li> Fast shipping but the color and scent is a little off from my previous one I had bought in a salon and this one seems more clumpy</li>
<li> I dont want to empty the whole bottle into a squeeze bottle and apply...</li>
<li> Love this product for my thin hair.</li>
<li> I cannot use masks that are too heavy because they will cause my roots to be even oilier than normal and the cycle would be non-stop!  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and still leaves it really soft and shiny!</li>
<li> On the day of use, my hair feels extremely silky and smooth and continues for at least a day or two after (before the dry shampoo begins to dry it out again).  </li>
<li> This mask further helped to repair my extremely dry and damaged hair.</li>
<li> Second, it truly made my hair feel like new without weighing it down or being too heavy.  </li>
<li> hair is dry, but when I use the mask it stays oily...</li>
<li> I could not live without this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a few hydrating masks, different brands.</li>
<li> I usually swear by MorrocanOil products and use the oil religiously.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product does not work, I´m not be able to apply it in my hair for its texture and smell.</li>
<li> I was skeptical but hopeful about this working for my very damaged, bleached hair.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
<li> No more dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> and they said that they apply it slightly warmed up through a squeeze bottle in lines on your hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, when I came home and bought it, it did work...but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair half as shiny or manageable as when it was applied in the spa.</li>
<li> My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy.</li>
<li> I waste my money.</li>
<li> I have oily hair but very little time to wash every day</li>
<li> The smell and conditioning lasts days after I tried this...it worked wonders for my thick, cury hair.  </li>
<li> This product left my hair horrible like oily and Fluff hair in the mean time...</li>
<li> I was not impressed with this one.</li>
<li> Really bad....</li>
<li> But... Smelled awful to me.</li>

    <li> The product was sent correctly and meet my expectations. It has an excellent quality. Indico this seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask to accomodate my MorrocanOil Extra Volume Shampoo &amp; Conditioner since I was getting such great results. This mask further helped to repair my extremely dry and damaged hair. My hair is noticeably smoother and softer, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down! It withstood a huge test:  I was expecting my hair to get super frizzy as it always did on a humid day, but it did not. I was pleasantly surprised! This product exceeded my expectations as I have been trying to find shampoos/conditioners/mask that actually do what the description says it does, but I will never switch again! Morrocan oil is my product of choice. Plus, it smells heavenly and the smell lingers with you until you wash again (I wash once a week).</li>
    <li> I like it this one it very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product does not work, I´m not be able to apply it in my hair for its texture and smell. I waste my money.</li>
    <li> This is a must for my Hair Repair when my Hair is Dry and Frizzy i use this for a quick repair.This works excellent adds lots of Shine and repairs my Dry end and leaves me with Frizz Free Hair that i can Manage.Smells Great Also.</li>
    <li> An excellent conditioner.</li>
    <li> It gave my hair sheen and improved its texture!</li>
    <li> Perfect , best product</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!! My hair is softer and shines more than ever!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is made of all that is right in the world. It is exactly what bleached blonde hair needs to become healthy. I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for over 2 years now and this stuff has saved it time and time again.</li>
    <li> Great for a deep condition once a week!</li>
    <li> If I use this too regularly this was a bit too heavy for my hair, I have very fine hair. But it does make my hair feel shiny and healthy if only using once a week or less.Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I put a tiny amount on my hair after washing it and leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels silky and soft. No more dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday now and love it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, very dry hair. This mask is a wonderful deep conditioner. The best I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is soft and manageable. The mask is weightless, just as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or heavy.</li>
    <li> I usually swear by MorrocanOil products and use the oil religiously. I also love the curling mousse a lot so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I had this product used on my hair at a spa and it was AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I came home and bought it, it did work...but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair half as shiny or manageable as when it was applied in the spa. I called to ask how they had done it and they said that they apply it slightly warmed up through a squeeze bottle in lines on your hair. I dont want to empty the whole bottle into a squeeze bottle and apply...I guess next time I&#x27;ll try to leave it on longer or warm first and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best Morrocan Oil Product.</li>
    <li> Really bad.... I will not buy this product and the brand Moriccan never again... This product left my hair horrible like oily and Fluff hair in the mean time...</li>
    <li> ships on time..&lt;br /&gt;my hair is dry, but when I use the mask it stays oily...&lt;br /&gt;I´m still testing the mask, for me didn´t supplied expactations yet..</li>

    <li> Good product, keeps my hair super soft after use, but that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t see any difference in hydration. Then again, I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a week for a month.</li>
