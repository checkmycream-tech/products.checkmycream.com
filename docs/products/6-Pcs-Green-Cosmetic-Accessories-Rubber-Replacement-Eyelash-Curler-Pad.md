      <li>They fit perfectly in my CVS-bought curler as well as my Forever 21 curler.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with these.</li>
      <li>couldnt find the replacements anywhere(target,walmart), glad i found them here!</li>
      <li>yourself a favor and spend more wisely than I did.</li>
      <li>(circa 1960&#x27;s - the silver metal kind).</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of it, but happy with the product.</li>
      <li>It was an ok product.</li>
      <li>So I  used them all and got  some more durable ones from Ulta.</li>
      <li>Cheap, practical, and functional!</li>
      <li>I love these rubber replacement pads for eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>glad was more than one.</li>
      <li>Much better than silicone.</li>
      <li>and I love them more than the Revlon rubber that was already in there when I bought it.  </li>
      <li>fit my curler perfectly but have been cut open by the metal on the curler after 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;Losing</li>
      <li>wierd color though, fit my favorite eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>and even helps curl my lashes better than the original one that came with my curler when I bought it.</li>
      <li>and then it fit fine.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for some that fit.</li>
      <li>They fit well on my Revlon eyelash curler</li>
      <li>It does fit snug and it fits end to end.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up placing an order for the Seki Edge replacements (that fit in my 4 sets of Maybeline/Revlon lash curlers that I&#x27;d been having to buy since I couldn&#x27;t find the lash curler refills at the store).  </li>
      <li>so it would fit.</li>
      <li>THESE WON&#x27;T EVEN FIT MY COVER GIRL EYE LASH CURLER.</li>
      <li>i have no idea why i cannot find refills to fit my revlon or maybelline product.  </li>
      <li>Based on one review, i thought this would fit my Maybelline (print letters)</li>
      <li>I had to trim it to make it fit.</li>
      <li>The rubber perfectly fit in my eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>Revlon makes the best ones IMO and the first rubber that came with the curler lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>and so far so good.</li>
      <li>Nice fit and seemed great at first but initial strength of lash pad quickly diminished after just a week of use.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent much better than the white replacement pads by same manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Original post, 5 stars:  </li>
      <li>They are a softer rubber than the original Cover Girl rubber pad.  </li>
      <li>The cost, under $3, was very affordable and it came via free shipping!</li>
      <li>The strip has already split open on top and I inserted it TODAY!</li>
      <li>The shipping was very expedient, too!!</li>
      <li>I just got this today in the mail, and I was pretty excited.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
      <li>The eyelash curler cuts into them pretty quick.</li>
      <li>Other than that pretty good</li>
      <li>I give this a big 5 stars, and hope that you are as pleased as I was....</li>
      <li>each one sliced through on the FIRST EYE.  </li>
      <li>The rubber pads that came are exactly what is pictured.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they will hold up, even if I can trim them to fit my old curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They give my lashes way more of a curl than the last refills I bought.</li>
      <li>They work, but the rubber cushion breaks almost immediately after using it for the first time; eyelashes always get stuck.</li>
      <li>Good quality, I use my eyelash curler everyday</li>
      <li>These replacements fit my curler, but they started ripping right after the third use.</li>
      <li>and I was excited to order these because of the other reviews that said these fit.</li>
      <li>I wanted to like these, I really did.  </li>
      <li>I really needed to use them</li>
      <li>It does fit the maybelline curler with cursive letters and made in China on the handle.  </li>
      <li>After trimming, it did fit and worked but falls out before next use</li>
      <li>Also purchased the white ones and they fit revlon curler made in korea.  </li>
      <li>tried to trim them to fit and finally gave up.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was looking for and seem to be holding up pretty well thus far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now realized that other brands of curlers come with MUCH more durable pads than these.</li>
      <li>I ended up having to buy a whole new Cover Girl Eyelash Curler!  </li>
      <li>Try to buy a curler with a more plastic-looking pad, those will last much longer than these if you&#x27;re big on curling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and buy a whole new curler.</li>
      <li>So the search continues for my older curler.  </li>
      <li>They are stronger than the ones that come with the curlers, they last longer, and due to their firmness they make for a really nice eyelash curl.</li>
      <li>I lost way too many eyelashes to this crappy little thing.</li>
      <li>I believe they are standard, I took a chance with my Revlon curler and figured I could cut them if they weren&#x27;t the right size.</li>
      <li>lashes left right and center.&lt;br /&gt;Garbage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i bought these because other reviews indicated they fit.  </li>
      <li>curler manufactures want to make you buy a new eyelash curler just about the time you get one broke in.  </li>
      <li>I guess I need to give up and just buy a new curler.</li>
      <li>These are too thick to fit into the slot and they are super soft and squishy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the first one out of that brand for several weeks now</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better to spend the extra few dollars to get something that&#x27;s better quality and from a brand you TRUST (and I honestly would rather buy some that are made here in the USA - getting kinda weary of bad beauty products from China).</li>
      <li>I force fit them to make them work, but even with that they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>too soft and splits after just one use.</li>
      <li>Rubber so soft the eyelash curler cuts through in a week of use.</li>
      <li>I have an old Maybelline eyelash curler from about 1975.  </li>
      <li>I have an old hand-me-down Maybeline eyelash curler from the 70&#x27;s</li>
      <li>ALL OVER FOR THESE ,SOFT, BENDABLE ONES</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched for replacement rubber pads for my old Cover Girl Eyelash Curler in store and online.  </li>
      <li>they are soft like the old white Maybelline refills.</li>
      <li>1/8&amp;#34; - 1/4&amp;#34; with my cuticle scissors to make it fit, as it was a little too long.</li>
      <li>I FINALLY found a eyelash curler refill that works on the old style Maybelline eye lash curler</li>
      <li>I have found the new black maybelline pads do work in this curler, just prefer the old soft white ones.</li>
      <li>These eyelash curler pads split down the middle on the first use!&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
      <li>They are fine but seemed like a bit of false advertising for what I thought I was getting...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> IT DOES NOT FIT INTO STANDARD EYELASH CURLERS NO MATTER HOW HARD MY SISTER, MYSELF , ANDMY DAUGHTER TRIED.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL.BEEN LOOKIN ALL OVER FOR THESE ,SOFT, BENDABLE ONES</li>
    <li> too soft and splits after just one use.</li>
    <li> works. doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> Plan on ordering these again. Just what I wanted. Much better than silicone.</li>
    <li> Based on another review I read, I thought these would be workable in my old Revlon eyelash curler, but not very good. Too short and keeps popping out. Also, my mascara all gets smudged and clumpy using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m going to have to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and buy a whole new curler. Revlon makes the best ones IMO and the first rubber that came with the curler lasted a long time. These aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are pretty terrible. After about a month of use each pad would get a permanent groove from the clamping of the eyelash curler. From then on it would snag eyelashes and yank them out. I lost way too many eyelashes to this crappy little thing. Actual brand name replacements are only a couple bucks anyway--get those instead, and don&#x27;t risk your lashes on this crappy thing.</li>
    <li> I have to trim these (not just the ends but the sides as well, which is really difficult) to fit in either of my eyelash curlers, and even then, they pop back out. I force fit them to make them work, but even with that they don&#x27;t last long. The eyelash curler cuts into them pretty quick. Not good. But not a lot of choices out there either.</li>
    <li> These rubber replacements are not available anymore in drugstores.  Seems like curler manufactures want to make you buy a new eyelash curler just about the time you get one broke in.  This product is excellent much better than the white replacement pads by same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It was an ok product. It was a little big for my curler so I had to cut of a few centimeters and then it fit fine. Other than that pretty good</li>
    <li> These took at least a month to get here, since they are coming from hong Kong. They do the trick, especially since I can&#x27;t buy these in the stores!! But my eyelash curler made a divot almost immediately. They aren&#x27;t very tough.</li>
    <li> I love these rubber replacement pads for eyelash curlers.  They are so cushy.  They fit well on my Revlon eyelash curler and I love them more than the Revlon rubber that was already in there when I bought it.  The Revlon rubber was too hard whereas these are soft and rubbery.  I also bought these in pink.</li>
    <li> Not rossallini brand. Took a couple weeks to ship to me. Nice fit and seemed great at first but initial strength of lash pad quickly diminished after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> These fit my Lancome eyelash curler, but the rubber is thick  and not very flexible and after a week&#x27;s use the rubber is already split.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re to bulky for any of my curlers. I really needed to use them so I managed to trim one of them with a nail clipper so it would fit. After trimming, it did fit and worked but falls out before next use so I have to maneuver it in the curler again!. Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for some that fit.</li>
    <li> Original post, 5 stars:  These are awesome. They fit perfectly in my CVS-bought curler as well as my Forever 21 curler. They are stronger than the ones that come with the curlers, they last longer, and due to their firmness they make for a really nice eyelash curl. Definitely will be buying again.    Edit 9/2/14, 2 stars:   I&#x27;ve now realized that other brands of curlers come with MUCH more durable pads than these. As others noted, these do get deep cut grooves in the middle after a few times use. Try to buy a curler with a more plastic-looking pad, those will last much longer than these if you&#x27;re big on curling. Not rebuying!</li>
    <li> Based on one review, i thought this would fit my Maybelline (print letters) circa 1970&#x27;s curler but it does not.  It does fit the maybelline curler with cursive letters and made in China on the handle.  Also purchased the white ones and they fit revlon curler made in korea.  I will post same review for the white ones.  So the search continues for my older curler.  I have found the new black maybelline pads do work in this curler, just prefer the old soft white ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s coming from China so you&#x27;ll have to be patient. Besides that these are great! Good quality, I use my eyelash curler everyday and I think I&#x27;ll need to change them for hygiene purposes before they wear out. I believe they are standard, I took a chance with my Revlon curler and figured I could cut them if they weren&#x27;t the right size. No need, perfect fit!</li>
    <li> Quality is very good for the price.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of it, but happy with the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just got this today in the mail, and I was pretty excited. The rubber perfectly fit in my eyelash curler. This product didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all..</li>
    <li> These rubber replacements are really thick. I did have a little trouble getting them in one of my eyelash curlers. I ended up using some scissors to adjust the width. They are a bit wider than the average refill. I will say that they work perfectly. They give my lashes way more of a curl than the last refills I bought. The reason why I got them was that I looked everywhere for refills, but could only find the eyelash curler with one refill. I am very pleased with these. The shipping was very expedient, too!!</li>
    <li> I  can  use  one of these every three days before they break all the way through and pull my eyelashes out.  So I  used them all and got  some more durable ones from Ulta.</li>
    <li> I FINALLY found a eyelash curler refill that works on the old style Maybelline eye lash curler (circa 1960&#x27;s - the silver metal kind). I am using my moms curler, and the green refills are soft enough to work. The Rosallini white ones DO NOT (they are hard and do not fit this style). I had to cut off approx. 1/8&amp;#34; - 1/4&amp;#34; with my cuticle scissors to make it fit, as it was a little too long. Works great~ they are soft like the old white Maybelline refills. I give this a big 5 stars, and hope that you are as pleased as I was.... it has taken a lot of buying refills that did not stay in or did not fit from the start.  You don&#x27;t even have to work at getting it in the slot. If you love your old Maybelline eye lash curler like I do, you may be frustrated enough to give this a try. I don&#x27;t think you will regret it.</li>
    <li> I have an old Maybelline eyelash curler from about 1975.  Still works great IF I can find the refills, which I can&#x27;t.  These are too thick to fit into the slot and they are super soft and squishy.  I don&#x27;t think they will hold up, even if I can trim them to fit my old curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took forever to arrive and are NOT Rosallini brand.  They are from somewhere in Asia.  Product description says rubber, but these are probably actually silicone.  Bogus ripoff.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  Rubber so soft the eyelash curler cuts through in a week of use.</li>
    <li> couldnt find the replacements anywhere(target,walmart), glad i found them here! wierd color though, fit my favorite eyelash curler.  glad was more than one.</li>
    <li> They work, but the rubber cushion breaks almost immediately after using it for the first time; eyelashes always get stuck.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fit.  Cut it done to size</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these, I really did.  But I went through three in three days... each one sliced through on the FIRST EYE.  I could almost handle them slicing through if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that when they did, they pulled out lashes and also cut some of my lashes.  Not okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up placing an order for the Seki Edge replacements (that fit in my 4 sets of Maybeline/Revlon lash curlers that I&#x27;d been having to buy since I couldn&#x27;t find the lash curler refills at the store).  I&#x27;ve been on the first one out of that brand for several weeks now and so far so good.</li>
    <li> THESE WON&#x27;T EVEN FIT MY COVER GIRL EYE LASH CURLER. TOO THICK AND TOO SHORT.</li>
    <li> Cheap, practical, and functional!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for replacement rubber pads for my old Cover Girl Eyelash Curler in store and online.  No success.  I ended up having to buy a whole new Cover Girl Eyelash Curler!  In store and online, it only comes with ONE pad.  I found these pads and decided to order them.  The cost, under $3, was very affordable and it came via free shipping! I was expecting shipping to take a long time, since my order review stated it would take about a month to get to me.  The item came in about 10 days.  The rubber pads that came are exactly what is pictured.  They are a softer rubber than the original Cover Girl rubber pad.  It took a little doing to put the replacement in the eyelash curler.  It does fit snug and it fits end to end.  It is nearly a perfect size.  After doing a test curl it seemed to do it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for and seem to be holding up pretty well thus far. The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is because although it says Rosallini brand, I received a small mailing envelope from China with a foreign brand name in Chinese characters written on the packaging of the replacements, not Rosallini. They are fine but seemed like a bit of false advertising for what I thought I was getting...</li>
    <li> i have no idea why i cannot find refills to fit my revlon or maybelline product.  i bought these because other reviews indicated they fit.  that was not my experience.  tried to trim them to fit and finally gave up.</li>
    <li> these refills last forever and are less rigid than the silicone type , I feel they&#x27;re  easier on the lashes and price is wonderful</li>
    <li> Worst pads ever! These eyelash curler pads split down the middle on the first use!&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality material. Not worth a cent!</li>
    <li> The saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies here.&lt;br /&gt;These are garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through 3 in a week.&lt;br /&gt;They fit my curler perfectly but have been cut open by the metal on the curler after 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;Losing lashes left right and center.&lt;br /&gt;Garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend more wisely than I did.</li>
    <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t give them NO stars! These replacements fit my curler, but they started ripping right after the third use. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Great by and they last a long time!</li>
    <li> They worked really great ! Now I don&#x27;t have to keep getting new curlers every time the padding goes bad</li>
    <li> 1) They rip out your eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;2) They are not the brand that is indicated (&amp;#34;Rosallini&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;3) They last only a few days&lt;br /&gt;4) They take a LONG time to arrive (weeks/months)&lt;br /&gt;5) They don&#x27;t actually seem like they are rubber (false advertising)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better to spend the extra few dollars to get something that&#x27;s better quality and from a brand you TRUST (and I honestly would rather buy some that are made here in the USA - getting kinda weary of bad beauty products from China).</li>
    <li> It fits my curler perfectly! and even helps curl my lashes better than the original one that came with my curler when I bought it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have an old hand-me-down Maybeline eyelash curler from the 70&#x27;s and I was excited to order these because of the other reviews that said these fit. It did not fit. I had to trim it to make it fit. Also the quality is what you would expect out of China. The insert is not springy. It is gummy and the metal leaves a deep indentation when pressed down. The strip has already split open on top and I inserted it TODAY! I guess I need to give up and just buy a new curler.</li>
