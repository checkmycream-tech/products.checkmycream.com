<li> No other deodorant does this as well as this one.</li>
<li> and what I got was just old and withered enough to disappoint me.  </li>

<li> It use to be easier to find at department stores but is harder to find nowadays</li>
<li> Porbably due to the ingrediant triclosan.</li>
<li> I need this to not challenge a cologne I&#x27;m wearing other than Aramis Cologne one of my all time choices.</li>
<li> /&gt;Second, rub a small amount on the back of either arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However it is getting hard to find locally.  </li>
<li> But the smell works less than three Hours</li>
<li> Aramis is one of the very few products which my husband can tolerate because of allergies.</li>
<li> It is a bit cold and sticky when you apply it, and it does not perform as well and protects as long as the antiperspirant.</li>
<li> /&gt;Third, wait for approximately 30-seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
<li> so when I discovered I had the wrong one I could not return it.  </li>
<li> The Product is very Bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant.  It is often unavailable in stores, so ordering from you is great and so convenient.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product when bought fresh; trying to save money I ordered it online and what I got was just old and withered enough to disappoint me.  It&#x27;s back to retail for me.</li>
    <li> Best Deodorant I have ever used</li>
    <li> This smells great on dark and olive-skinned men.  I don&#x27;t know why there is a difference when a light-skinned man wears it, but there is.  I bought some once for my light-skinned husband and I chased him out of the house until the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; went away.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I could find this very essential item for my husband. The delivery was prompt and the product was as advertised. What else could I want?</li>
    <li> Old school great scent</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product for the price and arrived promptly.  I was very pleased with this product and would order again.</li>
    <li> My Husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> Real 24 hour protection. Other deodorants provide good protection but Aramis 24 hour high performance deodorant is exactly what it states to be...true 24 hour protection. Even if you do sweat you can smell the deodorant but not the sweat. No other deodorant does this as well as this one. Tabac deodorant is good too but nowhere near as good as this one for protection. It use to be easier to find at department stores but is harder to find nowadays so online is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW this is the review of the deodorant version not antiperspirant version...I can&#x27;t use the antiperspirant because I&#x27;m allergic to them.</li>
    <li> If you like Aramis, and I do, you&#x27;ll want to have this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product by accident.  I have always used the antiperspirant stick, not the deodorant stick. I didn&#x27;t use the product right away so when I discovered I had the wrong one I could not return it.  So I just started using the deodorant.  I have to say that I don&#x27;t like it much.  It is a bit cold and sticky when you apply it, and it does not perform as well and protects as long as the antiperspirant. I&#x27;m going back to antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 25 years.  It goes well with my omega constellation, Mt blanc rollerball and Mercedes.</li>
    <li> First, locate a sample at a mall or department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, rub a small amount on the back of either arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, wait for approximately 30-seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, now it is time to determine if the product works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aramis deodorant stick works with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product!</li>
    <li> Items just as described.  Package arrived earlier than I even expected.  Great service.  Definitely would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> One of the sticks had obviously sat on the shelf for some time because the stick had shrunk in size.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a combination of volatile fragrance and volatile alcohol which when combined will evaporate...&lt;br /&gt;thus the shrinkage. The seller offered me a replacement free of charge and shipping. I decided the effort&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t worth the effort so I kept the shrunken stick which still did its job of killing underarm bacteria &amp; providing&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.This IS NOT an anti-persperant stick. Just deodorant.  All in all, great service and a proven product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1980 from mostly high end mall providers. Just make sure you require this seller&lt;br /&gt;to give you a fresh product. Otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aramis products for many years. I like the fragrance</li>
    <li> I need this to not challenge a cologne I&#x27;m wearing other than Aramis Cologne one of my all time choices.</li>
    <li> I,ve been using aramis products over 50 years,and this is no where near as good as antiperspirant stick.</li>
    <li> I like the Aramis sent, but don&#x27;t like antiperspirants,  this product works well without antiperspirant.  Porbably due to the ingrediant triclosan.</li>
    <li> Priced way too much for what you get.</li>
    <li> Very effective, application can last 3 to 4 days if necessary. Pleasant clean fragrance. These reviews just require too many words.</li>
    <li> Aramis is one of the very few products which my husband can tolerate because of allergies. The fragrance is great. However it is getting hard to find locally.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> God product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this product - a deoderant that works in hot, humid weather - rather than the more common anti-perspirants that can be found everywhere that I will not wear.  Well done Aramis!</li>
    <li> The Product is very Bad it has a hint of Aramis But the smell works less than three Hours</li>
    <li> Excellent aroma for men. My husband has had many compliments about it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER TRIED IT BEFORE BECAUSE I HAVE VERY SENSETIVE SKIN.  SO FAR, SO GOOD. I WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
