      <li>Great size.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Very effective.</li>
      <li>but they are an awesome fit for me...</li>
      <li>I feel good knowing that I don&#x27;t have to apply any chemical/fragrance-full products.</li>
      <li>The crystal is good; the plastic dish is a throwaway, and the velvet pouch arrived already coming apart.  </li>
      <li>Good size and works.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>and I was kind of regret that I did not buy it more than one.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this purchase and will consider stocking up if all continues to go well.</li>
      <li>It made me feel much better understanding the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wife love it, what more can i Say</li>
      <li>Works better than any aluminum deodorant I used to try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s deodorant, so doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration, of course - but, works great to keep odor at bay in an all natural, and non-toxic way.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I am quite happy with this and pleased to se the American Cancer Society  recommends this product</li>
      <li>They make fantastic gifts.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I tried out a \\&quot;natural deodorant\\&quot; about 13 years ago and did not have good results but this one seems to be working.</li>
      <li>May it last many, many years!</li>
      <li>Keeps you fresh for 24 hours and so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Aluminium is the third most abundant element on the planet and we ingest it in large proportions every day in water and food.</li>
      <li>Best  deodorant ever plus long lasting!</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant hands down.</li>
      <li>Aluminium Chlorohydrate is a synthetic ingredient of antiperspirants/deodorants, designed to be absorbed into and to block the pores under the arms, to prevent perspiration.</li>
      <li>and I still smell fresh.    </li>
      <li>I picked this gem up yesterday and so far I am really pleased.</li>
      <li>The first crystal was cracked  and replaced quickly.</li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower then put on my scented powder</li>
      <li>I was a skeptic but, because of health issues, have been going more natural with my routine and eliminating as many environmental toxins (including hygiene products) as possible.</li>
      <li>Just rub your under arm after showering when you are still wet then it is good with you for the whole day.</li>
      <li>I mainly tried this because it was cheap and a large size.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
      <li>More than that, with the heat in California this time around 84-90oF, I don&#x27;t need to use spray deodorant as a back up anymore.</li>
      <li>and so we class it purely as a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put it on after an evening shower, slept in it, went through a day of work, then out running errands in humid 85+ degree heat, then on the treadmill where I worked up a real sweat.</li>
      <li>But I still had to use normal spray deodorant on hot days.</li>
      <li>The whole purpose of my buying this was to get away from aluminum.</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>It was larger than I expected so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>This particular one is made from mineral salts and potassium alum.and is made in Thailand.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
      <li>Alum has been used for many years, in the Far and Middle East, as a deodorant, astringent and basic antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>This crystal really does keep me dry and fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>It was time to order a new one.</li>
      <li>like a naked stone and makes you feel clean and fresh unlike the other chemical deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;it is not antiperspirant protection....</li>
      <li>I was concerned about trying this, as I have very sensitive skin and salt in my perspiration often bothers my skin.</li>
      <li>It is not particularly good for living organisms in the body so over eons we have evolved a particularly efficient and effective system for allowing naturally occurring Aluminium and its salt derivatives to pass through the body without effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are other similar crystals with velvet pouches, much better quality.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how simple this is, and how much it really works!  </li>
      <li>Never thought that a natural product like this would do the job, but it does!</li>
      <li>Potassium alum is a natural antiseptic and astringent and inhibits the growth of bacteria that causes body odor.</li>
      <li>is an ingredient that features highly in all of our current range of natural deodorants.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and lasts a long, long long time.</li>
      <li>I like that they&#x27;re natural and last a really long time.</li>
      <li>This is my second crystal, my first, this same product, lasted for four years; and I used it everyday.  </li>

<li> people get confused about Alum because the press talk about Aluminium being bad for us.</li>
<li> It is the bacteria which causes the bad smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used anything but these crystals for about 20 years and they work like they say. another big plus is that they don&#x27;t trash your t-shirts</li>
    <li> I picked this gem up yesterday and so far I am really pleased. I tried out a \\&quot;natural deodorant\\&quot; about 13 years ago and did not have good results but this one seems to be working. So far today I have not experienced the excessive sweating which I usually experience and I still smell fresh.    So far so good.

    <li> Love these! They make fantastic gifts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of deodorant stones. I&#x27;d had the last one for about 7 years, dropped it a few times, and only had bits left. It was time to order a new one. I found this one on Amazon and ordered it because it was a great price. It was larger than I expected so I&#x27;m very pleased. May it last many, many years!</li>
    <li> Best  deodorant ever plus long lasting!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have bought these, they last me about a year, and I never smell bad.  Works on feet too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how simple this is, and how much it really works!  It&#x27;s deodorant, so doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration, of course - but, works great to keep odor at bay in an all natural, and non-toxic way.</li>
    <li> Good size and works.  I never use deodorant anymore.  This lasts all day</li>
    <li> A friend told me about these deodorant stones. I like that they&#x27;re natural and last a really long time. This particular one is made from mineral salts and potassium alum.and is made in Thailand. Remember this is a deodorant and not an anti-antiperspirant, so it won&#x27;t prevent your pits from sweating but will stop the odor. Potassium alum is a natural antiseptic and astringent and inhibits the growth of bacteria that causes body odor. It&#x27;s also the stuff that some styptic pencils are made with to stop the bleeding if you cut yourself shaving.</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE!  Beautiful tray and bag.  I think this will last for some time.</li>
    <li> Couple years ago, I bought a &amp;#34;crystal deodorant &amp;#34; from L&#x27;occitane. It worked well. The greatest thing is that it did not have any smell, you&#x27;d feel nothing just like you did not use any deodorant. But I still had to use normal spray deodorant on hot days. L&#x27;occitane stopped producing it and I was kind of regret that I did not buy it more than one. I almost run out of it that&#x27;s when I found this crystal here on Amazon. It arrived bigger than I expected. More than that, with the heat in California this time around 84-90oF, I don&#x27;t need to use spray deodorant as a back up anymore. Just rub your under arm after showering when you are still wet then it is good with you for the whole day. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant hands down. I can&#x27;t believe I never tried it before!</li>
    <li> The first crystal was cracked  and replaced quickly. I am quite happy with this and pleased to se the American Cancer Society  recommends this product</li>
    <li> I mainly tried this because it was cheap and a large size.  I was figuring salt is salt but this one doesn&#x27;t last very long compared to the Windsalt brand I bought previously.  I usually have to reapply halfway thru the day or sooner if I do any physical activity.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this deodorant!  This is my second crystal, my first, this same product, lasted for four years; and I used it everyday.  I heard about crystals being the healthier, safer, deodorant over 20 years ago, and I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try one.  They&#x27;re excellent.  They work perfectly.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works! I was a skeptic but, because of health issues, have been going more natural with my routine and eliminating as many environmental toxins (including hygiene products) as possible. I decided to give this a try and am impressed. This has just replaced the brand name deoderant that I couldn&#x27;t do without. It does last 24 hours, at least. I put it on after an evening shower, slept in it, went through a day of work, then out running errands in humid 85+ degree heat, then on the treadmill where I worked up a real sweat. Even after cooling off, still no odor. I feel good knowing that I don&#x27;t have to apply any chemical/fragrance-full products. And no worrying about the dreaded white streak on clothes.</li>
    <li> This crystal really does keep me dry and fresh smelling.  It is easy to use and lasts a long, long long time.</li>
    <li> This works great. I put it on right out of the shower then put on my scented powder and I&#x27;m good for the whole day. This works as both a deodorant and antioxidant for me. I was concerned about trying this, as I have very sensitive skin and salt in my perspiration often bothers my skin. Have been using this daily for about a week and no irritation.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Great size. Works better than any aluminum deodorant I used to try.</li>
    <li> These are the best deodorant. Very effective. Inexpensive, long lasting, and this giant size is easier to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I know, those Thai stone deodorants do not work for everybody but they are an awesome fit for me... Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Really works. But I&#x27;m not sure that alum is any different than aluminum based on the research I&#x27;ve done. The whole purpose of my buying this was to get away from aluminum.</li>
    <li> Wife love it, what more can i Say</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS GREAT!! I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives to deodorant for so long and was about to give up but this saved the day!! Next time you need to buy deodorant skip it and get this!!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says on the box. Keeps you fresh for 24 hours and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> like a naked stone and makes you feel clean and fresh unlike the other chemical deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;it is not antiperspirant protection....might outlive me it&#x27;s so big</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest, and biggest, of the deodorant crystals I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;m allergic to the aluminum salts in regular deodorants, and health foodstore deodorants like Thom&#x27;s just don&#x27;t work as well. Excellent value!</li>
    <li> Now I smell like human skin mixed with laundry detergent. Great</li>
    <li> Great product! Have been using this deodorant for a couple of weeks now. Works great. Never thought that a natural product like this would do the job, but it does! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> THESE STONES WORK JUST LIKE AN ANTIPERSPIRANT, WITHOUT ALLTHE CHEMICALS. I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
    <li> This will get the odor out, after showing I will use it to remove any possible remaining odor. I do need to use it during the day if I am not using a regular deodorant. I am guilty of buying this and then worrying because I didn&#x27;t know what Alum was. I looked it up and found this description. It made me feel much better understanding the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alum is an ingredient that features highly in all of our current range of natural deodorants. Alum has been used for many years, in the Far and Middle East, as a deodorant, astringent and basic antiperspirant. It is also used on cuts after shaving because of its styptic properties (stops bleeding and closes pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alum is used in our deodorants for its antibacterial properties, which helps to inhibit the growth of bacteria on the skin. It is the bacteria which causes the bad smell. Some people find it also performs a basic antiperspirant function, but others don’t and so we class it purely as a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people get confused about Alum because the press talk about Aluminium being bad for us. Aluminium is the third most abundant element on the planet and we ingest it in large proportions every day in water and food. In fact, in some parts, its presence in water is the only thing that allows it to be drunk without harm. It is not particularly good for living organisms in the body so over eons we have evolved a particularly efficient and effective system for allowing naturally occurring Aluminium and its salt derivatives to pass through the body without effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is specific types of manmade Aluminium that have the health scares associated with them. Aluminium Chlorohydrate is a synthetic ingredient of antiperspirants/deodorants, designed to be absorbed into and to block the pores under the arms, to prevent perspiration. There have been some claims that there may be a connection between breast cancer and Aluminium Chlorohydrate but no real concrete evidence. For reference to some studies on deodorants and breast cancer see end of article.eference to some studies on deodorants and breast cancer see end of article.</li>
    <li> This works well for me. I would recommend trying this!</li>
