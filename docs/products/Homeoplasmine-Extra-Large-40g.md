      <li>Good for chafing, dry lips, boo boos, and cuticles.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for dry lips, elbows or skin irritations.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product is not the same as Boiron&#x27;s calendula ointment in the US, which I also own.</li>
      <li>I like to start putting on my make up even when ip the cream has not been fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite new skin care product!</li>
      <li>My whole experience with this has been just super.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a gritty texture at times and I don&#x27;t think it works any better than Vaseline or Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Soft, smooth, silky (if that makes sense).  </li>
      <li>It has a similar consistency to Vaseline but better.</li>

      <li>This really helps!</li>
      <li>Yes, I love it for the dry skin</li>
      <li>but, certainly it should be in your kit for face and lip prep.</li>
      <li>This will certainly moisturize and act as a barrier cream, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
      <li>also agree that the Calendula cream by Boiron at Whole Foods is probably the same thing at a vastly better price if you live in the USA.</li>

      <li>Really nourishes and moisturises. .</li>
      <li>It works as well as a specifc lip product that I used to use that cost 4 times as much as this.  </li>
      <li>Irritated my skin and my skin is very resilient.</li>

      <li>This stuff really clears up flaky skin on the face.</li>
      <li>It WORKS - it really really does.</li>
      <li>He was kind enough to enclose English info for me as the package is labeled in Cyrillic.</li>
      <li>and I loved the effect since I couldn&#x27;t find anything for long time as efficient for my aging dry skin as this... ointment.</li>
      <li>This will smooth your skin out so it&#x27;s a flat canvas for your makeup.</li>
      <li>It takes much longer for the skin to heal itself as I get older.</li>
      <li>It also works nice on dry patches of skin such as the flexor zones.</li>
      <li>This is the first winter I&#x27;ve made it through without the skin on my knuckles cracking and bleeding, the skin even stays soft.  </li>
      <li>.. makes a huge difference as I have really dry lips</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am obsessed. The texture of this is a bit like aquaphor but it is not as greasy. It is an excellent moisturizer. I love that this gives me glowy skin without any shimmer or glitter.  This is my absolute favorite new skin care product!</li>
    <li> FYI this is available in the US by the same company with a different name. Boiron makes homeopathic calendula cream, ointment and gel. The ointment is the exact same thing as this and is MUCH cheaper -- under $10.00 a tube. The ointment form is in a petroleum base which makes it greasy. I prefer the cream formula &amp;  love the gel formula. I would buy again in cream or gel form but not under the French name. Wish Boiron would just call it the same name in English so that it is not misleading and more expensive. I found it at my local healthfood store by going to the Boiron website and using store locator.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever for dry hands and chapped lips.  I had angular cheilitis last summer and tried nearly everything to get rid of it.  Nothing worked until I started slathering this stuff on it constantly - it improved within days and was gone in a couple of weeks.  This winter, every time I put this on my lips I&#x27;d smear the excess on the backs of my hands.  This is the first winter I&#x27;ve made it through without the skin on my knuckles cracking and bleeding, the skin even stays soft.  I keep a backup just in case I lose it or run out.  So good!</li>
    <li> I was so intrigued by all the reviews on this product. I learned that it could be used for lips, blemishes, cuts, and even pimples. So far, it works very well for lips. I usually put it on my lips before bed and wake up with soft supple lips. It has a similar consistency to Vaseline but better. I still use Neosporine for cuts. And pimples? That&#x27;s another long story.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!! I use it on my lips everyday as a chapstick, and it works wonders! I can also mix a little blush to make custom colors. My makeup artist friends SWEAR BY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my chest and neck when lotion wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I was so dry and my skin was starting to crack.. OUCH! One night of this got me back to normal. I also use it on my hands in the winter months if they get distressed!</li>
    <li> This stuff really clears up flaky skin on the face. It didn&#x27;t do the same wonders on the eczema on my hands, but that&#x27;s an extreme case. I use this all over my face every night after washing and in spots in the morning. Great purchase, though it could be a little less expensive.    UPDATE 11/23/14  I have found that it does lose efficacy over time. But that has been my general reaction to petroleum-based ointments. I prefer Welleda Almond Oil now, with a light lotion over it, for dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I used this for a particularly bad diaper rash for baby and it worked really well. Bought mine in a French pharmacy. This product is not the same as Boiron&#x27;s calendula ointment in the US, which I also own. There are some different ingredients. Not saying that you can&#x27;t get similar results, but if you are familiar with homeopathy and the way it works, you&#x27;ll know that different plant ingredients can make a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My lips have never been smoother!  As a bonus it works well when mixing with lipsticks to turn into a softer stain!</li>
    <li> Multi purpose cream/Vaseline excellent for softening my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product both at night and under my make up and I love it. It makes my skin feel very soft and despite being quite thick (reminds me of Aquaphor in this sense) it isn&#x27;t greasy at all and has not clogged pores, etc. Highly recommend it as part of your skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Can i just say that all this is is extremely expensive Vaseline.. Dont waste your $$</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin and my skin is very resilient.</li>
    <li> Love.  My lips have never been so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very dry skin on my face for so long now &amp; have tried numerous brands of moisturizers.This is the only brand that does not &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; my skin. A little goes a long way. My skin absorbs this products in less then 30 mins. It does not leave a &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; finish.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> What? Non-greasy? Brought an under-makeup shine to my face all day long.  Did not soak in at all. Just go to Wal-Mart and buy a jar of Aquaphor, it&#x27;s the same thing</li>
    <li> Bought this product based on rave reviews from a magazine.  Very disappointed.  Its just a glorified Vaseline without the smell.</li>
    <li> It is really expensive Vaseline. Not impressed.  I don&#x27;t mind spending money on skin products and was excited about this one when I ordered it.  It is not special. Save your money for another product.</li>
    <li> This is a fine emollient, but the French name should not deceive American buyers.  The main ingredient is vaseline, followed by boric acid (disinfectant) and small (homeopathic small) quantities of herbs. This will certainly moisturize and act as a barrier cream, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have very sensitive skin that dries out and our Ohio winters can be brutal with cold and wind. This stuff saved my face. I use it every day, morning and night. It goes on greasy but absorbs so nicely. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than petroleum jelly which you could buy a barrel of for this price.  I&#x27;m sending mine back.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone can&#x27;t think this product isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> This is one of those staple products that I have wanted for a long time. I am excited to have it and use it. It has a light pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I really liked it at first but, then I starting itching and my skin became irritated.  Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> NOT A FAN OF THIS OVER PRICED VASELINE!!!! I GOGGLED ALL INGREDIENTS TOO LATE THIS IS CRAP!! DONT WASTE UR MONEY GUYS!!</li>
    <li> I bought his based on all the rave reviews from other blogs.  I have to say, I&#x27;m not all that impressed especially given the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a gritty texture at times and I don&#x27;t think it works any better than Vaseline or Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree that the Calendula cream by Boiron at Whole Foods is probably the same thing at a vastly better price if you live in the USA.</li>
    <li> Big fan of homeoplasmine.  It is the only ointment I have ever used that is not greasy, absorbs well into the skin, and prevents my lips from getting all dried out from the office air conditioner.  I also use it under my makeup for a flawless complexion.  Great product.  I used to use YuBe, then I found this..I think homeoplasmiine works much better.</li>
    <li> My daughter has chronic dry lips and this stuff has made a huge difference. I used it on my lips and a few dry patches on my face and it has worked wonders. We bought two more tubes to keep with us at all times. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got it for diaper rash and it works great for my daughters sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s good for dry lips, elbows or skin irritations. Great product, safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> Originally from Montreal, Canada - I&#x27;ve been using Homeoplasmine all my life as it is available at the pharmacy. I was first introduced to it introduced to it during the winter months as a cream to put on my red/irritated nose when I had a cold. I would put it on before bed and wake up with a normal looking nose. It was like a miracle. Then I started using it on blemishes and problem areas. It WORKS - it really really does. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s so worth the money. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest spreading it all over the face but it&#x27;s definitely a little secret cream that does wonders for redness, blemishes and improving skin tone overall. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This primer is my perfect product! This is a thick emollient, like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s 8 Hour Cream, that needs to be warmed up in your hands before smoothing it all over your skin. A little goes a long way! Homeoplasmine does need time to sink into your skin. I have combination skin that it starting to age but still dealing with mild adult acne. It takes much longer for the skin to heal itself as I get older. This will smooth your skin out so it&#x27;s a flat canvas for your makeup. To me, this is where it also acts like a BB Cream because it looks as if it slightly blurs/ evens out my skin tone and as a bonus, it has a matte finish! If my skin was a little bit clearer, I would wear this alone. I give this about 30 minutes to absorb into my skin. Now what I really love bout this, is that I don&#x27;t feel this cream on my skin! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel heavy or clogged like other emollients will. I like to start putting on my make up even when ip the cream has not been fully absorbed. The cream and my powder mix together to make a lovely, satin finish which lasts all day. It&#x27;s very easy to cover up any imperfections in a way so that your skin looks flawless! A tube this size will last a really long time so it is value for money! I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I use it just about everywhere on my face and body. Good for chafing, dry lips, boo boos, and cuticles.</li>
    <li> I love the product! i put it on my face around the eyes before i go to sleep and on any other trouble areas. I look forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
    <li> Love this ointment. Help healing skin scrapes.</li>
    <li> The main component of this product is petroleum jelly. The additional ingredients are in homeopathic amounts. This means they are effectively undetectable, since they are in parts per BILLION. You can buy a barrel of Vaseline for the price of this tube.</li>
    <li> I like to use it to protected the nasal cavity from pollen , a tiny  amount is enough . Works well for minor skin irritation or chaffing</li>
    <li> I bought this product,  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  I read the reviews and was so excited to receive it.  Please go and buy some Aquaphor it works better and is a lot cheaper.  This is not a miracle cream that you may want it to be, its average and that is all.  Trust me, I wish I did not buy the item.</li>
    <li> Very basic - feels like Vaseline. I read that this was a secret/miracle cream that most European women use. Maybe the climate is different, but I do not see what the huge hype is about.</li>
    <li> fab product i use it for my lips and for any irritation like sore noses after a cold , i use it when my skin is sore from skiing and sun and wind, amazing , i have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Nothing has made my lips and dry patches as smooth as this emollient. And it also smells weirdly wonderful, like vanilla. Wasn&#x27;t expecting that!</li>
    <li> I mainly use it on my lips - so I will stick with talking about how great it makes them feel.  Soft, smooth, silky (if that makes sense).  It works as well as a specifc lip product that I used to use that cost 4 times as much as this.  I wish they would also package this in a lip balm type of tube - easier to take with you and apply throughout the day.  But I just squeezed some into a small pot and keep that in my bag.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> IT has worked wonders on the psoriasis on my forehead! LOVE this stuff.  It works better than aquaphor.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I chose the 5 star rating because this does exactly what it says, and more. I get really dry, chapped lips and I also don&#x27;t drink enough water throughout the day so they get really dehydrated. This really helps! If anyone else has any tips and tricks for what they use it for (I heard it can be used underneath makeup) let me know!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Will purchase it again if I can get my paws on it. It&#x27;s very difficult to find in the US.</li>
    <li> I did not order it.  I do not even know what it is.  Instructions are written in a foreign language.  I have not been successful in sending it back.  Anyone thinking of buying it, beware.</li>
    <li> Yes, I love it for the dry skin and my husband likes it for his dry hands.  We both think it works well and is not as greasy as vaseline it absorbs in the skin.</li>
    <li> Really nourishes and moisturises. . I use it for my lips mostly at night. .. makes a huge difference as I have really dry lips</li>
    <li> Except for the price, this stuff is perfect. My lips stay protected and hydrated. And I wake up with a perfect pout. Love it. I only wish they would sell it closer to the price available in Paris. The mark-up is crazy!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing more than petroleum. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on recommendations from makeup artists and its restorative healing qualities it was be touted for. I did find it a bit greasy as a primer but, certainly it should be in your kit for face and lip prep.I have found NOTHING better for my chapped lips, night use around my eyes &amp; use it on my  hands ( a lot). --pkg is in French, Google what to do w it</li>
    <li> I like it, but it is a little thick. I use it under my makeup when I have a dry stop of skin. It also works nice on dry patches of skin such as the flexor zones. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I love Homeoplasmine. This is wonderful for chapped lips and dry/irritated skin. This heals my chapped lips immediately and the results last. This is product is a beauty secret in France and I wish I had know about it sooner. I will never be without Homeoplasmine!</li>
    <li> This balm is fantastic. Helps relieve dry, cracked, and/or flaking skin.  My cats foot pads were all dry and torn up, and a tiny dab did wonders. He feels much better, I can tell. Best fix for chapped lips and cracked hands. Oh, and yes, it&#x27;s French. Ooh la la.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  having just used this for a week, its made my lips softer and definitely is a great primer before foundation.  it seems to &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; the negatives on my face.  must try.</li>
    <li> I always had problem with my dry and flaky skin around my nose and my eyes corners until I ordered the 40g homeoplasmine. Its been doing great job as overnight lip moisturizer and it calmed down my irritation in outer corner of eye and my noes. I do a lot of out door running and biking, so the dryness of my skin was mostly due to dry air and wind but since I am using this cream, I am not getting even a single dry or flaky patch on my face. I LOVE IT and definitely  recommend it!! try to use it over night, but never under your make up since it is thick and shiny.</li>
    <li> I use this cream as I would vaseline, like on my heels overnight with white socks. It is just as advertised, but I&#x27;ll stick with my vaseline.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the claims that are now everywhere about this potion, but I am a fanatic about caring for my skin. I found it at a decent price here on amazon from the seller Live Forever which happens to be in Bulgaria. More about that in a moment. I have a small problem with blemishes that turn cystic and hard. They are very very small or I&#x27;d be at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office by now. However, they are the bane of my existence, and I thought I&#x27;d try this. IT WORKS. All I can say is IT WORKS. My skin is clearer, no more blemishes. I cannot promise this will do the same thing for you but I am convinced and will keep using it. As well, I will keep buying it from the Live Forever seller. He was kind enough to enclose English info for me as the package is labeled in Cyrillic. I was very impressed by his thoughtfulness. I know what is in it and how much thanks to him. My whole experience with this has been just super. It even came earlier than expected. Hope this helps you decide!</li>
    <li> This one saved my face, literally. I have mistaken the usage for it though, I think. I was using it nightly on my whole face and I loved the effect since I couldn&#x27;t find anything for long time as efficient for my aging dry skin as this... ointment. But I have just learned of &amp;#34;possible&amp;#34; side-effects when its applied regularly (which is what I have been doing) and to large areas (which is what I have been doing). It can apparently cause &amp;#34;general toxic effect&amp;#34; due to the high content of boric acid in it. Although this specifically can happen in children, I still feel every person needs to be aware of this information as I wasn&#x27;t when I gave rave review in the past of this product.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot each month - I use this on the plane (and for those nights I know I&#x27;m not getting a full 8 hours of sleep) - keeps my skin moisturized so I don&#x27;t look tired and dried out</li>
