<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it during summer, it just blends right in. I haven&#x27;t used it after I ran out because I was too lazy to buy another one. It was my holy grail when I did use it, though. I wish they would make a No. 25. That would probably be the perfect shade for me!</li>
    <li> Love this! Stays on all day if you use a primer and setting spray. Covers well too!</li>
    <li> This  product is amazing  it gives you a  smooth finish with the advantages of having such a  high spf  that was exactly what I  was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about BB creams and i did about months and months of research before buying this one. I have normal/combination skin with dry patches here and there...and I have tan skin(Indian skin tone) with warm undertone and no.27 is perfect for my skin tone...I feel like it actually brightens my skin tone...But there&#x27;s a trick to this product..I feel like if I use too much, it makes me look like a ghost and highlights my dry patches...but I use just the right amount then it&#x27;s perfect...after I started using this product, It&#x27;s made my life so much easier...This is perfect for everyday wear...I no longer have to use a primer and on my good days, I don&#x27;t use a concealer either...I just moisturizer after I wash my face and put this on..and sometimes if it&#x27;s too hot, I just set it with a powder..and that&#x27;s it...I love this BB cream and see myself using it for a long long time...</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing, has pink undertone but oxidizes to my color which is a natural tan .. Around A nc30 or nc35</li>
    <li> I love this product. I get so many compliments on my skin.  It really covers the unevenness of my skin without looking thick or cake like. My skin is not breaking out as much. I&#x27;m on my second tube.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to completely revamp my facial routine. And giving up foundation and swapping for a BB cream was harder than expected. Since I am hesitant on buying products I can&#x27;t try myself I had o trust the reviews and YouTube. Luckily I for this! The coverage amazing and the benefits are too! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great BB cream! I like the texture and the natural color. I bought it at Amazon, and recent bought it again during a trip to Korea. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not Asian, but I have olive skin tones due to my Greek heritage. When I first used this it seemed thick compared to the BB creams I&#x27;m used to -- but it soon blended well and felt super-light throughout the day. It matched my skin perfectly and also offered more coverage than similar products -- I even put some on my chest to cover some redness, and it looked amazing.</li>
    <li> Background: Let me tell you about my skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a single line or wrinkle, remarkable for my age. But I still break-out, pimple scars last decades (feels like that but is probably a few months) and my skin tone is very uneven. If I don&#x27;t wear a moisturizer, I look dry and parched. If I wear one, I will look like an oil slick in 20 minutes after walking under the hot sun. So for me, a product has to not just even my skin out, but stay somewhat matte, not break my skin out, stay put despite my long morning commute and provide some sun protection (did I mention I tan unevenly and often end up with a brown nose and beige cheeks? Oh yes, I do). I used to wear a tinted moisturizer with SPF by an iconic brand (Famous for their primer) This would melt off by 8 AM, and would make my normal sized pores look like someone pricked me with many pins. I could deal with this in winter because I could use mineral makeup on top of it, but in summer, I simply couldn&#x27;t stand the slick, heavy feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Tone: I am MUFE #153, and someone who has long resisted BB creams in spite of being impressed by their credentials because I am South Asian (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh) and many of us differ remarkably from South East Asians (BB cream territory) when it comes to hue. I have mild yellow tones, but would be called a neutral by most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: The first time I applied this (with a foundation brush), I was HORRIFIED. My skin looked like I had dipped it into a vat of arrowroot. I went to find my kid to spook him, but by the time I found him, something strange happened. That bright white cast now looked like my skin. My skin *if* it had been more radiant, even toned, soft, semi-matte, sure, but not that ghostly ghastly color it was. Airbrushed would be a great descriptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST IMPORTANT TIP: If you choose to apply, dot your face lightly with the cream, and blend nicely to just below your jawline with a brush (my preference) or fingers and *wait for 5-10 minutes*. Your face will look nothing like it did when you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: My skin has stayed calm since I used it, no brown nose/beige cheeks situation (in fact have not tanned anywhere this cream went), no oiliness (my skin becomes vaguely semi matte and easily blotted) even after my daily 2x30 minute daily commutes in the blazing summer sun. I can&#x27;t discern any smell, it doesn&#x27;t settle in lines, it doesn&#x27;t feel tight, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, hell it doesn&#x27;t feel I have anything on, but my skin still feels comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I am in awe that a product can do all that. Take a look at other  reviews, especially on youtube to get a sense of what shade you should be ordering. If you are very pale, or very dark, maybe BB creams won&#x27;t work for you from a color perspective. But if you are anywhere from creamy sand/beige, to mid brown, there is probably a shade from Missha that is worth a shot.ference) or fingers and *wait for 5-10 minutes*.

    <li> I have oily skin, so I usually don&#x27;t reach for this BB cream since it&#x27;s a little too dewy for me, but I imagine this would be great for those iwth normal or dry skin. Shade #27 is actually a little dark for me (I&#x27;m MAC shade NC25) but it&#x27;s GREAT to mix with lighter BB creams if they&#x27;re too ashy or cool-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself, this BB cream is surprisingly high coverage and has a dewy finish. It covers my large pores very well and can be applied simply with your fingers, so no fancy brushes are needed. I LOVE the squeeze-y tub packaging mixed in with a pump nozzle because it&#x27;s both functional and easy to travel with. (It doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as hard, plastic tubes.)</li>
    <li> Great product as always</li>
    <li> I received this product in a Glossybox and loved it.  Found the best price here on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Amazing coverage and moisturizing for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is just what I was looking for: great coverage, matches my skin color, longwear. I bought one to see if it would work for me, I ended up buying another one two days after just in case they run out of product. Its that good!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time. I use NC35 / NC37 from MAC and the #27 it is perfect for my skin color. I have very oily skin and works perfect for my type of skin, specially in south Florida weather.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this BB cream.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just amazing.i love it 😃</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Saw it on a beauty blog and it lived up to every expectation!</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail for 2014. I love it,  best bb cream, perfect coverage, perfect for winter and sumer, fall, spring. 100% recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately there aren&#x27;t a lot of brands that cater to different skin colors except Missha so I&#x27;m extremely happy about this. I wear an NC42 in MAC&#x27;s Studio Fix powder, #153 in MUFE HD foundation, and Honey Beige in Maybelline&#x27;s 24/7 foundation. I had to watch a few Youtube videos, look at color swatches on websites and read various customer reviews before I decided to purchase this BB cream in honey beige because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should go with this one or their darkest color golden beige. If you&#x27;re having a hard time deciding what color to order I suggest you do this before purchasing. I&#x27;m glad I ordered the honey beige because at first when I put this cream on it was way lighter than the color of my face but fortunately for me this ended up being a plus because my face is originally darker than the rest of my body so this ended up matching my face to the rest of my neck and chest without looking ghostly. Also you have to read the packaging because it says to finish or set the cream with powder. I use Loreal True Match powder also in honey beige to finish off the look of the bb cream and it worked out just perfect. I say this because previous reviews I&#x27;ve read complain that the coverage is awful and that this bb cream makes them oily. This is not full coverage and it&#x27;s not a foundation so please keep that in mind. BB creams in general are compared to tinted moisturizers and also like a primer but with a whole lot more added benefits and renews the skin. If you want more coverage then I highly recommend finishing off with a powder that adds to the coverage. For the oily complaints, I use the Loreal True Match powder &amp; Too Faced Primed &amp; Perfect powder to control the oil. I use all three and I have completely oily skin and this actually got me through a 10 hr work days with having to blot once or twice during the day and that was it. I was really impressed. But what really impressed me was how my face still looked good after a long days work. My $40 full coverage foundation doesn&#x27;t even do that and I would have to blot my face still. I&#x27;ve experimented with this bb cream for a week and this is what works for me. I&#x27;ve had to experiment different powders as well so definitely experiment as well once you&#x27;ve found the right Missha color that you can work with.</li>
    <li> Excellent color match but makes me too oily :( then again I have oily combo skin so perhaps it&#x27;s the right side of dewy for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Use this with No 23 to get right shade</li>
    <li> This product is really great! It&#x27;s not super dewy like most Korean be creams and the color fit me perfectly. It has a nice medium coverage that can also be build-able if needed. Really recommend anybody to try Missha bb creams!</li>
    <li> Simply a great BB cream. I use it everyday as my base.  Perfect coverage, great price, lasts on face all day.  I&#x27;m on the third tube and got my 85 year old mom to use it too. The color is perfect for my skin tone,  Must wear moisturizer under it and try not to get it in the eyes as it  irritates my eyes.  But so does most products. I would like to try other Missha products also.</li>
    <li> I bought this BB cream after loads of research on the best brands. I have sensitive, combination skin that darkens easily-- finally settled on this after seeing that it had color to match my more natural tan skin as well as SPF. I found many other BB creams had only one set color (light) which, on my skin, would end up looking gray or pale. Being an NC35 from MAC, this BB cream was perfect for my skin tone-- not too light, or dark, blended perfectly and best of all looks natural. It&#x27;s light, easy, and gives great cover. I absolutely love it! Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of its dewy finish. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a humid environment or like my moisturizer still hasn&#x27;t been absorbed. I live in a rather dry place with a high altitude, so I suppose the finish is just something I am not used to. That aside, it is still a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice light to medium coverage, very buildable and has high spf which makes it perfect for bright Australian summers. The shade (honey beige, no. 27) is yellow based so it may not look very natural on pink undertone skinned ladies. For Mac lovers out there, the shade is somewhere between NC30-NC33. The finish is a bit shiny but nothing a loose powder or mattifying powder can&#x27;t take care of. Due to the high spf content this product will not photograph well (the spf reflects flash photography and casts a white, greyish tint over the skin in photos). However, an overall great, practical product for everyday.</li>
    <li> I have a medium tan skin tone and this is perfect for my color. The coverage is remarkably good for a BB cream. It lasts all day on my oily skin. It has a nice fragrance to it, it is strong, but pleasant. I do have to set this with a powder and repowder my T-zone halfway throughout the day. I do wish they had darker shades as I barely squeaked by with their darkest shade.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good BB cream. Very thick! I have a naturally oily complexion, but it doesn&#x27;t add too much oil to my face. I occasionally mix this with a moisturizer so that it blends better into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first application, it feels a bit heavy. It has a grey tinge to it, so you&#x27;ll look a little washed out. After a while, it changes to a more flattering tone. I prefer to use this for the evenings since it compliments cool shades of eye shadows more than the warmer. A little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll run out, but it still feels like more than half a bottle after half a year of moderate usage (3-4 times/week).</li>
    <li> After trying several of the popular Korean brands and finding that most of them are for cooler skin tones (often leaving a pinkish cast) I was thrilled to find a Korean brand that offered variety in base colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first impression, #27 is definitely yellow-toned. Dark, even (well, it seemed that way for my light-to-medium olive (tans easily) complexion). However, because my skin has yellow undertones in it, I figured I would still try. Putting it on my fingers, it was definitely darker than my skin. HOWEVERRR...once it was fully smoothed on, it blended SO WELL with my coloring. Perfectly, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a little thicker than your standard foundation, mind you (I use my fingers to put it on, just as I would a sun screen or moisturizer, because I want my skin to absorb it well), but the consistency is SMOOTH and melts onto my face easily, creating a pretty canvas for artwork (make-up). It also leaves a slightly dewy (but not greasy) look which is lovely (in my opinion). As for coverage, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s definitely medium finish which evens out my skin tone and makes my skin look smooth, like a good primer would (I use one from Philosophy and the Missha BB cream provides the same effect with additional benefits). Now, it&#x27;s not full-coverage enough to conceal dark circles, but it IS enough to provide a nice base for my concealer to do its work on a primed canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I set it with a powder (Nyx&#x27;s powder foundation, using a large, fluffy powder brush for just a light sweep all over) and love the way my face looks when done. In fact, my mom noticed the difference right away today; said that my face looked \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; (which is pretty damn terrific as I&#x27;m 39 years old). I&#x27;m convinced that the BB cream makes all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! And one more thing...my skin feels amazingly SOFT since using it. All day, every day.</li>
    <li> Works perfect with light brown skin. I am Indian but I have lighter skin and this BB cream looked perfect on me. It matched my skin tone very well and blended perfectly. I highly recommend this. Only caveat is that it can make your skin look a little dry so make sure you hydrate properly and apply a setting spray if needed.</li>
    <li> ok - didn&#x27;t blend into skin well on it&#x27;s own, had to use it with facial lotion - once I figured that out it looks great.</li>
    <li> First, I always prefer Korean BB creams to Westernized BB creams. Always. Out of all the Korean BB creams I&#x27;ve tried, Missha offers the best coverage and it does not irritate my skin. I&#x27;m a bit on the tan side and I brown very easily in the summer so I mainly use #27 (which is a yellowish tone more than pink, imho) during spring/autumn/winter seasons. The cream itself is a bit thick so I would caution not to use too much. A little goes a long way - giving nice coverage and not too much of a heavy feeling. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very oily skin as the cream is heavy and may make you look even more greasy. I have oily skin but it&#x27;s nothing some translucent setting powder wouldn&#x27;t fix. :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does not bother me at all but it does have a lingering almost floral scent to the cream. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the pump. You lose a lot of product once you start running out (which for me was around almost a year until my bottle ran out) because the squeeze pump can&#x27;t get all of the stuff out. At that point I cut the bottle with scissors and put it in a little container pot so I can easily use the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shade and even though it looks a bit orange when you pump it out, it blends beautifully! I have very oily and sensitive skin and it does wonders!!</li>
    <li> Firstly shipping was very fast which is always appreciated :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I don&#x27;t like wearing too much makeup but still like some coverage this cream did exactly that for me.  Less than a pea size covers your entire face with a nice amount of coverage so it lasts a long time.  I put it on and brush powder over and I&#x27;m ready to go which is perfect for people who are always in a rush.  It even smells so lovely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color blends beautifully into the skin.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard for me to find a good shade especially in bb creams since im indian and Portuguese. But this color blended perfectly with my skin. Love love love this product and will be buying it again!  :)</li>
    <li> This is my go to Foundation for everyday wear. I have olive medium skin tone and 27 is a perfect match. The high SPF and it&#x27;s fantastic coverage are my two favourite things about this BB Cream. It&#x27;s hard to find a brand that matches or out does these aspects. I apply using my fingers or a stipple brush for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Medium buildable coverage - hides freckles, any redness and under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;- High SPF, great for those like me who get burnt in 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- No scent&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts 6 hours without powder, or 8+ with powder to set&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t move into lines or dry areas&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive. Perfect to buy from amazon&lt;br /&gt;- Hygienic, convenient pump packaging&lt;br /&gt;- No grey cast people complain about with some BB creams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- High SPF &#x3D; white out in photographs&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t like perspiration - so take some oil blotching papers with you and your problem is solved&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to find color match, trying to see only online pictures</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it changes to grey after minutes !</li>
    <li> This is a great product that actually does what it says with the added benefit of matching my skin color and also smells wonderful! I don&#x27;t know of any other product that is true to its words as this. I&#x27;ve had to settle with prescriptives and bareminerals after a very long time of searching for the right skin color and now I&#x27;ve found even more than what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t have dark skin...my skin is actually very light and I did fear that it may be too dark but base on the reviews on #23, I opted for this one and am glad I did! The color actually has gold undertones so it fits in and blends in with my skin color perfectly. For asians, I&#x27;ve found that this is very important because if the foundation doesn&#x27;t have this, it tends to finish with that \\&quot;pinkish\\&quot; color in which you can clearly see the mismatch in the neck and face. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and I hope you&#x27;ll be as lucky as I am with this product!</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought 2. I use it during the day but is also a great cover wear for night (just add a second coat for more coverage). Matches my yellow neck</li>
    <li> This BB cream looks wonderful! I bought this in two different shades, one for summer when I&#x27;m tan &amp; one for winter in a lighter shade! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great coverage. Stays on all day and did not need to touch up at al! I recommend this to everyone with oily to combination skin.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend uses this almost everyday.</li>
    <li> I always loved the look of BB cream and with all the great reviews I&#x27;ve seen, I was dead set on buying some for myself. Unfortunately there&#x27;s a severe lack of shades for people with tan skin tones. (BB creams usually look pink or gray) I heard about no. 31 but I was reluctant to try it because it seems too red/orangey for my olive/yellow Filipino skin. Later, I found out about no. 27 which was definitely YELLOW so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, it worked wonderfully! It doesn&#x27;t match my skin perfectly, but it is very close. To fix this, I just put on a bit of powder foundation on top of it. It feels so weightless on my skin and as soon as I put it on, I could tell my face looked clearer and brighter. The coverage is light-medium and it doesn&#x27;t cover my dark circles so I still have to use concealer, but that&#x27;s no problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (hence the 4 stars) is that I normally have very oily skin, and since this BB cream leaves a dewy finish, it looks very shiny on me...very quickly. This happens EVEN when I wear oil control primer and finishing powder. It doesn&#x27;t bother me though because I&#x27;m used to blotting often. It shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for people with normal or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue my wait for a similar shade with a MATTE finish/oil control! :)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product :(.  My skin tone is olive with yellow undertones (Asian) and it was still too light for me and made me look pasty.  I have very oily skin and was hoping that the BB cream would have a mattifying effect but no such luck.  It only gave me light coverage and you can still see dark spots underneath.  Finally, did did not help even out my skin texture, which made my skin look uneven.  I&#x27;m sticking to my Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> This has a great consistency and feels lightweight. Offers full coverage but does not last all day. Honey 27 is appropriate for some around NC 35/37. I&#x27;d recommend mixing a primer with it before applying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I hate using foundation and this bb cream works wonders for a flawless look! This one was a little too dark for me.. But hey.. summer is almost here!  Best bb cream I&#x27;ve tried for sure! Texture, coverage, packaging  etc... 100%</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It goes on light, but with great coverage and a matte finish. A little goes a long way. Perfect for someone with lighter olive skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream. it fists my complexion perfectly and has great coverage. I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I ordered this BB cream over a year after getting into BB creams. I have yellow undertones and I would say I&#x27;m about an NC 35 in MAC terms so it was kinda hard for me to find a BB cream that really works and looks good. I used The Etude House BB cream #3 for a about a year before ordering the Missha #27. The Etude House one was lovely and provided good coverage, but it still did washed me out and made me kinda look ghostly. BUT the #27 is a whole other story. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s definitely a step up from what I was using. Let me start with the texture. This BB cream has a beautiful, smooth, creamy texture that glides on your face. Some may say it&#x27;s too creamy, but I disagree; I think it feels lovely on my face. It also has a pleasant smell. It doesn&#x27;t have strong coverage, but it has enough to give my face one cohesive color and cover up red marks. I even use it under my eyes to conceal my bags. It&#x27;s not as strong as a concealer, but it still gets the job done. Overall, I see myself ordering another one as soon as the one I have runs out (which seems like it&#x27;s going to be sooner rather than later).</li>
    <li> Bought the natural beige for me an this one for my niece. We are both in love with this product. Don&#x27;t know what we would do without this.</li>
    <li> This provides great coverage, but frankly I&#x27;m worried about the ingredients.  It does not wash off with make-up remover.  I have to also use soap twice to remove it.</li>
    <li> I had previously used the #23 of the same brand and loved it, had no problems until summer came around and my face and body turned too tan for it to look natural. So I ordered this shade, and am still very pleased with the results it gives. It looks very natural on my face. The shipping was super fast too!</li>
    <li> This bb cream actually matches my skin tone! I have the hardest time finding makeup products that do and this one matches perfectly. It also last like no other bb cream or foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, even without primer. Which is hard to do for other beauty product due to my oily skin. There is one letdown, this product tends to be on the shinier side, but I still give it 5 stars since this is easily taken care of with some setting powder. All in all this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it and this is her 3rd time repurchasing it. Nice coverage, a little too think sometimes. It has a neutralizing grey tone to it which I like so then you can use blush and bronzer to get the perfect shade you want that you can rarely get from using only foundations.</li>
    <li> i am and Nc35 this shade is more like a NW than a NC I liked using this over the winter time though it kept my face hydrated at all times! its very creamy not heavy at all and it calms my acne:) ~</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream! It feels light on your face and lasts all day. Looks great with a soft pink blush and mascara and pretty pink lipstick and your ready to go! Very natural. Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Really perfect bb cream</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have a hard time matching to my skintone because I&#x27;m cool, but also olive-toned and usually light skinned (I also use Make Up For Ever shade 117 to give an idea) and this stuff really matches me.  It oxidized quite well.  I do have a little summer color now and I really hope this still works in the winter for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and LOVE IT! With a primer it literally stays on all day :-) I have been wanting to skip out on foundation completely and want to use something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; for my skin. A lot of people say it goes on thick. Honestly I have put on A LOT heavier foundations and this is definately on the lighter end. I use either my ELF stipling brush or my hands to blend it and it blends in beautifully. A little goes a very long way. I have asian skin with a little neutral to warm undertones and the #27 works great! It is a tad light but I go over with a bronzer and works just fine. Looks yellow once you pump it out but not top yellow once you put it on your face. It does not make me oily if I use a blotting powder. This is a GREAT product and I will definately be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> The package came on time. I love the coverage because it&#x27;s medium to high bUT still look natUral on the face. Ithe doesnt feel heavy on the skin. I feel lIke i dI&#x27;d nof wear aNY thing on the face.. I don&#x27;t  have  to use concealer  to cover up my acne and acne scar.  Its  a perfect match on my skin. I ordered honey beige no.27 I would definitely  buy this BB cream again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product over the last couple of years and like it.  However, if you want to cover the blemishes, you will need to apply a thicker amount to hide them.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite BB cream!  It looks so natural while giving me an even tone.  It has sunscreen built-in. I will be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> Love this BB Cream great cover, lasting and good for the skin</li>
    <li> fast shipping, very good package</li>
    <li> However, the staying power deteriorates quite quickly, settling into the creases of one&#x27;s face and making the skin look greasy.  It does have a light baby powder smell too.</li>
    <li> Love it alot even out my skin...sucks bc i bought the wrong shade it was too yellow for me but mix it with my lighter foundation and it still works wonder ;)...i think i bought the shade honey beige....not sure but yes ♡♡♡ !!</li>
    <li> despite having my acne go into remission I Still get occasional pimples here and there and I still have very mild acne scars. I got tired of having red inflammation all over my face so I decided I would try the name brand BB cream from the drug store , wrong, I brought it home and not only did  I get a grey tint but it was crusty and Iooked gross. I then decided I would try a Korean BB cream and I can&#x27;t say enough about it , it is easy to apply ( as a guy I had no getting used to ) you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing make up , completely evened out my skin tone and reduced all redness to almost none, also very easy to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Great product for a male who suffered from redness on his face, will be buying a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am African and Caucasian mixed but a little on the lighter side, this product is perfect for now but I may need to go to no.31 come summer.</li>
    <li> I been using this BB cream for 5 yrs, no BB cream on the market can compared to this, I have tried Dior, Clinique , Bobbie Brown it not the same</li>
    <li> I ordered shade 23 from the Missha US website directly and while the color was ok, the tone was not.  It was gray, even after waiting 30 minutes, which made my skin look unhealthy.  I was going to give up because I thought the 27 would be too dark, but it actually does work on my skin tone.  When I swatched it on the back of my hand and rubbed it in, it did look quite orange and too dark for me.  Maybe I just had too much on my hand because when I applied it to my face, the color was much better: not as dark and yellow rather than orange.  For color reference, I wear ELDW foundation in Tawny (3Wl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this has anti-wrinkle and whitening ingredients. I haven&#x27;t seen any results from them yet, but I also haven&#x27;t been using this very long mainly because color 23 made me look unhealthy.  The only problem that I have with this BB cream is that it does make my face a little oily and by the end of the day my forehead looks bad.  I&#x27;m experimenting with primers and setting powders to fix this for the summer, but I know in the winter this will be perfect because my skin gets so dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after I had used a trial sized one, in the same colour, and when I finally got to use the filled sized one the colour was a bit darker. I am currently mixing my cc cream with this bb cream to adjust the colour to match my skin tone. So just a little heads up.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I use after my daily moisturizer. Fantastic SPF 42 coverage. While I notice a lot of friends my age with sunspots on their faces, I barely have any. I have been using Missha for over three years. It blends well into the pores, much better than the holika holika aqua petit jelly bb cream I bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Missha Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 for a few years. I really like it and continue to use it. But why #27 is way too expensive comparing to the #23??????? :(</li>
    <li> This bb cream did a good job at covering up blemishes and uneven skin tone.  I feel that it lasts for almost the whole day of wearing. The consistency of cream is thicker than most foundations i have had.</li>
    <li> This is great product to hide blemish and acne when you are going on a date or interview. I originally bought to look more professional when I go on interviews...But I started using it when I go on dates too. I have found a girlfriend and I thank partially to this cream. Hahaha. My girlfriend said she can&#x27;t notice it that I am wearing BB cream. I don&#x27;t wear it too often though. I am too lazy to take off makeup everyday....I am a guy after all.</li>
    <li> The tone is a little light for me but the product is of good quality and I was able to find my right match later on.</li>
    <li> While searching for the correct shade of bb cream since they are too many, i was looking for one that would look exactly like my skin tone, one that looks natural. i found all of those things w/ this. it is smooth and blends perfectly w/ my skin giving me  what i was looking for. i researched what number would be perfect for my daily basis foundation, while reading someone post a comment, about how the MAC NC30-40 matched missha bb cream #27.</li>
    <li> My everyday BB cream. Great coverage, goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! The best BB Cream ever! My skin is oil and it was perfect, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Missha BB Cream is fine but for me, it shows more wrinkles and making surface of my skin even more dented but apply a tiny bit, really a bit, and using a small brush to control where you apply, like concealer, helped to make my face look somewhat flawless. It blended well with fingers after. It takes a lot more time for oldies to look fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I thought I needed some finishing powder, my choice was Yellow Veil powder, and bronzer and this Honey Beige worked for my skin, light to medium olive-red tone.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. ..I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles and it is by far my favorite.  It is moisturizing and full coverage. Doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines or dry out my face. I do use a powder to set it since it does contain spf it can get a little oily looking. .. but all the moisture has been great for my skin.  It is much cheaper than the HD foundation I used for years prior.  I&#x27;ll be using this kind for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, specially if you have dark spots due to sun damage. It not only protects you face but it actually reduced and erases the dark spots.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The coverage is great, no need for anything else. Also the High SPF means no additional sunscreen required.</li>
    <li> Best BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried so far... The coverage is amazing and it makes you look flawless... Plus you get all the BB benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!!! You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite BB cream thus far, I&#x27;m actually on my second one and have to buy another one soon. It blends well with my skin tone and I am more of a light tan color, so I always order NO. 27.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the best BB Cover there is for the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this BB cream from ShopDeal and once I received it- I can tell its not authentic! The cap can be unscrewed and it smells like baby powder. I have used Missha BB creams before and this is not it! I am returning this for a ful refund. Just as a warning- this BB cream may not be the real thing...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian with medium yellow toned skin. Only shade 13 to 23 available here in Asia, which are too light for my complexion. I&#x27;m so happy that I could finally get this product.    I&#x27;m NC30 in MAC and this shade 27 matches me very well. Compared to the lighter shades of this Missha bbc line, shade 27 is more yellow toned (not yellow enough to match my skintone perfectly though). It also has no greyish effect, unlike the lighter shades.  The reason I take 1 star off is because of its matte finished. That accentuates the appearance of my early fine lines. The lighter shades of this bbc that are sold in Asia have glowing effect. Why this one doesn&#x27;t?   All in all, I like this bb cream, but I wish it could have more glowing effect. Maybe I should try to mix it with little moisturizer next time.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this BB cream from a co-worker. I was a little skeptical at first bc I normally will not spend over $8 bucks on a make up product. Plus I have really sensitive skin. Well I took a leap and absolutely love it! It&#x27;s easy to apply. I just rub it on like lotion. It&#x27;s the lightest thing you&#x27;ll ever wear. It blends really nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I love the product; just wish there were a few more color options.</li>
    <li> good product fast shipping color is a bit off but still good</li>
    <li> I like the coverage and the fact that it has high spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is very perfumey and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It cover very well</li>
    <li> great !!! did not take long to get it. good job !!!</li>
    <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, this has come to replace foundation for me</li>
    <li> Broke me out. And too dark</li>
    <li> Perfect for my olive tone, color is PERFECT... I flip flop between a MAC nc35 and nc40, and this color blends beautifully. Soft supple skin, with just the right amount of coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it really does a good job covering up my blemishes.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve loved this BB Cream!</li>
    <li> postive  - good coverage  -fits a variety of skin tones (from light to dark: personally I have a medium olive skin tone)    negative  -ACNE (a bit too oily and heavy for acne prone skin)</li>
    <li> Use No. 27 for a winter makeup when I am pale.</li>
    <li> I love this product because of it&#x27;s ability to cover and does not dry my skin out in winter. Great for my mature skin....</li>
    <li> I love this BB Cream. I don&#x27;t like using &amp;#34;western&amp;#34; BB cream because it is all about making money. Korean BB creams is about quality while saving money. This BB cream has made my skin look tons better and gives better coverage. I have sensitive skin and this works very well and does not irritate it. The color is good too.</li>
    <li> I always have problem with skin care products because my skin is so sensitive. But this cream is no problem and keep me mat looks and no dry. I recommend this to everybody.</li>
    <li> I love the container and how easy to pump out the cream.  I am from Southeast Asian and I have tan skin.  I love how smooth the cream makes my face feels and it looks brighter.  Unfortunately, the color left my face gray.  The gray lessen as hours past but still noticeable.  I have oily skin and this product helps with shine even after 8 hours work day.  I will try number 31 this time around and I hope it matches better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with Skin79 Super+ Triple functions for comparison, and for my trip to 90+ degree weather Thailand. It surprisingly came in several days early! I have combination oily skin, and typically wear MAC NC35 - 40 (winter - summer) for reference. I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox &amp; Too Faced and both were too dry for me, but Missha feels GREAT against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely very nervous choosing the shade over the web, but after reading other reviews that provided powder matches, I settled on No. 27 Honey Beige -- and it&#x27;s a PERFECT match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly like the feel of Missha vs Skin79, but only slightly more, and I love the fact that Missha offers different shades. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first is that when I first put it on, it looked slightly orangey/tan against my skin, but as I rubbed it in it started to look more natural. I will definitely be trying out the Missha BB cream over the next couple of weeks during my trip to see how it holds up in hot weather! More to come later.</li>
    <li> this shade matches perfectly to my skin! most of bb creams out there in market have pinkish light skin tone, i tried other brands and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any darker shade yet. i am so glad missha decided to make one. i am asian but years of tanning in past (stupid me!!!) i am not super light. it goes on smooth, i will definitely recommend to some gals out there who have medium skin tone and has yellow under skin tone.</li>
    <li> This make my finally clear skin break out horribly.  I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had issues with MUFE, Laura Mercier, or Dior foundations.  I used this one time and had monster break out that took 3 weeks to control.  A lot of people love this, just double check the ingredients.</li>
    <li> one word.... PERFECT! Never found anything that matched my skin color so well!(I&#x27;m asian, so probably that makes the difference) It might be a bit oily on the \\&quot;T\\&quot; parts tho~ VERY SATISFIED! X)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of BB creams, especially the new drugstore brands that came out in North America, and hands down the Asian brands are so much better and works like how a BB cream is supposed to. Missha M Perfect Cover in No. 27 is almost a perfect match to my current skin tone. The fragrance is light and pleasant. It gives great coverage with one coat and I pretty much skip foundation and concealer, since it covers so well. I just set it with a loose powder. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy like the North American brands and it&#x27;s pretty long lasting. This line of BB creams is excellent as it has more than one color, unlike most Asian brands that only have one. The pump bottle is a plus, so it&#x27;s more hygienic. I love that it also has SPF 42 PA+++ built into the product. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good coverage BB cream.</li>

NC36 and this matches to the tone of my skin perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this I was using mineral powder foundation and Missha BB Cream creates coverage that no mineral powder foundation I have used can. I only use concealer on this one deep red scar on my face when I use Missha BB cream where as with my mineral powder foundation I had to use concealer everywhere so this BB cream really does offer good coverage. My mineral powder foundation didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing foundation but at the touch you can feel it, this thick texture. But with Missha BB cream it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation too and at the touch it feel really silky smooth and not thick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of people say that it minimizes their pores but it didn&#x27;t make my pores any less noticeable, they still looked the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump could be better, each pump give out a lot of product which I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s hard to control how much comes out and it becomes wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A glaring problem with this foundation is that it makes my forehead breakout and I&#x27;m already on four prescriptions to reduce my acne. Before I used this I didn&#x27;t have bumpy acne but afterwards I got a bunch and some deep skin acne. So if I am on four dermatology prescription and it was still able to make me breakout then odds are it might make someone else with sensitive skin have a major breakout too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do choose to get this remember to still do your daily skincare routine. Moisturize your face beforehand (even if you have oily skin) and wash this foundation off asap when you come home at the end of the day. This kind of foundation is not okay to wear for the whole day for reasons stated.</li>
    <li> very good bb cream for fair asian skin. blends well. looks great. not cakey. definately a buy! will buy again when i&#x27;m out. lighter than foundation. great cover up during the day for work or casual days.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, and while this doesn&#x27;t substitute as a moisturizer, it provides excellent, natural looking coverage over my oil moisturization treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m having a bad skin day I use a little bit of a mineral powder foundation on my cheeks where I have more hyperpigmentaition. Works well to set the BB cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I am an NC35, and this is a teeny tiny bit light, but with some bronzer it looks perfect.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream has great coverage, high SPF and does not make my skin oiler. This is my second purchase and I will keep repurchasing it, i just love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it! One needs only a little bit to make the skin brightened. But I don&#x27;t see the point of having the pump for a plastic tube. It&#x27;s much easier just to have a little cap and squeeze out. I found that the tube seems not full when new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using missha bb cream for years and it&#x27;s amazing on my skin. I always buy the 23 and 27 because my color fluctuates. Although it does set into your skin and blends in, California weather is unpredictable and I&#x27;ll get tan within days. Love the high spf and smooth application. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last!</li>
    <li> Clogs pores! Maybe its my skin but after a day of wearing this my pores are twice as large.</li>
    <li> This is now my go to &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;… it&#x27;s the perfect shade for my olive toned skin, and it feels nothing like makeup! Great coverage, good for your skin, makes my skin feel and look beautiful all day, and by all day I mean all day.. I work 7am-7:30pm! This is my second tube and I will continue to use this for as long as it is on the market!</li>
    <li> Works well when you need to rush out and don&#x27;t want to have &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; skin.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for (MAC) NC37 skin (I had my doubts before buying - see questions)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;But this is NOT full coverage and will show your dark spots. However, I have successfully concealed my pimples with this by applying a tad extra on the zit.&lt;br /&gt;Covers my redness and gives an evenness to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Might want to use some kind of powder on top.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy. Will buy again and will use again especially at this price.</li>
    <li> Felt too heavy for my skin.  Not what I was looking for and the color was not a good match.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Can&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
    <li> It didnt cover too well but it protected my skin! I guess i didnt get the full benefits of it because of my skin type but it works well!</li>
    <li> looooove it!!! (I&#x27;m an nc42 in mac) looks good and feels good ( if I&#x27;m tan this could be too light for me). The item arrived even earlier!</li>
    <li> Great product I love this particular brand compared to higher brands like benefit and urban decay. The only reason why I do give it  a 4 is if you look at the date it was made. They are sending you be cream made last year.  So once you receive it  better use it quickly. But the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t EVER review products but because I love this so much I think it deserves my first review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;m 30 y/o, Asian, my skin is oily, acne-prone, and sensitive with some from acne and some slight aging signs.  My skin color is about a NC35/40 in MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard so many good things about BB creams so I wanted to find the best one for me.  I also wanted to steer away from the traditional foundations because I wanted something that actually faded my acne scars instead of just covering it.  I&#x27;ve tried Clinique Age Defense BB Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 and Dr. Jart+ Water Fuse Beauty Balm SPF 25 PA++ based on reviews online and they did not work well for me at all.  Then I found this based on youtube reviews and it also helped me decide on the shade.  I&#x27;m a really low maintenance type of girl and I hate to spend too much time on my makeup.  All I want is something with a quick application process with good coverage that does not feel too heavy yet looks natural.  I hate having to use brushes and sponges because I get super lazy to do all that and I&#x27;m normally in a rush in the morning to get out the door for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this BB cream and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever try anything else.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now.  I use The Regimen from acne.org at night to control my acne breakouts.  When I wake up in the morning, I wash with The Regimen cleanser and tone my face with witch hazel toner, then I apply this BB cream and I&#x27;m ready to go!  The consistency is really nice and it goes on easily and super smooth.  I often get really oily on my T-zone mid-day but this BB cream has really reduced the oiliness.  I apply it with my finger tips just like a moisturizer; all you need is a pee-sized amount to apply.  It works great as a primer as well under powder foundation (I use Urban Decay Surreal Skin Mineral Makeup in Trance), which gives a completely flawless finish!  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my scars have faded!  It has really done wonders on my skin!  My acne has finally calmed down after using The Regimen and so I needed something to fade away the scars and this was it!  I can go on and on about how this BB cream is so great!  Love it!  A must try!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Bare Minerals foundation for about 5 years and wanted to try something different. I purchased this product because of all the positive reviews and thought it could possibly do wonders for my skin. The coverage is nice and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. This color was a little too light for me, but I used a slightly darker setting powder over it to match my skin tone. It looked great and had a matte finish for the first few hours, but after that it made my skin extremely oily. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and after a little over a week of using the BB cream my skin had broken out with small tiny bumps all over, which lead to even bigger breakouts. I continued to use it for almost 3 weeks thinking that my skin had to get used to the new foundation, but that was a big mistake. It has been a couple months since I stopped using the cream and my skin is still recovering. I don&#x27;t think the Missha BB cream is a bad product, just be careful if you easily breakout!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation. I&#x27;m about to order a lighter color for my pale winter skin.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using BB Cream after reading about several different brands!  The first time I used it, my husband said, &amp;#34;You look a little different, not sure what it is, but it looks good.&amp;#34;  It gives good coverage (not thick) but still very natural.  If I have to cover a red pimple, I do need to use an additional separate concealer.  I am Asian with tan skin, I do love the sun but I&#x27;m not super tan.  I was worried that this color might be too light for me but it was not and blends well.  I also use just about half a pump and gives me full coverage.  I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd tube now, first tube lasted a good six months!</li>
    <li> I have darker skin (south Asian) and a lot of BB creams are too light for me. This one is absolutely perfect. When I first out it on it looks a little strange but the color evens out and blends in perfectly after a few seconds. You also need a only a small pea sized drop, so one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried other BB creams that wouldn&#x27;t do justice. Missha M Perfect Cover is amazing! I don&#x27;t like wearing heavy make up therefore this product is a must, since its very light. With just a little BB cream my face looks really radiant and vivid. A product that I am definitely recommending to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup! It&#x27;s not too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout which is awesome since most makeup does. I have darker toned skin (I&#x27;m hispanic) and this makeup does not make me look too light/ grey and pasty as many other bb creams do. Plus, I get it in exactly three days every time! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sue Devitt&#x27;s Triple Seaweed Gel foundation (in Granite Downs) since 2005. It&#x27;s the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The company recently went out of business so I knew I needed to find a suitable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this BB cream in my wish list for quite a while now.  It was significantly cheaper than Sue Devitt&#x27;s so I finally decided to give it a try. The honey beige is a perfect match for my skin tone.  I like the way it feels like it melts into my skin. I use my finger tips to apply it just like my old foundation but the coverage is MUCH better.  I have a lot of redness in my cheeks and this covers like a champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; properties but after about a month of daily use I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  It does have a slightly dewey finish that can get a bit greasy. I use a mineral foundation on top which takes care of that and also provides a nice finish. This BB cream does not make me break out but I wouldn&#x27;t say it improved my skin at all.  Overall I like the product and will continue to use it in lieu of foundation.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time reading views before purchasing this bb cream. The Missha M bb cream covers better than all of the other bb creams I&#x27;ve tried at drugstores and mall beauty stores. I have not noticed that my face gets excessively oily with this product and I live in a humid, sweaty climate. The application is nice either using fingers or a stippling/foundation brush. If your skin is dry, I&#x27;d recommend moisturizing the dry patches or exfoiliating regularly to avoid any caking on dry skin. Shade number 27 is a perfect color match for tanned skin, and this shade does not have a chalky, grey hue as I&#x27;ve found in a lot of other Asain bb creams. I will definitely be repurchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I have a fair Indian complexion and I use it as foundation.</li>
    <li> the product itself was great but it was a bit darker than expected and had a really red undertone. im nc30-35 i think no. 23 would of been a better pick</li>
    <li> I was not very pleased with this BB cream. The color was extremely gray. I assumed it would blend in with my skin color after a few minutes but it remained looking very gray and very fake looking on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure whether the product would have improved my skin because the color was too far off for me to continue to wear.</li>
    <li> brightness control is very good, lasts all day, looks very natural, but does not cover acne scars and red zone</li>
    <li> Love it! I usually get no. 23 but decided to try 27 and it matches my color so much better! Fast shipping and great product! Will be doing business again soon!</li>
    <li> The only make up I use. The color is perfect for my olive skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage and good care, sweet, not too greasy, i&#x27;m very happy about this BB cream and I&#x27;ll buy again, it&#x27;s a shame that I can not find it in France...</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream! I&#x27;ve tried it in 23, which looked tad too pink on me, so I was delighted when they came out with 27. I&#x27;m a NC30-35, and it matches perfectly. This is more of a hydrating BB, so I use this as a moisturizer+SPF+concealer. I put on a hydrating toner, hydrating serum, skip moisturizer, then bb cream. I powder my t-zone and I&#x27;m good for pretty much the entire day. I&#x27;ve also used it with the Urban Decay makeup setting spray, and it lasts all through the night. As for coverage, this gives me medium natural coverage. Then again I dont have many blemishes, I could get away with just wearing undereye concealer, but I like the high SPF and simplicity of putting on BB cream in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Perfect BB cream for those days where you&#x27;re not really feeling foundation. Compared to the smash box bb cream, this product provides higher coverage. It leaves you with smooth skin and it looks very natural. Long lasting and great for those with yellow undertones.</li>
    <li> perfect for my skin tone. good coverage too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time picking out the right foundation, and ordering something online made me worry. However, after receiving this product, I was really surprised at how great it is on me. A bit of information: My skin tone is typical Filipina, moderately brown, or morena. It does apply a lighter shade, but oxidizes well and blends in smoothly. I love that it has SPF protection, and the whole bottle has lasted me quite a while. I&#x27;m currently ordering another one, it is the perfect base foundation for me. I wear it with or without make up, and it does an amazing job!</li>
    <li> First of all let me tell you that I don&#x27;t like makeup.  I&#x27;ve never liked the feeling of it on my skin-like it can&#x27;t breathe. Second of all I&#x27;ve had trouble with acne since I was 8 years old, and now that I&#x27;m 26 the acne has cleared pretty much, but my skin is still far from perfect.  Third of all my coloring is odd.  My father is Creole and my mother is Italian and I have neither of their coloring (olive and a dark caramel brown).  My skin has a definite yellow tint, much like Asians,  with a tendency to tan easily, which I don&#x27;t like to do (I just don&#x27;t like the sun beating down on me, never have even as a kid, NOT because I&#x27;m afraid of getting dark).  With all that said, this BB Creme is PERFECTION.  I throw it on in the morning and voila! Beauteous Me! It sits on my skin like a nice sunscreen- not &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but not heavy or cakey like all make up seems to me.  I have oily skin, and while I&#x27;m used to &amp;#34;being shiny&amp;#34; this this BB Creme makes a pleasurable shine rather than oily grossness.  If you&#x27;re like me, I highly recommend putting a light non-oily lotion on after washing your face and before putting on the Creme, it just goes on nicer and looks and feels better.  Last but not least, I swear my face FEELS better after using it for a good two 1/2 weeks now, which is more than I can say for other makeup I have tried.</li>
    <li> I use this as my everyday makeup and save the heavy stuff (MAC, MUFE etc) for special occasions. This feels light but provides enough coverage to even out my skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t provide the heaviest coverage on scars but you can layer a bit once it dries for better coverage. Regardless, I wanted to even out my skin tone and use it for light coverage so it works great for me. I was in Korea last year and tried to buy this while there but they didn&#x27;t have the No 27 in stock so the Missha BB creams I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon are all I have this to compare to and so far, the quality has been consistent.</li>
    <li> Looks perfect on my skin and quick shipping. This product is best on yellow skintones and it feels light and definitely not cakey. My go to product (: Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t in need of lots of face makeup but i still have lots of imperfections that I would like to cover up. This is my very very first BB cream that I tried. I looked up so many and I wanted to try an Asian one. It was reallllyyyyy hard to find a yellow-toned one since almost all asian brands have grey-tinted products. Well ya know, cause they&#x27;re on the pale/whiter side while I&#x27;m Hispanic so I&#x27;m more tanner. I&#x27;m not veryyy dark. I&#x27;m medium i guess. Well anyways I was hesitant to buy it from the seller.. since it could be fake but once I got it and used it i instantly FELL IN LOVE WITH IT! I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this for a long long long long time! Amazing coverage! Doesn&#x27;t come off easily at ALL! Which is great since i like to go dancing and i sweat buckkettsss. Idk about chlorinated water but even with regular water it doesn&#x27;t come off easily. Which is a bonus! It also has SPF! Gosh for my tan skin you don&#x27;t know how GREAT THAT IS! Anyways, i recommend buying this to anyone that asks! My sister tried it out since i left it in the bathroom and she is hooked! It&#x27;s SO inexpensive and worth EVERY PENNY! :)</li>
    <li> Great BB Cream I totally recommended this awesome coverage!!!</li>
    <li> You could wear this under foundation, but to be honest it&#x27;s a foundation in itself.  This color is a nice golden tone and I use it as a foundation and then put a light mineral powder over the top.  I use it over moisturized skin.  I have dry skin and this is not drying nor is it oily.  I think it would suit any skin type really, apart from someone with very oily skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
    <li> Loving this bb cream!!!!! I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation and what not buy this I can wear pretty much everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. I have skin that is EXTREMELY prone to breakouts. Every time I wear makeup I&#x27;m usually rewarded with a pimple the next day. Not so with this product! I can wear it all day and I never get any breakouts from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is smooth and easy to blend (I use a beauty blender to smooth it in). I have medium toned skin and it works perfectly for me. It easily lasts upwards 8 hours. The only con I can think of is that it does leave a slightly shiny finish. I either set this with some translucent powder, or I use an oil absorbing sheet on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good for someone who&#x27;s looking for more sheer and light coverage.</li>
    <li> This product performs consistently well.  I had been using the Missha BB cream starting in February and I unknowingly got a shade a tiny bit lighter than my actual skin color.  There were no stores in my area that carries it for me to try and see if it matches my skin.  But despite the shade difference, the bb cream adjust to your skin and doesn&#x27;t make your face a different shade than your neck.  I can get away with it pretty well during the winter and spring months.  However, when summer hit, I decided to try a shade darker... which is this one.  The cream is great, spreads very evenly and the consistency is smooth and does not require special applicator or technique.  Its perfect for a fresh dewy summer day look.  It makes your skin look even and smooth with a natural glow, even after several hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that I wish that there is an oil-free formula, I have oily skin and I do need to blot several times a day.  However, this is a problem that I have with most foundation/tinted moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was very hesitant to make this purchase since it is a Korean product and I wasn&#x27;t able to test it out.  However I am so excited that I made this purchase and will always keep this in my daily routine.  I was on BC for several years and developed those unattractive dark patches on my skin...nothing (not even fade cream) would get rid of this discoloration.  However after using this BBcream for 30days(off and on) my discoloration is pretty much gone.  I will advised to put it on at least 15mins before leaving your home because it takes a minute for the cream to settle (lose the ashy look)</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this BB cream. My friends and I are planning on stocking up in this product. My skin has evened out after a week of use and after a month my scars and dark spots have faded or even disappeared! Amazing product. Btw I&#x27;m NC35 in Mac and No. 27 is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This is the miracle product all women should try. It evens out skin, adds radiance, and is light. I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone. Most products do not control my oil zone- but this one does. I love it- and the spin off bb creams we have in the US do not in any way compare to the original Korean ones (of which this is one).  By far this one is superior. Moreover, it makes you look very good with minimal makeup- you enhance your looks rather than look too overdone :-).</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Cant go without it, It blends in so perfect with my skin and works like a moisturizer and covers all your imperfections without looking fake or flaky. Definitely recommend this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> An awesome BB cream, excellent coverage and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream I&#x27;m an NC40 in Mac and this matches me perfectly I don&#x27;t have to mix in any products to get the color right because it&#x27;s already done!!! I do still put on a moisturizer underneath because it goes on a lot smoother and a little bit goes a looooong way. Definitely recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this BB cream and so far Its been Perfect! I really enjoyed purchasing this!  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this product. Its a little thicker than I expected, but it is amazing. Gives me full coverage, just like foundation. The best part about this BB cream is the way it makes my skin feel AFTER I wash it off. Smooth and silky!! I love this BB cream!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely great purchase I made. Provides good coverage and it does improve your skin as well.</li>
    <li> I receive the bb cream within 2 weeks. The product give a great coverage with just 1 pump! I have been using it for a month and seen no difference to my skin type. I still get break out :( the colour match was perfect for me. I have yellow tone and it suited me fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy i bought this bb cream I wear it all the time. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> It took a lot of trial &amp; error to find the right BB cream and I finally found it in this one. I ordered a bunch of different sample packs so that I didn&#x27;t waste too much money trying to find the right shade. I am Pacific Islander with medium-tan yellow/olive undertones so it&#x27;s always been hard to match my color. But #27 is a match! At first, it seems too light but let it dry and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried even more BB creams and this is still the only one that looks natural. In the summer, I mix it with a little 31 for just a little more color when I&#x27;m tan.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not the real deal.  This product breaks up and looks disgusting. The real deal melts into the skin and looks amazing. Seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns. Surprise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. I have oily skin and I use it as my sunscreen/bb cream and put it on after I moisturize my face. I do wear MAC&#x27;s studio fix powder over it to provide just the right coverage for me. Most women don&#x27;t realize that you need to use 2 or sometimes 3 different shades of foundation to get a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; match for your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you simply can&#x27;t beat it. Totally worth it and I love it.</li>
    <li> The finish of this bb cream was very sticky and greasy looking. I have normal to dry very sensitive skin. I wore this today and now I have a swollen, bumpy, itchy face. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> It is so oily !!!! It looks terrible for who has oil skin!</li>
    <li> So far it is the best:)  I use to use &amp;#34;TheFaceShop Clean Face Oil Free BB Cream&amp;#34;, not any more.</li>
    <li> Great product it covers just as it states. The best I have used to date.</li>
    <li> Love the feel, and how it blends so naturally into my skin.</li>
    <li> This was a repurchase. Love it...good coverage without being Cakey.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and spread very well.  covers nicely, about a medium cover. however i do find the color tone to be a bit darker on my skin color, i&#x27;m a light yellow while the bb cream is more towards a light orange.  I will continue to look for a different cream hopefully it&#x27;ll match my skin more with good benefits too.  however this is a good alternative to the common pink tone creams you find everywhere</li>
    <li> My sister gave me one of these for my Christmas present. She said this is the only thing she wears everyday &amp; she looks great. So I tried it and fell in love with it, I ordered 2 more. I used to use Shiseido&#x27;s foundation, but this one provides so much better coverage without feeling heavy on the skin. And it costs less. It provides a perfectly light coverage. Like other reviewers have said, you need to wait a little bit and the lotion blends into your skin tone.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream matches my skin tone.  This makes me happy as a lot of Asian brands tend to cater to fairer skins. Good medium coverage and once applied it does not feel tacky or sticky.  It has good staying power, it lasts 8 hrs on me, longer if you apply powder finish.  The seller was helpful and shipped fast.  And, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of BB creams to try given it&#x27;s difficult to tell if the color will match my skin tone or not.  These include Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 The Oriental Gold, Missha M Perfect #23 and now Missha M Perfect #27.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have typical Asian skin tone, no sun tan but not pale. I do not normally wear any makeup.  #23 though has a gray tone but once put on and after 15 minutes, it actually blends in well with my skin color.  My daughter is more tanned so I got #27 Honey Beige mainly for her to try thinking the higher number means darker.  It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#27 is a bit thicker than #23 and a little does goes a long way.  However, it has a yellow tone in it and thus makes my already &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; skin more yellow and very unnatural looking.  The BB Cream by itself is ok - good coverage and stays on all day.  It just does not match my skin color.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews - I was concerned over color matching.  No. 27 works very well with MAC NC40 Studio Fix.  It is a nice medium coverage.  I still use concealer for under my eyes and on age spots.  I like the feel of this cream.  I do feel that it is helping in reducing &amp; preventing blemishes and correcting imperfections.  I like the SPF 42. I&#x27;ve tried numerous BB Creams and find that this one is more of what a BB Cream should be.  I still use an oil control primer for my t-zone and a smoothing primer for under my eyes.  This cream is a great compliment to my makeup routine.  Extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I&#x27;m glad I like above the other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried (Loreal youth code and loreal studio magic bb cream). It doesn&#x27;t break me out and I only need a pea size to cover my entire face. With a little bit of powder it&#x27;s great and fast. I give it only four stars as it doesn&#x27;t work too well on redness or acne scars. I have acne scars all over my cheeks and it barely covers them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a twenty something with combination skin with some residual acne scarring. I hate using foundation because it makes my skin break out and It looks blotchy and gross at the end of my day. I decided to try this BB cream because of the high reviews here, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. It has completely changed my skin for the better. It covers just fantastically, and it&#x27;s lightened my acne scars. Plus, since i&#x27;ve started using it, i&#x27;ve had zero breakouts! My skin is luminous and I get complements on it all the time. This is thick when applying, but it&#x27;s actually so thin and light on your skin that you look airbrushed. I might be crazy, but I also feel like it matches itself to your skin color. I got the #27 shade because is the only one I could tell looking online that is more &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; tinted, which my skin is, and it just magically blends into my skin like nothing has before. I&#x27;ve even been able to go days without any skin makeup for the first time in my life thanks to this fantastic skin product. It&#x27;s also resilient. I work in a fast paced and hard environment, and nothing but this has been able to withstand the crazy that is my job. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Not too thick or light.  Just right. Provides great coverage and smells good.  Cover with a little finishing power and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
    <li> the product has a very nice coverture, good quality and the seller sent it to me so fast!&lt;br /&gt;the color has a yellowish under tone and it&#x27;s suitable for NC35</li>
    <li> This is not the real Missha BB cream I think this is American Version of Missha BB cream the real Missha BB cream is Korean and is really good for your skin but this one is just take foundation.. Very disappointed 😔😒</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream on the market. I have tried several and love the coverage. You  do not fee as if you are wearing foundation but you have the look!!</li>
