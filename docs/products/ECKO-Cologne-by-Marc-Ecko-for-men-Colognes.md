      <li>lucky for me</li>
      <li>It has a subtle but nice top-note hint of sweet licorice, which works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend the Ecko Blue over the original any day of the week as that scent makes much more of an impression.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did smell at all! Thats right was like water in bottle - and guess what - Amazon wont let you do returns on glass bottles - I go beat for 30$ - Beware</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily agree it&#x27;s a younger scent either. in fact, it smells nearly identical to a classic/obscure fragrance called DeRothschild. It&#x27;s a clean-smelling, sophisticated scent with plenty of depth.&lt;br /&gt;Ecko isn&#x27;t exactly a celebrity either, he&#x27;s a designer of contemporary urban fashion. While I don&#x27;t particularly care for his lines of clothes, this fragrance is spot on; much different than other scents on the market.</li>
    <li> Ordered it late on the 11th(when i saw there was free shipping) and its arrived on the 13th!!! Thumbs up amazon and fragrancenet.Got the cologne because i like the brand and the packaging (thought it would make a great present at this price). I came to know about this cologne when i saw a 1.7oz gift pack version for $24 at Tjmaxx.The 5 stars in the reviews and $25 for 3.4oz forced me to order it immediately. Absolutely loved the fragrance so i am keeping it for myself and highly recommending it too! The fragrance itself is subtle,relaxing and expensive smelling (agree with the Acqua di gio analogy).</li>
    <li> Came within the promised time frame and was what I expected</li>
    <li> I was shopping on black friday for a cologne for my man and ran across this mark ecko, I loved it it has a great smell but it was kinda pricey. I went home mad at myself for not buying it, I checked out Amazon and found the same item for half the price so of course i ordered it. It smells kinda like the first Sean John but its still a great buy and my man loves it.</li>
    <li> I liked the price of it and also got it for my Dad for Christmas. Never even smelled it before, when he opened it and sprayed it on him and walk around the house I smelled it and it was really good. Ill probably buy another bottle for myself because it smelled really good!</li>
    <li> First off Ecko by Marc Ecko is a brand new fragrance just introduced in 2009, and it is the first fragrance from Marc Ecko. Second off it&#x27;s a \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrance along the lines off Sean John, Usher, Britney Spears etc etc. So with that in mind I wasn&#x27;t expecting this fragrance to be as good as it is. I really enjoy this fragrance and I know people around enjoy smelling it on me. It is a really clean fresh scent kind of like an Acqua di gio. (I have a review of that too). This is more of a younger scent for someone in college or high school even. With it being a light scent its not recommended for fall/winter wear, but more for the spring or summer. Very clean and fresh, won&#x27;t offend anyone.</li>
    <li> exceptional value!! lucky for me</li>
    <li> I received my product on time and the product was very good and its the real deal</li>
    <li> Get it, this Marc Ecko cologne smells great - and you only need a few squirts.  It&#x27;s potent stuff!  It seems to last a while too.</li>
    <li> I never wear cologne, as most of them don&#x27;t smell great on me. They&#x27;re always good on the tester paper, but something with my chemistry doesn&#x27;t agree with them. My favorite is very expensive ($180 online), so I was looking for a much cheaper alternative after I finally ran out. I ordered this one after trying it in a store. It actually clicks with me, and I&#x27;ve received a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert on describing scents, but the first thing that comes to me is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;light\\&quot;, definitely works as a day-time fragrance. I work with the public and stand close to hundreds of people a day, so subtlety in a cologne is important to me. One 6-8 inch spray on my lower neck, and I&#x27;m perfect for the whole day without it ever being too strong. The same spray with similar scents ended up being too strong on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your results will vary, but I figured I&#x27;d post a review from the perspective of someone with skin that seems to amplify fragrances too much.</li>
    <li> This has a great scent. Women love it. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;8 , 250 lbs&lt;br /&gt;And it stays with me. I use less compared to cheap stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again</li>
    <li> The cologne itself is amazing. Never smelt a better cologne before (besises acqua di gio). This is far cheaper than that cologne though. I purchased this as a gift though, and especially since it says it is Prime eligible, I KNEW that I would have it in time with free 2-day prime shipping. The then told me though that it would have to be shipped standard shipping which wasnt a deal breaker, but still sucked. Standard shipping would have been 3-5 business days. They have now told me though that the orders estimated delivery date is 13 days from the time that I ordered the item. This is rediculous, considering the product is advertised as \\&quot;prime eligible\\&quot;. The cologne gets 5 stars! Amazon&#x27;s advertising of this prime eligible product gets 1 star. Customer service was of no help either when I attempted to inform them that the product was advertised falsely as being &#x27;prime eligible&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you dont mind waiting 2 weeks for your order, then I definitely recommend ordering this great cologne at a great price!</li>
    <li> I went to the local retail store to find a new brand I liked but their price was too high.  I looked on Amazon.com and found the same product for almost half the price.  Received the product in a timely manner an I&#x27;m very satisfied with the service I received.</li>
    <li> Best cologne i smelt by far great price i love how it smells plus it do not fade off like others its great</li>
    <li> I like this scent because its fresh and not to heavy with hints of citrus. I&#x27;m glad I can purchase this on amazon and accrue points!</li>
    <li> My son loves this line</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this cologne, and I&#x27;ve actually purchased it before buying it through Perfumania (but their price was the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.) I get multiple compliments on this cologne, and if I have any complaints my only problem is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long in intense heat, but then again what fragrance does?  Either way, for the price of a large bottle I can afford to spray liberally and reapply as needed.</li>
    <li> being that I do not care for overwhelming colognes with strong fragrances, I found Ecko to be very sublte. A very good deal for the price ($20.00)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day! I have always loved the scent of this cologne but the dept stores weren&#x27;t selling it, only the blue one. I like the Blue one but its a bit stronger than this one. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. Its a very SEXY scent!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  No bad odor or out of date smell of anything.  His favorite &amp; mine :)  We couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Great cologne. Excellent shipping and service. 100 percent recommended!</li>
    <li> The signature Marc Ecko fragrance is a pleasant blend of citrus and (I get the) tonka bean notes with a hint of musk.  It is ideal for Spring and Summer wear and most perfect for an office environment.  Performance is average at best - lasting a solid three to four hours on me (perhaps longer on clothing) at arm&#x27;s length (or closer) projection.  To reiterate - perfectly safe for office wear.  I love the bottle design and the price range is fantastic.  Given the modest performance, my final tally for Ecko is 3.8 stars out of 5 stars.  It really is a pleasant scent and one that I will hang on to, but if you are a serious collector - take a pass.  I will add that it is a great blind purchase or one for the novice collector.  Enjoy your day...</li>
    <li> Great price for the size when you can fin d the smaller one for double the price.Smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my boyfriend!  He bought a sampler Ecko cologne set last year and this and the green UNLTD scent are his favorites.  The Ecko blue and orange UNLTD aren&#x27;t bad either...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really describe this cologne better than something that kind of smells like a nice neutral deodorant. It is unimpressive and I bought it by accident. Being a neutral scent you can actually wear it for the day or the nighttime, I would lean more towards the day though. I use it as a daily driver when I don&#x27;t care and have no one to impress. I strongly recommend the Ecko Blue over the original any day of the week as that scent makes much more of an impression.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, I work in the food industry and this cologne is not overwhelming, smells sweet fresh and very masculine</li>
    <li> I love this spray I would recommend this to a lot of people I am going to buy again and again</li>
    <li> Waste of dollars. Doesn&#x27;t last at all, wears off instantly.</li>
    <li> i buy 2 bottles thinking that i got i good deal but i was wrong the perfumes arrive but they dont smell , it look that the perfumes where old , i try the same perfume in jc penney and it last longer the smell .....i not going to buy more perfumes</li>
    <li> This is a nice men&#x27;s cologne for the price. There&#x27;s a mild pungent undertone at first but when it dries it smells very masculine. I do recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling, good price, got it cheaper then the bottle I got in store even though it was half off because this is apparently discontinued (hope not)</li>
    <li> Very fresh and masculine. Very good as an every day cologne. It goes very well with any outfit and/or ocassion.</li>
    <li> Great Price &amp; quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells great all the time, first had it in little test bottles and it seemed to hold essence longer...that&#x27;s why the four stars.</li>
    <li> My son really likes this, and so do I. Its not over powering and the price was great. The shipping was not the best as it took a long time to arrive, but other then that its a keeper.</li>
    <li> Okay when I saw the price, I thought wow that was such a great deal. I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy my husband a cologne/perfume that would smell like he has just gotten out of the shower and after reading all the great reviews I thought I&#x27;ll try it. I was so excited when it came in the mail today just finding out that the bottle didn&#x27;t have any cover/cap at all and in the middle of the body of the bottle said &#x27;TESTER&#x27;. This was supposed to be one of my Xmas gift for my husband but after seeing that it was just a tester, I thought I would just give it away to someone else. So future buyer, beware. I am pretty sure that I didn&#x27;t see in this posting that this item was a tester...So disappointed:(</li>
    <li> Lady&#x27;s like this one ...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love it...</li>
    <li> Got this for my guy; get got it last summer at a sidewalk sale at an Outlet mall and liked it for his rainy day scents. It&#x27;s okay not OMG amazing but better than Axe or any of those sprays.</li>
    <li> You can tell that this fragrance is made of artificial ingredients from the moment you spray it. Of course, there&#x27;s not much else to be expected of something so inexpensive, but I expected something acceptable. I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead wearing this; it&#x27;s worse than axe in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragance. Like it.</li>
    <li> I hate this cologne and I hate myself even more for buying it. It has an over powering not so pleasant pungent spicy smell to it. Half of the bottle actually just dried sitting on my table. You get what you pay for. No wonder its so cheap.</li>
    <li> great price for suck a big bottle of cologn</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray on my husband...Love..love..love it and the cost make me love it even more. For mens spray that is inexpensive it does not smell as cheap as it cost. This is WONDERFUL...I have bought 2 more bottles for family members as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great and came exactly when it was estimated to arrive.</li>
    <li> Good Choise to this kind of product. I recommended it 100% . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Smells nice and people notice the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Gave me a skin rash. Had to stop using</li>
    <li> great value for the quantity, long lasting, not overpowering cologne. My son loves this cologne and it&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. It smells good. Back in the day when it first came out, this cologne was the ISH. Now, its like throw when you feel like it matches your attitude.</li>
    <li> Perfect Scent, not over powering, just right</li>
    <li> Very great scent no bad odor left after you sweat a bit. Scent should last a bit longer! Great price.</li>
    <li> Cologne is just okay. Fairly subtle scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I prefer Ecko Green if you are looking for a scent in the Ecko line.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had purchased the Ecko green and blue and am a big fan of both. Of course they are both much more expensive so when I saw this one at 17 bucks I jumped on it.  My girlfriend and I personally do not like the scent at all, but there seems to be a lot of people who favor it judging by these reviews. After smelling the scent I was extremely skeptical that it may be a fake as it shares no resemblance to Ecko&#x27;s other products. In fact, this very bottle has the &#x27;decals&#x27; placed backwards when compared to the bottles I purchased in JCpenny. Perhaps they are paying a third party company to manufacture this scent or something and they just aren&#x27;t very good at it, who knows. But do beware, it is cheap and it smells cheap. (In my opinion.)</li>
    <li> Very good product for a daily use. It is not expensive and the odor stay last long. Could be fake or not, but it is very good.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I use this as an every day scent and it last all day.</li>
    <li> Great smell for him at a great price , good for everyday wear and sophisticated  enough for a special occasion .</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Fiance and he absolutely loooooves it. I love how it smells on him. Its very soft yet masculine at the same time. Next time I&#x27;m going to order the Blue. I figured with the bottle being only 3.4 it may not last long, its almost Summer and he still has a almost over half the bottle, and he likes to spray alot, Lol. Great Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Clean smell and excellent product!!!!! I would reccommed this product to a younger audience like me who is going on date or hanging with friends. best use in the daytime.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.... Not a good scent.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred to wear mens cologne.  This isn&#x27;t as citrus smelling, as a I prefer, but, it&#x27;s light enough, and didn&#x27;t take but a light spray to then fade into the subtley that I like.  Yet, it is noticeable and clean smelling up close, and seems to last.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great. It doesn&#x27;t last long though. My boyfriend and I both wear this, and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours on either one of us. That&#x27;s too bad too, because I really do love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> The price was great, especially since it was the larger bottle. Not only I love the smell, but ladies always tell me how much they love how I smell. Great cologne just get it.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift so I can&#x27;t comment on the particulars of scent but the price and product was very satisfactory. I received exactly what was advertised (packaging was undamaged and the shipping was fast.)</li>
    <li> I tried a bottle of this after my wife bought me a stick deodorant of the same scent. I really liked the fragrance of the deodorant and the cologne is exactly the same, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. How to categorize it? Well...it&#x27;s different, but in a good way. It&#x27;s very inviting and fresh, not at all harsh, strong or off-putting like some of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; fragrances tend to be. It has a subtle but nice top-note hint of sweet licorice, which works surprisingly well. Then, as it dries down you have the freshness of the citrus, and the overall impression is very pleasing. Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not think it smelled at all cheap, despite a bargain price! It&#x27;s a great summer fragrance, and one of the most appealing and fresh scents I&#x27;ve owned. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long, but if used with the deodorant, the scent lingers a reasonable time.</li>
