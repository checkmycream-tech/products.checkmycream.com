<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got to try the product for free, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got the product and read through all the information that I found out I was not a candidate for using it. The product warning states it is not for people who suffer from kidney stones.  I was excited to try it as I have very sensitive teeth so I was really disappointed when I discovered that I couldn&#x27;t :-(</li>
    <li> For my purpose they do not work. I purchased the sensi-strips for relief from acid erosion . Never having used these I was surprised at their size, approx. 1/2 &amp;#34; long. Not a practical solution when you have a mouthful of sensitive teeth. They are cost prohibitive and as I said in the beginning they didn&#x27;t relieve any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> did not work as suggested- but. the return and refund was smooth.  thanks</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money</li>
    <li> It works! Tooth sensitivity is significantly reduced after a couple applications.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my tooth. Couldn&#x27;t keep it on my gum around my tooth.</li>
    <li> My teeth our very sensitive and this product did help.  I was surprised because it was so fast and easy.  It&#x27;s good for about a month and than reapply</li>
    <li> I need and love these things.  It helps for about 3-1/2 weeks.  I can finally swoosh again.</li>
    <li> Expensive and didn&#x27;t even help- did every thing according to directions but Stil had to hold tiny strips against the hurting area.  Went through a lot of strips and it was useless.  Disappointed in Crest Co.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for sensitive gums!  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> it works!My gum sour when I eat cold thing. it can help me reduce 80% pain,not 100% but it amazing enough.I am satisfy.</li>
    <li> So far, no help.  I&#x27;ll try again.</li>
    <li> this crap actually works!</li>
    <li> bought this for dental office</li>
    <li> Amazing relief! I&#x27;ve had to use prescribed sensitive teeth toothpaste for years. A few weeks ago, I received Crest Sensi-Stop Strips as a promotion from the brand so that I could try them myself. Crest Sensi-Stop Strips provided long-term relief without the hassle of special toothpaste. I can even travel without worrying about obtaining a tube small enough to fit carry-on requirements (I don&#x27;t like to check bags). Thanks Crest!</li>
    <li> I received sensi strips Free from Crest. I used sensitive toothpaste and never felt any relief. It takes just a few uses and I can drink hot and cold alike without any pain. I would recommend anyone try them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great! Don&#x27;t send the money on this, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I was so skeptical of this product. It says it would work for up to 30 days, and I did not believe that. I have to say it works really well.  I used the product on a tooth that has been bothering me for a long time, and I am so thankful I got to test this product.  It has worked amazingly well.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity for 3 weeks now.  The only complaint I have is it is really hard for me to keep the strip where it is supposed to be, but it still offered great relief.</li>
    <li> These strips are amazingly effective.  I adore sweets, but my teeth do not. I had to give up candy for awhile. With the Sensi-stop strips, I can enjoy a sweet  treat  without cringing in pain.  These don&#x27;t taste bad at all....something I was worried about initially. It also does not leave a sticky residue on my teeth. I received a sample of the strips from Crest because I am a BzzAgent.  With Halloween just atound the corner, I am definitely stocking up on more. I would not want to miss out on all the goodies.</li>
    <li> Received a sample thanks to Smiley360. I was lucky tor receive this product. Crest Sensi-Stop Strips use potassium oxalate to block dentinal tubules and decrease tooth sensitivity. The oxalate is contained in a gel on a strip that is applied to the affected tooth and gum and left in place for ten minutes. They are not uncomfortable and don&#x27;t have any offensive flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, they work surprisingly and even impressively well at reducing sensitivity and associated pain immediately after treatment. It&#x27;s faster than just getting to a dentist&#x27;s office for a fluoride treatm</li>
    <li> Ever since I can remember I always had to bite ice cream with my lips over my teeth (I&#x27;m sure most of you know exactly what I am talking about) and as of the past few years I have become more sensitive than ever, so when I received this free product for the purpose of my review (Opinions are 100% my own.) I was super excited to test them out!  You&#x27;re not supposed to brush, eat, or drink for 30 min after the application. There is no taste and the strip is pretty simple to adhere.  Also one strip lasts for at least a month! AWESOME SAUCE !!</li>
    <li> Do not use it, it cause burning mouth and tingling tongue after used twice, it is nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from local CVS.</li>
    <li> It works great it&#x27;s been a month and I still don&#x27;t have any issues with sensitivity I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free and I have to say I am pretty impressed.  I wanted to try this product because my teeth since having braces have become very sensitive in spots to cold.  I mean to eating ice cream, a cold fruit to just rinsing my mouth with water after I brush.  I have tried tooth paste and although that helps a little it takes longer.  Sure the tooth paste is a lot easier you just brush and your done.  These strips aren&#x27;t that simple but they are easy!  I put them on around bed time after I brush my teeth because after using the strips you are not allowed to east or drink for 30 min.  So the whole process is about 45 min.  5 to apply 10 wearing the strip and then 30 more to let them work their magic.  I like to put mine on while I and getting my children ready for bed and then.  So my 10 min are spent reading a story.  The strips them selves are a lot like the whitening strip...however these do not whiten only help with sensitivity.  The one thing that I don&#x27;t like is I have to pick and choose where to apply my strips so you really need to which teeth hurt and which ones need the most help.  But they do work and the relief is faster then using a tooth paste.  I am glad I got to try these for free its been a good experience for me and I would very likely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this  free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I suffer with tooth sensitivity to cold foods and acidic foods, so enjoying ice- cream , slushies  or even iced coffee is torture for me, and pickles ( my favorite ) are a just out of the question on a good day. I mainly have top front row teeth (middle 4 ) sensitivity.  The Crest  Sensi-Stop Strip is the perfect sized strip, it small and cover about 3-4 teeth (depending on size) . You ca  target the areas you need to with wasting the product , they are not long like whitening strips, but it&#x27;s the same concept where you apply and leave on the teeth then peel away. The strip is applies to the the gum and teeth, not only the teeth.  They are comfortable, adhere nicely and aren&#x27;t noticeable . The require just 10 minutes of wear time. After you remove the strip you are not supposed to eat, drink or brush for 30 minutes. So in all, it takes 40 minutes once a month. Not bad for ouch-free teeth.  They worked for me and I think they were quite effective. I often use special tooth paste but they don&#x27;t work for me, but I think with the strips I&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I got this item FREE from Smiley360 and I&#x27;m so excited I did. This product is amazing. It really worked for me. I have very sensitive teeth. I barely eat ice cream because of it. This product really helped with that. I had ice cream a few nights ago and I bit into the bar...no problems whatsoever!</li>
    <li> For far to reach places it&#x27;s not easy to place but it does work. I like the Ora-gel the had awhile ago. It worked for 3 months and was way more effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from tooth sensitivity under normal circumstances, but experienced severe discomfort after using tooth whitening strips. I purchased these Sensi-Stop strips in preparation for tooth-whitening sensitivity, but they failed to provide any relief. They might work for ordinary tooth sensitivity, but do not seem effective when used to treat tooth-whitening sensitivity. I will say, though, that the Sensi-Stop strips were easy to apply, stayed in place, and were easily removed.</li>
    <li> I think they work really well but they are small and I believe that all the rules are at times hard to remember. I also wasn&#x27;t sure if they worked at first, it took a couple days to notice the change. They work but they are a lot of trouble, I would prefer to use a simple toothpaste then these strips.</li>
    <li> Crest sent these to me for FREE and I absolutely love them. I can now finally eat cold foods without being in pain!</li>
    <li> So excited to have received a sample of these from Crest as I can now eat ice cream again without doubling over in pain! Without a doubt, these are the only product designed to stop tooth sensitivity that has had any sort of an effect. And what an effect it was. I highly recommend anyone with tooth sensitivity issues to try these out. I&#x27;ve already added them to my &#x27;always replace&#x27; list as now that I know what it&#x27;s like not to experience dental pain, I don&#x27;t want to have it again. Excellent product Crest - well done!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Crest Sensi -Stop Strips from Crest .My front upper teeth are very sensitive to cold. After using Crest Sensi Stop Strips they are not as sensitive.I can finally enjoy hot and cold drinks without my teeth hurting. I really liked the fact that it was a strip I could apply, let sit for 15 minutes, remove and have no issues with sensitivity for up to 30 days!I found the strips hard to place on my gums at the side of my mouth. When I placed it on my gum, the strip did not stay in place, so I had to remove it and try again. .If anyone has sensitive teeth, I would recommend this product.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> It certainly seemed to work. I was experiencing very sensitive teeth following dental work. I did find the strip very small and fiddly. It was hard to make it stay in place or to know which side was the gel side after taking it out and relocating it several times. However it it 3 weeks since I used it and I&#x27;ve had no toothache since.</li>
    <li> My sensitivity is on my back upper molars. No matter what kind of prep I did or careful placement they would not stay in place even for 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are fast acting and completely amazing! I used them in addition to my sensitive tooth &amp; gums toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and left the strip on the affected area for 10 minutes and I was very very pleased with the results! I was able to go about my day and not have the temperature of my beverages or food be bothersome. Once I find these in local stores, I&#x27;m most assuredly making a purchase! I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about Crest Sensi-Stop Strips!</li>
    <li> I used as instructed and had no decrease in sensitivity at all.</li>
    <li> (I tried Crest Sensi-Strips for free, from Smiley360, for the purpose of reviewing. Opinions posted here are my own).&lt;br /&gt;I admit, when I saw the size of these strips, I was very skeptical as to whether or not they would be able to help me. I have had sensitive teeth (compounded by a receding gumline) for years. I have tried sensitive toothpastes, desensitizing gels, and such... most have brought little or no relief.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that these little strips DID offer as much relief as the best of those &amp;#34;other products,&amp;#34; and the duration of that relief lasted MUCH longer. Although I can&#x27;t say that the full effect lasted for an entire month, I can say that I was still noticing a considerable decrease in sensitivity after nearly 3 weeks. This is huge, for me... most products were mandating reapplication at LEAST a few times a day!&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, the strips are small... they only protect a couple of teeth, each. For someone like myself, this isn&#x27;t enough of a range. However, for someone with only one tooth that&#x27;s &amp;#34;acting up,&amp;#34; I can see how it would benefit them by directly targeting the necessary area.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I liked... it only took 10 minutes to start working. This was a big improvement over the gels and drops that take a half hour or more to start numbing the pain. I noticed that you must wait a half hour before eating or drinking anything. That&#x27;s no big deal, as long as you know it before applying the strip!&lt;br /&gt;I did have to hold the strip in place, as it wanted to slip. Again, it&#x27;s only a 10-minute application, so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal. If it were being used on a difficult-to-reach area (say, a molar), that could be a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;Finally (and a definite PLUS, in my book), there was no awful taste or tongue-numbing goop to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think Crest has really stepped up the game, on fighting sensitivity!</li>
    <li> Like millions of other people, I also suffer from sensitivity. These strips were easy to use and they work amazing! I received these Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest. I have gum recession near one of my top teeth and I always have sensitivity there. Its so bad that I cannot deal with eating ice cream or other ice cold beverages because its just bothersome. I normally use a sensitive toothpaste, but I was excited to try these strips because they provide immediate relief and it lasts for up to one month. The product lived up to what it claims to do. Since I have been using these strips, my sensitivity has went away and I am back to eating ice cream and drinking ice cold beverages. In addition to this, I went to my local Walmart to stock up on some more and they were completely sold out. Word of mouth must have spread around town that this product is the truth.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Smily360 in exchange for my honest review! I took this strip out of the box and packaging, and it was a small gel side down little piece that you put on your gumline where the pain and sensitivity is for 10 minutes,and then you remove it,and you can&#x27;t drink or eat anything for 30 minutes after taking it out. I had a little difficulty getting it in the back on the left side,because when I stuck it back there it would try to ball up and fold up,so I did not really care for that part,but I finally got it in,and after I took it out, my pain is GONE! I am so happy! I get a lot of pain back there to the point of where I thought it was a cavity on that side,and I went to the dentist, and they told me it was sensitive gums was all,and gave me sensitivity toothpaste and a toothbrush to use. Well, needless to say, that did not work to well for me unfortunately. I felt I had nothing to lose taking this product,so I put it back there and presto! No pain,and I am really looking forward to putting it to the full test,because it is supposed to give you lasting pain relief for a month at a time,so we will see if it holds up to that month,but right now it is doing a WONDERFUL job! Thank you Crest Sensi-Stop Strips for Tooth Sensitivity! You helped me get through the day a lot better!</li>
    <li> Love these strips.Very easy to use and works for a month.That&#x27;s cool.No problem with it so far.It really worked for me.No more sensitivity and no more pain.The only problem is the strips are too small and covers only a couple of teeth per treatment.Who cares as long as it works.I definitely recommend this to my friends,family and anyone with this problem.Use it!!feel it!!</li>
    <li> I tried Crest Sensi-Stop Strips as part of a mission from Smiley360. I feel fortunate to have been selected to try them because I do suffer from tooth sensitivity. I like how quick and easy these were to use and would recommend them to anyone needing relief. They are not messy at all and really work! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Tried one last night and it really does seem to work.  Can&#x27;t say yet how long it will last, but it does seem to provide better relief than  Sensodyne tooth paste.</li>
    <li> These strips work so much better and quicker than sensitive toothpaste. You apply the strips along the gum line and they work faster than paste. I have sensitivity to cold so these are such a relief. These do not whiten so do not confuse them with whitening strips. These are very easy to use. You cannot eat for a bit after using. I highly recommend them. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky ones to try out the Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips, That I received as part of a promotion from the brand, and i am proud to report that i have always had issues with eating ice cream and sweets,But after trying the sensi stop strips i can now eat anything i chose, I also am proud to say that the sensi stop ctrips do not have a negative taste as well as the strips stay on unlike previous strips i have used in the past.I am so happy to have been a part of this product review. For anyone who has sensitive teeth there is now a cure for it Go ahead and give these strips a try.</li>
    <li> I received my Crest Sensi-Strips to try free from Smiley 360 in exchange for my honest review. When the strips arrived and I looked at them, I was like this is not going to do anything for this extreme sensitivity I have. However, I am pleasantly surprised. While all my sensitivity is not gone, there has been a significant improvement and I will continue using them until all the sensitivity is gone. I have been using sensitive toothpaste for a while and my teeth were still very sensitive to ANYTHING cold, but the strips have definitely dome what the toothpaste couldn&#x27;t. The downside is the strips are small and they will move around, therefore, I would suggest you refrain from talking when using the strips. The strips only have to stay on for 10 minutes, so that is not a lot of time. I would also suggest eating before using because you are not able to eat for 30 minutes after removing the strip to give them time to work.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product, back to eating icecream with no pain.#gotitfree</li>
    <li> The claim is that this product provides immediate relief, and that it can last for up to a month. I put that to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you have to figure out which teeth are sensitive, because this is a spot treatment, not full-mouth. Common points of sensitivity are where your teeth rest together the most, so that&#x27;s a good starting point. I figured mine out by biting down on an ice cube and pinpointing the bad areas, which were surprisingly small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works similar to whitening strips. which, by the way, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just for sensitivity. You place the gel side of the strip to cover the outer gumline. It tastes about how you would expect, but it&#x27;s not too bad.The usual 30-minute wait to let the product work, of course, and voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate relief? I got mixed results. I think it depends on the amount of damage that causes the sensitivity. Most of my areas were granted immediate relief, others held on to the sensitivity. A second application to the troublemakers took care of it, though you have to wait a full day before Take 2, per the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lasting relief is quoted as up to a month. Again, the areas that responded the best to the product lasted almost the full month, while the trouble spots lasted about two weeks. Even then, that&#x27;s considerably better and of a much longer duration than other products I&#x27;ve used to treat this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version? The product works, for sure, but depending on how intense the areas of sensitivity are, you may get varied results and may need to reapply, after waiting a day. Check the product ingredients for possible allergies, if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for testing and review purposes. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used toothpaste for sensitive teeth with mixed results, &amp; liked the idea of applying strips directly to my teeth for more targeted &amp; lasting relief. I found the strips stayed in place fairly well, although I had to fiddle with the placement the first time I tried them. I noticed a decrease in sensitivity quite quickly after application. Although it didn&#x27;t last as long as a month, it did last several weeks, &amp; overall the strips were an easy convenient solution. However the strips are small, so it could be expensive to use on a regular basis for those who have more than a few sensitive teeth. I received a free product to try in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried it twice - it makes it better - I wouldn&#x27;t say it was amazing...</li>
    <li> Not durable like white strips does not achieve taking away sensitivity.  A waste of money.  I have been a LONG time customer of crest products especially the white strips.VERY DISSATISFIED</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzagent. I tried this product and it seemed to help.  I was able to eat ice-cream without  looking funny.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is so easy to apply.  It works just as it says.  Relieved my tooth sensitivity and I was able to eat/drink things I had not been able to in awhile.  Definitely recommend this product!  (I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.0</li>
    <li> does not work very long- only a couple of days</li>
    <li> I received the Crest Sensi-Stop strips free from Crest. I was really looking forward to trying them as I have very sensitive teeth and its a constant problem for me when I eat and drink cold things, and sometimes sweets. I was eating an ice cream cone the other night and although it was delicious, when I finished the cone, I got toothache pain in my upper right side. It kept getting worse and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I thought about trying ibuprofen, but I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t help. Of course it was night time so its not like I could call a dentist. I remembered I had the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips and my husband ran and got them. I put a strip over the teeth that were hurting.  I was so relieved when it started working! Within about 5 minutes I was feeling better. What a relief that was. I realized then I had better plan on always having these on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with sensitive teeth for about 15 years due to a history of brushing too hard. Worn down enamel in 3 quadrants of my mouth has caused pain when eating sweets or anything cold.  Sensitive toothpaste daily takes the edge off -- more so with sweets than cold. I got the opportunity to try crest sensi-strips free thru Bzzagent &amp; really likthe right time since I ran out of sensitive toothpaste and had been using regular toothpaste for a few days. The strips were small so maneuvering them in the back of my mouth was a little tricky at first. I liked that they only needed to be on for 10 min &amp; didn&#x27;t have much of a taste. I used them before bed so that I wouldn&#x27;t eat/drink anything for 30min after.  I tested the efficacy the next day and noticed I had no pain at all when eating a candy bar (a first), but slight pain lingered when holding cold water in my mouth near the most sensitive areas. It was less than before, so I considered it a success! Three weeks later the sensitivity is a little more noticeable but still better than sensitive toothpaste alone.</li>
    <li> The ingredients may be good but these are ridiculously small, almost unusable because they are small AND slip around. They are more like specks than strips. Imagine trying to place a one-inch by half-inch piece of plastic that is gooey on one side on a back upper tooth. It isn&#x27;t easy!!! The picture on the box makes these look larger than they are, and they are small for the price. I tried these twice and I did not find them to be worth the price or effort because they wouldn&#x27;t stay put for the few minutes needed for them to work.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised it worked for me! I&#x27;ve tried other products to help my sensitive teeth and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to find one that works! This worked pretty quickly compared to normal toothpastes. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and great price</li>
    <li> These strips actually made my tooth sensitivity worse. I did complete three applications as the instructions said it might take up to three to realize the full effect. I can only attribute the failure to the fact that the active ingredient is different from the one in Sensodyne. Fortunately, a month or so later, the Sensodyne is working and reducing the increased sensitivity caused by the Crest Product.Great idea, but in this case the active ingredient didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensi-Stop Strips come with a breathtaking amount of excessive packaging and I discarded the UPC off the outer container which is needed to take advantage of Crest&#x27;s money back guarantee.  Hang on to that UPC in the event you need it!</li>
    <li> I had dental work recently and it aggravated an already-sensitive tooth to the point where I worried I was going to need a root canal. After being in pain all weekend, I was going to call Monday to get back in and see my dentist (emergency visits are hard to score). I found a sample of these at a local big box store on Sunday and thought I&#x27;d try them out. To my great surprise, one application was enough to get my tooth settled back down to nearly-normal. What a relief! I can hang in now until I see my dentist again in a few more days.</li>
    <li> I purchased it but never used it, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works. When it arrived I read the instructions and it stated that if you have a history of kidney stones not to use. I have a history of them so i&#x27;m afraid to use it. Too bad.</li>
    <li> The strips made my teeth hurt more after using them.....</li>
    <li> I have always had really sensitive teeth, which really bites when you are trying to each ice cream. After using the Crest Sensi-Stop I was able to eat my ice cream and anything else without any irritating pain.</li>
    <li> A fun new product similar to tooth whitening strips, but with a totally different purpose, size and set of instructions.  First of all, I received my box of Crest Sensi-Stop for free but everything here is 100% my words and my opinions.  I have sensitive gums lately, I blame age, so I was happy to try these out.  At first glace, you notice how much smaller these are then expected.  Enough for one tooth at a time, and best described as slippery, both in your hands and in your mouth.  After placing on a trouble spot, I had to keep my whole face still since this product doesn&#x27;t &#x27;stick&#x27; as well as it could and any movement slid it ever so slightly away from my trouble spot.  I didn&#x27;t feel any pain while it was on and the taste was relatively unnoticeable.  I felt a difference afterwards, but how significant is negligible.  My gums were not numb after, but I did feel like there is less pain in the usual situations and that lasted for over two weeks.  After this, the sensitivity did not rush back, but slowly reemerged.  Overall, this product does as advertised and I believe would work wonders for individuals with chronic sensitivity. The cost might be a touch on the high side, but with available coupons and drug store promotions, it could be brought to a reasonable price for what it does.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!  I have VERY sensitive teeth  to both hot and cold. I would be in pain for hours if ate something too hot and would need 800 ml of an ibuprofen to help the pain.  I was anxious to try sensi strip because i really needed help. I was so excited that the strips worked since the first day I put them on!  I am in my 3rd. week now and I still have no sensitivity and am pain free which is a HUGE relief.  I got my strips for free from smiley 360  and I am so glad that I got this mission.  I highly recommend these strips to anyone with tooth sensitivity and will definitely  buy them to continue being pain free.</li>
    <li> I tried these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips out of desperation for myself. . .I have had trouble with sensitive teeth for sometime and find that some of the sensitive toothpastes only work so-so and you must keep using them to get continued relief.  I put this product from Crest on 3 weeks ago and so far so good. I love the fact that it is still working for me.  Without having to keep using it!</li>
    <li> For someone that cannot even see someone bite into a popsicle without my teeth seering in pain, I wanted and needed to try this product. It really helped the crazy sensitivity, specifically to cold! It really dulled the pain to a level that I could enjoy a popsicle with my kiddos. I will say - the only negative is that the strips don&#x27;t cover much surface area and move a bit while in your mouth. That aside - I highly recommend! Got this free through BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I applied my first sensi-stop strip about two weeks go. It works very similar to the whitening strips. Easy to use, only takes a few minutes and voila you are done. I&#x27;ve had sensitivity issues since I can remember. Hot and cold foods are torture! To the point that I drink everything through a straw, including hot coffee. I also try to drink most things at room temperature. So when most people go for the ice cold bottled water, I get the one out the pantry. Friends/family think it a bit odd but I don&#x27;t like pain so this is how I cope. After using the sensi-stop, I didn&#x27;t really notice anything. So it wasn&#x27;t like a drastic change for me. It wasn&#x27;t until a week later when I was on vacation that my brain finally processed the difference. We didn&#x27;t have straws and I NEEDED coffee so I drank it without a straw...and I was fine. No sensitivity pain. Then I had beer on the beach (I used to get really strange looks drinking beer with a straw). No pain to suffer through. So obviously the sensi-stop worked because I was drinking hot and cold things with no problems. My thoughts are if you have sensitive teeth, try this. It&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve tried the tooth pastes before and they worked okay but these worked much much better. I received a free product from Smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> After having a baby my teeth got very sensitive I love eating ice, icecream, soda, ect but the pain I get when eating anything cold is horrible so o rather not have it, but after using the Crest stop OMG what a difference.  I love them. Thank you crest for creating wonderful products.</li>
    <li> My gums have recently started to recede, and have therefore opened up some sensitive areas.  The Crest Sensi-Stop Strips worked to relieve that unwanted pain.  The strips come in little envelops and are easy to apply.  My only complain is that they didn&#x27;t last for the month.  Maybe a week or two and the pain was back.  But then I just applied another strip and was set.  Great product and an easy solution to sensitive teeth.  \\&quot;I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It actually works!!  I have very thin and weak enamel and therefore have lots of sensitivity.  I used one of these strips two days ago across an affected area, and no kidding, the sensitivity is completely gone. I can drink coffee, iced drinks, and eat anything I want without pain.  I will watch to see how long it lasts, but for now I can say that this product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product can be called a &#x27;strip&#x27;. It&#x27;s one tiny rectangle that covers less than two teeth! If someone is experiencing pain from sensitive teeth - particularly from using Crest White Strips - this tiny thing is useless.</li>
    <li> have only used a couple but seem to take the sensitivity out of the edges of my teeth at the gum line.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to receive a sample, from Crest, of the Crest Sensistop product while participating with Bzzagent. I&#x27;ve always had some struggles with tooth sensitivity, particularly from cold, or when going back and forth from hot to cold. While I have had some success with toothpaste sensitivity products, I&#x27;ve always wanted something that I could hopefully utilize at a less frequent rate. The Sensistop strips really were ideal for that. They are easy to use and certainly worked well. I would rate my level of sensitivity at moderate - it certainly hurts, but it&#x27;s not crippling pain, and the strips gave me relief for right about a month&#x27;s period of time. They performed as advertised and helped me out, that&#x27;s a great combo for me!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product. I have always had a problem with cold things hitting my teeth. I never could fully enjoy ice cream, and I could never chew ice. These strips have changed that for me. I can now enjoy ice cream like I never could before. The only problem I really had was trying to identify which teeth is was that was most sensitive. Operator error, not the products fault. Love it, WILL definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I received a sample via Smiley360, and I must say that I enjoyed this product. I have sensitive teeth, and I tried this and felt a  cool soothing sensation. It was easy to apply and felt great. I was pleasantly surprised because I had tried a similar product that didn&#x27;t work, but this one did. In all, I was very pleased, so I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> They won&#x27;t stay in place for 1 minute. ..more less 10 minutes.  I threw them away...what a waste.</li>
    <li> These really work.. Tooth pain is not much fun so HATS OFF TO CREST..</li>
    <li> These work great. It takes a couple of times to get the hang of it. When using it on the inside of the tooth, it helps to pack with cotton, so your tongue doesn&#x27;t move the strip. It definitely works for more than a month.</li>
</ol>
