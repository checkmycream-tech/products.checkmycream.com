### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best price on the internet (that I found anyways).</li>
      <li>After buying it, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with its duration.</li>
      <li>I brought this cologne from a sample in my GQ magazine and it impressed me.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great ight smell.</li>
      <li>Lol.</li>
      <li>- this is a great cologne to put on after a gym workout and shower.</li>
      <li>Yes, the price is dropping and you are buying a (great) Dolce fragrance, but I have been spoiled with buying fragrances at a discount..</li>
      <li>This cologne smells great.</li>
      <li>This cologne is great.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant and you will like it immediately.  </li>
      <li>I went to Macy&#x27;s to check out the colognes smell, loved it</li>
      <li>so I am good with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the smell is refreshing!</li>
      <li>And the scent is amazing,  </li>
      <li>So amazing i use it every day</li>
      <li>I did try this in the store and liked it.</li>
      <li>Sure, there are better performers out there, but this juice is good...</li>
      <li>Yes, I may have the money, but do enjoy that good buy at a \\&quot;sale price\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>He said it is not to strong but nice and scent.</li>
      <li>but this has a distinct smell (really pleasant).</li>
      <li>pricing and value could be better...</li>
      <li>It was for my grandson and he love it, he like the scent.</li>
      <li>i love this colognes smell and believe its #1</li>
      <li>As most sport types of cologne, it was meant to be worn in the summer time.  </li>
      <li>He said he loves it and gets many compliments on the smell of it..</li>
      <li>better than the one gentleman</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it, and I am giving it five stars, but I would echo some of the concerns that this is a mild cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell very strong by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>- having said this, I believe One Sport offers great flexibility and versatility that it can be worn during any season, for any occasion, and day or night...</li>
      <li>This is a Great Cologne, light not heavy, my Wife loves it and you&#x27;ll get compliments from others too.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care because the cologne was fine</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic for 10 min, then fades on the wind.</li>
      <li>This is such a great scent for any man for any reason.</li>
      <li>and i enjoy it every day</li>
      <li>AXE cheap.</li>
      <li>light, playful effervescent</li>
      <li>Guys - the relatively new fragrance by Dolce is fantastic..!!</li>
      <li>Great juice, but needs just a little more longevity/projection/sillage for the money.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Today was actually my first day wearing the scent and a (female) co-worker after walking in my office says, \\&quot;gee, it smells great in here..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely scent, really.</li>
      <li>but it better be a real</li>
      <li>Dolce Gabbana has Become  One of my favourite  Men cologne because of the smell, It feels fresh clean</li>
      <li>, I save a bit, and my husband finally smells nice instead of</li>
      <li>The One Sport opens with aquatic and citrus notes then settles down with notes of floral, musk, powder, and spice - Nice blend of notes that is easy on the nose..</li>
      <li>I found it on Amazon and bought it right away.</li>
      <li>Just the right cologne for the hottest day of summer</li>
      <li>bottle and packaging are first class - no surprises from Dolce..</li>
      <li>I sampled some at Macy&#x27;s and it seemed to last thru most of the day, so I purchased one.  </li>
      <li>Probably marketed more for the younger crowd -</li>
      <li>I am especially fond of the clear bottle and clarity of the juice - nicely done..</li>
      <li>Try it first, but boy, I really like it.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, and in case you&#x27;re worried that its watered down the bottle I got seems legit.</li>
      <li>The bizarre thing is - I had given up on the fragrance still being detectable some two hours earlier.  </li>
      <li>Its subtle but definitely unique and memorable.</li>
      <li>I would prefer the projection and sillage to be better, but it is average as well as the longevity.  </li>
      <li>This better not be a fake like most colognes out there...</li>
      <li>Not only was it cheaper but it shipped fast!</li>
      <li>but us 40+ old guys that can&#x27;t let go of our 30s</li>
      <li>Got this considerably cheaper than in stores.</li>
      <li>It was still working and The Wow Factor made its presence known..  </li>
      <li>When I finally found the right bottle, it was like an Axe commercial.</li>
      <li>Should put zero stars because the product I arrived damaged, broken lid and spray hauling, ah seems that given a strong blow to fall, the box was more or less but not the bottle!</li>
      <li>While it has potential Wow Factor, it is early or shortly after the initial application.  </li>

<li> The smell lasts for hours, I even smell on my clothes a few days after spraying.</li>
<li> It has a little bit of a spice to it but subtle.  </li>
<li> but it hardly stays on your clothes.</li>
<li> Alas - it really doesn&#x27;t last or project at all, which leaves me very disappointed.  </li>
<li> I had read that the longevity and sillage were poor.  </li>
<li> no, that&#x27;s expensive, so</li>
<li> That&#x27;s just weird.</li>
<li> You can not go wrong with any of the Dolce Gabbana colognes.  </li>
<li> I am totally disappointed with the product I got ah.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <li> This toilett is a little too musky the smell does last on the average as other.... lack of freshness added.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great. I have a few sports cologne but this has a distinct smell (really pleasant). Try it first, but boy, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Una excelente fragancia, para ser una colonia, tiene buen caracter y muy duradero, considero que se puede usar en cualquier ocasión.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Cologne, light not heavy, my Wife loves it and you&#x27;ll get compliments from others too. Great ight smell.</li>
    <li> This better not be a fake like most colognes out there... i love this colognes smell and believe its #1 but it better be a real(:</li>
    <li> This cologne is terrific.  It lasts a long time and can be worn on any occasion.  As most sport types of cologne, it was meant to be worn in the summer time.  It has a little bit of a spice to it but subtle.  You can not go wrong with any of the Dolce Gabbana colognes.  Quality ingredients in a Quality cologne.</li>
    <li> My friend bought me a bottle of this about a year ago. I ran out and bought  this one off amazon. Not only was it cheaper but it shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I smelled this in a department store and I was all like heck no, that&#x27;s expensive, so Imma have to go to Amazon and find me a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a deal here, I save a bit, and my husband finally smells nice instead of AXE cheap. It&#x27;s a lovely scent, really. DOUSE THE MEN.</li>
    <li> Dolce Gabbana has Become  One of my favourite  Men cologne because of the smell, It feels fresh clean Just the right cologne for the hottest day of summer</li>
    <li> It was for my grandson and he love it, he like the scent. He said it is not to strong but nice and scent.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic for 10 min, then fades on the wind. I wish the scent stayed on all day like my Gucci cologne. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am giving this order a 3 stars because box the item came in was damaged.  I didn&#x27;t care because the cologne was fine so I am good with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for timeliness, item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as christmas gift..He said he loves it and gets many compliments on the smell of it..</li>
    <li> So amazing i use it every day and i enjoy it every day i think you aint regret it if you buy this product .... better than the one gentleman</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it, and I am giving it five stars, but I would echo some of the concerns that this is a mild cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell very strong by the end of the day. Doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I know that with one or two squirts its never overpowering.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!! I tried it out in a store and it was selling for $80. so when I seen the price here I had to jump on it</li>
    <li> Guys - the relatively new fragrance by Dolce is fantastic..!! The One Sport opens with aquatic and citrus notes then settles down with notes of floral, musk, powder, and spice - Nice blend of notes that is easy on the nose.. Well done Dolce and Gabbana..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of you know I am a fan of the aquatic citrus fragrances - having said this, I believe One Sport offers great flexibility and versatility that it can be worn during any season, for any occasion, and day or night... Probably marketed more for the younger crowd - but us 40+ old guys that can&#x27;t let go of our 30s (and 20s) can wear this too..!!  We have all the money (and the women)..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was actually my first day wearing the scent and a (female) co-worker after walking in my office says, \\&quot;gee, it smells great in here..!!\\&quot; I responded with - \\&quot;it is probably the air freshener over on the credenza\\&quot;, but no - it turns out it was me and One Sport.  The bizarre thing is - I had given up on the fragrance still being detectable some two hours earlier.  It was still working and The Wow Factor made its presence known..  It has potential..!!  I would prefer the projection and sillage to be better, but it is average as well as the longevity.  Sure, there are better performers out there, but this juice is good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and packaging are first class - no surprises from Dolce.. I am especially fond of the clear bottle and clarity of the juice - nicely done..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pricing and value could be better... Yes, the price is dropping and you are buying a (great) Dolce fragrance, but I have been spoiled with buying fragrances at a discount.. Yes, I may have the money, but do enjoy that good buy at a \\&quot;sale price\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give One Sport 4.2 stars out of 5 stars.  The fragrance is pleasant and you will like it immediately.  While it has potential Wow Factor, it is early or shortly after the initial application.  Great juice, but needs just a little more longevity/projection/sillage for the money.  If the price continues falling, perhaps to below $50.00, definitely buy.. Imagine and Dream..!!vity/projection/sillage for the money.  If the price continues falling, perhaps to below $50.00, definitely buy.. Imagine and Dream..!!</li>
    <li> I brought this cologne from a sample in my GQ magazine and it impressed me. After buying it, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with its duration. The scent is the same as the sample but it hardly stays on your clothes. You have to actually bring your nose close to the fabric to get its scent. I would recommend Hugo Boss or Polo Black over this product.</li>
    <li> I had read that the longevity and sillage were poor.  I sampled some at Macy&#x27;s and it seemed to last thru most of the day, so I purchased one.  Joke was on me.  Some of the tester had caught my leather watch band,  Every time I checked it out, I was getting the scent on the band.  And the scent is amazing,  Alas - it really doesn&#x27;t last or project at all, which leaves me very disappointed.  I carry it in my gym bag and use it after a work out.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s funny and weird to review a cologne. I mean, there are folks that buy cologne on the net by name of designer. That&#x27;s just weird. I did try this in the store and liked it. Bought it on the web for a lot less dough.</li>
    <li> Got this considerably cheaper than in stores. Smells amazing, and in case you&#x27;re worried that its watered down the bottle I got seems legit. The smell lasts for hours, I even smell on my clothes a few days after spraying. Its subtle but definitely unique and memorable.</li>
    <li> As a female who prefers men who don&#x27;t wear cologne, this was an exception. I walked thru the men&#x27;s clothing area at the mall, and got a brief sniff. Someone had recently sprayed perhaps...the scent was intoxicating, and I followed it to where the ties and suits were. When I finally found the right bottle, it was like an Axe commercial. Lol. I contemplated if they put pheromones in it. If you are debating on getting it, purchase the smaller bottle. I have purchased one. I can&#x27;t get enough of this scent!</li>
    <li> I would never have my boyfriend wear any other cologne! This is such a great scent for any man for any reason.</li>
    <li> Should put zero stars because the product I arrived damaged, broken lid and spray hauling, ah seems that given a strong blow to fall, the box was more or less but not the bottle! I am totally disappointed with the product I got ah. Quice not return because it is tedious to the respective procedures, but next for sure that I will. If you want to buy and know what they can find. You assume the risk.</li>
    <li> light, playful effervescent - this is a great cologne to put on after a gym workout and shower. the smell is refreshing!</li>
    <li> I went to Macy&#x27;s to check out the colognes smell, loved it but I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the department store price. I found it on Amazon and bought it right away. This cologne smells great.</li>
    <li> Best price on the internet (that I found anyways). Saved $$$ verses going to Macy&#x27;s and I didn&#x27;t have to take time to go to the Mall.</li>
