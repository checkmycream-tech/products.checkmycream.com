    <li> Great product. Good price. Arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> I have such thin hair, this really does the trick and should definitely be used with the shampoo and conditioner. Also a great deal if bought with the shampoo and conditioner. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Probably will not repurchase. OK, but not any better than an of the less expensive products</li>
    <li> This smells really good, but honestly, I&#x27;ve never felt that it did anything for thickening.  It also leaves your hair with that stiff, hair spray feel.  I usually use it more as a &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; spray when I am wearing my hair up.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time.  love it</li>
    <li> Since I have stopped coloring my hair - this product has made a big difference in the texture of my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look so much better. I would recommend.</li>

    <li> Seems to work for my hair.</li>
    <li> If you need body, this is the product for your hair.  Just spray it on while your hair is wet and blow dry.  You will see an immediate difference.</li>
    <li> this product is really great. I was loosing my hair and my hairdresser and I had tried a lot of different products.  Then she found this and I have been using is for about six months and I have new hair growing it is about two inches long now.  I praise this product so much.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing for my fine, thin hair.  It made my hair look darker and greasy, even though it didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  When it dried it felt like I had a ton of buildup on my hair.  It smells nice and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product: adds such volume to my flat, lifeless hair. Makes everyday a \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair day while leaving it natural looking &amp; feeling. Reactivates between applications/washings each morning by dampening!!</li>
    <li> It adds volume to thinning, fine hair without weighing it down. I use it even on days I&#x27;ve not shampooed to provide the styling boost I need.</li>
    <li> It may be my imagination but my hair feels fuller after just a couple of weeks!!  My new favorite product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however the packaging wasn&#x27;t so great. It leaked some in the box and just had tap over the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this gives me great body without stiffness and makes hair manageable and easy to style.</li>
    <li> great product, great price, would order again</li>
    <li> i have thin straight hair and am always looking for products that will give me some body and volume. i spent 25.00 on this one thinking&lt;br /&gt;it would give me volume and it would also protect from heat of blow dryer. WELLLL, how wrong was i , no volume, NONE, no body, NONE,&lt;br /&gt;AND  flyaways like you can&#x27;t imagine.. I gave it 2 trys and in the garbage it went. What a waste of money .</li>
    <li> This was a used product that was supposedly new.  It had a replacement black cap and it was dirty. I was very disappointed in this</li>
    <li> Initially got this product from stylist and really like it. :) it provides that extra little umph for my fine hair.</li>
