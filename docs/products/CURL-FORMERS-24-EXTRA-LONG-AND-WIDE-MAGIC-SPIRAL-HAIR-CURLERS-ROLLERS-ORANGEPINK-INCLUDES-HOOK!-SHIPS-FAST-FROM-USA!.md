      <li>These mostly work well for me.</li>

      <li>and I approve this message. :)</li>
      <li>but I love them and so does my daughter.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product because It WORKS</li>
      <li>If you purchase, check with the seller to make sure</li>

      <li>i LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Depending on your hair, you might want some spray gel or styling product to hold the curls better.  </li>
      <li>The hooks tangle your hair and many times when I pull through the rod, my hair got pulled out.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THEM&amp;#62; thanks for great service and quality.</li>
      <li>However, I used a spray bottle filled about 1 part spray gel and 2 parts water to make my hair damp, and even after having them in for a couple of hours, my hair had really nice waves, and after leaving them in for around 5 hours, I had fantastic curls that lasted for days.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great quality product, fun to use!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THEY MET MY EXPECTATIONS GOOD, IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK GORGEOUS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Gave me smooth spiral curls, easy enough to learn to use with the help of youtube. On wet hair took about 8 hours to fully air dry better than sleeping on them!</li>
    <li> I like these curlers a lot. I use them when my hair is damp and add a little gel to my hair. I leave them in over night and wake up to easy heat free curls. They make my hair so bouncy and full.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get these in the mail.  They arrived within the said time frame. i used them with CharOyl and Eco styler gel.  I actually slept in them over night.  it was really very comfortable but bareable.  I took them out the next morning and had some really nice soft bouncy curls. I love them and will use them a lot for easy care free styling.  I have no relaxer and have</li>
    <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product. The curlers are sub-standard, and are not the size advertised. They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers). As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily. However, the most urgent issue is that these products are being sold illegally. Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
    <li> I like it but some times my hair gets tangled in the wand. Im thinking about buying some more. I need the skinny ones.</li>
    <li> they are easy to use and they work amazingly well. If you are looking for a long lasting curl without damaging your hair. BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> one of the curlers broke and so did the hook. otherwise the product is okay. not what i expected. disappointed</li>
    <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;They advertise fast delivery from the US! They LIE. It&#x27;s coming straight from China which means you have to wait for a month to recieve your order. There are a ton of companies that sell the knock off curl formers, which I love, for a great price. I just really wish I paid attention to what amazon said the delivery time frame would be and not the great big sign that says FAST DELIVERY NOW FROM THE US! With that said, I can&#x27;t really comment on how their product works because it&#x27;ll be a few more weeks before I recieve it. Dang it!!!&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, we have some of knock off curlformers from a different manufacturer. They work extremely well. They are easy to put it. The girls don&#x27;t have a problem sleeping with them in their hair. There is a trick to this though. Give the hair about 2-3 inches of slack before the curler actually starts. I really wanted to put them in close to the scalp, that makes it uncomfortable to sleep in. I really wish I could comment on the quality of their product but so far all I can say is that if they lie about their fast delivery from the USA they probably are not going to best the product out there. I am not holding out any hope of them being any good. :(</li>
    <li> Like I said, this is a good product but the description is misleading. If you purchase, check with the seller to make sure you know what the width of the curlers are. Some are 1&amp;#34; which will give you a tight curl and go as high as 2&amp;#34; for soft waves. I returned this item because I thought the description of &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; meant at least 1.5 inches.They were very prompt in giving me a refund which is always appreciated.</li>
    <li> I had a batch of the short version (name brand directly bought) and wanted to buy longer ones since my hair had grown.  These mostly work well for me. The only difference is in the openings on either side. After comparison with the openings on the original shorter ones, the opening on these seem to be stuck together slightly and perhaps a little more difficult to hold open with a two finger pinch while putting in hair.  . . but after using my nail to open the ends of a few of the curlformers in order to insert the hook I didn&#x27;t have a problem.  Since this didn&#x27;t make the process much more difficult for me I would definitely buy this version again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item prior to reading reviews and promptly had buyers remorse. I&#x27;m happy I never cancelled my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived quickly- so it certainly wasn&#x27;t shipped from China. There was no strange odor, that some people described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American with natural, and my hair actually dried faster than it did with the name brand curl formers.  My curls were gorgeous. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> I borrowed some curl formers from a friend and I fell in love instantly, I gave them back and wanted some of my own so I ordered some narrow and some wide (I had a hard time finding extra-wide ones). The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is because the narrow ones I bought and these are exactly the same diameter, no difference whatsoever. If anything the narrow ones I bought were longer so had I known I would have just bought two packs of those. I&#x27;m kinda disappointed about that. Anyways in regards to the product I thoroughly recommend it, even though you should probably watch some YouTube videos before you put them in for the first time. Great on natural hair as well. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to use and the curls turn out great. I purchased two packages and ended up using all but 7 curlers for my hair. They are too uncomfortable for me to sleep in, but I just blow dry my hair with the curl formers in. Haven&#x27;t used my curling iron since I purchased these.</li>
    <li> It was very hard to put them on and when I was ready to take them off, it wasn&#x27;t the curls i wanted. However, if you just looking for something to create some curls, then this is it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because I had lost the wand for my curlformers set and I wanted a new wand. The wand that comes with this set is so cheap and flimsy it comes apart every time you try to pull your&lt;br /&gt;hair through the curlformers so it is 100% useless</li>
    <li> The rods are wonderful. However, the hooks need to be made better. The hooks tangle your hair and many times when I pull through the rod, my hair got pulled out.  Once in a while, it would go exactly as it was supposed to and when that happens...AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of hair, you need 2 sets because you can&#x27;t put much hair into the roller. These are a great idea but they will take much practice to use.  So far, I have used them twice.  The first time my hair was half way dried and I left the rods in for 1 hour and 15 minutes...the curls were bouncy and full and it looked really good.  Today I tried to put them in my WET hair but it was way more difficult and my hair got really tangled up.  Finally when they were in my hair (and it takes a while) I left them for 3 hours to get a tighter curl....and boy did I!!!!  Shirley Temple curls everywhere.  You need to figure out how much curl you want and practice a lot to get the desired look.  But overall, I LOVE THESE...except for the hook.  It&#x27;s hard to get the hair to stay in the hook and the hook easily tangles and pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these as a second set for my daughter&#x27;s hair before cheer competitions. They work GREAT- but you need to practice a bit to get them hang of them so try a couple times before you need them! If you use too many the hair can look weird but too few and the curls don&#x27;t hold very well. For the price these were exactly what we needed!</li>
    <li> The curl formers are great!  Nice curls. Easy to sleep with them in.  Makes small curls. Easy to maintain. Just great</li>
    <li> It really works!!  They also straighten my hair with little shrinkage and they do not pull your hair.  I will recommend these to my friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect, this product meets my expectations.  I may need to order this one again.  A clue that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase is that I keep it, when I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll send it back. Now that I know that you require a specific number of words to write a review these five will be my last time completing a review... this is crazy!</li>
    <li> Really curls your hair.  Shirley temple curls. Only negative on my account only came with one hook and more oranges then pinks.</li>
    <li> So fun and easy to use! No need to by the $70 ones from Sally&#x27;s, they are exactly the same thing. Much cheaper too!!!</li>
    <li> These are quite literally the greatest leave in curlers i&#x27;ve ever purchased. My hair was likened to that of a pin up girl and it was wonderful</li>
    <li> The curlformers arrived as advertised.  I only tried a few to determine if I could master it.  The product does work.  I have very fine,  tightly curled hair.  These certainly help to stretch the curls without the heat.</li>
    <li> I always had a hard time curling my hair, curls would fall flat within an hour. And doing a roller set on yourself isn&#x27;t exactly easy. After trying these Curl Formers I will never use anything else! My curls stayed in all night! And they are super easy and fast to put on, just sleep with them and wake up with gorgeous curls every single time!</li>
    <li> I have natural African-American hair and tried these--I haven&#x27;t tried it with a setting/styling product, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be better that way...the curls do come out nicely although my hair gets frizzy quickly with separating the finished curls even a little bit.  These can be slept in if you band them up with big ponytail holders or headbands because they are stretchy and flexible and will stay in place if you tie them up.  Very easy to use after one or two tries of practice, I figured it out without seeing instructions.</li>
    <li> I brought it for my daughter and she loves it so much. Thanks Melodie I&#x27;ll look forward to purchase from again.</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re super hardcore, you probably won&#x27;t want to sleep in these, and they can pull at your hair if you put them in too high, so be careful.  However, I used a spray bottle filled about 1 part spray gel and 2 parts water to make my hair damp, and even after having them in for a couple of hours, my hair had really nice waves, and after leaving them in for around 5 hours, I had fantastic curls that lasted for days. These are definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I love this idea, they are very easy to use.  Makes beautiful curls. Really good product.</li>
    <li> my girls love these curlers! this is the second set they have gotten and indicated the applicator to use with the curlers is much sturdier than the one from the first set (from a different maker).</li>
    <li> Works really well, the only drawback is that it&#x27;s kind of pinchy feeling/not super comfortable. I use on wet/damp hair and let it dry overnight.  The curl stays in for two days (looser on the second day). You need about one and a half packages for an adult head. Great value too.</li>
    <li> I really like these curformers. Once you get the hang of how to use them, they are pretty easy to use. I am so glad I did buy the name brand ones that are crazy expensive, these are great quality. My hair come down to the middle of my shoulder blades and there is still length left in the curformer. It is really uncomfortable to sleep in them, so I tired putting them further back on my head, so  they weren&#x27;t on the sides of my head. That worked great, I was able to sleep through the night. I would recommend these to anyone thinking about ordering them.</li>
    <li> These are nothing like curl formers you get from the curl formers website. My order looks nothing like the picture and did not curl my daughters hair at all. Do not waste your money! Order only the real thing!!</li>
    <li> These were a great buy but my hair is natural and short so I am going to have to wait to use them when my hair gets a little longer!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I used them this weekend for my daughters cheer competition.  They make the perfect spiral curls.  Very easy to use and she loved that she looked like a La La Loopsey doll.</li>
    <li> I have only used these once since I purchased them but they really do work.  I only gave four stars as I wish they had stated in the description that these would make ringlets and not waves.  Still, they did their job perfectly.  I put them in while my hair was wet and slept on them.....have to say, worst night of sleep ever!  Next time I will just use the blow dryer on them on the medium setting.  The curls came out wonderfully for ringlets....that just wasn&#x27;t the look I was going for.  Now that I know, I will keep these for special occasion up dos and I will by the looser ones for a more wave effect.</li>
    <li> Just like you would buy in a hair supply store just cheaper price</li>
    <li> Awesome....Awesome....Awesome...I am ready to order another set.</li>
    <li> The quality is not the way that I expect ,the colors was different  with the picture.and it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair which is straight, after 10 minutes it doesn&#x27;t look like I had curler for 3 hours on my hair, they didn&#x27;t put it it on a package and also No instruction.</li>
    <li> I give this 3 stars because they are hard to get in right. But they do give you great curls once placed correctly. I have really long hair and that might be the reason I have a bit more of a hard time. But do love the curls. Did not like the false advertising of where it was being shipped from!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers!</li>
    <li> The long is not long enough! Long hair girls beware. I have about three inches of hair coming out the bottom.. And thats too much. Granted, my hair is waist length. But still, maybe extra long should be an option?</li>
    <li> I love it and will be purchasing more from this seller. I purchased the item Sunday night, received my package Tuesday evening. I absolutely love it. I gave it a text run with a couple pieces of my hair, let it dry over night, and wallah, beautiful bouncy curls. So I recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> If you want great curls, these are fantastic.  If you expect to sleep comfortably in them, then don&#x27;t purchase them.  My one daughter slept in them with some complaints.  My other daughter insisted I take them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for curls, they can&#x27;t be beat.  They are relatively simple to put in and really quick to take out. (See the youtube videos for putting them in and taking them out correctly--it really helps). Depending on your hair, you might want some spray gel or styling product to hold the curls better.  If you put them in with wet hair and let them dry for several hours, you get great curls.</li>
    <li> These work great! I used them on both of my daughter&#x27;s one had thin poker straight hair the other has very thick hard to curl hair. Just make sure the hair is damp abd tangle free. Can&#x27;t bribe people pay 4 times as much for actual curlformers</li>
    <li> Ordered for my 14 yr old daughter because she has a very difficult time with heat styling. Theses curlformers work wonderful in her super fine yet thick hair. Ended up buying 2 sets. LOVE THEM&amp;#62; thanks for great service and quality.</li>
    <li> My two grand daughters really enjoy these curlers. When they dress up they use these curlers all of the time</li>
    <li> took a few tries and you-tube videos to get it right, but no matter the tries I still ended up with the best curls ever...I&#x27;ve never got so many compliments on my hair style and I&#x27;m told I look younger and like a baby doll :0)!</li>
    <li> Great price!  I was going to buy the expensive Curl Formers but this curls hair just as good.  A little tougher material but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking I was going to get what was in the picture.  The ones I got look nothing like it.  These are NOT essentially the same product as the description says.  I ordered 2 packages.  They were each missing 4 in the package which the company is refunding me for.  The Curl formers in the product photograph hang down in spirals to do nice spiral curls which is what I needed them for.  The generic ones I received are rolled up upon themselves like snails.  The rolled up ones are not going to be able to dry as fast in the hair as the ones advertised in the picture since the hair is rolled up and laying on itself.  Some of the ends were stuck together, but I picked them apart and that was fine.  They are cheap quality.  The mesh is poking through the rubber ends on some of them.  I grabbed the ends to open them and got poked by sharp bits of mesh on a few of them.  I ordered extra long, but HALF of the curlers in each package are a good 3-4 inches shorter than the others.  It makes me think they switched out some with regular length to save themselves some money.  Also, my package came from China, NOT the USA as stated in the photo of the product.  I only tried a couple in my hair and they HURT at the roots.  When I pulled the hair though it rolled back up in it&#x27;s snail shape quickly, but with the end that my roots were coming out in the center of the circle.  That made it twist and pull very badly.  The type in the picture has the ends out and not all curled up so it will hang much better while in the hair.  I&#x27;m not going to use these for my child.  I will be ordering the Curl formers from the Curl former company which is what I should have done in the beginning instead of trying to save $20.</li>
    <li> I actually wanted to get waves and generally just put some volume back into my straight and limp hair. What I&#x27;ve found is that the first day I get adorable curls which stay without using hairspray or anything, and the second day I get the wavy volume I was looking for. Normally curls won&#x27;t stay in my hair unless I practically shellac them with hairspray.The curl formers are very easy to use (look on youtube for instruction) and I only have problems if I try to feed too much hair through a single curler. It&#x27;s not a fast process, takes me about 40 minutes to put them in and 3 hours for them to dry, but the results are worth it. My sister loved the look and ease so much that she&#x27;s now bought the same set.&lt;br /&gt;Just to note though, you will probably need more than one set. I don&#x27;t have so much hair - about a half-inch diameter ponytail - and I use 36 curlers to cover it all. Also, my hair is about 4 inches past my shoulders and the curlers would easily cover another 4-6 inches of length.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy them again except they seem so durable that I expect them to last for many years. And although they shipped from China, they still arrived much earlier than the timeframe Amazon told me.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as described.  They worked great.  My daughter has super straight, fine hair that will not hold curl from curling irons, wands, etc.  She slept in these curlers with little complaining...a bit uncomfortable, but tolerable.  Took them out the next morning, and she had beautiful curls ALL day...even after a cheer competition and a ferry boat ride in the wind.  The were fairly easy to use.  I used them on her hair both damp and straight after shampooing.  She slept in them both times.  The curls were pretty with no frizzing.  Towards the end of the day, they were looser, but just as pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with two hooks.  The quality of the product was just fine.  No complaints.  I will be ordering these for gifts !</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars because you get great curls, but theres a couple of things that i didnt like. One is that trying to pull my hair through with the hook, a couple of the times the hook somehow got stuck into the mesh these are made of, and i literally had to cut one out of my hair because i couldnt get it out. Also- i do NOT recommend sleeping in these, i know some people say you can, but i tried and it was extremely uncomfy because these are really hard to lay on, and tight in your hair. So i would suggest blow drying your hair or leaving them in through the day if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is- i paid 1-3 day shipping and i tracked the package, and it said i wasnt going to get it for 5-6 days. So, i contacted the seller not once, but twice, making sure it would be delivered in time, befor my weekend trip so i could use them on my vacation. Then my package was delivered 4 days later- still on time luckily, but i didnt even get a response from the seller, from either of the 2 times i wrote to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these few complaints- the product works great, gives you GREAT curls! I know some girls say to get long curlformers if your hair is shoulder length or longer- so i did, but they were a little too long for my hair still, which wasnt a problem but id say shoulder length, use the short curlfromers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great perfect curls though:)</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews on these curl formers before purchasing. I have long hair - down to the middle of my back, so I got the extra long and wide curlers. My package came with12 pink and 12 orange curlers and two plastic wands. The package came in the mail in just a few days - NOT from China. I was happy with the shipping speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I partially dried my freshly shampooed hair and used the curlers. Note: don&#x27;t try to get too much hair into each curler, it will be very hard to pull your hair through and you will be yanking on your hair to get it through.&lt;br /&gt;So, with damp hair, I used a larger chunk of hair in each curler so that I would not end up with tight kinky curls. I hit them with the hair dryer once again for about 10 minutes. Probably should have been longer, but I didn&#x27;t have the patients to stand and dry my hair for an hour. I took one of the back curlers out and, my hair still being a bit damp, came out straight. So I left the rest in for about an hour. When I took them out, I was disappointed. They made my hair look crimped. The curls were very curly on the ends and pretty straight towards the roots. I like bigger, loose spiral curls, so I didn&#x27;t like the results. They were spiral, but too tight. (Like I said, my hair is long, so it&#x27;s heavy so I don&#x27;t blame the curlers for the parts that were straighter.) I just didn&#x27;t like the results of the tight curls and crimped look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the curlers to be long enough, none of my hair stuck out the ends of the curlers. If I had installed the curlers closer to my scalp, that might have been a different story. I couldn&#x27;t fathom sleeping in these, but if you are used to sleeping in curlers, I guess these wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, if they are not too close to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your hair to curl away from your face, use the pink ones on your right side and orange on the left. Vice versa for curls towards your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these curlers did the job they are intended for, I just didn&#x27;t like the results. If you like soft, loose curls, invest in a good curling iron. It&#x27;ll probably take less time.st didn&#x27;t like the results. If you like soft, loose curls, invest in a good curling iron.

    <li> These work great. They don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair unless I try and grab too much hair. I won&#x27;t get to use them for a while (cut my hair shorter recently) but I tried them out earlier this year and really liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you need help, look on you tube for videos. Tons available.</li>
    <li> They work the same as the Curl Formers sold by Sally Beauty Supply and priced less.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These do not ship from the US, they ship from China so be aware. One of the hooks was bent, but overall everything looks good. I&#x27;ll give them a try this weekend and update this review if I can.</li>
    <li> Love these. Had to go to YouTube to figure out how to use them but I love the product!!!  Great.</li>
    <li> I love these little curlers.  They do exactly what they say, easy to use and the hold is perfect. I now can go straight or curly and they do not damage your hair!  I have thin, fine hair and these curl it like I just had a spiral perm.</li>
    <li> These work great on my daughter&#x27;s hard to curl hair.  The curls last all day.  She sleeps in them and says they are not too uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I watched 5 YouTube videos before trying them in my hair. my hair is almost shoulder length, naturally curly. I wanted more unified curls so I tried these. my hair was damp but not soaked. I sectioned the first piece, put the little tool thru the curler, hooked into to my hair &amp; gently began to pull. and pull... and pull - well the tool got stuck in the curler and broke off somewhere inside. I had to gently coax it out!!! I tried the next curler a different way and had better results. AFTER I waited over two plus hours for my hair to dry, it doesn&#x27;t  look nice, pretty or the way I wanted too.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE-Save you Cash!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I gave these guys five stars because they work VERY WELL! I don&#x27;t like the curl that these particular curlers create. They are too tight for me. My hair is down to my shoulder blades and is considered thick(ish). These skinny curlers couldn&#x27;t hold enough of my hair for this package to be enough for my whole head of hair. If you have finer hair these would be perfect for you. They are even long enough to hold the entire length of my hair, which I was so pleasantly surprised by. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend these to anyone looking for an over night, no heat curl. Perfect curls, just be sure you like width of the curler.</li>
    <li> So I will be trying tomorrow! My sister styled my hair with these. i finally have my own! Love these they are exactly what my sister has but i go a must better deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea!</li>
    <li> I am soo happy that I got this product. I LOVE this product because It WORKS, I have 4C hair and I didn&#x27;t believe that this product would work as good as it does, but I Love it, and I do plan on buying more. I am a natural woman and my hair just touches my neck when i flat iron it..So I&#x27;d say my hair is short-medium length...And I thought that would be a problem because the Curlformers would be too long but Its not....Unlike some people I didnt have too hard of a time, you&#x27;ll be fine after the third one, its really not hard, and they give you directions and what helped me was watching lots of Youtube Videos. The curlformers where a little annoying to sleep with because their so big, but thats the only con, Plus all i did was condition my hair before, and then used a little bit of my coconut curling cream to do the curls and they came out just like i was sitting in the hair salon for hours getting a press and curl. So they look great..I would suggest for anyone to get two get one of these packs and then another pack...Because i needed like 5-10 more for my hair but made it work. So I suggest buying Another small pack but its great and it comes with Two Hooks, and I don&#x27;t know how some people get them to break because they are pretty sturdy....It took me 35 minutes to do my whole head and i did take my time...And i made the parts like i was twisting my hair, and i always put medium sized twist in my hair, so a good portion of hair can go in and come out nice in these, plus its really thick....So overall i recommend this product, more so than buying the whole kit for like 70 dollars, you can get this one and a smaller one for half that price, and it will all be the right size for you and work well....I am a 4C Natural and I approve this message. :)</li>
    <li> this is a great way to get curls!  I&#x27;ve used them on both short and longer hair.  the hook can be a little tricky to use and will pull the hair if it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hook properly.</li>
    <li> These are great to use with my daughter.  We put them in after the shower at night, and she sleeps with them in, and we take them out the next morning.  Great curls.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but these are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave them in over night, you get really defined spirally curls.&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you leave them in for only a few hours, you get more of a wavey curl pattern. I use the latter to add just a bit of body to second (or third) day straightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;Get them, you&#x27;ll LOVE them!</li>
    <li> These definitely produce curly hair.  They are a pain to sleep in.  It&#x27;s nice to have the option of blow drying them.  It takes practice to use.  The extra long and wide ones weren&#x27;t quite long enough for my hair, but I have really long hair, so I sometimes have to curl my ends with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the receiver had wanted them for awhile.  Once used, she was very pleased with the curlformers. They performed as promised. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the ending results of the curlformers.  I love my curls.  I wish i would have come up with the idea.  :)</li>
    <li> got here quick and is just as it said. works great I&#x27;m pleased got it quick too very happy Thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter was in competition and needed her hair in a certain style, these saved me from staying up until 2 am! Excellent product and it saved us from exhaustion in the mornings!</li>
    <li> This gave me super tight curls. I came out looking like shirley temple. I think the trick is to not keep it in your hair as long, and I have experimented with that with varying degrees of success. I am asian and my hair doesn&#x27;t need it in as long as someone with more ethnicity.</li>
    <li> I cannot describe how much i LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I was very hesitant about purchasing it b/c miracle hair products usually turn out to be baloney, but not this!! I watched a few you-tube tutorials before using them, but the results are AMAZING!!!!  Would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> took a bit to get them but I love them and so does my daughter.  she has think hair I have really thick hair and they work great!</li>
    <li> I just love this, I use it on my teens hair and it comes out beautifully. She can wear them to bed with no discomfort</li>
    <li> Like other reviews these do take time to put in.  I have used them three times and the curls do not stay in after 2 hrs.  The type of hair I have is full but fine.  If you have this type of hair I would not suggest these.  I even put the hair spray that the product recommends but using it did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality product, fun to use!  I highly suggest it!  My hair is about 20 inches long and straight, though I may donate it again soon.  These were definitely long enough for my hair, there was even extra.</li>
