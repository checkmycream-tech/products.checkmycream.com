      <li>LOVE THIS DEODORANT.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m buying for two :-)</li>
      <li>This stuff works like magic.</li>
      <li>but I find the roll on works better.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>Great product for those that are looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Great deodorant if you have sensitive underarm skin.</li>
      <li>My husband is a chemist, plus it says right on the bottle: it is \\&quot;aluminum CHLORHYDRATE free\\&quot;!!</li>
      <li>Make sure your armpits are clean before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
      <li>Works fine, but I&#x27;m now breaking out in a rash from it.</li>
      <li>; my tops but even in 90 degree weather I have been fine.</li>
      <li>Everything went smoothly</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic for someone like me.</li>
      <li>This ball moves super easily and you get plenty of the deodorant on.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s pretty sensitive, so I&#x27;m happy with that result.</li>
      <li>Efficacy isn&#x27;t the best, just OK, but at least no itchy arm pits!</li>
      <li>Works great, stronger protection than the Naturally Fresh solid crystal deodorant.</li>
      <li>The roll on head is very large and applies easily.  </li>
      <li>The first bottle worked fine, but bottles two and three aren&#x27;t agreeing with me.</li>
      <li>There is no scent and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Use in the morning, quick wash underarm in the evening</li>
      <li>I started using Naturally Fresh Deoderant because mainstream antiperspirants gave me lumps or irritation.</li>
      <li>I love the natural roll on and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>Very thankful that this works for me!</li>
      <li>first time I wore it</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample directly from the company  when I called to inquire about it.</li>
      <li>I used the solid crystal many years ago, but had difficulty finding it for a while, so I switched to this roll-on version.</li>
      <li>Things are fine in the am right after showering but quite honestly, by mid day, frankly, I stink!</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s fragrance-free, is natural (no aluminum or potentially harmful chemicals), and is effective.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first, but this stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>Thought this would be the same-same company, same fragrance free label-but clearly states on the ingredients it has an added scent!!!!</li>
      <li>Goes on like pure water and never dries.  </li>
      <li>They have also recently redesigned the bottle, and the new look is MUCH better.</li>
      <li>Easier than applying a huge piece of rock salt to your armpit, which didn&#x27;t work for me back in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>have friends that had problems with BO &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; to the roller/crystal, and they had to throw the whole thing away.</li>
      <li>I can really say is thank God for this product, tried everything else I could find and either they didn&#x27;t work,</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>price  --  fast ship</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give the deodorant five stars, but the packaging has been really problematic.</li>
      <li>Naturally Fresh had no harsh chemicals like aluminum.</li>
      <li>I sometimes work in the sun all day and it worked the whole day no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
      <li>I tried many natural roll on products and this one is the only one Iiked.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have tried that consistently worked AND prevented underarm odor almost completely.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, goes on smooth, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, smells nice, but totally not overwhelming - very fresh.</li>
      <li>It works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more inexpensive to buy several at a time and they will last forever.</li>
      <li>In my most recent order, however, they put all six deodorants in one big Ziploc bag, and they had leaked everywhere.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t sweat or stink as much, I just have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I am allergic and have used the spray which works but is messy (sprays more than your underarm).</li>
      <li>only worth what I charged to submit it and your mileage may vary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>if I use spray Deodorant, it is my third time I bought this naturally fresh with pack 6 units.</li>
      <li>I switched to Naturally Fresh deodorant several years ago.  </li>
      <li>if u normally</li>
      <li>This is a life changer for me and very popular I see in south west asia where it&#x27;s hot and muggy.  </li>
      <li>Found out about this product through a blog written by actress Alicia Silverstone, who apparently uses this very product.</li>
      <li>I have had skin allergies to all aluminum based deodorants for years now and went through a testing period with many other products that were natural in an attempt to find something that actually worked.</li>
      <li>No scent, rolled on nicely, took a little while to dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great deal when you buy in bulk</li>
    <li> my wife and I both use it</li>
    <li> Great deodorant if you have sensitive underarm skin. Inexpensive, also.</li>
    <li> This stuff works like magic. No rash, flakes, stains, or smell. Apply anywhere you don&#x27;t want odor to develop.</li>
    <li> This is THE ONLY deoderant my husband can use that wont cause him to break out in a rash or cause swelling/lumps in his armpits. He has literally tried every other male deoderant on the shelf at the natural health store to no avail. He will only buy this brand now, as he wears dress shirts every day to work and needs to remain odor/sweat free for long periods of time without other negative side effects.</li>
    <li> I started using Naturally Fresh Deoderant because mainstream antiperspirants gave me lumps or irritation. Other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deoderants never worked for me or they would work for about 2 hours max. Naturally Fresh had no harsh chemicals like aluminum. It really worked for me, no more irritation or lumps! I sometimes work in the sun all day and it worked the whole day no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont apply too much or it will leave white residue. Make sure your armpits are clean before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Because it is not an antiperspirant you will still sweat alot if u normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most roll-ons it takes some time to dry. My advice is put it on as soon as u get out the shower so that it has time to dry.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest deodorant I have ever used and I have tried a LOT. It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, goes on smooth, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, smells nice, but totally not overwhelming - very fresh. I can HIGHLY recommend this product. I have been using it every day for well over a year and a half.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered! The roller ball is much smaller than previous Naturally Fresh bottles. Different picture too than received! Also, quite annoying, the bottles leaked in shipping. The inside of the sealed bag was coated with leaked deodorant. I guessed I lost about 1/4 of the total liquid in all 6 bottles. &#x27;Naturally Fresh&#x27; is GREAT, but I would not reorder from this Spencer&#x27;s Specialty Shoppe vendor. I will probably return them, but it&#x27;s a pain.</li>
    <li> I switched to Naturally Fresh deodorant several years ago.  I like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free, is natural (no aluminum or potentially harmful chemicals), and is effective.  I have also tried the solid crystal, but the roll-on is much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I recall having to reapply late in the day, before going to the gym.  After a few weeks, this was no longer the case -- one application in the morning lasts all day, even through workouts.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all.  Goes on like pure water and never dries.  I received no packing slip in the box so not sure how to get my money back.</li>
    <li> a VERY gOOd product&lt;br /&gt;a gREAt price  --  fast ship&lt;br /&gt;bp okc 67</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend to help with the red, itchy areas that can develop in just 1 day, where skin touches skin in the summer heat, etc.  People into the health/\\&quot;Earth Mother\\&quot; issues say perspiration, itself, is healthy, just not the bacterial aspects.  This product mostly helps--although the fact that you are still perspiring was not pleasant for me.  I would not re-purchase it.  Also, 3 of the 6 bottles in my pack leaked enough to have lost up to an oz. of the product--although it was sealed in a plastic \\&quot;envelope\\&quot; (each bottle). Purchased at Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This product is NOT \\&quot;aluminum FREE\\&quot;!!!  My husband is a chemist, plus it says right on the bottle: it is \\&quot;aluminum CHLORHYDRATE free\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> I love the natural roll on and have used it for years.  It works exceedingly well for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sweat or stink as much, I just have really sensitive skin that&#x27;s why I shop for hypoallergenic deodorants. This one is not &amp;#34;odor free&amp;#34; it certainly smells like something not very pleasant, also I have to apply huge amounts of it to prevent my armpit of smelling and yet it does not do the work, I&#x27;m blown I ordered the 6 pack, I will have to give them away.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, Unfortunately is no longer sold in Mexico&#x27;s GNC, that&#x27;s why I brought them in Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for someone like me. I have really bad allergies to almost every other deodorant, and this saved my life. It is very pleasant, it lasts me a LONG time, I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out and body odor because these things are incredibly good at keeping smells away. Great and perfectly priced.</li>
    <li> I have had skin allergies to all aluminum based deodorants for years now and went through a testing period with many other products that were natural in an attempt to find something that actually worked. All other natural deodorants or antiperspirants failed in one way or another. This is the first product that I have tried that consistently worked AND prevented underarm odor almost completely.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS DEODORANT. They have also recently redesigned the bottle, and the new look is MUCH better. I&#x27;d give the deodorant five stars, but the packaging has been really problematic. Only 3 of the 6 bottles I received have functioning &amp;#34;rollers.&amp;#34; So half of the deodorants are unfortunately almost useless without lots of effort.   Also, the shipping-- once, they sent this shipment in individually wrapped bags within a bigger bag, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about them leaking (and they didn&#x27;t leak anyway). In my most recent order, however, they put all six deodorants in one big Ziploc bag, and they had leaked everywhere. I had to dry each bottle individually; it was a decent amount lost and the caps were sort of loose. So that&#x27;s a bummer. But still, deodorant itself is good. Just some packaging issues.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and just as I expected.</li>
    <li> After trying this product for a couple months, my wife decided that she wanted in on this excellent deodorant.  Now I&#x27;m buying for two :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using crystal deodorant for 10+ years, and it has rarely failed me. I can work outside, go hiking, or whatever and not have to worry about stinky pits! I used the solid crystal many years ago, but had difficulty finding it for a while, so I switched to this roll-on version. I hate the plastic waste when the product is gone, but I have stuck with it because of the added camomile which adds a light, fresh scent and soothes my skin (no chafing or bumps from shaving!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have friends that had problems with BO &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; to the roller/crystal, and they had to throw the whole thing away. They found that applying after washing underarms solved the problem.</li>
    <li> No scent, rolled on nicely, took a little while to dry.  However, massively stinky pits by mid-day so I&#x27;ll have to give this one star.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It actually works and when you sweat, you don&#x27;t smell it. You don&#x27;t smell anything! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s all natural. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have tried! It works for me even through exercising.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I&#x27;ve use for the past 4 years now.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to almost everything, and this is one of the few underarm deodorant products that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction.  In other words, it actually is hypoallergenic as advertised.  Efficacy isn&#x27;t the best, just OK, but at least no itchy arm pits!</li>
    <li> Anything else left me smelly. I&#x27;m starting to forget what I smelled like. Easier than applying a huge piece of rock salt to your armpit, which didn&#x27;t work for me back in the 80&#x27;s. Basically this product is the same thing as the rock salt but in liquid form. This is a life changer for me and very popular I see in south west asia where it&#x27;s hot and muggy.  This doesn&#x27;t leave thick stains on your clothes armpit area, which is a plus also.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s much more inexpensive to buy several at a time and they will last forever. I had no issues with the seller. Everything went smoothly</li>
    <li> My family has been using this deodorant for a few years now, it has acceptable ingredients and actually works! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I had used the spray variety of this same product but I find the roll on works better.</li>
    <li> No fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It works.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product it is hard to find a roll on deodorant much less one that works well. I can not use stick deodorants so this was a real win for me. No Aluminum Chlorhydrate (however you spell it), no scent, NO SWEAT! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works as well as Secret, Dove, etc. without the harsh chemicals.  And it&#x27;s much more effective and easier to use than a crystal deodorant.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I can use without any itching or discomfort. Have been using this product for the 4 years. Arrived on time as scheduled.</li>
    <li> Works great have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a little over a year now.  I battle hidradenitis supprativa, and this deodorant has not caused a flare to date.  Surprisingly, the odor protection is great.  I was hesitant at first, but this stuff really works.  Keep in mind - it is not an antipersperant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and I have not had any adverse issues. It did take a day or so to get used to the gel-like feel of it, but now I don&#x27;t notice the difference anymore. Since it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant I was a little nervous I&#x27;d &amp;#34;pit out&amp;#34; my tops but even in 90 degree weather I have been fine. No odor for me, either (but I also purchased Body Mint tablets to make sure--seems to be working). I feel good about making this change for the better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I usually get it at the grocery store but they&#x27;ve been out of it lately and I decided to check Amazon.  How wonderful to be able to stock up with a 6-pack!  Also, perfect for those who do not want aluminum in their deodorant.</li>
    <li> I live in a chemically sensitive household, and I guess I&#x27;m the oddity, because the hubby&#x27;s the sensitive one (chemically anyway).&lt;br /&gt;All I can really say is thank God for this product, tried everything else I could find and either they didn&#x27;t work, didn&#x27;t work well (neither&#x27;s an appealing prospect as only one of us lost their sense of smell and sadly here, it wasn&#x27;t me!)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, for several hours anyway.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s pretty sensitive, so I&#x27;m happy with that result. Use in the morning, quick wash underarm in the evening and we both survive until the following day.&lt;br /&gt;As usual this reviews&#x27; only worth what I charged to submit it and your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of it, I&#x27;d buy a single, if it works for your situation, you can stock up.</li>
    <li> I have developed late in life, an allergy to ALL DEODORANTS. Even the ones for sensitive skin makes my underarms  itch like crazy. I know Julia Roberts once said she uses no deodorant and I try to do that on the days I&#x27;m not going out. Things are fine in the am right after showering but quite honestly, by mid day, frankly, I stink! I don&#x27;t remember where I got this to try, but it is the ONLY deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me itch. I don&#x27;t want to chance a fragrance sensitivity so I use unscented. No more need for sniff the pits test late in the day using this. Very thankful that this works for me!</li>
    <li> Been using these for a year now.......first time I wore it I went on a little hike to try it out........no musky sent!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bo anti perspiration, so you&#x27;ll sweat, but that&#x27;s how your body  gets rid of heat.......n toxins! I recomend it</li>
    <li> Excellent, works great and keeps my body free of most Chemicals and pollutants, have always purchased and will always keep purchasing, unless something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I read about it on Food Babe&#x27;s blog or her book.  I&#x27;ve had some other crystal deodorant roll-ons, but the roll-on ball didn&#x27;t work very well and it was hard to get the actual deodorant on.  This ball moves super easily and you get plenty of the deodorant on.  Plus, the deodorant works well too.  I&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue to order this brand.</li>
    <li> This works great for me. Good value in the 6 pack.</li>
    <li> This is a natural and very good roll on. The roll on head is very large and applies easily.  I tried many natural roll on products and this one is the only one Iiked.  I like this one because it has no fragrance, and as a guy I like that.  If you have sensitive skin or are after Natural product, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Found out about this product through a blog written by actress Alicia Silverstone, who apparently uses this very product. Here is the link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample directly from the company  when I called to inquire about it. I tried it...after 1 week I was hooked.  Now my daughter and I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for several years since all of the health issues connected to deodorant use was revealed.  It works well for me, preventing wetness and odor.  It&#x27;s gentle and does not leave any white marks on my clothing</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my wife can use that does not irritate her underarms.  Plus she says it is all natural and has no aluminum chlorohydrate in it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a nurse.  I like the applicator &amp; it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time. Product is what expected. Price is excellent.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the fact that it is 3 ounces allows me to take it in my carry-on.  Great advantage</li>
    <li> great product,very effective, does not stain or clot in fabrics. excellent odor control.</li>
    <li> It works first thing in the morning after a shower, but does not last throughout the day, which is bummer when you have to find out the hard way, like while you are at work and being hugged by co-workers!!!!  I was not active or anything (I sit at a computer) and yet I started smelling myself. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for me, but maybe it will for you!</li>
    <li> JUST A DEODORANT NOT AN ANTIPERSPIRANT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T CLOG YOUR PORES OR LEAVE A RESIDUE BEHIND.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for the girlfriend and she loves it. Doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
    <li> Great product for those that are looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I&#x27;m now breaking out in a rash from it. I tried switching bottles to see if it was just the one, but this bottle still creates the rash. The first bottle worked fine, but bottles two and three aren&#x27;t agreeing with me. Sorry now that I bought the package of six.</li>
    <li> I use this because it does not stain my shirts.  I have used the product for years with no &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant.  No yellow staining.</li>
    <li> Let me say this is the best product in its genre on the market in the US.&lt;br /&gt;I am more than  gratified.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works after a shower but after about 3-4 hours it stops working and I get the underarm odor.  I am sitting in an office with airconditioning so I don&#x27;t sweat but it just does not keep the odor at bay.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this stuff. Leave it ALL for me to use. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works great. And I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Brazil and allergic if I use spray Deodorant, it is my third time I bought this naturally fresh with pack 6 units. It&#x27;s the best deodorant of I have used, I use this product about 4 years and until now non problem! It is a pitty doesn&#x27;t not have place to buy here in Brazil!!</li>
    <li> I like the product. There is no scent and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Has a definite scent! I am allergic and have used the spray which works but is messy (sprays more than your underarm). Thought this would be the same-same company, same fragrance free label-but clearly states on the ingredients it has an added scent!!!! Not OK to false advertise.</li>
    <li> Works great, stronger protection than the Naturally Fresh solid crystal deodorant.</li>
