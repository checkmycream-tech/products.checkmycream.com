      <li>I assume it is good.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the brand!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product was amazing for my at-home pedicures.</li>
      <li>A nice consistency.  </li>
      <li>When it came time for removal, it was very easy compared to Gel polish having to be soaked off.</li>
      <li>Seche Ultra V UV Topcoat is about the best I have used since getting my nails professionally done and that has been about 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I used this top coat over a normal nail polish manicure and I loved it!</li>
      <li>I work at a top salon and we use Gelish, OPI, Essie, and Seche.  </li>
      <li>so you can paint your nails and finish with this top coat</li>
      <li>and she seems to think it is ok but could be better, so</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.</li>
      <li>This top coat dries well with the UV light and looks nice.  </li>
      <li>I really love Gel manicures, and I wanted to start a Gel nail polish collection.  </li>
      <li>I was getting Gelish manicures every 2-3 weeks and am still IN LOVE with Gelish but needed to save some money</li>
      <li>It air dries and gives a pretty good shine</li>
      <li>I use this top coat with a 9 watt florescent uv light.</li>
      <li>I cleaned my apt right after.</li>
      <li>It also comes off easily with Acetone without soaking your nail for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I figured, if this is a great topcoat, it has to survive a major cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I was beginning to think that I would have to switch to all Gel polish in order for the UV light to work they way</li>
      <li>I have a bottle of cheap topcoat from the dollar store that lasts longer.</li>
      <li>I already have a Gelish Pro light</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate if you have a UV light.  </li>
      <li>Overall I love it!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, i use it to dry my acrylic nails with opi and essie polish.</li>
      <li>So far I love it!</li>
      <li>, this is an outstanding product that really keeps polish from chipping and protects nail color.</li>
      <li>It was actually more shiny and glossy looking than a regular top coat.  </li>
      <li>but it is quick drying</li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries quickly</li>
      <li>Yes, it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I am very upset!!</li>
      <li>Fast shipment too!!</li>
      <li>and I used an Essie polish (Your Hut or Mine), OPI top coat, and this on my natural nails.</li>
      <li>This product was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>This really came in handy when polishing my 4 year old daughters nails and toes too.  </li>
      <li>Just the same as the Seche Vitae fast dry top coat, this performs beautifully.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for UV light drying the nails and sealing it all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted to be able to dry my nails under my UV light, and not worry about nicking my nails or smudging them on anything.</li>
      <li>If I intend to decorate my nails, I will add the additional touches and use Seche Vitae (not Seche Ultra-V) to secure the changes, additional UV light time is not necessary.  </li>
      <li>Super fast drying in my UV dryer.</li>
      <li>I first air-dry my polish for about three minutes and then put on the Seche Ultra-V topcoat.</li>
      <li>and you are ready to go!</li>
      <li>vacuumed, the whole works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dries fast, but not faster then regular top coat,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I spent 2 hours doing awesome nail art only to have to remove it all the next day...</li>
      <li>My polish chipped the next mornign and easily peeled off that night.  </li>
      <li>long lasting and so far great product.</li>
      <li>Very flexible.</li>
      <li>I use regular nail polishes, when I am done, a coat of this and under the UV light.  </li>
      <li>This topcoat really has staying power.  </li>
      <li>It did cure, was very shiny</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used tons of top coats, Orly, Gel Nail, Hoofer&#x27;s Choice, Sally quick dry, European Secrets Rock, Seche Vite, etc.</li>
      <li>other top coat...</li>
      <li>The nails are fantastic, completely dry and very shiny.  </li>
      <li>Within 3 minutes under the light, my nails were dry and sealed.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a uv light at all for it to dry.</li>
      <li>Total shine and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a good brand (OPI) of regular topcoat.</li>
      <li>not thick feeling on and does not peel off like the gellish topcoat.</li>
      <li>I love doing my toenails, and I was looking for a UV polish that will last through my long work day on my feet.</li>
      <li>Seche Vite quick dry and then topped that off with Kleancolors city lights glitter polish.  </li>
      <li>One week later (with rough use) I still have a fantastic manicure (with exception of wear at the very tips, not noticeable without looking closely at it).  </li>
      <li>it dries fast under UV, dried through 5 coats, including one of them being a top coat itself, and it lasted through the apartment cleaning abuse as if nothing happened and my little hooves still look freshly done.  </li>
      <li>The polish still came out tacky no matter how long I left them under the light.</li>
      <li>After research I realized that the regular nail polish was not going to dry any faster under a light, because of the chemicals it was made out of.</li>
      <li>I did try to use my regular polish and dry them under the light, but that did not work.  </li>
      <li>To finish I used the Seche Ultra V-UV activated topcoat to seal all of the glitter and color on my nail and dried it using a UV light dryer.  </li>
      <li>As far as the UV polish setting and drying under the lamp, I had zero problems.</li>
      <li>My job requires using my hands a lot and frequent handwashing</li>
      <li>All I have to say is WOW.  </li>
      <li>this product needs multiple coats to be really shiny.</li>
      <li>I have gone through 2 bottles so far.</li>
      <li>This keeps polish from chipping and does quickly dry layers of polish, if you follow the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I only gave it four stars, however, since it does tend to dry up rather quickly</li>
      <li>I will admit with this my polish dried pretty quick, but it works just as well as other high end topcoats that don&#x27;t need the UV lamp.</li>
      <li>On the plus side it does dry fast.</li>
      <li>Works great and not to bad on the price.</li>
      <li>My manicure with the Seche UV top coat actually lasted less than a typical manicure.  </li>
      <li>In the past I have had to spend as long as 15 to 20 minutes to make sure my polish was nearly dry.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right</li>
      <li>I used my regular base coat, regular color coat, and then the UV activated top coat, then dry under the light.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is great!! Total shine and dries quickly. The only negative for me is the smell - it&#x27;s a little stong but does go away once it dries and you wash your hands!</li>
    <li> I will admit with this my polish dried pretty quick, but it works just as well as other high end topcoats that don&#x27;t need the UV lamp. Also, my polish started to peel the very next day. Usually my polish lasts 3 days, so this was a bit odd to me. I might give this a second shot since I have a whole bottle, but I won&#x27;t get my hopes up :/</li>
    <li> Seche Ultra V UV Topcoat is about the best I have used since getting my nails professionally done and that has been about 15 years.  With Seche my time spent under the UV lamp was shortened. In the past I have had to spend as long as 15 to 20 minutes to make sure my polish was nearly dry.  With Seche Ultra, I only spent about 6 minutes. My nails were dry and proof was no smudges after leaving the shop. It has protected my polish also. Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> This top coat dries well with the UV light and looks nice.  But I was dissapointed in its performance though.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a good brand (OPI) of regular topcoat.</li>
    <li> I used this top coat over a normal nail polish manicure and I loved it! It made my manicure last a week longer than usual. Super fast drying in my UV dryer. Overall I love it!!</li>
    <li> I do like this product needs multiple coats to be really shiny. I LOVE the brand!  There&#x27;s no build up from it!</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed that this was not uv activated like it says it is. On the plus side it does dry fast. You don&#x27;t need a uv light at all for it to dry. It air dries and gives a pretty good shine but after a few days you&#x27;ll want to reapply another coat to keep it shiny. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and the industry I&#x27;m in. I sell nuts, bolts and other construction items so maybe I&#x27;m just to rough on the polish. I&#x27;m not sure. If you&#x27;re looking for uv activated and durability this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I just received this topcoat a few days ago, and although I did not purchase it from here, I wanted to place a review.  This topcoat really has staying power.  I am the type that gets bored with her nails each week, so I did 2 coats of lavender metallic polish, topped it off with Seche Vite quick dry and then topped that off with Kleancolors city lights glitter polish.  To finish I used the Seche Ultra V-UV activated topcoat to seal all of the glitter and color on my nail and dried it using a UV light dryer.  All I have to say is WOW.  Within 3 minutes under the light, my nails were dry and sealed.  So, I had to put this to the test.  I cleaned my apt right after. I figured, if this is a great topcoat, it has to survive a major cleaning.  I took out the trash, scrubbed the counters, did the dishes, then proceeded to scrub my tub (Ajax and scrubber), changed the cat litter, vacuumed, the whole works! Then did a wash and blow out on my hair, hopped in the shower and used loofah mitts to scrub down.  I was expecting it to be chip nation but instead, my nails looked like they were just done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used tons of top coats, Orly, Gel Nail, Hoofer&#x27;s Choice, Sally quick dry, European Secrets Rock, Seche Vite, etc. and this one is the best! it dries fast under UV, dried through 5 coats, including one of them being a top coat itself, and it lasted through the apartment cleaning abuse as if nothing happened and my little hooves still look freshly done.  I highly recommend this for UV light drying the nails and sealing it all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make your manicure last longer than gels would but it is quick drying so you can paint your nails and finish with this top coat and you are ready to go!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, i use it to dry my acrylic nails with opi and essie polish. I cure thier nails with a uv light for 3 mins.... and their good to go!!!!  also french manicure do not yellow with this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to buy this.  I really love Gel manicures, and I wanted to start a Gel nail polish collection.  I soon realized how expensive that was going to be.  I already had a collection of regular nail polish colors I just couldn&#x27;t part with.  I wanted to be able to dry my nails under my UV light, and not worry about nicking my nails or smudging them on anything. However, this is only possible with Gel polish.  I did try to use my regular polish and dry them under the light, but that did not work.  The polish still came out tacky no matter how long I left them under the light. After research I realized that the regular nail polish was not going to dry any faster under a light, because of the chemicals it was made out of. I was beginning to think that I would have to switch to all Gel polish in order for the UV light to work they way I wanted it to (no nicking or smudging immediately after use).  Then I found this product.  I used my regular base coat, regular color coat, and then the UV activated top coat, then dry under the light.  It worked perfectly!  My nails we dry and the polish was hardened. There was no chance of the polish smudging or getting nicked on anything. This really came in handy when polishing my 4 year old daughters nails and toes too.  When it came time for removal, it was very easy compared to Gel polish having to be soaked off. I read some reviews that the polish was too thin or didn&#x27;t last as long.  But my polish was the same consistency as regular nail polish, and lasted just as long.  It was actually more shiny and glossy looking than a regular top coat.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to use a UV topcoat with regular polish.  Note: If you use a regular color coat and put a &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; topcoat over it, the topcoat tends to crack.  This is because the Gel and regular polish are made of different things.  This product did not do that with my manicures.</li>
    <li> I got this product after reading rave reviews about it. People are liars!! I have had gel and acrylic nails continuously for years and have never had the problems I had with this topcoat. I put it on and let it cure for 8 minutes, way longer than the recommended 3 minutes. It did cure, was very shiny but it smells horrible. Not even 24 hours later, my polish was badly chipped on 4 fingers and most of the polish on my thumb was gone. I will never use this again!! I was very disappointed...My job requires using my hands a lot and frequent handwashing and I can usually go 3-4 weeks without having to worry about my nail polish. I didn&#x27;t even go to work or wash my hands more than twice after using this product and my nails looked horrible. I have a bottle of cheap topcoat from the dollar store that lasts longer. Never again!! I spent 2 hours doing awesome nail art only to have to remove it all the next day...I am very upset!! 0 stars!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it dries quickly. I had expectations that my manicure would last longer than a regualr manicure.  My manicure with the Seche UV top coat actually lasted less than a typical manicure.  My polish chipped the next mornign and easily peeled off that night.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing for my at-home pedicures. I love doing my toenails, and I was looking for a UV polish that will last through my long work day on my feet. My pedicure lasted for over two weeks with little to no chipping. I love this stuff! As far as the UV polish setting and drying under the lamp, I had zero problems. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This product was worth the wait. Works great and not to bad on the price. would for sure recomend!!!!! Fast shipment too!! A+++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> I work at a top salon and we use Gelish, OPI, Essie, and Seche.  I was getting Gelish manicures every 2-3 weeks and am still IN LOVE with Gelish but needed to save some money so I bought this.  I already have a Gelish Pro light so I don&#x27;t have to wait the 3 minutes to have it dry (45 second setting 1-2 usually does it) and I used an Essie polish (Your Hut or Mine), OPI top coat, and this on my natural nails. One week later (with rough use) I still have a fantastic manicure (with exception of wear at the very tips, not noticeable without looking closely at it).  I was expecting chipping, peeling, and the shine to fade but it hasn&#x27;t.  It looks like I have a Gelish manicure but for far less time and money.  I&#x27;m trying a french manicure once I have the time to do it and if it doesn&#x27;t last as long I&#x27;ll update my post. So far I love it!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OK VERY THIN AND RUNNY. THE PRICE IS GOOD YOU HAVE TO GET USE TO HOW THIN IT IS OR YOU END UP WITH IT EVERYWHERE;(</li>
    <li> Just the same as the Seche Vitae fast dry top coat, this performs beautifully.  A nice consistency.  I use this to cure false nails that are not gel nor acrylics.  I use regular nail polishes, when I am done, a coat of this and under the UV light.  The nails are fantastic, completely dry and very shiny.  Don&#x27;t hesitate if you have a UV light.  If I intend to decorate my nails, I will add the additional touches and use Seche Vitae (not Seche Ultra-V) to secure the changes, additional UV light time is not necessary.  Very flexible.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl and she seems to think it is ok but could be better, so I assume it is good. Sorry I can not be more helpful.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m putting it on wrong or I have a defective one,but this UV Topcoat sucks.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly but then it dulls up as if I just put just water on my nails. Another thing is a Uv topcoat sometimes takes all of the ridges out of an enhancement if there is any, and i noticed that this topcoat seems to create ridges instead of filling them.</li>
    <li> long lasting and so far great product. not thick feeling on and does not peel off like the gellish topcoat.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with any directions on how long to cure in uv light but every time I do it shrinks to the point that it looks horrible. Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dries fast, but not faster then regular top coat,&lt;br /&gt;I had before Sally Hansen Insta-Dry and&lt;br /&gt;it does the same job, but without UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the smell, and the fact that it didn&#x27;t make my&lt;br /&gt;nail polish stay longer then other top coat... Will not recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I use this top coat with a 9 watt florescent uv light. It dries in 30-60 sec. I have gone through 2 bottles so far. It also comes off easily with Acetone without soaking your nail for 15 minutes. I use regular base coat, 2 coats of regular color and last, two coats of uv top coat. I have no fading, dulling or other weird results.</li>
    <li> This keeps polish from chipping and does quickly dry layers of polish, if you follow the directions exactly. I first air-dry my polish for about three minutes and then put on the Seche Ultra-V topcoat. It glides on and gives the polish a glass-like, mirror-like shine, almost equivalent to that of gel polish, which I have stopped using as it is too hard to remove and damages your nails! I only gave it four stars, however, since it does tend to dry up rather quickly and I have noted crystals forming around the lip of the bottle.  It has to be shaken vigorously before use.  Other than that, this is an outstanding product that really keeps polish from chipping and protects nail color.</li>
