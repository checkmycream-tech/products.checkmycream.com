      <li>I have very fine lair and a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>Strongly recommended!</li>

      <li>They heat very quickly, hold the heat, and have an excellent clip that holds very well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, the color change is a VERY nice feature and even though they don&#x27;t seem hot, in fact they are and the curl stays.</li>
      <li>My issue with these rollers isn&#x27;t their quality - they work excellently, heat up quickly and are very compact to store.  </li>
      <li>They also deliver great curls, mine lasted 2 days and were nicer than the large set of&lt;BR</li>
      <li>I now have 3 sets and it seems like a good number for a whole head of hair!!</li>
      <li>I would buy products from this seller again for sure.</li>
      <li>so I knew I needed more.</li>
      <li>love that I can see when they are hot/cold by the color.  </li>
      <li>These Conair are the next best thing to the Clairol curlers.</li>
      <li>The size of the rollers is perfect for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>I am going to buy clips to see if they work better.</li>
      <li>The rollers take a long time to heat and the clips are not the greatest to use for the rollers.  </li>
      <li>They are just great and make my hair so soft.  </li>
      <li>I compare this set to an old set of Clairol hot rollers I have that is the greatest.  </li>
      <li>I loved that set so much</li>
      <li>As for the seller - great communication and super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>However, this set has given me the most beautiful curls, when my hair was medium length or long.</li>
      <li>They are also compact and easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is probably medium/long in length</li>
      <li>The curlers heat up almost instantly (90 seconds) and the curls are great.  </li>
      <li>Have fun with this. : )</li>
      <li>I have purchased this set for the 3rd time and LOVE IT!!  </li>
      <li>This product is very useful for at home use and traveling.  </li>
      <li>Because the stay cool end band sits up, it&#x27;s very easy to keep your fingers away from the hot part of the roller.  </li>
      <li>Also, these plastic clips are not travel friendly.</li>
      <li>Most of the time the clips would pop off and the roller would fall out if I so much as turned my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Compact set, but need a couple more to set my whole head with on heat up.</li>
      <li>The good news, is that I have finally found a travel set which meets the needs of shoulder lenght hair or shoulder.  </li>
      <li>it gets very hot and burns your fingers.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes it would work well because I loved my old set</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend, also they are very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I love that they get really hot and really fast.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something quality, compact and easy to use that will stay in your hair until YOU&#x27;RE ready to take them out, I&#x27;d recommend that set instead of this one.</li>
      <li>The unit is compact and just the right thing for quick curls while on the tourist trek.  </li>
      <li>okay if you have fine, short to medium length hair.  </li>
      <li>I only have to leave them in for about a minute or two for some nice waves.</li>
      <li>They are worth the process of ordering and waiting.</li>
      <li>The case and rollers are very cute and compact, the universal voltage and &amp;quot;color change function&amp;quot; of the rollers is pretty neat.</li>
      <li>I would give this four stars for the clips, but I felt that enough people have already complained about this factor and those are so easy to replace that I would rather rate the curlers which I think are great!</li>
      <li>I think with normal metal hot roller clips they would be fine, but with the plastic ones they either fall out or leave a crimp in your hair.  </li>
      <li>The 2 different size curlers are great for different hair styles.</li>
      <li>The Clairol hot roller set has very lightweight flocked rollers with a plastic band around each end that sits up and stays cool to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I am a african american and this is the best product for synthetic and human hair</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a small travel set, this is about the most compact I have been able to find.  </li>
      <li>They do get really hot and it does curl hair</li>
      <li>First off</li>
      <li>I do sometimes get the crimped look on top with the old set, but I go to war with the new set.  </li>
      <li>The new set I bought from Remington has some white clips that you squeeze and place around hair and roller, which I liked.  </li>
      <li>The rollers didn&#x27;t work for my hair, however the seller went out of there way to find a new set of rollers that would work for my type of hair and they refunded me in full will no problems.</li>
      <li>These little rollers are amazing.  </li>
      <li>They heat up in about 2 minutes, and curl very well.</li>
      <li>They take up almost as much space as the rollers.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
      <li>fit on the same heating pin.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has been very misleading.</li>
      <li>I was very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>Very compact and heat well.</li>
      <li>Even the best result I got was just nothing, nothing but a very slight volume, nothing that couldn&#x27;t be accomplished with a little hair gel and a blow dryer.   </li>
      <li>Back to the Clairol rollers - they are very easy to use and stay in, but the set I have is a set of 18 which is way too big for travel.  </li>
      <li>(it was blue not pink) but it died on me after many years of use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The only issue is sometimes the clips leave a dent in your hair, so make sure you have a second after you take them out to adjust or undo the dent</li>
      <li>I bought these curlers for a trip to europe, mainly for the size and dual voltage.</li>
      <li>I have relatively fine, straight hair, which is typically curl resistant.</li>
      <li>They definitely add curl &amp; body to my hair just not quite as much as with my large non-travel size remington rollers.</li>
      <li>I have been using this new set for two months and used it on a month&#x27;s vacation.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to touch the hot part of the Remington blue rollers which is not much fun -</li>
      <li>With the Clairol set, you could order any size rollers you wantedso if you wanted all small, or more jumbo or any combo you wanted, you could have it.  </li>
      <li>- I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough.</li>
      <li>I had bought these hair rollers a few years back at a local Kmart and LOVED THEM.</li>
      <li>They are too heavy, the pins don&#x27;t stay in place easily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is very useful for at home use and traveling.  The small size is convenient for packing.  I use this each day.  The size of the rollers is perfect for my short hair.  I would give this product a 10!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this set for the 3rd time and LOVE IT!!  I keep looking for Remington products on-line because they are not available in my local area and this set is so unique.  This product is so small and lightweight compared to those big bulky curler sets (like Mom used to use).   &lt;br /&gt;I love that I can see when they are hot/cold by the color.  I love that they get really hot and really fast.  They are also compact and easy to travel with.  I have used this model set since it came in blue and I think another color before that in the mid-90&#x27;s.  I am on my 3rd set in 8+ yrs and will buy them again when these need to be replaced! &lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and lots of it.  It&#x27;s down below my shoulder blades and one length all over.  I have a difficult time finding rollers that will heat up quickly and get hot enough to set and hold my hair without falling the second I take them out.  This set does the trick and I can put them in and do my makeup and pull them out and voila!   &lt;br /&gt;I did find that I need to buy larger clips because I have never been able to use those silly hairpin style clips with any set...too much hair.  The new set I bought from Remington has some white clips that you squeeze and place around hair and roller, which I liked.  Although they are still too small to hold all of my long hair, that is the type of clip that I buy large ones of from a local beauty supply store to use with the rollers. &lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up for me!</li>
    <li> Just purchased these hot curlers for trip to Europe and they are the best!  The unit is compact and just the right thing for quick curls while on the tourist trek.  The curlers heat up almost instantly (90 seconds) and the curls are great.  Just put the curlers back for a reheat and curl the rest of your hair.  I had no problems with clips staying on.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This product works well making curls if you can get the clips to stay on the rollers. The old style had metal pins which kept the rollers in place. The plastic clips often fall off letting the roller fall out, leave clip marks (bend lines where the curl starts) on your hair and make the curler heavier.  Great curl but bad clips. The curler set is quite compact and will take up little room in your bathroom and/or luggage. I think you can buy metal pins to replace the clips but then there isn&#x27;t a storage area for them as in the previous model.</li>
    <li> This product is great - However it&#x27;s been been discontinued from the MFG and you can no longer gets parts or accessories for this model.</li>
    <li> I had bought these hair rollers a few years back at a local Kmart and LOVED THEM. I only bought one set which contains 10 rollers. With only 10 rollers it takes a while to roll a full head of thick long hair so I knew I needed more. Well turns out Kmart, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens doesnt sell these rollers anymore which led me to look online. They are worth the process of ordering and waiting. They dont rip your hair or get tangled. They are pink and turn white when they are hot and ready. Very helpful, takes about 1 minute to heat up and they curl BEAUTIFULLY. Not like the other rollers that have the prongs around them and pull hair while taking them out. I would recommened all girls that need good rollers to get these. I now have 3 sets and it seems like a good number for a whole head of hair!!</li>
    <li> I am a african american and this is the best product for synthetic and human hair weave, i wear tree braids all the time and these rollers are so easy to set my hair with beautiful curls. I strongly recommend, also they are very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The curlers that they send is not the set shown in the picture. I have been looking for the blue set with the clips shown , but that is not what you get when you order this product. You get a black and pink set that has different horrible white clips.I was very dissappointed. I already own this set and do not like it at all. I thought I was ordering the set shown in the picture. Amazon has been very misleading.</li>
    <li> I simply wanted to coment on the review given by Jennifer.  She complains that instead of the pictured set she recieved a pink and black set.  Um, Jennifer, the picture IS a pink and black set.  You said something about looking for a blue set so you bought this one.  I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re logic is, perhaps you put your coment on the wrong page.  I don&#x27;t think Amazon is misleading at all, I think you simply made mistake.</li>
    <li> The rollers take a long time to heat and the clips are not the greatest to use for the rollers.  I was a little disappointed since I&#x27;ve bought Remington products before and had been happy with other purchases.</li>
    <li> As said by others, the rollers are extremely heavy; the clips aren&#x27;t really clips....more of a barrel and hard to get to stay in; and the rollers don&#x27;t appear to get as hot as other sets. However, the color change is a VERY nice feature and even though they don&#x27;t seem hot, in fact they are and the curl stays. I am going to buy clips to see if they work better.</li>
    <li> I have very fine lair and a lot of it.  My hair is a little below my shoulder and these curlers really do the trick.  I only have to leave them in for about a minute or two for some nice waves. The set is small and it comes with 2 sets of clips - one for the big rollers and one for the small.  Great size for travel, can squeeze into a suitcase and seem like it&#x27;s not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is sometimes the clips leave a dent in your hair, so make sure you have a second after you take them out to adjust or undo the dent (looks like a tiny crimp horizontally).  Overall, for the price, size and ease, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> For travel rollers these are the way to go. Very compact and heat well. They definitely add curl &amp; body to my hair just not quite as much as with my large non-travel size remington rollers. The only down side to the travel ones are that the actual rollers are heavy due to the heating elements in the rollers...and the pins don&#x27;t hold the rollers on my head well. I use the pins from my non-travel set &amp; they work great.  Overall, for the cost &amp; small size of the roller case I think they are fabulous!</li>
    <li> I had two sets of these that I used for years.  They quit working around two years ago and I have tried everything else on the market and did not like any of them.    Just on chance I tried Amazon, and yeaaa  found them here at Discounts Jungle.  Just plugged these in and they heated up perfectly.  I am a happy camper!!</li>
    <li> out standing job thank you its awsome</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a small travel set, this is about the most compact I have been able to find.  I like the small size of this set but I find it is frustrating to use because the rollers are so heavy - the weight of the rollers makes it difficult to keep the rollers in my hair and they often fall out.  Also, the metal pins that hold the rollers on also get loose which again, causes the rollers to fall out of your hair.  I phoned the manufacturer when I purchased this set to ask why on earth they had made the rollers so heavy.  I was told the heating elements are in each of the individual curlers (!) and this is how they can make the unit so small (there is no heating element on the bottom of the set - it is instead inside each roller.)  Be forewarned, if your hair is too short, the curlers will not stay in because of their weight.  I had a shorter haircut once, and there was no way I could use this roller set - the curlers would absolutely not stay in!  I compare this set to an old set of Clairol hot rollers I have that is the greatest.  The Clairol hot roller set has very lightweight flocked rollers with a plastic band around each end that sits up and stays cool to the touch.  Because the stay cool end band sits up, it&#x27;s very easy to keep your fingers away from the hot part of the roller.  It&#x27;s easy to touch the hot part of the Remington blue rollers which is not much fun - it gets very hot and burns your fingers.  Back to the Clairol rollers - they are very easy to use and stay in, but the set I have is a set of 18 which is way too big for travel.  Clairol had the best rollers.  Another neat thing about the Clairol set was, you could have small, medium, or large rollers and they all fit on the same heating pin.  Some other manufacturers sets would come with certain size rollers that you could not change, for instance, they&#x27;d have 6 medium and 6 jumbo rollers and you have no option to change it.  With the Clairol set, you could order any size rollers you wantedso if you wanted all small, or more jumbo or any combo you wanted, you could have it.  If any manufacturers are reading this review, P-L-E-A-S-E produce a 6 or 8 travel flocked roller set like the old Clairol sets.  They would sell like hotcakes!  The Remington is the best I could find for now, so go for it if you have long (at least shoulder length) hair and can stand a little frustration with trying to keep the rollers in!!!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the rest of the negative reviews. I purchased these curlers for travel, and their practically useless. First, the curlers are too heavy and do not stay in your hair. Second, the clips do not hold the heavy curler. Very disappointing :{. The good news, is that I have finally found a travel set which meets the needs of shoulder lenght hair or shoulder.  &lt;br /&gt; The product I would purchase instead is the Conair Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter, Model HS 28. The Conair curlers are perfect for traveling &amp; camping! I too am a big fan of the Clairol curlers from long ago. These Conair are the next best thing to the Clairol curlers.</li>
    <li> I bought this set directly from the manufacturer.  I have the previous old set that I&#x27;ve gone back to using because the rollers are far easier to put in place and they stay in place.  I do sometimes get the crimped look on top with the old set, but I go to war with the new set.  I have been using this new set for two months and used it on a month&#x27;s vacation.  I had high hopes it would work well because I loved my old set and it is compact.  It was a battle to keep the rollers in place.  They are too heavy, the pins don&#x27;t stay in place easily.  If you have short or thin hair, they want to fall out.</li>
    <li> This is the set I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I had one years ago (it was blue not pink) but it died on me after many years of use.  I went out to look for another set only to find they didn&#x27;t make it anymore.  People always complimented my beautiful hair and I had no luck duplicating the same curls with other rollers. I loved that set so much I continued my search every so often hoping they would make these again - finally I&#x27;ve found them again - Yah!  The only difference is the clips.  I don&#x27;t like the metal ones anyway.  I will advise however if you have lots of thick hair you may need a sturdier set of clips.  Ordering a set of clips to go with this wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me though as I was wanting the rollers themselves.  They are just great and make my hair so soft.  It only takes 5 minutes for my hair to set with these.  I am very happy with this purchase.  As for the seller - great communication and super fast shipping.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> The pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use.  I don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> My last set of Remington curlers, very similar to this set, lasted over 10 years and I was very happy to see that they still made a comparable model.  The curlers heat up quickly and do a great job curling your hair. The 2 different size curlers are great for different hair styles. I prefer the original metal clips that came with my first set as the plastics ones with this one do not fit if you have long hair. Overall I would recommend this set to someone with shoulder length or short hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been the owner of several Remington Express Sets in my lifetime.  All of them have worked wonderfully.  My issue with these rollers isn&#x27;t their quality - they work excellently, heat up quickly and are very compact to store.  The only problem is that instead of pins, they come with clippy-type holders to keep them in your hair.  I suppose the clips would work okay if you have fine, short to medium length hair.  I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not very thick, and the clip holders would not keep the rollers in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only put a VERY small section of hair around the roller if I had any hope of it staying put on my head.  Most of the time the clips would pop off and the roller would fall out if I so much as turned my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington has another set of compact express rollers called \\&quot;All That\\&quot;, which are almost identical in function, only they come with pins instead of the clips.  If you&#x27;re looking for something quality, compact and easy to use that will stay in your hair until YOU&#x27;RE ready to take them out, I&#x27;d recommend that set instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers after a friend lent her set to me in college (back in &#x27;97). I have relatively fine, straight hair, which is typically curl resistant. However, this set has given me the most beautiful curls, when my hair was medium length or long. I haven&#x27;t found another set that performs this well! Strongly recommended!</li>
    <li> The seller of this product was Excellent... The rollers didn&#x27;t work for my hair, however the seller went out of there way to find a new set of rollers that would work for my type of hair and they refunded me in full will no problems. I would buy products from this seller again for sure. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful travel set!  I have fine hair that is probably medium/long in length and this works perfectly.  I already had a remington set of curlers but hate carrying such a large item when travling.  When I received this, I was pleased to see its smaller than I thought -- not much bigger than a small makeup case.  The curlers work great.  They heat up in 90 seconds as promised, but I waited probably about 3-4 minutes for them to fully heat up (the color fades away completely).  I was skeptical because they didn&#x27;t seem hot enough, but they really worked well and my hair held all night.  Unfortunately, my previous set has those stupid clips as well and what everyone says about them is true -- they are annoying, don&#x27;t hold well, and crease your hair in the end.  I&#x27;ve always hated them, but when you use just a regular metal pin they work perfectly.  I would give this four stars for the clips, but I felt that enough people have already complained about this factor and those are so easy to replace that I would rather rate the curlers which I think are great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for everyday styling years ago, but after going to a very short &#x27;do, I eventually got rid of them. Lately &#x27;ve been letting my hair grow out and decided to go back to trusty old hot rollers.  Not much has changed, but I wanted to try a newer type of roller, one that dispensed with metal clips and I thought the grippy coating on these would be nice.   I&#x27;ve thrown them out, having found them useless. First off - I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough. Second off, the plastic clips they come with don&#x27;t hold hair tightly - even if I managed to get them on tight, they quickly loosened and the rollers are then flopping around, unrolling. Even the best result I got was just nothing, nothing but a very slight volume, nothing that couldn&#x27;t be accomplished with a little hair gel and a blow dryer.   \Very disappointing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set at all.</li>
    <li> These little rollers are amazing.  The &amp;quot;Large&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Extra Large&amp;quot; are generous terms.  At first I thought they would not work for me--I have long hair.   The rollers are very small and compact and pack easily.  They also deliver great curls, mine lasted 2 days and were nicer than the large set of&lt;BR&gt;rollers I use at home.</li>
    <li> These are the best curlers I&#x27;ve ever used. They heat very quickly, hold the heat, and have an excellent clip that holds very well and is easy to use. I prefer these to a curling iron because I can put them in, then go to another task. They are lightweight and great for traveling. They heat up in about 2 minutes, and curl very well. I like them so well, I bought extra sets as gifts for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Nice set, but they don&#x27;t work the best because of the clips.  I think with normal metal hot roller clips they would be fine, but with the plastic ones they either fall out or leave a crimp in your hair.  Compact set, but need a couple more to set my whole head with on heat up.</li>
    <li> This is a standard but convenient set of rollers. The case and rollers are very cute and compact, the universal voltage and &amp;quot;color change function&amp;quot; of the rollers is pretty neat. Have fun with this. : )</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers for a trip to europe, mainly for the size and dual voltage. They were a huge disappointment for me, mainly because of the clips! It is true that the rollers are heavy. My hair is very thick, but even with minimal hair around the curler, the clips kept popping off. Once I got the clips to stay and left them on to set, I had clip marks left in my hair! The only way I could use them was to use the metal pins from my old set. Also, these plastic clips are not travel friendly. They take up almost as much space as the rollers. And my set did not heat up in 90 seconds at home or abroad. Sorry, but dont get these if you have thick hair or don&#x27;t have a backup set of clips!</li>
    <li> My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn&#x27;t curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else.</li>
    <li> There was a problem with the clips: one small one was missing and there was an extra large one which means you can&#x27;t use two of the small rollers.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome set to own. They do get really hot and it does curl hair too&lt;br /&gt;Take anywhere you want</li>
