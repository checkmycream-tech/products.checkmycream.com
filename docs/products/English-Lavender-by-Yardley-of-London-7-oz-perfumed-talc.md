<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LIKED IT VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY THE LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> I purchased this powder and also the Lily of the Valley from the same seller. One of the cans was not even sealed and one of the tins of powder was damaged and scratched. Was not packaged very well either.</li>
    <li> I love Yardley English Lavender talc.  It is affordable and an excellent product.  I would recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful talc.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find dusting/bath powder in stores locally, and when you do they are the type applied with a powder puff.  The talcum ends up all over the floors and rugs.  The Yardley can be applied with much less mess, it feels smooth and light on your skin and the scent is heavenly.</li>
    <li> love this product, love all Yardley of LOndon</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of lavender</li>
    <li> Nice talc, but came in a defective container with talc all over the box it was shipped in.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, I have been wearing body talcs for as long as I can remember. It helps keep you dry and smelling nice. Baby powder is great too but I am 50 years and don&#x27;t really want to smell like a child. All I would say is try it you will love it.  I am also welder this works great all day. Its great to take care of yourself inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Bob Kelley</li>
    <li> If you love lavender, it is for you!</li>
    <li> I use this along with Yardley of London cologne spray-its not overbearing and has a soft fragrance that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day-also makes me fee more feminine.</li>
    <li> Yardley English Lavender Talc is soothing and calming. It smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;and makes you feel like a princess. It is truly addictive.</li>
    <li> This is a very luxurious perfumed talc.  Makes you feel like a queen.  Beautiful scent.  Therefore, I would highly recommend purchasing this product.  DAME HILDA</li>
    <li> We buy this My MIL every Christmas, it&#x27;s her favourite.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed, there is hardly any smell or such a slight smell of the scent of Yardleys.&lt;br /&gt;I like having the perfume of the talc that gives a very subtle smell instead of using perfume. But you can&#x27;t smell anything. Don&#x27;t know if its old, they perhaps watered it down with other talc, or this is just how it is. I have soap that smells stronger than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve always liked English lavender. I bought it from Amazon because although it&#x27;s easy to find Lavender soaps in stores, no one that I know of seems to carry the talc. This is also true of the English Tweed, which I just reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thank you, Amazon, for carrying these hard-to-get products. And although I like the Lavender ok, it can&#x27;t compare to the Tweed experience.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like English lavender Talc..It is the Best, Could not find this in the USA at this price!</li>
    <li> When I was a kid my mom always had their room smelling like this english lavender....always smelling rich and springy.....now...with me...many years later....my fav thing to do with the talc is when i change my bed sheets...i sprinkle it all over my mattress....then lay the sheets down...with my pillowcases....i sprinkle the pillows then cover them with the cases....i guarantee you will have such a joyous sleep for the next few days......I&#x27;m ording more.....Lavender is my favorite by far</li>
    <li> A generous sized container and the good quality product from Yardley.</li>
    <li> My favourite fragrance. I received the product in the time indicated. One of the containers was slightly dented, otherwise fine. I am satisfied with the service.  S. Hardin</li>
    <li> Delightful talc and nice scent of lavender made in UK well made and nice metal talc container.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again one depleted.</li>
    <li> This was a much sought out gift for my mother.  She loves everything Yardley has to offer, especially their Lavender Talc.  She was overjoyed that I could find the talc for her which is increasing difficult to find here in the States.</li>
    <li> Great product. Brings back the scent of spring and days gone by. I recommend this for anyone young and old.</li>
    <li> My wife was trying to find a source for English Lavender by Yardley of London talcum powder. Finally asked me to try if Amazon had it. I did. They did. I ordered. It came. She loved it. (She is now an Amazon fan).</li>
    <li> Finely milled - beautiful fragrance - they make the best rose and lavender powder and have done so for over 60 years (at least that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been using it).</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful bath product. Its so relaxing and smells os good.  Its great for those hot sticky days  Bought two</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here...although it arrived on time...but it was worth the wait.  I got lily of the valley. And lavender  Both are nice, but the lavender really smells authentic.  Talc is very soothing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of lavendar and Yardley seems to excell in the use of it in their products. Their soaps are too harsh for my skin, but this powder is working out very well. I will definitely be ordering more when this is gone. It was shipped from Britain, but I was pleasantly suprised to find that the shipping fee was much less than some of the talcs that I ordered from firms here in the States. A good experience all around.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love this lavender powder.  It takes me back to England every time I use it.  The fragrance is not too strong and not too weak.  I&#x27;ve bought three tins and have given them as gifts.</li>
    <li> This has an &amp;#34;old-lady-like&amp;#34; smell to it, there is definitely lavender involved, but it is not the fresh smell I prefer.  I thought I&#x27;d try it though.</li>
    <li> omg love it ...&lt;br /&gt;smells so nice&lt;br /&gt;n made in the UK&lt;br /&gt;DO recommend</li>
    <li> Standard product, should be the same every time</li>
    <li> Shades of my youth!  The scent and silky texture are the same as they were 50 years ago. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  The English Lavender is different from any powders you can buy here in the states.  Love the fact that it is satiny smooth and the scent has never changed as far back as I can remember.</li>
    <li> I will be buying it again for sure! Great fragrance, nice big size.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance...beautiful container.  Good gift.</li>
    <li> This powder is cooling and refreshing and makes you feel clean and stay clean after the shower.  I love sprinkling it on me and also in my shoes before I slip my bare feet in them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always appreciate the smell of lavender in body sprays, soaps, or perfume because they can be a little strong, but I just love this powder and it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent.  I&#x27;ve used it for 20 years but its much more difficult to find these days.</li>
    <li> Love Yardley Lavendar anything!  Wonder why we don&#x27;t carry it in the states anymore.  Yardley is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product during a flight layover at Abu Dhabi. I never considered myself as a lavander lover but this lavander powder it&#x27;s exquisite! It leaves on you a soothing and sophisticated sensation. Hubby prediction: 99.9% will go nuts.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d really like this, but again I wasted my money.  It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to mask odour, instead it mixed with the odour and created a monster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that&#x27;s just my experience.  Many others have had a good turn with this product.</li>
    <li> On a hot sticky day lavender powder is just the thing to make you feel human again!</li>
    <li> GREAT AFTER A SHOWER BEFORE BED.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before ordering this product. One stated that the tin had arrived damaged. I thought what are the chances of that happening again? When the product arrived it was in a soft padded envelope. Not only was the tin dented but it was crushed, broken open and powder was in the envelope. It is extremely wasteful and disappointing. The manufacturer must know the packaging is not sufficient protection for international shipping and just doesn&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> AFTER A SHOWER THIS IS LOVELY TO USE.  I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW NICE TALCUM POWDER FEELS ON HOT SUMMER DAYS.  IT KEEPS YOU DRY AND FEELING FRESH.</li>
    <li> A stronger fragrance than expected, but still nice.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this powder for my wife for a number of years but it has been unavailable lately. It&#x27;s back again &amp; she is very happy.</li>
    <li> Yardley was my grandmother&#x27;s favorite product, and now it is mine, too.  I plan to continue ordering in the future.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere to replace my old English Lavender Powder. But, it seems that the frangrance is different now. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Too strong a perfume scent.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older I prefer a nice body power instead of perfume.  This one has just a nice scent.  Not too heavy nor too light.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I got it much sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent.  Never iritates skin. Using it for years - straight from London England. Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase two, but only one was available.  I hope that ADZ continues to carry this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My wife prefers to use a box with a powder puff, so she tranferred some into the box she uses for home and for travel and still had 1/2 a can left over!</li>
    <li> Deliciously scented with lavender, and fondly reminiscent of Britain, of which I am quite fond. I have friends there... shopping in Fenwick&#x27;s Dept Store for Yardley&#x27;s is a good memory for me.</li>
    <li> Wife is a big fan of Lavender products and this was a welcome addition to her collection. All their products are really great.</li>
    <li> WE TRAVELED TO NASSAU RECENTLY AND A GOOD FRIEN WHO IS ENGLISH BORN , WANTED  ME TO BRING HER BACK  A CANISTER OF YARDLY POWDER. SHE HAD BOUGHT IT WHILE VISITING NASSAU MANY TIMES. I COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE SO I ORDER FROM AMAZON. I RECEIVED THE POWDER ONE DAY AFTER OUR RETURN FROM THE ISLAND. NOW THAT IS FAST SERVICE!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother for a Christmas present and she loved it!!!! Would recommend this for anyone with a girlfriend,mother,or mother-in-law to impress!!!</li>
    <li> This is my mother&#x27;s preferred brand of Lavender Bath Powder. We have more problems finding Yardleys talc these days however.</li>
    <li> Soft but very definable lavender scent. Using it feels relaxing. I purchased it for a gift and turned around and purchased one for myself.</li>
    <li> Received the Yardley English Lavender, direct from England, almost as fast as if it was local.&lt;br /&gt;Initially the system said it would be 5 to 6 weeks, but the English Lavender Talc arrived in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed and extremely pleased.  Exactly what I ordered, at the same price it used to be, when you could find it.&lt;br /&gt;I say that because I am no longer able to find anyone who has it available.  The only difference is the color of the can.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Keith in Illinois</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for someone who has used Yardley products since birth.  High quality and name recognition.</li>
    <li> The most beautiful texture and fragrance if you like talcum powder. I first found in the UK.and have been searching  for a U.S. Vendor. I should have known that Amazon would be the place. Everyone try to use Amazon Smile. Your favorite charity will benefit and you are shopping anyway.</li>
    <li> It is for my mother. She has used your products for years.&lt;br /&gt;If she did not like it I would not get it for her.  She is in a home and&lt;br /&gt;it makes her happy to use things from her youth.</li>
    <li> I love lavender, and this powder is so pleasant and refreshing. It has a soft fragrance and the texture is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best of any lavender bath powder, I&#x60;ve tried! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves this scent and Yardley. Well worth the cost! Reasonable here vs other places, that sell it. I plan to order spme more, as soon as I can. I recommend this seller, too!</li>
    <li> I, myself, am quite partial to lavender. Lavender is farmed and harvested in many parts of the world,---including the United States of America. There is also English lavender, French lavender, Spanish lavender, etc. Sometimes, the flower differs,---depending upon the region where it is cultivated and grown. For instance, French lavender looks quite different from Spanish lavender. I am assuming that since Yardley is an old and established English company, the lavender used in their products is grown in England. When we were in the south of France, we saw many lavender fields. It was a most beautiful sight to behold, and the scent was amazing. Lavender is a homeopathic flower. It is beneficial to both humans and to pets. Although this particular product is not for pussycats, there are quite a few pet products which do contain lavender. Mumzy states that the Yardley company has been well established for many years. Their products are quite wonderful. Lavender also helps one to relax, and to eliminate stress. Bees and hummingbirds love lavender as well. Now, I have something in common with them,---for I adore lavender!</li>
    <li> this is a scam and not the yardley powder i am used to getting in stores. the cap was altered and the talc smelt like weird baby powder</li>
    <li> Yardley of London English Lavender Body Powders is a must. Talcum powder is so hard to find these days. I was amazed to find English Lavender by Yardley of London Perfumed Talc. This is an incredible find. This is really good stuff and I hope they keep making it.</li>
    <li> What a nice lavender talc. Feels great, smells great, beautifully subtle (you&#x27;d have to dump half a handful on yourself for someone to notice it as you walk by). Washes off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality. I&#x27;m going to get more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> It is such a delight to use this talc after a refreshing shower.  I live in a warm climate and look forward to cooling off at the end of the day and getting into bed smelling like flowers.  Yardly has been making quality products for over a century and they have not lost their touch.</li>
    <li> Lovely! Wonderful lavender sent. Perfect for any occasion. The powder is fine and smooth. Enjoy wearing it. Only thing is the container. I appreciate the traditional metal casing, however, I bent it several times, while shaking out the powder. Perhaps a dispenser, which allows the use of a powder puff would be better. Regardless, I enjoyed the fragrance and will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Really nice powder. I use this on myself and my daughters when they get out of their baths:) We live on a lake and I like to have this out by the back door to help get the sand off our feet, and it smells soooo good!!</li>
    <li> I had hoped it was the older version in the pale violet container.  The scent is softer and more delicate..  The darker containers have some other ingredient that makes the powder somewhat more strong and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  I realize that the old kind that I loved isn&#x27;t being made any more and that&#x27;s too bad.  Ah well.....life goes on and one must accept what is available.  My hope is that in time the company might revert to the original &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; that has been my favorite for many years.</li>
    <li> Just beautiful smells like a dream! The sent is always the same high quality you will just love it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The product was as expected. I was pleased to find it at such a good price. I received it very quickly too. The top of the spout was slightly pushed in but it did not affect opening the tin. My very favorite talc!</li>
    <li> Although it did not arrive in time, I received it very late. Things do happen. I need this item Not able purchase USA. What alternative is there  for me to make A Choice.</li>
    <li> I love this scent so much! It refreshes my senses and when I put it on in the morning after my shower, it takes me to another world.  Call me crazy...but there&#x27;s just something about it! It&#x27;s feminine and soothing without being overpowering. I&#x27;m a lavendar lover and this has lavendar, but other incredible olefactory sensations as well. I also can&#x27;t stand perfume or \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; scents. Even though this has a lavendar base, it&#x27;s very soft and light. Hard to find in America.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted to give as a Christmas present. My daughter loved it. English Lavender by Yardley was my mom&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I use to use baby powder but I really like the fragrance of this talc.  Sometimes I use it in place of deodorant and it not only keeps you dry, but the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The lavender is a bit strong for my taste so I diluted it with baking powder and corn starch to make it comfortable to wear. .</li>
    <li> everything in my life smells like yardley&#x27;s english lavender I LOVE IT.AND I LOVE SHOPPING AT aMAZON</li>
    <li> This scent is better than the freesia option. It has a good lavender scent and is not quite so overwhelming as the freesia scent by the same manufacturer. Use sparingly and it will do quite well.</li>
    <li> Love Yardley. This is a great talc. Although I can live with the &amp;#34;canister&amp;#34;, powder puff delivery would put this at 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It came when expected, was packaged nicely, contained exactly what I wanted. The powder itself is great. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell!! Takes me away from stress :)</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find.  I spread it on clean sheets and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It is the one and only lavender talc for me.</li>
    <li> Fine talc, wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> My mother has used this for years.  It is not found locally so I&#x27;ve ordered it for her.  This Is the real stuff!  Other than a slight dent in the can due to shipping, we are happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Yardley has offered this product for many years and, at least for a period of time, was the hands-down favorite of many women. As my significant other was experiencing some difficult times it was clear that she needed something soothing and comforting, and Yardley&#x27;s English Lavender was the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Amazon seller&#x27;s pricing was reasonable and shipping was extremely prompt; I intend to purchase other products in the very near future. If you&#x27;ve never purchased anything on Amazon in the past and this product is of interest, then it would be the perfect place to start so you can enjoy the superb quality talc and experience same high level of service.</li>
    <li> I am not a girly girl, but this smells so good!  I started off with the soap, then moved onto powder. It&#x27;s silky smooth, and lovely smelling, but not too strong. I am really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Love the English Lavender powder - fragrance is long lasting and feels smooth on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product, smell not overwhelming</li>
    <li> Somehow it does not smell the same way the original does, it is still a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Lavender Yardley products have used for many years...</li>
    <li> She is 91 now and has always loved Yardley English Lavender powder.  She had been looking for it in stores, but not carried as much anymore - mostly creams.  I wish it was in a plastic container rather than a can - but that&#x27;s me.</li>
