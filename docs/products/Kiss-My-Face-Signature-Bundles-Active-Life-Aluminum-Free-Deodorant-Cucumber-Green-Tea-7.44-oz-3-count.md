<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using this product for about a week I got an itchy red rash under one arm and just some itching under the other.  I stopped using it and it gradually went away.  Tried it again and the rash came back within just 2 days.  Stopped using it and no rash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I had bought it originally from another source, but was glad to find it on Amazon when my first stick started running low. Other deodorants make my armpits hurt, which is my lymphatic system telling me it is plugged up. This product does not make that happen. It is important for me to keep my lymphatic system working as I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July, 2010, and I don&#x27;t want it back! Oh, and it works great for the purpose for which it is intended, to keep me from stinking!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and glides on easily.</li>
    <li> works great and smells good too. cruelty free and no harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant. Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to this brand and it caused my pits to dry out and I got a rash.</li>
    <li> Says it has lasting protection and it does not! It only lasts for about an hour on me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant. It is hypoallergenic and it doesn&#x27;t have any scant, which is nice.</li>
    <li> It smells so good at first, but when first applied it gets all goopy and takes forever to dry and then it dries out my skin. After reading the other reviews I&#x27;m glad to find out that I&#x27;m not the only one who seems to smell worse after wearing it.</li>
    <li> Best natural deo I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> This deodorant works really well for me.  Lasts all day and even after a workout and a hike, it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Tired of the sticky film some antiperspirants leave under your arms. Found it didn&#x27;t want to come off in the shower. Tried this product and I no longer have this problem. I receive enough protection, but I&#x27;m not real active or a sweaty person by nature.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey and the scent sort of smells like bugs. It doesn&#x27;t smell like cucumber green tea to me. I like that it&#x27;s aluminum free and goes on clear but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is definitely better than many of the paraben free products out there but it fails in the heat. I can only use it for basic, activity free days indoors.</li>
    <li> Smells great and has lasting freshness!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed. I love Kiss My Face products, but this just doesn&#x27;t do anything. Leaves me reaching for Secret :(</li>
    <li> Honestly, I just dont think natural deodorants are for me. The smell is delightful and feels nice and smooth, but it does not have all day protection like some of the other deodorants I have tried. The product  I was trying to go natural with some of my products, but I dont think natural deodorant is for me.</li>
    <li> At first I enjoyed using it but buy the end of the week my arm pit skin was peeling like crazy!:(</li>
    <li> Friend told me about aluminum in deodorant (research it) so I found this.  Good smell and so far lasts all day.  Good price and comes direct to your door.  Can&#x27;t ask for more....</li>
    <li> Unfortunately caused a rash with my sensitive skin. Desert Essentials seems to be a better fit for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant to help avoid harmful chemicals in most mainstream deodorants. It smells very good (like a jolly rancher almost) and glides on smooth. But within an hour, I smell worse than I ever have!! I&#x27;m a petite girl and never even had a body odor issue, but this deodorant seemed to make the odor worse! I&#x27;d put it on before bed and I&#x27;d wake up smelling horrible....it really isn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me AT ALL! I bought it somewhere else though... But its the crapiest deodorant ever. Worked for couple of days and then stopped. It also gave me rashes (and i thought that for being natural wouldn&#x27;t give me any) Ive NEVER gotten rashes from anything ive ever put on my body, ever. And btw i take two showers a day every day so its not that my BO its too strong.</li>
    <li> Holy cow. I bought this on a whim in the efforts of using natural product on my skin. It applies nice and smooth and smells pleasant. But after only an hour of just walking around the house I could smell my armpits- like I had never put any deodorant on in the first place. This does not mask odor, and grew increasingly worse in smell throughout the day. Also, it does not stop sweat. I have had sweat marks under my arms from merely sitting and leisurely walking, and I do not sweat THAT easily. Active life? PSH! It doesn&#x27;t even support your pits with a stale life. Not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this isn&#x27;t enough to steer you away, I finally looked up reviews on this product to see if I was the only one unhappy with this product, and found many negative reviews claiming their armpits were peeling. I have just taken a look in the mirror, and I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t noticed that I am PEELING! How could I not have seen this earlier?! My skin is all chapped and the skin is splitting, and it made my armpits darker. I am going to finish typing this review, and then I am going to throw this deodorant away.</li>
    <li> Wow. This just didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry at all. It made me smell worse than when I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant.</li>
    <li> Left your arms sticky after it dried</li>
    <li> It is as I expected. Makes you feel wet for a little while.</li>
    <li> I like this product as I feel it is a healthy option being aluminum chlorohydrate and paraben free, however it certainly does not provide all day protection.  I don&#x27;t work hard physically nor do I sweat much but I feel I need to reapply this one or two times during the day.  The scent of the product is nice and that is important to me as I don&#x27;t do well with many scents;  this one is not overpowering ~ it&#x27;s a nice natural scent.</li>
    <li> Works very well and for those that are usually allergic not an issue here and no annoying smells or stickiness...</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing. Isn&#x27;t know if it would hold up to the other deodorants since it was natural. I was a clinical strength deodorant user and this hold up, if not better than those. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I smelled horrible. It also gave me a rash. I am bummed as I&#x27;d like to switch from aluminum based deodorant (which work amazingly well by the way!) to a healther option.  I threw it away after a valiant effort. I lasted 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Gave me a terrible rash. My son uses it without a problem. Won&#x27;t be buying it for myself again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well, it goes on clear, dries quickly, and smells good. Also great protection, which I was worried about before trying!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the best- very artificially fruity....and it made me have an allergic reaction under my arms...</li>
    <li> My wife used this. It came as expected. It smelled good. It did not last her all day. She really can only get away with using antiperspirant with how active she is all day.</li>
    <li> After using this for ten days, I strongly want to urge others not to buy it! My underarms are having a weird reaction and are both itchy and peeling, similar to sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was pleasant enough and it kept me fresh enough at work, but I have never had a reaction like this to ANY deodorant.</li>
    <li> looking for deodorant without aluminum etc for my ten year old daughter. this product is excellent in that regard. also my daughter only swipes one time on each side and does the trick...so expect this will last long. worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and the product does a really great job at preventing any stinkiness.</li>
    <li> This item is aluminum and paraben free. Aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer and paraben is known to mimic estrogen and is known to build up in your body  This can cause breast cancer and other health problems.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant even though it doesn&#x27;t use aluminum for deodorant purposes like other products do, it works just as well.  It has a crisp and refreshing natural fragrance like cucumber&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many products that can cause health problems and avoiding certain substances can be key to your health. Especially for something that you use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant. I&#x27;d been looking for an aluminum free deodorant option and unlike many natural products, this one has a great scent and you can find it at various stores. The problem is that it makes my armpits itch like CRAZY from the second I put it on (don&#x27;t even get me started on what it feels like going on freshly shaved armpits--yikes!). The itching lasts throughout the day and the odor protection wanes after a few hours. At first I thought the itching was my skin adjusting to a more natural product, but after a month of use, it is just as bad as the first time I used it. I find this so strange because the chemical-laden deodorants I used to use never irritated my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love their product, but this one is just ok on effectiveness.  I find the protection is good for a dinner date, but as an all day it&#x27;s not up to the task.</li>
    <li> I am a big girl. I sweat. I don&#x27;t perspire or dampen my teeshirt in the heat. I SWEAT. And I am highly allergic to all that gunk they put in regular antiperspirant so I used to sit and dig at my pits when no one was looking. I admit it. I had a stiff-bristled round brush you use for blow drying your hair and curling it bought esp for the express purpose of being my pit brush. Yes, I keep my pits shaved. Of course. But that aluminum whatever it is eats me alive. Then a couple weeks ago, I started developing sore lumps. It scared me to death. They were under the skin and appeared to be lymph nodes. So...I bought this stuff and crossed my fingers. You know what? It actually works and much better than I ever expected! It isn&#x27;t supposed to totally stop perspiration (or in my case, sweating like the premenopausal woman that I am) BUT it greatly cuts down the sweating and I smell sweet and clean. The sweating, I believe, is less because I am not clogging up my pores with that gunk they put in perspiration and so it naturally just dissipates. IDK. But the smell is very nice, very light and sweet and it just works. The price is EXCELLENT here on Amazon. Just try it. If you don&#x27;t care for the cucumber/melony smell, try another &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; For me, it&#x27;s awesome. No more itchies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but not very effective. It has a pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s not so great at preventing body odor.  It&#x27;s fine if I don&#x27;t get stressed out or sweat much.</li>
    <li> This deodorant boasts &amp;#34;24-hour Protection,&amp;#34; but for me, it varies between 4 and 10.  I&#x27;m not super active, nor am I super smelly.  It just stops working well before 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Too oily,doesn&#x27;t mask odor. Wanted a natural alternative but this doesn&#x27;t cut it. Disappointed.  Rather take the risk health wise and use secret</li>
    <li> Love the Kiss My Face line.  This works just as great as all their other products.  Will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> If you are going to put a product on your body and have it absorbed into your system...make sure it has no additives or chemicals...this fulfills that need for me...and it works.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  try to stay sway from products that contain aluminum and this deodorant works well for me and has a more natural composition.</li>
    <li> Ive tried many different brands to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face cucumner green tea smells amazing, keep me dry (for organic) and odor free.&lt;br /&gt;Def. will buy again!</li>
    <li> Greasy, smelly, and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to make it though the day.  I ended up switching to the pricer, but more effective aluminum free version of Tom&#x27;s of Maine as it was on sale at Target.  The Tom&#x27;s product smells a little better (but still not ideal), and lasts 20-36 hrs.  If your stuck purchasing via amazon, I&#x27;d probably opt for the aluminum free Arm and Hammer product next.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of it being healthy. The problem is their use of &amp;#34;all day protection&amp;#34;. It was not even 6 hours and I was already feeling the wear. I put it on at 7AM, then go to work. By noon, it already wore off and I didn&#x27;t even exercise. I do like the smell, but I was hoping it would have the strength as the Essentials Arm &amp; Hammer, cause I don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
    <li> I like this but I have to re-apply several times during the day. Maybe a stronger scent would help with this problem.</li>
    <li> long lasting, smells fresh</li>
    <li> In the first few days of use, it was effective at controlling odor. After about a week of use, my underarm skin become red and irritated, then peeled off.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be working during the morning until around noon when I started to feel itchy and uncomfortable. Once I got home I took off my shirt to see my armpits completely red and bumpy, so i washed it all off.  The next morning the skin was peeling and burned!</li>
    <li> Smells gentle and soothing.  Fantastic for people who need mild help.  I bought for my slightly stinky 9 yr old boy.</li>
    <li> This product smells really good, like cucumber and works better than any other natural product I&#x27;ve tried. I know conventional antipersperants are highly toxic and dangerous to use, so I have been trying several different natural options. This is the best I&#x27;ve tried and a great price.</li>
    <li> I had decided to stop using deodorant/antiperspirant with aluminum in it recently and tried this. The scent is mild and it works well as a deodorant. Be mindful, it won&#x27;t keep you from sweating but I knew that going in. It works as promised.</li>
    <li> The smell alone is Amazing and makes me feel like a woman~Shaina said it first and I agree 100%  Amazing and works so well!!</li>
    <li> After years of using a sensitive skin deodorant and realizing it has aluminum in it, I made the switch to this.  So far it seems to work pretty well.  There are no white marks that are left behind.  Also it smells like watermelon Jolly Ranchers which is not a bad thing.</li>
    <li> Horrible deodorant. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched far and wide for a reliable natural deodorant that actually keeps up with me and so far this is the only one that does the job.  I work in tv/film production and I sweat constantly for 10-14hrs a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unscented also works but not as well as this one for me anyway</li>
    <li> Feels good &amp; provides safe protection.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works fairly well … I do have to reapply after a long day of work (I work in a hospital and am walking around lots and moving around, sometimes sweating, etc)… It works during yoga or pilates or exercise, but it&#x27;s good if I reapply beforehand. However, I don&#x27;t feel bad re-applying since it has way less chemicals!!</li>
    <li> Though the scent was pleasant upon application and I liked the idea of using a natural product, I was not overly impressed with this product. It did not seem to last quite so long as &#x27;Kiss my Face&#x27; claims, and towards the end of the day it smells terrible as if it was rotting on my skin. As a person with sensitive skin this product did not do so well for me as well because after a few days my skin began to peel and redden where the product was applied.</li>
    <li> it has an odor that leaves you wondering &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34; to me it smelled like you&#x27;ve ran few miles outside, drenched your shirt, went to work with that shirt on all day...my co-worker used to do that...i hated the smell!</li>
    <li> Would be a good starter deodorant for tweens or teens. Doesn&#x27;t help me unless I reapply it 3 times a day. I like the $3 deoderant stone sold on amazon waaay better and it will last me probably 3 years or better.</li>
    <li> does not work for me.</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t work for perspiration. But it doesn&#x27;t say it does either, so I&#x27;m not giving it a BAD rating.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and it worked all day, but after two weeks of using it, I had rashes in both armpits.  I am allergic to something in this product.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different deodorants without aluminum since I have been pregnant.  The Tom&#x27;s of Maine types didn&#x27;t work well and made my skin peel.  I was disappointed to find a long list of chemicals on the label when this type arrived.  This type makes my skin peel less, and works slightly better, but still doesn&#x27;t work like regular deodorant.  I have continued using this while I breast feed for lack of a better alternative.</li>
    <li> I am very careful about deodorants as I want natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals...and no aluminum.  This fits the bill and it has a very fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I like non antiperspirants because they don&#x27;t stain my light shirts,  and this brand is more effective for me than other brands.</li>
    <li> Was trying to be more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; in my personal care, and this product sent me running back to good old Lady Speed Stick, so fast it made my head spin.</li>
    <li> This is good deodorant. I have sensitive skin and a lot of wetness issues and this one handles both well. It&#x27;s also cruelty free and aluminum free which is why I got it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;However, my mom who also has sensitive skin does get a reaction to it, so not perfect for all skin allergies and irritations.</li>
    <li> Wonder why you get a rash?  first ingredient is propylene glycol which is a known skin irritant and dries out your skin.  Also can cause damage to central nervous system, liver and heart.  For starters it alters the structure of the skin by allowing chemicals to penetrate deep beneath it while increasing their ability to reach the blood stream.  So even if propylene glycol was good for you, it’s main job is to help any other chemicals you come in contact with reach your bloodstream. Who wants to use a chemical designed to help other chemicals penetrate even deeper into your skin? Not me.  It has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental/reproductive issues, allergies/immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and organ system toxicity. It has been found to provoke skin irritation and sensitization in humans as low as 2% concentration, while the industry review panel recommends cosmetics can contain up to 50% of the substance. It has also been classified as “expected to be toxic or harmful” by Environment Canada.</li>
    <li> Smells great, no irritation!  Do not be hesitant to buy love the light smell.  Very pleased!  Try it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work great, still smelled by the end of the work day. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Worst deodorant ever. I only bought it because it was on sale and wanted to give it a try. I developed a burn-like rash under my arms which caused me not to be able to wear deodorant for a week. My dermatologist told me to stop using it and within days, the rash was all gone. So much for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. It wouldn&#x27;t even help with odor control. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell and I think it works pretty good. It may be that I am so used to regular store bought (chemical filled) deodorant that it seemed really dry after putting on.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is GREAT! Not only does it keep you from being stinky, it actually keeps your armpits dry!! I have never used an antiperspirant/deodorant that kept me dry. It also smells really nice. A light, fresh cucumber scent.</li>
    <li> When I first made the switch to toxin-free products, I realized how accustomed to artificial chemicals I was. I was so used to &amp;#34;shower fresh&amp;#34; and scents not found in nature, and my notion of cucumber scents was not anything like what real cucumber smells like. I also did not think I sweated very much, when in reality I had been using aluminum based deodorants for so long I had forgotten what my own body did naturally! We use toxic deodorants because it is convenient: one swipe and you can go the whole day without worry, usually the whole night too. As soon as I stopped using Dove deodorant I noticed: I was sweating at an astronomical rate. It seemed that even minutes after a shower, they were already wet with sweat again. This deodorant seemed ineffective, and for a while I considered returning it! A month after purchasing, my body finally adjusted to being able to sweat and this deodorant does a fine job. We were meant to sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few side notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. This has a nice light cucumber scent and a gel consistency.&lt;br /&gt;2. This deodorant only lasts a few hours (4-6) before you need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;3. Natural deodorant comes off like a dream in the shower. I am so glad I don&#x27;t have that sticky, chalky residue under my arms anymore.&lt;br /&gt;4. Tip: Use body soap with sage, a natural odor fighter, to increase the potency of this product.&lt;br /&gt;5. Tip: Scrub your armpits well with an exfoliating sponge in the shower to remove all traces of unpleasantness.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not clear and will stay on for about an hour after gliding it on.  I also may be partially allergic to some of the ingredients because my skin starts to peel after using this for a few days and becomes a faint red color.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other deodorants, organic or otherwise, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like the protection is any good either, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of the organic deodorants on the market (Tom&#x27;s, Jaesan, Wallenda, Crystal Stick, even my boyfriend&#x27;s Natural Grooming - \\&quot;strong\\&quot;) and none of them have worked for me, in fact, I think they all made me smell worse than if I just didn&#x27;t wear it! I&#x27;ve had a super stressful week at work including near 12 hour days and this deodorant has really worked and far-surpassed my expectations. The smell reminds me of a spa, it&#x27;s really soft and soothing to apply (although it can feel a little runny), and the best part is that it&#x27;s aluminum and paraben free!</li>
    <li> We ordered this to try out, smells great but doesn&#x27;t work. We don&#x27;t sweat very much so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t even work for us is really disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, which I guess I&#x27;ve already said.  But here is why.  Almost all deodorants have antiperspirants which have aluminum. Aluminum has been linked to breast cancer and an increased link to Alzheimer&#x27;s.  My mother died from Alzheimer&#x27;s so I began to take these warnings more seriously.  If antiperspirants have aluminum, I&#x27;d just buy a deodorant.  Do you know how difficult that is?  Almost any drugstore or grocery will carry one brand and the most available one I&#x27;ve found is Tom&#x27;s which recently has started producing a line which contains aluminum.  So I&#x27;m not sure I really trust them, and they don&#x27;t smell as good.  This deodorant smells good and it works, but it is very hard to find locally.  We used to live in a town where the local Wegmans sold it, but moved to a larger town.  No Wegmans, no deodorant.  Amazon carries this, so I will order it from them when I use up my current stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve read the other comments.  One writer suggested that propylene glycol is not safe.  According to the ATSDR - Propylene glycol is a synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water. Propylene glycol is also used to make polyester compounds, and as a base for deicing solutions. Propylene glycol is used by the chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries as an antifreeze when leakage might lead to contact with food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified propylene glycol as an additive that is “generally recognized as safe” for use in food. It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics, or food products. It is a solvent for food colors and flavors, and in the paint and plastics industries. Propylene glycol is also used to create artificial smoke or fog used in fire-fighting training and in theatrical productions. Other names for propylene glycol are 1,2-dihydroxypropane, 1,2-propanediol, methyl glycol, and trimethyl glycol. Propylene glycol is clear, colorless, slightly syrupy liquid at room temperature. It may exist in air in the vapor form, although propylene glycol must be heated or briskly shaken to produce a vapor. Propylene glycol is practically odorless and tasteless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury (and consumers) appears to still be out on whether on not the small quantities in this deodorant are safe. But do your research and you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s used in many of our cosmetics as well as our foods.  This being the case, I think I&#x27;ll take my chances and you can make your own decision.rature.

    <li> I am a stay at home mom with kids 6,7 and 12. Im not super active as my day is about sewing and light duties around the house. This KMF deodorant smells great when you put it on. The only issue is give it 3 hours and with very light activity I smell.... I dont sweat a lot but this deodorant just does not last like I wish it did. If you reapply several times a day its ok.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I am going to try the arm n hammer product next. trying to get rid of the chemicals in my life.</li>
    <li> Cruelty-free but didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good for about an hour but then it fades.  Not a good choice for a non-Antiperspirant deodorant for an active mom.</li>
    <li> Smell is nice and mild</li>
    <li> I truly wanted to love this! I really like the light, fresh, scent and love that it&#x27;s more natural than other drugstore brands of deodorant.  Goes on smoothly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I purchased this is because it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum which is the ingredient that helps produce those yellow stains in your white clothes! I got a new nurse job and unfortunately, our uniforms are all WHITE scrubs! White scrubs + being on my feet all day which will make me sweat  &#x3D; need a new deodorant! This deodorant is called &amp;#34;active life&amp;#34; which means it should protect you from smelling bad while sweating, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any yucky stains on my scrubs. I do sweat A LOT during work!! Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t keep me dry and truly feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep me smelling fresh for very long. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do live in California where we are in triple digit summer weather.. so I&#x27;m still hoping that maybe if I&#x27;m not sweating as much during the colder seasons, it will work better for me. I was counting on this to be my holy grail deodorant regardless of the season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, maybe it&#x27;s just me.. after I apply, the deodorant gets all over the rim part which can get messy when putting the cap back on. I always have to wipe it off before putting the cap back on which I think wastes it!</li>
    <li> I was using TOMS for a long time and was still having a hard time with armpit odor. This product lasts ALL DAY for me! which is a complete first since switching to natural and cruelty-free products. Would 100% recommend to EVERYONE until my face falls off! The smell of this one is also subtle and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t eliminate body odor.  You&#x27;ll need another shower in a few hours.</li>
    <li> This will be fine for the fall and winter but I am glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it for the summer. As lovely as it smells, it does nothing to help keep me dry. I don&#x27;t think it is supposed to as it is not labeled as an antiperspirant, but still. I feel wet and sticky when the temp goes up even a tiny bit. I console myself with the thought that at least I am aluminum free and smell nice now:)</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant, will never go back to store bought...</li>
    <li> Works as before (no irritation, etc). a lighter alternative to the big store brands one see&#x27;s all the time. I did find a local supplier for basically the same price without shipping time.  Would buy again idf my local store runs out.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out after using Toms for so long. I like Toms, but it never lasts as long as I hope. Enter Kiss My Face deodorant. Ta da! Actual lasting and great smelling deodorant for a similar price. I will be buying this from now on and am extremely satisfied, knowing that I can be more confident at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to deodorant but can use this. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant for about a year now and love it. I wanted to see how other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants worked for me just for something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using Kiss my Face, my underarms started peeling horrible. It looked like I had sunburned my underarms, they dried out so badly. I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin which is why I started using Tom&#x27;s in the first place. After years of using super strength antiperspirant and wondering why I constantly needed to change my t-shirt, I thought maybe using harsh products was making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my relief I can finally go all day without worrying about raising my arms because of wetness or irritation. I was hoping to have those same results with Kiss My Face products but for some reason it irritated my skin worse than any antiperspirant I had ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sticking to Tom&#x27;s Of Maine products.</li>
    <li> Ok I think this may be my first review I have ever written on a product, but I couldn&#x27;t NOT in good conscious. My family is avid Vegan/Organic free/Sulfate Free/Aluminum free people and we have been searching for years for a Aluminum free deodorant. My sister (Vegan/Gluten Free Only Organic) had given up and was back using Aluminum containing Deodorant. Then I found this! It is absolutely Incredible. Not only does it keep me Smelling AMAZING at the GYM but in High Stress Moments at WORK I smell Great. (Just a side note I run 3-5 miles a day, do HOT Yoga, and Hike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE PRODUCT! I have made a total switch to all &#x27;Kiss my Face&#x27; Deodarants, Shampoos, Conditioners, and Lotions. Trust me this product is amazing!!!! I have gotten my whole family to switch!</li>
    <li> Looking for all natural deodorant that would last all day. This fits the bill! Long lasting and nice scent. Very pleased to have a deodorant without the chemicals that will do the job.</li>
    <li> This does have Propylene glycol as the first ingredient and a petroleum based product as well.  Works pretty well but I will not buy again due to ingredients.  Sad since I love &amp;#34;kiss my face&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I like how this smells and works pretty good. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot though.</li>
    <li> Scent is delicious!  Cucumbers!  Feels soft when gliding and it is cruelty free and has no animal products,!</li>
    <li> No odor protection, no wetness protection. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Works good and smells great! Makes me feel better using knowing there is no aluminum!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Hard to find a natural solution that stands up to Gulf Coast humidity. Best I&#x27;ve used. Last all day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t offer any odor control. I feel like I smell worse when I use it apposed to not wearing any deodorant at all. Total waste of my money. Bought two of these and ended up trashing them because they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> okay, I wanted natural deodorant from a company that does not test on animals.....this fit the bill, however I dont think it was very long lasting.</li>
    <li> It smells good, and it even is free of many chemicals, but it still contains a few dangerous ones AND every time I use it I have to re apply it every like 2 hours and I work at a desk! I am only a couple pounds overweight, nowhere near obese, so I don&#x27;t have layers of fat to sweat (that is not meant to be offensive, just stating I don&#x27;t have layers to generate warmth), so I know it is the deodorant. It also causes my skin to itch a LOT and peel. I am highly dissatisfied with this. I am also at a loss because now what? I&#x27;ve tried Toms and they are the same reaction. I&#x27;ve tried degree sport, I&#x27;ve tried that stupid rolling rock, and more! It is getting close to impossible to find all natural deodorant, or even at least chemically safe!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very, very pleased.. No aluminum and natural.. works very well..</li>
    <li> This works the best out of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Works fairly good.  I have to reapply halfway thru the day so I don&#x27;t start to smell tho.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non-chemical deodorant for my granddaughter.  She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t last as long (only about 9 hours) as the Dove brand that I was using, but it is aluminum and paraben free and therefore better for my body!  I love the smell of this product and feel protected during the day, even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> This product smells great when you put it on but it only last about a hour or so then it wears off. And then it starts to actually I think make your under arms smell worse. But the smell when you put it on is a really good smell. More cucumber then green tea.&lt;br /&gt;But it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite natural deodorant! I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin</li>
    <li> Smells good, goes on clear&lt;br /&gt;Good protection for no chemicals</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like this product at all! It didn&#x27;t work and I smelled awful all day! So I stored it in the bottom of my bathroom drawer. Then, a couple of weeks ago, I ran out of my regular aluminum deodorant that I used against my will since it really was the only thing that kept me from having body odor! And I absolutely hated using it since I know how bad it is for you!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since I ran out I desperately applied this one and prepared myself for a day of smelling, I even warned my co-workers! But nothing happened! I didn&#x27;t smell! The only explanation I can find for this miracle is that I stopped eating animal products. I don&#x27;t eat meat and I stay away from dairy as much as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying it will work for everybody, but if you have bad body odor and want to stay away from aluminum products try to stop eating animal products, it&#x27;s worth a shot!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very often that you can find an actual antiperspirant that is not tested on animals. Yay! Thank you! (And it works, too.)</li>
    <li> Tried it. Not loving it. My underarms are always wet after, and that could be okay... but I smell at the end of the day. Not sure why I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a deodorant that was free of metals and I came across this. It&#x27;s def worth the buy. I think it smells great and it&#x27;s a product I look forward to putting on every day.</li>
    <li> Best of all of the natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried both for reliability and for scent, which was pleasant and not very strong.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I put like because I haven&#x27;t tried it yet - it was a gift.  From what I hear it is fantastic though!</li>
    <li> Caused my skin to become very irritated, and it started to peel off dead skin like a sunburn.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other type of deoderant before so I am assuming it was caused the the propylene glycol.</li>
    <li> Eh. Not a big fan. Does not &amp;#34;deodorize&amp;#34; very well at all. I&#x27;d rather return for a better quality product.</li>
    <li> I tried toms of Maine which couldn&#x27;t keep me fresh without reapplying several times and an organic brand which was ok but left oily mark on my tight shirts. This one so far is a winner and i will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Active Life Stick Deodorant smells good but, doesn&#x27;t work.  I am really disappointed but, find that only crystal deodorants truly prevent odor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling and most effective &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant we have tried. My teen girls really like it and have requested I buy it again. Unfortunately, I can no longer find &#x27;Kiss my Face&#x27; products at my local stores, so thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, but I&#x27;m going to buy one for myself. Its a nice, pleasant unisex scent and it WORKS! I&#x27;ve tried Alba, which only lasted half a day, as well as the crystal rock one, which lasts but has no smell. We prefer a slight, fresh smell. This is perfect, and I&#x27;m happy we can avoid aluminum.</li>
    <li> very pleasant mild scent</li>
    <li> I love the idea of natural deodorants, but this one definitely does not work. It doesn&#x27;t protect me, even when I&#x27;m barely moving. I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious but guess something wrong with me didnt work I had body odor before day was over lol</li>
    <li> This did not help with sweating and I developed a rash.  I loved the feel of it and the smell though...it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going organic with many daily products I use daily.  I was hesitant about this one because I sweat  a lot, expecially in the summer.  After a friend suggested this, I tried it.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It smells good, works great, and isn&#x27;t filled with nasty ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has kept me dry and smelling pretty! I have used the Sport scented version as well and I loved it.  On time delivery and a great product! My armpits say  &amp;#34;YAAY!&amp;#34; &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Purchased this after Tom&#x27;s of Maine just didn&#x27;t work, at all. I&#x27;m not a tremendously smelly/sweaty person, but I do work-out and this product works great. It&#x27;s always tough to find an effective cruelty free product, but Kiss My Face did a great job with this one!</li>
    <li> This does the job well, no apparent harsh chemicals, smells good, lasts long, I use it days when i ride my bike to work.</li>
    <li> I wish this product worked but unfortunately it does not protect against sweat or the smell of sweat it&#x27;s also feel like which I hate in a deodorant</li>
    <li> I do not know about it&#x27;s effectiveness, but it has propylene glycol which is a nerve toxin. Many people are concerned with aluminum and parabens, but propylene is just as bad. I would press on my underarms and see lights flashing before my eyes and figured out why. PROPYLENE GLYCOL look it up.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand for years...works great for me! Love the cucumber green tea fragrance as well as the sport...happy to find these on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it! I am allergic to regular deodorant and this stuff works perfectly in its place.</li>
    <li> In my search for the perfect non-alum, non-cancer causing, \\&quot;non-Killer\\&quot; deodorant, I&#x27;ve been tying to find something that works as good as the Secret antiperspirant I used for years. So far, nothing cuts it. The Kiss My Face deodorant isn&#x27;t bad. The smell is pleasant, not overpowering. However I find that it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time - a trait with all of the &#x27;healthy&#x27; deodorants. I choose to apply at least 2x a day. The best one I&#x27;ve found so far is the Adidas \\&quot;Cotton Tech\\&quot; deodorant but at 14 bucks a pop the Adidas deodorant is a tough sell (and it&#x27;s not organic, just aluminum free).</li>
    <li> Doesnt work at all - had to keep reapplying all day long&lt;br /&gt;found one that does work though - ozone deoderant</li>
    <li> Usually I get the Trader Joe unscented Paraban free but the Kiss My Face brand does the same job with the same quality ingredients at a better price.</li>
    <li> Not good, wife hated,broke out her under arms junk</li>
    <li> My wife tried this for several days now.  Trust me she&#x27;s stankin&#x27;!  It&#x27;s a shame because the deodorant smells extremely good.  I believe it might be out of date which could have something to do with it.  (the bottom says Sept 13, which is the current date).  Either way I still give it 1 star because if that&#x27;s the case I received an expired product.  If it was not expired it might work, but she had BO for sure,  buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> My husband and son love this deodorant. It&#x27;s 100 % organic and smells good too. Protects you from body odors, at the same time that does&#x27;t harm your body. Excellent change from other harmful deodorants.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled awesome yet not too strong and I was looking for a vegan deodorant so I picked it up. I used it happily for awhile but soon noticed that while it \\&quot;worked\\&quot; it also left a filmy, peelable residue under my arm. It caused irritation and redness and I stopped using this. I suppose if you put it on and plan to shower after your day then it may work, but if you shower every other day like me and sleep without washing off deodorant, this can leave a very irritating, peeling film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a better deodorant called Lavanilla that is crazy expensive but gets the job done without irritating. I have a review on it.</li>
    <li> As advertised and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he used it for 2 days. Oh my god, he got crazy rashes under his armpits... I felt so bad and returned it.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Love it. Can be a little harsh on the arm pits, but works great! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was underwhelmed. A friend had recommended this brand to me as an alternative to aluminum-based deodorants, but I found, unfortunately, that it did not keep me dry nor did it mask odor. Shame!</li>
    <li> Goes on feeling great, dries and gets&#x27; stickey. When you get home you can smell BO in you clothing.</li>
    <li> So looking for a good, natural deodorant....natural yes but 3 hours into my work day not so stellar. I figured maybe I was &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; active but even on days when I was chilly...yeah not great even in the winter</li>
    <li> This was the first time to use a natural deodorant and I should have done more research using &amp;#34;natural deodorant that works.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go on, I had been using Dove and it was 100%. I know this was largely due to some of the harmful chemicals it contained. Hence the shift to natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I knew that Kiss My Face was not an antiperspirant and I was willing to get used to the feeling of having sweat under my arms. I felt that it must be the natural way for the body to react to heat. Active Life came with a gentle, fresh scent that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;What I did NOT like was:&lt;br /&gt;- My sweat smelled. (No, all hair removed, so it&#x27;s not that)&lt;br /&gt;- I was never 100% sure that in the middle of the day I won&#x27;t need a shower. So, one week in, I started carrying the deodorant with me in case I needed to kind of wash up and reapply.&lt;br /&gt;- After three weeks of use, I started to see some dry, peeled skin. This is the first time ever, in my life to see that. And this is when I immediately stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased Thai Crystal Deodorant Stone and hopefully this one works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different natural deodarants, &amp; this is now my new go-to favorite. I feel like the scent could be a bit stronger, but actually, you don&#x27;t need it since the product actually works. I have tried some other brands that smell wonderful &amp; fresh, but once you put them on, they don&#x27;t really work, &amp; you feel like you want to reapply them. Not so with this one. Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I love kiss my face products but this stuff did not work at all, a salt rock worked slightly better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks. I think it&#x27;s OK, but not great. Still looking for a favorite.</li>
    <li> smells good and works great.  Never been able to find in stores.  good all natural deodorant if you&#x27;re trying to avoid putting toxins in your body</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it was refreshing.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be great.. seeing all the reviews but this deodorant gave me a super bad rash.. made all my skin from my armpit peel off. painful experience. I guess it depends on the person. this one is not for me. I am going to try the roll on version if that doesn&#x27;t work i will have to keep looking for another option.</li>
    <li> It goes on very easily and smells good but after exercising or getting a little sweaty its time to reapply again. It doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms with the sticky flaky effect that you get from the other deodorants you get from the store.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty awesome. It smells so freshy fresh that it makes life super breezy. Buy the three pack and live it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be super popular in all the elevators in town.</li>
    <li> So great! Nice light smell. Dries in a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t show any marks on my clothes. First deodorant without aluminum that I have found that works, is budget friendly, and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a hippie. I tried Tom&#x27;s, LaVanilla and one other brand I don&#x27;t recall.</li>
    <li> I gave it a try in high hopes. It has a great scent.  It didn&#x27;t chalk up or get all over my clothes.  I found that it did not keep me from building up my scent.  It really seemed to wane after only a few hours under my arms.  Worth a shot I guess.</li>
    <li> the product works just as i expected and wanted buy the scent of it is not as fresh as i thought it would</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I really did. I wanted a deodorant that was aluminum free because of concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a few others have posted, after using it for 2 days, I have a horrible red rash that stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual stick smells wonderful, but in the 2 days I used it, I noticed it didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> This product made my underarms peel. I had to discontinue using and trashed it. Since day two of using it my underarms itched and was red in color. I am so bummed as it did decrease my over active sweat glands. :(</li>
    <li> Ineffective!! Not strong enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on KISS... build something that smell great, natural, and actually protects more than a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wake up... its 2014.  You&#x27;ve got to produce better results.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean smell!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t smell.  I am very active and it seems to work like the other deodorants like dove.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this locally.  LOVE it</li>
    <li> This product gave me rashes. I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, smells like clean . . . wanna roll around in it. got here fast.  great price.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly but product does not work for me</li>
    <li> Good for short bursts, but you have to layer it on. Not recommended for workouts!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Smells delicious and fresh.</li>
    <li> I like this product. If I need to be super sure I don&#x27;t sweat, like when I went to Florida on vacation in September, I use my old product. But for normal, daily use, I use this product.</li>
    <li> Though I don&#x27;t care to eat cucumbers themselves, I love body products that smell like it! This deodorant is natural, smells great, and lasts most of the day. I won&#x27;t be switching to another deodorant any time soon.</li>
    <li> This is very nice! The smell is good!</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant, it covers up my body odor more than other more natural deodorants have (for example the Toms of Main) or is a cheaper option (The Lavanila deodorants are my favorite but are 3x the price of this). The product is solid but sort of gel-ish and it can be a bit wet on my skin for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant for months now, trying a number of different brands and finally found one that I&#x27;ll stick with. I used Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s deodorant for a while but I always found that it left an unpleasant, slight burning sensation when first applied and it never performed adequately on hot days. But this Kiss My Face deodorant not only WORKS all day long, but it is soothing and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant after using ARM &amp; Hammer Essentials Solid Deodorant. I prefer the Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant. The Kiss My Face deodorant, when applied, is quite wet resulting in squishing sounds when I move my arms. Additionally, it does not last as long throughout the day as the Arm &amp; Hammer version.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this stuff smells!  And it works wonderfully!!! Great for people that want to use Aluminum Free Deodorants!!!</li>
