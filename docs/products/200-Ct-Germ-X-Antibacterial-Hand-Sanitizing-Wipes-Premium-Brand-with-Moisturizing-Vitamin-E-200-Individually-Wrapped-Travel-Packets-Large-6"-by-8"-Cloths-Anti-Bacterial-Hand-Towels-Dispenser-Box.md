<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the wipes are pretty big so you can rip them in 1/2 &amp; share, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, can&#x27;t ask for better, the wipes are of great quality &amp; even kids like them!</li>
    <li> I use these wipes all the time. They are so convenient, especially  if u have children. Love this product!</li>
    <li> These are very well sized and useable wipes.  They can be used repeatedly, if returned to the package, immediately,  at least one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They nare very handy for sanitizing Airline trays arm rests and seat belt connectors. Also, should be used to rewipe restuarant tables and condiment bottles.  During flu season use them after shaking hands with anyone.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find only thing was that it came as 2 100 Ct boxes and not the 200 Ct like I had ordered.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry in pocket, purse, and glove compartment. Price substantially less than at local drug store. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for home use, local and distant travel.  Just simply a GREAT PRODUCT and very handy, effective against today&#x27;s dread bacteria etc.</li>
    <li> These are the best sanitizing wipes I&#x27;ve found. The foil packaging retains the moisture,and makes them easy to keep wherever an antibacterial wipe is needed.</li>
    <li> Best wipe little to no residue!</li>
    <li> Love the wipes and these were cheaper to buy in bulk like this.  Unfortunately the shipping was so slow on it, it took almost 30 days to get to me!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Can&#x27;t get them at Costco or Sam&#x27;s anymore.</li>
    <li> These are great! Individual packets to carry with you and clean your hands whenever you need to. Nicer than just the gel...you can rub the dirt &amp; grime off with the strong towelettes.</li>
    <li> This came as two 100ct retail boxes which was great, and they worked amazing. they are large and actually are wet, not dried out! A+ Product!</li>
    <li> THIS is the wipe to buy! The other types promote resistance - they contribute to the creation of &amp;#34;super germs.&amp;#34; These Germ-X wipes are fantastic. We have them everywhere - in our cars, briefcases, desks... I gave several boxes to my mom and told her to quit using the grocery store wipes. They are soft, large, and I used them not only on hands, but on the computer keyboard, doorknobs at work, telephones... most illnesses we &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; are from our hands. Alcohol wipes long with washing with soap and water can make a huge difference. I&#x27;ve avoided illnesses at work that everyone else caught. I highly recommend these wipes.</li>
    <li> Most used product !&lt;br /&gt;Can use wipes to clean tables, chairs, toilet seats as well as hands.&lt;br /&gt;Love convenience and peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Love having these around! Car, public places. Places I can&#x27;t wash my hands. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Found these really helpful after the earthquake in Haiti - they worked unexpectedly well as a substitute for (ugh!) a shower, when there was no available water for several days. Admittedly an off-label use, but one I had heard of from friends in Iraq, and very helpful in a pinch!</li>
    <li> Packed with my First Aid Bag, several in my Truck &amp; Purse. Great Product!</li>
    <li> We used to get these wipes at Costco but our local Costco no longer carries this brand. Now they carry some mousy little wipes in foil that evaporate in no time. GermX foil packages are a bit larger but work so well. We take these packets everywhere.</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with these wipes they leave a very bad smell on your hands when using. we have been using these wipes for years at the sheriffs police and never had this problem before. We are not using these wipes at all, sorry we order them.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Purell wipes, they&#x27;re big, strong, and clean really well with a single wipe. Purell now only sells the smaller size, but it does seem like GermX has picked up the 6x8 size wipe format. They&#x27;re pretty nice, but I like the texture of the Purell a little better and the individual packaging is a little classier too.</li>
    <li> Easy open packages in nice dispenser carton.  Wipes are always moist with alcohol solution. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  Nice scent. Great product.</li>
    <li> Large moist and real durable. When they dry out after use, I sometimes use the cloth as a dust rag and that works really well!</li>
    <li> As many others noted, these were a replacement for the old 6 x 8 Purell individually packaged hand wipes.  This is a very good size (I don&#x27;t like the smaller ones at all).  These work very well and are not too harsh on my hands.  We keep them in our truck glove box and it is very convenient to put one in your pocket for later use.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes the package doesn&#x27;t want to tear open and you have to use a small scissors to open it.  It doesn&#x27;t happen every time and it is a very small complaint.  I also like that you can buy them in good quantity.</li>
    <li> The Germ-X hand wipes are alcohol based and quite large, making them an excellent wipe to have in your purse or pocket when eating out.</li>
    <li> I always keep at least a few of these in my purse. Especially when going to the mall. Clean hands after handling money before I eat. Wipe off table just before eating at fast food places. Especially when with grandchildren. Some food item always ends up on the table before the mouth.</li>
    <li> These wipes are fabulous! As others have already written, they far exceed any like product. I ordered on Sunday and the 200 count package arrived on Thursday, during a week just prior to a holiday weekend. Therefore, even though the ordering directions for this product caution of a longer shipping timeframe that definitely was not my experience. I was extremely pleased at how quickly the product arrived.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these &amp; was so happy to find the individual packets. Great product. They don&#x27;t leave your hands feeling sticky like other antibacterial wipes. They feel nice &amp; clean &amp; sanitized.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> Like these wipes a lot.  Have been using them for RV and foreign travel (7+ years). Only Con: Wipe can leave a nasty tasting residue on your hands.  You will notice this, if you handle food, shortly after using Wipe to clean your hands.  I am aware of this and am careful to avoid touching my mouth with my hands/fingers.  Not an issue with me. updated Oct 2016.  I still like this product.  However, I have found the identical product at a less expensive price. 100ct $13.50, incl shipping.  have purchased many since I placed this original order.</li>
    <li> These are the best hand wipes I&#x27;ve found yet.  They have a pleasant smell, and don&#x27;t dry out before you finish wiping your hands.  I keep them in all of our cars, and in my briefcase.</li>
    <li> I have used these for several years and love them! Use them under the arms after playing sports or to freshen up during a night of dancing. Was so happy to find them on Amazon since my regular store doesn&#x27;t seem to have them anymore.</li>
    <li> My mother loves these and I send them to her whenever she gets low. I like them too as they are just the right about of wet, non-offensive light smell, can be used on skin and also great if you need to wipe something off clothes as they don&#x27;t leave lent like some can.</li>
    <li> use frequently. love the size.  soft and easy to use. I bought another brand because it was cheaper,found out it was cheaper because the cloth was small and  stiff and you had to use two instead of one.Highly recommend the Germ-x wipes</li>
    <li> Extremely versatile. Can be kept in the lunch box, the car or anywhere you need to clean up. Lasts for years without drying our in the pack.</li>
    <li> These are so convenient to put in purse or pocket.  These are substantially packaged so can leave them in the glove compartment of the car and truck and they don&#x27;t leak or dry out.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over.</li>
    <li> This product is so handy. Great to carry in hand bag, travel bag, pre-lunch wipes. I am sad to see Sam&#x27;s club in my area no longer carry this item.</li>
    <li> Never sick...thanks to these wipes.  A big favorite around our house, the only hand wipes we&#x27;ve found that really make you feel clean.  Most of the others on the market leave an odd residue on your skin, these just leave the skin clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years and love them. I keep some of them in my camera bag, console in my SUV, desk drawer at work, and a lot of other places. The huge 6\\&quot; by 8\\&quot; size and the fact that they are very moist makes cleaning your hands very easy. A lot of times I am at festivals, outdoor concerts, and similar type events and I want to wash my hands before and after I eat and running water is not close by. These make things easy. I take a lot of photos and these keep any dirt, grime, and food off of my hands that would end up on my camera gear.</li>
    <li> Easy transaction and as promised.</li>
    <li> I am so glad these are back in stock on Amazon!  These are the best of any of the individual sanitizing wipes on the market.  They are large, soft, moist, durable, and don&#x27;t stink.  I have even trained my husband to use them.  I keep several in my purse, my makeup bag, my traveling tote, and my luggage.  Since I am afraid of these going of out stock again I bought extra boxes to keep as backup.</li>
    <li> Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I carry these when I travel.</li>
    <li> These help to keep the kids healthy during cold and flu season, my son is always putting his fingers in his mouth, this way they are germ free.</li>
    <li> After weeks and weeks of trying to find these anti bacterial wipes in local stores, I finally found them here on Amazon   These wipes are great.  They used to be made of paper and now they are made of a softer cloth material, they&#x27;re larger and just work alot better.  They&#x27;re easy to carry with you anywhere you want.  They work amazingly great when you can&#x27;t get soap and water.  These are great wipes and I wouldn&#x27;t (and don&#x27;t) leave home without them.  It&#x27;s a shame though, that Purell has discontinued the packets but they have replaced the packets with a dispenser container that can be put in a car or at home but not easy to carry around with you.</li>
    <li> We have used these for years and couldn&#x27;t find them in any stores locally.  With a husband that doesn&#x27;t have a very good immune system - this type of product is a must in our home.  Price was right - shipment was way faster than expected.  Perfect transaction!</li>
    <li> Have used these for 5+ years, very handy!</li>
    <li> So glad amazon started carrying this.  We use these all year round so the big pack is essential.  They really come in handy.</li>
    <li> Best antibacterila wipes.  Load them in the cars and my purse.</li>
    <li> Best hand wipes available.</li>
    <li> I used to get packs of these Germ-X wipes at a local &#x27;super store&#x27;.  They stopped carrying them &amp; then I found this giant economy size on Amazon!  Perfect for the germaphobe in me &amp; to take with you everywhere!</li>
    <li> Always bought at Sam&#x27;s; they stopped carrying; was delighted to know can buy online....this is a great product that can be carried and used anywhere!</li>
    <li> Ordered these to be one of three items in wedding favors with a beach theme.  It was a huge hit among the guests and I had many mothers with young children and school teachers asking where to order this particular item.  I also volunteer at an elementary school and the wipes comes in quite handy!</li>
    <li> two or more years ago, purchased a resealable 12pack of these and put them in my van and left them there.  Recently needed to sanitize my hands and found them in my door compartment and they worked like I just had purchased them yesterday.  So I purchased 2 boxes of 200 and now have them in all the vehicles and in all carry bags.</li>
    <li> This is the best and most convenient hand sanitizer on the market! Much nicer traveling with a packet instead of a bottle of liquid sanitizer. No more spills in the bottom of my purse!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes.  Great size to carry along for daily use and at the parks on vacation.  Been using them for years.</li>
    <li> These things are always good to have on hand</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Wife, going through chemo!!</li>
    <li> order was sent fast  product is good especially in  the flu cseason</li>
    <li> These wipes are by far the best hand cleaning product on the market.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Originally bought them at Sam&#x27;s Club, but was told they no longer carry them.  Found them at Amazon, but were shipped in a box from Sam&#x27;s Club.  I share them with family.  They are really very good to carry, especially since hands should be kept as clean as possible at all times.</li>
    <li> Convenient and clean.  We use them a lot.  Easy to put in my purse and use when we are out to dinner.</li>
    <li> How could you not love Moist Towelettes?</li>
    <li> pricey but nice to find a discontinued product really miss being able to get these</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hand sanitizing wipes superior to the liquids out there!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest antibacterial cloths I have ever used. Fabric is soft, fragrant is clean, they do not dry the skin.  I have used them for years, but I can no longer buy them locally, so Amazon.com  here I come.  Great traveling companions. great in lunch boxes. Keep this product. I am counting on you to keep this in stock. Thanks, J</li>
    <li> Take this with you everywhere. Not just for hands but toilet seats too.</li>
    <li> Love this prooduct. It has nice large wipes that are soft. They are also easy to open. Which is important if they are going in kids lunches boxes. It&#x27;s not as easy to find but if you want an antibacterial wipes these are the best.</li>
    <li> love these for travel, restaurants, etc.  Wish&lt;br /&gt;sam&#x27;s club still had thee on their shelves.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant product! The only bacterial wipes i trust.</li>
    <li> Sorry one &amp; all but I have been using anti germ wipes for well over 20 years.  These are the best.  They are much larger in size come in large quantities while others do not.  Will continue to buy these for as long as they exist.  Everything I go to the grocery store, just everywhere including my own home.  I have 3 cats, I handled them all the time, but always use these wipes when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many use the liquid product, NOT FOR ME!  I want to wipe my hands not just smear some liquid on them.  I antique, always touching something, my hands get dirty.  I again want to wipe my hands clean, these are great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I was familiar with it and had purchased it from another source previously. Far beyond anything in it&#x27;s class.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great little hand wipes for your pocket or purse. Wouldn&#x27;t be without them!</li>
    <li> Great to have on you all the time, comes in handy</li>
    <li> My husband and I love using these when we are out. They are great to carry in your purse for use in a restaurant before eating and handling your food. I sometimes use them to wipe down salt and pepper shakers, ketchup bottles, etc. before handling them.</li>
