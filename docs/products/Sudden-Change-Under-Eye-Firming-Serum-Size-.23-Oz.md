      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>And the cost is good value.</li>
      <li>After reading reviews and doing my own experimenting, this is what I&#x27;ve learned:  </li>
      <li>I use a very good moisturizer first, this eliminates  any lines.  </li>
      <li>Glad this didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with most of the reviews and can&#x27;t understand why a lot of people love this product.    </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Works great,  better than high end creams I have tried.  </li>

      <li>This product does smooth my lines and wrinkles somewhat</li>
      <li>I have spent a lot of time in the sun in my 63 years, and I have also laughed alot, so I have some of those lines!  </li>
      <li>**skin must be clean and oil-free  </li>
      <li>And heaven forbid you smile, instead of fine wrinkles your skin folds like corrugated cardboard.</li>
      <li>After surgery my eye would open a fair amount</li>
      <li>Seriously, don&#x27;t smile.</li>
      <li>At the time it only worked until you smiled and then your face would crack up.  </li>
      <li>It also tells you not to smile or frown, which I did.</li>
      <li>painting clear glue under your eyes - It&#x27;s extremly drying and made my wrinkles more noticable.</li>
      <li>This is WELL WORTH the price.</li>

      <li>They did say on TV that you would need to mix a couple of drops in your foundation when putting it on because it was pretty drying.  </li>
      <li>so maybe this would be okay for younger women.  </li>
      <li>For the sake of the seller I hope that my post will be a positive one.</li>
      <li>Every time I make sure my face is dry, I never moisturize my face, so that wasn&#x27;t my problem.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see that it does what it claims.  </li>
      <li>THIS REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I saw this item on the Rachel Ray show and it really seemed to work for the lady that they tried it on.</li>
      <li>And I didn not use too much.</li>
      <li>It really is something you must stay away from.</li>
      <li>it really does work.</li>
      <li>When I did mix it with my foundation as instructed, it makes the foundation very powdery on my skin.</li>
      <li>I seemed to be wasting a lot of makeup to use just under the eye area without seeing much difference in appearance.  </li>
      <li>IN FRONT OF YOUR VERY EYES</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t work with too much foundation or eye cream.  </li>
      <li>It was really drying and you could definitely not wear it alone without seeing significant drying on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that I like much better that you don&#x27;t have to mix with foundation, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to those from now on.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t go for these kind of products.</li>
      <li>I am older</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried creams, lotions, serums from high end companies and nothing</li>
      <li>even makes it a little better.</li>
      <li>I have fine lines and slight bags--it diminished the lines a bit.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it would be fine for a few hours, I think, although I have yet to try this and go out.</li>
      <li>**if skin puckers, dab gently with wet fingertip  </li>
      <li>wow big differnets</li>
      <li>I could not go out in public without completely washing it off.  </li>
      <li>I really need to wear foundation (due to pigmentation issues)</li>
      <li>she could not use because it burned her eyes too much, and caused other problems with eyes.  </li>
      <li>My bags are pretty bad, so they weren&#x27;t COMPLETELY gone, but definitely 95% better.</li>
      <li>Only for evenings--or special day--It works a little, but not as I expected it to.  </li>

<li> Like the new green packages - they have been around for about 30 years.  </li>
<li> yes, it tightens, but it leaves behind a white residue once it dries and when you smile it enhances wrinkles.  </li>
<li> It will work for a limited time only, but if you need foundation or concealer forget it.</li>
<li> As far as flaking is concerned, I haven&#x27;t noticed any, although my daughter said it flaked a little when she tried it.  </li>
<li> But every single time I used it, it left a residue, it looked as though I let glue dry under my eyes.</li>
<li> After 3 minutes I had this white crusty looking, rough feeling stuff under my eyes.  </li>
<li> this has been on the makert for a long thime.</li>
<li> It was as if I had put egg whites under my eyes and let it dry.  </li>
<li> It does cake and dry the area.  </li>

<li> Dont waste your money on this product - you&#x27;d get the same result buy</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not the type that wears makeup or even tries this stuff, but as I get older, they are getting worse.</li>
<li> This product dries very tight under my eyes, then it leaves white lines, and I can&#x27;t cover them with make up.</li>
<li> and the small bottle will last me forever.</li>
<li> It is not what I had expected!</li>
<li> It cannot be used under or over any other face product so why bother.</li>
<li> I saw it on Dr Oz and have a hard time believing that it was recommended, makes him lose all credibility for the future.</li>
<li> So, I went out and bought it to treat my dark puffy circles.</li>
<li> I have always had problems with dark circles under my eyes, and this is a product I will use for years to come.</li>
<li> A Dermatologist was there when they were doing the testing and said he saw some difference when this product was used for puffiness and dark circles under the eye.  </li>
<li> I tried it over and over and had no success.</li>
<li> Not worth it!</li>
<li> I would be a little concerned if I wore it to bed and woke up with it all cracked -</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t like the white film it leaves behind.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>

<li> AFter a few hours, though, it does begin to flake and look like your skin is flaking (</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this has been on the makert for a long thime. it really does work. i see my face change right in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;i took a picture of before and after. wow big differnets</li>
    <li> yes, it tightens, but it leaves behind a white residue once it dries and when you smile it enhances wrinkles.  Definitely would not recommend.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I saw this item on the Rachel Ray show and it really seemed to work for the lady that they tried it on. So, I went out and bought it to treat my dark puffy circles. I&#x27;m not the type that wears makeup or even tries this stuff, but as I get older, they are getting worse. Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I&#x27;ve tried it 4 times. Every time I make sure my face is dry, I never moisturize my face, so that wasn&#x27;t my problem. It also tells you not to smile or frown, which I did. But every single time I used it, it left a residue, it looked as though I let glue dry under my eyes. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Ever used a liquid bandage or Nu-Skin? That&#x27;s what this looks like on your face. And heaven forbid you smile, instead of fine wrinkles your skin folds like corrugated cardboard.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum from a testimonial I saw on the Rachel Ray Show.  I really don&#x27;t see that it does what it claims.  The directions tell you to put no moisturizer on before or after using the product, and the product itself drys my skin out.  When I did mix it with my foundation as instructed, it makes the foundation very powdery on my skin.</li>
    <li> Please ladies, do not order this. It is beyond snake oil, it is just a horrible product. It made my eyes itch, it peels when it dries so you look like you have excema, just gross. And I didn not use too much. It really is something you must stay away from. I saw it on Dr Oz and have a hard time believing that it was recommended, makes him lose all credibility for the future. I guess I have to give this a star to have the review posted, they need negative stars.</li>
    <li> After seeing this product on Rachel Ray, I decided to order. It is a miracle. I just \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; that bags were creeping under my eyes. This product works instantly and lasts all day. The proof really came under the flourescent lights at hairdressers, where the bags show the worst. NO BAGS AT ALL...NO discoloration under the eyes. LOVE THIS PRODUCT. and the small bottle will last me forever.</li>
    <li> Sudden under eye firming serum; THIS product works. I had an accident and cut the muscle in my eye lid and in the cheek area. After surgery my eye would open a fair amount and I was considering additional surgery. Whe I saw this product being reviewed on TV I thought I would give it a try.   To my surprise one application and there was noticeable difference, It has been over a year now and I use it twice a week (I am retired)usually when I go visiting friends and on Sunday.  I highly recommend this I have always had problems with dark circles under my eyes, and this is a product I will use for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with most of the reviews and can&#x27;t understand why a lot of people love this product.    It definitely doesn&#x27;t last long.  It does cake and dry the area.  I doesn&#x27;t work with too much foundation or eye cream.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling of flaking off when I touch my face.  It will work for a limited time only, but if you need foundation or concealer forget it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  When it drys it becomes crusty and flakes off. I even tried to mix it with my liquied makeup and it looks worse.  This product should not even be sold.  Will ask for my money back.</li>
    <li> Glad this didn&#x27;t cost a lot. I tried it twice, thinking I&#x27;d overdone it the first time.  Both times, the results were much worse than the bags I&#x27;ve lived with for years.  It reduced the puffiness, alright, but picture what happens to a grape when it becomes a raisin.  Not the result I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I am purchasing this product for the first time. I should have read the reviews before I placed my order but I did not. After reading a few of the postings it makes one not want to purchase this product at all. But I do understand that what might work for some people, might not necessarily work for others. So as soon as I get and start using this product I will post the pros and cons of buying it, if there are any. For the sake of the seller I hope that my post will be a positive one. Will keep ya&#x27;ll updated..</li>
    <li> Heard about this product from a doctor on Oprah. It definitely tightens, but it feels a bit strangle. I suppose you could become accustomed to that, though. AFter a few hours, though, it does begin to flake and look like your skin is flaking (like when you&#x27;re peeling after a sunburn).  Overall, it would be fine for a few hours, I think, although I have yet to try this and go out.</li>
    <li> This product does shrink the bags under your eyes, but you can only wear it with liquid makeup.  Sometimes it starts flaking off and you have to reapply it which is not always at a convenient time.  However it does what is says it will do, shrink those bags.</li>
    <li> This product did not minimize anything; only made them much worse. I tried it over and over and had no success. Very disappointing. Don&#x27;t waste your money! I totally wasted mine.</li>
    <li> I tried this eye cream, I put it on and it did seem to tighten skin and then in about 5 minutes it started to crack  and peel off, it was horrible. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This tightens your skin, but leaves a layer you can see, and then it starts to peel.  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> I knew Sudden Change worked from way back when I was a teen.  At the time it only worked until you smiled and then your face would crack up.  But the formula has been changed so that it will last  for an evening.  I even wear it to sleep with the Night Eye Repair.  THIS REALLY WORKS IN FRONT OF YOUR VERY EYES IN 1-2 minutes. It&#x27;s like nothing you&#x27;ve ever used.  And the cost is good value. It eliminates under eye bags and takes YEARS off of your face.    I would be a little concerned if I wore it to bed and woke up with it all cracked - a man would think he went to sleep with a 10 and woke up with a 2!! LOL  Like the new green packages - they have been around for about 30 years.  Kudos to them for the product and their shipments were right on time.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on this product - you&#x27;d get the same result buy painting clear glue under your eyes - It&#x27;s extremly drying and made my wrinkles more noticable. Not something I&#x27;ll ever buy again.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on Rachel Ray. About a year ago I went to a plastic surgeon to see if there was anything he could do for the bags under my eyes EXCEPT for surgery, and there wasn&#x27;t anything for me. I&#x27;ve tried creams, lotions, serums from high end companies and nothing even makes it a little better. I put it on this morning before work. I was amazed. My bags are pretty bad, so they weren&#x27;t COMPLETELY gone, but definitely 95% better. If you didn&#x27;t know me, and I didn&#x27;t point it out, you wouldn&#x27;t notice I had bags at all. This is WELL WORTH the price. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as I received it.   Only for evenings--or special day--It works a little, but not as I expected it to.  I have fine lines and slight bags--it diminished the lines a bit.  What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that I can&#x27;t put moisturizer on after.  Also,  since this is used as a cover-up product-my foundation goes on after because you&#x27;re not supposed to put anything on after you use this product.   Maybe I have it all wrong.   If I do,  please, someone let me know.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and doing my own experimenting, this is what I&#x27;ve learned:  **shake the bottle before use  **skin must be clean and oil-free  **if skin puckers, dab gently with wet fingertip  **mixing with foundation will reduce the effectiveness  As far as flaking is concerned, I haven&#x27;t noticed any, although my daughter said it flaked a little when she tried it.  I really need to wear foundation (due to pigmentation issues) and so I will continue to experiment.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work. cant go out in public with it on. it makes u look like u have egg whites on your face. dries flaky and white. flakes off. just embarassing</li>
    <li> After all the Hype on the Dr. Oz show I ordered this serum.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I carefully followed the directions on how to apply it.  After 3 minutes I had this white crusty looking, rough feeling stuff under my eyes.  It was as if I had put egg whites under my eyes and let it dry.  I could not go out in public without completely washing it off.  I have thrown the crap away.</li>
    <li> Product will pull up bags under eyes but when it dries it leaves a white scaly looking substance.  It also says you can use it with make up but although I followed directions, it never worked for me.  I am older so maybe this would be okay for younger women.  I think the only thing that will remove bags is surgery!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t smile. Seriously, don&#x27;t smile. Once you put this on you can&#x27;t move your face muscles. It cannot be used under or over any other face product so why bother. After one hour it&#x27;s effects were gone for me.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t go for these kind of products. I saw it demonstrated on tv and decided to try it. It really works. Within minutes the skin looks smooth; no residue at all.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> bought for my wife after seeing advertised on rachael ray tv show.  she could not use because it burned her eyes too much, and caused other problems with eyes.  she tried couple of times before giving up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after seeing it on TV.  They were reviewing face products you could use instead of having costly procedures done.  A Dermatologist was there when they were doing the testing and said he saw some difference when this product was used for puffiness and dark circles under the eye.  They did say on TV that you would need to mix a couple of drops in your foundation when putting it on because it was pretty drying.  I thought for the price that I would give it a try.  It was really drying and you could definitely not wear it alone without seeing significant drying on the skin.  I seemed to be wasting a lot of makeup to use just under the eye area without seeing much difference in appearance.  I had to stop using because it was too drying.  I&#x27;ve used other products that I like much better that you don&#x27;t have to mix with foundation, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to those from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sudden Change for about 3 weeks now, and I like how it tightens the skin around my eyes.  I have spent a lot of time in the sun in my 63 years, and I have also laughed alot, so I have some of those lines!  Sudden Change has provided me with that temporary sudden change!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Temporary fix if you can tolerate the how it feels on your skin.</li>
    <li> This product dries very tight under my eyes, then it leaves white lines, and I can&#x27;t cover them with make up. The only way to get rid of the lines is to use water, but after I use water it loosens the serum and the bags come back... (my under eye bags have gotten worse)&lt;br /&gt;Very Frustrating... I will not purchase this product again!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27; believe this product works as advertized.  I didn&#x27;t see any change.  I would not recommend this item to my friends</li>
    <li> Works great,  better than high end creams I have tried.  Just play around with it a bit.  I use a very good moisturizer first, this eliminates  any lines.  Also I only needed one drop for both eyes,  this eliminated any white flakes.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money</li>
    <li> This product does smooth my lines and wrinkles somewhat but I don&#x27;t like the white film it leaves behind. But I use it anyway.</li>
    <li> It is not what I had expected! Does not work for me, my puffiness has not changed! I was disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she uses it daily, she has terrible sleep habits and it obviously helps her appearance.</li>
</ol>
