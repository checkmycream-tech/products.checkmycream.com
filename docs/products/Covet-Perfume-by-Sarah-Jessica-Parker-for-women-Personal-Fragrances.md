### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After reading the reviews this seemed like the perfect product for me.  </li>
      <li>I received my bottle today and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
      <li>Its perfect.</li>
      <li>This was a very good price for 3.4 ounces.</li>
      <li>and I am happy to buy from them again.</li>
      <li>and smells great.</li>
      <li>I cannot quite describe it but its not as pleasant as it once was.</li>
      <li>so I ordered one for her as well as one for myself, again Amazon came thru with a pleasant purchase.</li>
      <li>and it keeps surprising you.</li>
      <li>Amazon provides a good price and a good variety of products in this line, too.</li>
      <li>Good call SJP</li>
      <li>and I got a great deal on a huge size!</li>
      <li>The two scents coincides very interestingly well together.</li>
      <li>and I simply love it!</li>
      <li>Covet is a strong, night time parfume, but can be used during the day; therefore if any of your are looking for a  great pafume to wear at a special event at night or just to smell great during the day, I recommend Covet.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, Covet is beautiful.</li>
      <li>I loved the original scent but something has changed in the formula since then.</li>
      <li>As it fades, it develops into a spicy blend of delicious goodness- lighter, and much more developed-</li>
      <li>they keep this item in stock, it is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>This is a favorite Perfume - a fragrance that does NOT catch your breath.</li>
      <li>This perfume is one of many layers.</li>
      <li>I just love this Covet Parfum created by Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
      <li>This has become one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>They fell in love with the scent.  </li>
      <li>I love Lovely</li>
      <li>Not too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>just glad that I&#x27;m still able to find it.</li>
      <li>One of my favorites and I receive many complements when wearing it.</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful, mild perfume.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been fantastic, and a nice mellow alternative to the light fresh notes in most perfumes I like without being too musky.</li>
      <li>I want a fabulous fragrance for my wedding.</li>
      <li>It is one of my favorite fragrances; a lite, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It is light and airy and does not overtake the world around them.  </li>
      <li>Tucci has been a good seller to me so far</li>
      <li>I already have Lovely and LOVE It, since the reviews are so high on this product, I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this fragrance in the mail.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a unique perfume.</li>
      <li>I was looking to try something new that a lot of people didn&#x27;t already own, so  decided to shop online and see what i could find.  </li>
      <li>At first spray, it comes off quite strong, with almost a citrus like scent.</li>
      <li>The green coloring, the brown flower top, it screams vintage (which I love!).</li>
      <li>Covet is fun to wear.</li>
      <li>People tell me frequently how they love my cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a manly lumberjack fresh out of that shower.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful, unexpected scent -- not for a J.Lo-type of girl, but more for the woman who revels in owning vintage costume jewelry and handbags, knowing that she&#x27;s the only one wearing such finds.</li>
      <li>but it smells just about right:</li>
      <li>I wanted something a bit heavier and it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>I have previously used Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy, which I loved-</li>
      <li>I love lemon, chocolate and lavender separately, but I never imagined they could combine to create such a scent.</li>
      <li>At first I noticed the musky lavender, but as the day wore on, I could identify the chocolate and lemon as well.</li>
      <li>I ordered SJP Covet after reading many mixed reviews.</li>
      <li>I never buy fragrance without smelling first.</li>
      <li>Clean and not heavy.</li>
      <li>And I have a very keen sense of smell.  </li>
      <li>but was ready for a change.</li>
      <li>I am very satified with the product</li>
      <li>It smells very unattractive for a woman who is as feminine as I am.</li>
      <li>so much I took the chance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so unique, I&#x27;m surprised you can only find it online now.</li>
      <li>Having had much difficulty trying to buy this Perfume in the stores,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon came up not only with the goods but at a very reasonable price</li>
      <li>Lemony/greens in the beginning then give it a few minutes and it becomes soft and warm, almost velvety with soft musk.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a new scent for a couple of months, when I came upon Covet.</li>
      <li>The seller gave me a refund in the end, that is the only positive thing.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re one of those people that like unexpected scents then this is for you.</li>
      <li>I only spritzed twice, but was able to pick up the scent (not over-powering, but not light either), even hours later.   </li>
      <li>I will be ordering another bottle soon, because I don&#x27;t want to wait too long, and have it become completely unavailable!</li>
      <li>I generally like to alternate between Thierry Mugler Angel and Vera Wang Princess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the few perfumes that the wife enjoys wearing and in limited supply so I bought her three to have on hand....</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful, mild perfume.  Tucci has been a good seller to me so far and I am happy to buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I gave each of my two daughters this as one of their Christmas gifts.  They fell in love with the scent.  It is light and airy and does not overtake the world around them.  This was a very good price for 3.4 ounces.</li>
    <li> My spouse bought this perfume for me years ago while he was deployed. I loved the original scent but something has changed in the formula since then. I cannot quite describe it but its not as pleasant as it once was. Buyer beware on purchasing scents via mail.</li>
    <li> I ordered SJP Covet after reading many mixed reviews. I have previously used Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy, which I loved- but was ready for a change. Right out of the box, Covet is beautiful. The green coloring, the brown flower top, it screams vintage (which I love!). At first spray, it comes off quite strong, with almost a citrus like scent. As it fades, it develops into a spicy blend of delicious goodness- lighter, and much more developed- my husband adores it. If you&#x27;re hesitant, I definitely recommend giving Covet a try. I will be ordering another bottle soon, because I don&#x27;t want to wait too long, and have it become completely unavailable!</li>
    <li> I just love this Covet Parfum created by Sarah Jessica Parker. Covet is a strong, night time parfume, but can be used during the day; therefore if any of your are looking for a  great pafume to wear at a special event at night or just to smell great during the day, I recommend Covet.</li>
    <li> Having had much difficulty trying to buy this Perfume in the stores,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon came up not only with the goods but at a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> My aunt wanted this perfume so I ordered one for her as well as one for myself, again Amazon came thru with a pleasant purchase. and smells great.</li>
    <li> I am very satified with the product just glad that I&#x27;m still able to find it. Always&lt;br /&gt;hope they keep this item in stock, it is my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite Perfume - a fragrance that does NOT catch your breath. A wear every day or any day fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ummm - May I point out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance &#x3D; perfume, flowers&lt;br /&gt;Aroma &#x3D; Food, cooking&lt;br /&gt;Smell &#x3D; usually anything other than mentioned above. Usually a negative. In example: what is that smell?</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite scents.  One of the very few I have used for years.  Amazon provides a good price and a good variety of products in this line, too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 years off and on. It is one of my favorite fragrances; a lite, fresh smell. Clean and not heavy. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this fragrance in the mail. But when it finally came I was GREATLY disappointed. I was looking to try something new that a lot of people didn&#x27;t already own, so  decided to shop online and see what i could find.  After reading the reviews this seemed like the perfect product for me.  I was wrong, this fragrance might be the WORST that I have ever owned. It smells like every weird thing that you&#x27;d find in an old persons home, a dirt, motor oil and a hint of alcohol. Which is why I will remain confused about all of the \\&quot;great\\&quot; things other have posted about this product. No one has complimented me on this scent in the day an a half that I have tried to give it a chance. It smells very unattractive for a woman who is as feminine as I am. It&#x27;s like a manly lumberjack fresh out of that shower. And I have a very keen sense of smell.  I will NOT be purchasing this product again. And once again I am highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I want a fabulous fragrance for my wedding. After several stops @ perfume counters, I just had to order Covet by SJP, I have used 1 sparingly for the past 3 years and I simply love it! It has layers to its fragrance and it keeps surprising you.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new scent for a couple of months, when I came upon Covet. I generally like to alternate between Thierry Mugler Angel and Vera Wang Princess. I like dark, patchouli scents, and some floral as well. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I read the description of the notes in Covet. I love lemon, chocolate and lavender separately, but I never imagined they could combine to create such a scent. This perfume is one of many layers. At first I noticed the musky lavender, but as the day wore on, I could identify the chocolate and lemon as well. I only spritzed twice, but was able to pick up the scent (not over-powering, but not light either), even hours later.   Covet is fun to wear. It is a beautiful, unexpected scent -- not for a J.Lo-type of girl, but more for the woman who revels in owning vintage costume jewelry and handbags, knowing that she&#x27;s the only one wearing such finds.</li>
    <li> I use this cologne and I bought it for my mother-in-law for Christmas and she loves it too!  People tell me frequently how they love my cologne.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle today and it&#x27;s perfect and I got a great deal on a huge size! I was worried it was going to be a fake but it smells just about right: Lemony/greens in the beginning then give it a few minutes and it becomes soft and warm, almost velvety with soft musk. The two scents coincides very interestingly well together. It&#x27;s not your typical fragrance for women. Actually I could imagine men wearing the scent as well. It&#x27;s so unique, I&#x27;m surprised you can only find it online now. If you&#x27;re one of those people that like unexpected scents then this is for you. Try it!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a unique perfume. The only problem is usually that they&#x27;re way overpriced. I already have Lovely and LOVE It, since the reviews are so high on this product, I thought I would give it a shot. It&#x27;s been fantastic, and a nice mellow alternative to the light fresh notes in most perfumes I like without being too musky. Good call SJP</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and when I opened the box I found that they gave me another perfume that I asked for. What a total disappointment! The seller gave me a refund in the end, that is the only positive thing. I got my money back. They honored it.</li>
    <li> I never buy fragrance without smelling first. I love Lovely so much I took the chance. Its perfect. I wanted something a bit heavier and it&#x27;s just right. Not too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love it. One of my favorites and I receive many complements when wearing it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was some nasty knockoff or what!  It smelled gross and wasn&#x27;t Covet!  I wear Covet all the time andthis was not it.</li>
