      <li>Lovely memories.&lt;br /&gt;♡</li>
      <li>Carry with me in case of emergency magic required.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I passed it by but took a good  look at the color of the particular scent I liked.</li>
      <li>This is a perfume that was introduced to me in 2005, and it has such a wonderful, fresh and pleasant &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that is so light</li>
      <li>The scent is very appealing and fresh, and it lasts longer than most perfumes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>and I always smell nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>Very exciting blend, lovely, natural, great sillage without knocking anyone out.</li>
      <li>, what I like about this scent is that it does not go on too strong....</li>

      <li>Easy ordering,very smooth.</li>
      <li>i was so happy to find that I could purchase locally.  </li>
      <li>Or is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>bottle is a great value - it will last me 1 year.</li>
      <li>I thoroughly enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>I love Inis Or&#x27;s fresh and clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Beautifully light clean fragrance</li>
      <li>Light and clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>A lovely scent, and my husband likes it very much.</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Fresh and invigorating scent and often asked about this fragrance!</li>
      <li>it just makes any occasion special.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely unique makes me smile.</li>
      <li>but I was out of time and this came quickly.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I found it much cheaper on Amazon ($30 for 3.3 oz.)</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite parfum from Inis.</li>
      <li>Light and overall a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I originally came across this perfume in a British Isles shop in Gatlinburg, TN and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>This scent doesn&#x27;t suit a \\&quot;girlie-girl\\&quot;; it&#x27;s feminine to be sure, but a scent for an active, confident woman.</li>
      <li>When I got home, I checked Amazon and there was the (I thought) exact same bottle as the one I liked.</li>
      <li>It is great for everyday wear or a night out on the town!</li>
      <li>I love it&#x27;s cool, light, slightly floral scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s crisp and not too overpowering</li>
      <li>This perfume smells EXACTLY like</li>
      <li>my ex-husband&#x27;s body wash, which I&#x27;m pretty sure was Irish Spring shower gel.  </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this parfum.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely perfume but does not stay long on the body- about 2 hours</li>
      <li>It is definitely one of my all time favorite four parfums those being D&amp;G Light Blue, Addict by Dior, Boyfriend by Kate Walsh and now Inis: Or.  </li>
      <li>It really makes me think of the Aran Islands.</li>
      <li>The scent really lasts on me</li>
      <li>Got this for the wife and she liked it but not as much as the regular Inis we had gotten at an Irish store in Hope, PA.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>I was not pleased with this purchase but it was my own doing.</li>
      <li>, lasts long and nice and fresh, but not amazing, doesn&#x27;t blow me away, but worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume, hands- down!</li>
      <li>For the price, I do belive Inis:Or will be my new signature scent too.  </li>
      <li>Nice, subtle, lemony floral scent.</li>
      <li>Could wax poetic on this fragrance - let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s my star of all Fragrances of Ireland&#x27;s perfumes, and it has the power to change bad days to good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old</li>
      <li>When I was visiting my sister, I shared a room with my 20 year old niece.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is different from the varieties I usually purchase, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clean and just sparkles!</li>
      <li>You can barely smell this one...</li>
      <li>Next time, I will write the exact name down.</li>

    <li> Smells so nice.  I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Could wax poetic on this fragrance - let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s my star of all Fragrances of Ireland&#x27;s perfumes, and it has the power to change bad days to good.

    <li> When I was visiting my sister, I shared a room with my 20 year old niece. I noticed she always smelled great. Asked her what she wore and she told me Inis Eau De Parfum. I purchased a bottle last year and just reordered again. I&#x27;m 58 years old and I always smell nice and fresh. Love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> Great product...terrific scent!!!</li>
    <li> A lovely scent, and my husband likes it very much. This scent doesn&#x27;t suit a \\&quot;girlie-girl\\&quot;; it&#x27;s feminine to be sure, but a scent for an active, confident woman.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells EXACTLY like my ex-husband&#x27;s body wash, which I&#x27;m pretty sure was Irish Spring shower gel.  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing.  The scent is very appealing and fresh, and it lasts longer than most perfumes I&#x27;ve used.  But I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to wear it :-(</li>
    <li> Being 100% Irish, the perfume intrigued me...when I tried it 7 yrs ago, I fell in love with it...I use nothing else and my daughter is a fan as well!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, hands- down! It reminds me of the ocean, with a slight flowery note. Very clean smelling and lasts a good amount of time. The 3 oz. bottle is a great value - it will last me 1 year.</li>
    <li> love the smell.  I visited Ireland about 8 years ago and i purchased this perfume.  i was so happy to find that I could purchase locally.  Love, love, love perfume.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent.  I wish the scent would last longer however, what I like about this scent is that it does not go on too strong....maybe the reason it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> The is the best Fragrance ever!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful fresh fragrance !! Feels refreshing and like you just got out of the shower. I get so many compliments when I wear it. Great for daytime and summer!!</li>
    <li> Fragrances of Ireland Inis Or Eau de Parfum 3.3 Fluid Ounces.  Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance! Would highly recommend!  A wonderful gift for that special person in your life!</li>
    <li> Since August 2012, I have worn this as my signature fragrance and always get compliments on it. I love it&#x27;s cool, light, slightly floral scent. I will continue wearing it as long as it&#x27;s made. Don&#x27;t ever stop production, please!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume but does not stay long on the body- about 2 hours and it is all gone! Nice, subtle, lemony floral scent.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is different from the varieties I usually purchase, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clean and just sparkles! I will add to the other fragrances I use.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found Inis! my wife has been using this for years. Easy ordering,very smooth. Thank you   for being on the net.</li>
    <li> I love Inis perfumes! I started wearing Inis a year ago, when I came across it in a Maine beach boutique! I love Inis Or&#x27;s fresh and clean scent.  It&#x27;s crisp and not too overpowering but it definitely gets noticed! I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> You can barely smell this one...I like the moon version much better.</li>
    <li> I originally came across this perfume in a British Isles shop in Gatlinburg, TN and fell in love with it. Unfortunately it was $70 for a 1 oz. bottle. Fortunately I found it much cheaper on Amazon ($30 for 3.3 oz.) It&#x27;s the perfect blend of floral &amp; citrus...think Tommy Girl, except Irish. Loooove it!</li>
    <li> Shipping was prompt...which is good since my wife cannot live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this purchase but it was my own doing. I saw this perfume in an Irish shop and it was quite pricey. I passed it by but took a good  look at the color of the particular scent I liked. When I got home, I checked Amazon and there was the (I thought) exact same bottle as the one I liked. I ordered it and when it arrived, I realized while the bottle was very similar, the scent one of the other varieties and I did not care for it.  The price was close to one half of the bottle I saw in the Irish shop. Next time, I will write the exact name down. There was absolutely nothing wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance.  It smells very fresh and clean.  It sort of does smell like Irish Spring Deodorant Soap, but more sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, very good price for parfum which has more oils than EDT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, lasts long and nice and fresh, but not amazing, doesn&#x27;t blow me away, but worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells like Ireland!&lt;br /&gt;My visit to the Emerald Isle was where I found Inis and wear it everyday. Lovely memories.&lt;br /&gt;♡</li>
    <li> A sure favorite that will yield attention and compliments.  Subtle but arresting.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite good company to deal with</li>
    <li> ENTICING FRAGRANCE WHICH IS FLEETING:  LASTS ONLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, THEN ONE NEVER KNOWS IT&#x27;S BEEN SPRAYED ON.  NOT AT ALL A LASTING FRAGRANCE, WHICH IS INITIALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE.</li>
    <li> Love this beautiful scent, light and clean. I bought it for all my daughters and wife. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a perfume that was introduced to me in 2005, and it has such a wonderful, fresh and pleasant &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that is so light it just makes any occasion special.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> What a bummer.  I had always purchased Inis in the past.  I douse myself in this and can&#x27;t smell a thing.  yes yes I have asked others around me.  I think this was made with dolphin spray.  Very disappointing.  I will stick with plain old Inis next time.</li>
    <li> Fresh and invigorating scent and often asked about this fragrance! From Ireland of course.</li>
    <li> Beautifully light clean fragrance</li>
    <li> This is a great refreshing fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite parfum from Inis. It is great for everyday wear or a night out on the town!</li>
    <li> Light and overall a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> lovely scent. a drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo good</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to learn that this could not be returned. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last and it is not nearly as nice as the plain Inis and I am stuck with it. If they can ship it to me, why can&#x27;t I ship it back?!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used Inis cologne and love it so thought I&#x27;d try the perfume. I am very disappointed as it has a unpleasnt smell. Not anything like the description in folder.  If I could have returned it, I would have.</li>
    <li> smells like a man&#x27;s colonge</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh.  Inis: Or is fantastic.  The scent really lasts on me and I think I really love it because it has base notes of patchuli, sandalwood and cedarwood.  The fragance is to just heavenly!  It is definitely one of my all time favorite four parfums those being D&amp;G Light Blue, Addict by Dior, Boyfriend by Kate Walsh and now Inis: Or.  For the price, I do belive Inis:Or will be my new signature scent too.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this parfum.  Simply fantastic!  I can&#x27;t imagine anybody not liking this!</li>
    <li> I found this fragrance when I was visiting Ireland . . . and I LOVE it.  It really makes me think of the Aran Islands.</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife and she liked it but not as much as the regular Inis we had gotten at an Irish store in Hope, PA.  Still not sure how the Gold differs from what we had before but I was out of time and this came quickly.</li>
    <li> The fragrances of Ireland are the only perfumes that I wear now.  I thoroughly enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely unique makes me smile. Light and clean fragrance. Impressed with seller shipping was timely. Irish girl here  &#x3D;)  Great for a beautiful summer day in So Cal.</li>
