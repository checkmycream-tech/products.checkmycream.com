      <li>I&#x27;ve tested pretty much everything!</li>
      <li>I wish the finisher bottle was a lot bigger, I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out of it very quickly, and I won&#x27;t be able to use regular shiny topcoat</li>
      <li>not as much as say a glitter polish but more than my regular polish any way</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my mom likes it but it peels off to fast</li>
    <li> Bought as Christmas gift for tween girl.  She should b pleased to have such pretty shades.</li>
    <li> wide variety. now the hardest part is to choose which color</li>
    <li> Gorgeous and so cost effective.</li>
    <li> The set was delivered quickly and all colors are as advertised.  Absolutely beautiful colors.  The only issue so far is the reds.  I always use a base coat especially with dark polish.  The red stained my nails so badly I will have to use a buffer or bleach to remove the stains.  Overall I am very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!!! I love the matte finish!!! I am truly in love with these colours. I will buy more of this brand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the purple and the silver so far, and they are really great matte colors. very sleek colors that don&#x27;t take too long to dry. I wish the finisher bottle was a lot bigger, I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out of it very quickly, and I won&#x27;t be able to use regular shiny topcoat or then it will get weird. Slick colors though! very chic</li>
    <li> Bought this set as stocking stuttered for a company party and they were a hit. The days following held nothing but good reviews of the polish and the matte finish was the main topic of conversation. I would definitely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Cheap, great quality, and quick shipping!! I love the color selection, as well as the packaging. It comes with a matte-ifying nail polish which is really great for the 2013 fall trends. All around, this set has colors for all year round. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not very impressed. I do love the colors, but when they say matte, they mean dries like it was made of colored mud. Once I put this stuff on (I have used 5 different colors so far) I have to put at least 2 coats of clear polish over it or add the glitter nail polish so that it gives it some POP. If not, this stuff would look like I painted my nails with a sharpie.</li>
    <li> I really like the way theyou came out, however,  they chipped easily. ..</li>
    <li> Showed up quickly. I&#x27;m using these for a cancer benefit raffle item.  They are beautiful colors and I&#x27;m sure to make money for the child.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on Sunday and I received them today (Saturday), just under 1 week later. I got 17 matte colors plus the matte topcoat. I have not tried them out yet but I did put them in my book. My only issues are that I had a couple bottles that stuck a bit when I first opened them and there was dry nail polish around the screw top which means that they had either been opened or not sealed properly and I also had one bottle that had a chunk missing from around the top opening. Nothing that should cause  problems with use, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are fantastic. They are a great addition to my collection. As long as wear of these is pretty good I will be ordering more from Klean Color. You can not beat this price. Including shipping I paid about $1.08 per bottle of polish!!! I can get about 7-8 bottles of this stuff for the same amount as I typically spend on 1 bottle of my other brands, so this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have photos up yet but soon I will have swatches and full reviews up on my blog. You can check that out at hannahsnails11.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Nail polish starts coming off the same day you put it on.</li>
    <li> It dries fast which is great. It doesnt last long at all. If you want to wear it for a night it is good to use, but it doesnt last any longer.</li>
    <li> A large assortment of dark complimentary matte shades . I use with my regular and glitter polishes to create some interesting looks.</li>
    <li> Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a matte finish and I have to say I am in LOVE with the look and feel! One coat (on the heavy side) was all that was needed. Going to a MLB game tomorrow so I have painted my nails with 2 colors on each nail. And leaving the matte finish. Looks wonderful on my nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great collection.  Got this for my daughter during the holidays and I use it as often as she does!</li>
    <li> Worst quality nail polish ever created</li>
    <li> I love the beautiful shiny colors. The colors really dont stand out until you add a topcoat but the polish does chip easy the very next day the polish starts chipping and i also did not recieve the colors that are pictured the seller needs to put colors may vary or change the picture</li>
    <li> I have never used matte finish, and I will not in the future.  They are just very boring and no fun for my daughter.</li>
    <li> The nail polishes were amazing! Just as shown on the site. The colors are amazing. The bottles are huge! No chipping and long lasting!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> THE. WORST. POLISH. EVER!</li>
    <li> I received my package and everything was just fine. No broken bottles. Nicely packaged. This is a great deal......a little over a dollar per polish. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I agree with others, I did experience chipping within a few days but, I am used to it when I do my own nails...Polish doesn&#x27;t last.  However, on my toes, absolutely perfect.  Not one chip or crack at all.  May be that i used different colors, not sure but i used two different colors on my toes and a totally different one on my nails so i doubt it.  That said, i love the colors.  Not usually a matte girl but... glad i took a risk.  I have one that wasn&#x27;t a matte color, but I like the color so its ok.  I have to say I was impressed at how fast my order arrived.  I ordered on may 3rd ( a Saturday) and received may 10th (the next Saturday).  Plan to order more soon.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors. I did not buy them for the matte finish, but it does add more art choices if you do some with clear coat and some with out. But when doing art on top of the color you have to put a top coat are the color bleeds to the art.</li>
    <li> The matte finisher doesn&#x27;t work like I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> I only just received this set,  but if they are like the others,  I will love them.  Kleancolor is my go to brand from now on!  The colors in this collection are just beautiful,  there isn&#x27;t one color in this set I wouldn&#x27;t use. I would recommend to my friends.  In  fact,  I plan to order more as gifts.</li>
    <li> These polishes are absolutely beautiful.  The colors are gorgeous and the finish dries to a matte look with a smooth touch.  Many people notice my nails and ask what kind of polish it is.</li>
    <li> these kleancolor matte metallic set is perfect. my daughter loves them. you get nice colors and she just loves painting her nails.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> I love the colors they go on perfectly. Polish arrived 5 days early. I got these for my daughter, we did nails and toes tried out all the colors and they were all great, even colors we didn&#x27;t think we would like looked good on. I will absolutely buy more Kleancolor colors in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Very pretty colors. Came quickly, unbroken, and no repeats. Very Happy.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> these matte metallic set is perfect. the color really stand out, but I don&#x27;t like that they chip rather quickly after a day of wear, they are great colors but the polish for these matte colors does not last very long</li>
    <li> great gift, VERY affortable, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Every time I wear one of these colors I get compliments - I&#x27;ve given out the name more times than I can count</li>
    <li> The matte finish polish colors are nice and vibrant and apply with ease, but once applied the paint chips off right away.</li>
    <li> Colors are as seen in pictures but, they chip and peel in little to no time at all.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the fact that they are all matte colors but... they chip after a day, even on my toes :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried doing nothing to my nails, ive tried a base coat, buffing, and everything else with no luck keeping the polish on for more than a couple days without chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the matte finish starts to fade away after a while. Im not sure if this is just because I use my hands for everything and they get washed a lot but it happens non-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the fact that there is a top coat that is matte. I used it on my regular polish and it dries as a matte color. pretty great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish does take a little effort to remove as well. not as much as say a glitter polish but more than my regular polish any way</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought they are very thick even have clumps in the bottle I do not want to add note polish remover to bend them out I should not receive a horrible product I do not have the time nor the patience to return them so to other buyers beware if you do not want to return them then do not order them they are absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> Not thin, good coverage, super cool colors, AMAZING bargain&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a barista with a nail polish obsession, and given my occupation I absolutely REQUIRE that my polish can stand up to a decent beating... I&#x27;ve tested pretty much everything! I believe these will be rather durable, like a 7.5 out of 10 (with glitter polish ranking at 10)</li>
    <li> This is a great set, full-size bottles...let me warn you, this polish does NOT come off easily!! Even if you get the KleanColor Nail Polish Remover pads, this polish goes on and stays on!!</li>
    <li> So far I have used two different colors and they are easy to use.  I love the assortment of colors. If you like to paint your nails a lot this is a perfect buy!</li>
    <li> my nail polish lasted longer than one day the color are pretty highly suggest buying this :-)</li>
    <li> Very happy will buy more for my salon.</li>
    <li> I just got these today and was really excited to try them but I didn&#x27;t get the 18 colors as promised. I did get 18 bottles in 3 boxes but unfortunately 2 of the boxes were exactly the same, so I got 11 colors plus the madly matte bottle. The other 6 bottles were another madly matte bottle and 5 colors that were in the other box...not good quality assurance</li>
    <li> Two stars because these were not nearly as good as I&#x27;ve been reading... Some reviews were mixed about whether it chips quickly or not, but I had seen more saying that they last for a while so I decided to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know nail polish chips. But these chipped within HOURS. Hours of doing little to nothing because I don&#x27;t want to be too active after doing my nails. It was really quite unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was just that color (black), but it happened with four other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the color, when it&#x27;s actually on your nails, is really very nice. You know they&#x27;re dry when they lighten up (very softly, doesn&#x27;t take anything away from the color). It dries VERY quickly and evenly. The colors are for sure amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t give a better rating because I can&#x27;t get over how quickly they chip.</li>
    <li> Love Kleancolor Polish...great buy!</li>
    <li> A great set of metallic matte colors.  They don&#x27;t do well for stamping (which is why I bought them), but they&#x27;re great cheap polishes.</li>
</ol>
