<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Biore product line is usually fairly strong. The unclogging scrub is a blemish on their record though. Get it? Blemish? Cause it&#x27;s supposed to clear those?...nevermind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the micro beads are a little small. They don&#x27;t scrub as much as you would expect. Then there&#x27;s the fact that it seems to dry out your face if used on a daily basis. If you don&#x27;t plan on using it that much, you might be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past that, it is a decent cleanser. It does give a pretty deep clean. There hasn&#x27;t been much of a problem with black heads. But it goes back to the fact that it&#x27;s not a great daily scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different skin, so be sure to try it yourself if you&#x27;re curious.</li>
    <li> I work in a factory and I routinely shower directly after coming home from work. Still I experience blemishes. I started using Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub and watched the blemishes reduce to really nothing. How could you go wrong with Biore?</li>
    <li> The previous pore unclogging scrub formula had transformed my skin completely in a matter of days- results which were easy to maintain by continuing to keep the scrub in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that they had updated the packaging, I didn&#x27;t panic at all because I assumed the formula inside would be the same. I&#x27;ve had flaky, oily, acne-prone skin since I was 12- So that&#x27;s 14 years now. But last year when I made Biore Pore Unclogging scrub a regular part of my daily routine, everything changed. I suddenly had bright glowing skin- everybody noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some skin irritation on my face after my first time using this new formula, but attributed it to the weather- my allergies had been out of control. But it&#x27;s weeks later and my allergies have mellowed out, and my face has been looking duller and duller (and it&#x27;s still been feeling itchy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved into a new apartment and have been slowly unpacking and sorting through all of my things to see if there&#x27;s stuff that can be donated. Well, when I was checking my suitcase I found an unused bottle of the old formula and decided to try it out and see if there was a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, there was a tremendous difference, my glow came back and my skin looked fresh and bright again. This result prompted me to compare the ingredients list and things have definitely changed. The new formula and old formula are different. I hope the new formula will work wonders for someone, but Im not that person unfortunately. Readers, if you have any recommendations I&#x27;m on the quest to find my new &#x27;product that works&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Wow - actually worth way more than they charge and my new favorite skin smoothing shower... cream? No... wash? No... Just use this after you use soap or whatever. It smoothed out my nose and got rid of the blackheads everywhere without giving it a mirror finish which is a GOD SEND alone.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product. Has improved my complexion (and friends and family!) like magic. I tried a different Biore product out of interest - but developed acne. Returned to Pore Unclogging Scrub and problem solved again. I wont change to a different wash any time soon.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t like the greasy feel of this product.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Makes my face break out</li>
    <li> I saw good reviews about this and needed a new face wash, so I tried it out. I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results, but it&#x27;s not bad. It didn&#x27;t make my face oily, so that was a plus, but I didn&#x27;t really notice much else</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do any miracles but does the purpose cleans well. I got it for cheap on amazon so no complains .I like the cooling effect when you use it on face it feels so refreshing especially on summer days. Got the product on time.</li>
    <li> It is very good.Frosted effect is very good</li>
    <li> Awesome scrub---- cleans and does not dry out my sensitive skin. Feels like my skin better absorbs my night cream after cleansing with this.</li>
    <li> big fan, use it everyday. Some day are better than others, but I don&#x27;t blame the scrub</li>
    <li> I have been using the Biore Pore Unclogging scrub for a few years now and I really like it. The exfoliating beads aren&#x27;t too rough or grainy like other brands I have tried. I like the light scent it has which is not too chemically but rather pleasant. This works really well.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually helps. Don&#x27;t see any radical changes. I would say it is a decent scrub.</li>
    <li> Love this !! Strong smell to it camer super fast .. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well! Feels nice with a slight tingle, does not dry my face out &amp; fragrance is mild.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome, i got some in a care package in Afghanistan. It lathers in your hand pretty smoothly and when rubbed onto the face it immediately goes to work and has a cooling sensation, no burn like other creams. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth with no lotion or moisturizer required after.</li>
    <li> I use this every night with my Clarisonic and I have almost invisible pores. It really does work.</li>
    <li> Works for me. An easy way to have good skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and at such a low price how can you go wrong. It leaves my face feeling awesome and clean. I have problems finding a product that doesn&#x27;t have red dye in it and that works with my sensitive skin. This is a great product and would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely favorite skin care product.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this along with the pore unclogging strips I bought to use with it. I didn&#x27;t like the strips but this product seems like it helps clean my face better than just soap and water. OK oroduct and nothing negative to say about the shopping experience.</li>
    <li> Goes on quite smoothly without the feeling your sandpapering your skin like some other brands.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Love this wash! My skin feels dull and I break out when I use anything else.</li>
    <li> Got the for my mother as a gift and she likes it.  Don&#x27;t know much about it but she said it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> I got this on my subscribe and save and just bought it based on the reviews. I love that it actually feels like its working when you put it on and also love the fact that well.... it really works.</li>
    <li> nice feel to it but the little balls get caught sometimes in my scrubber</li>
    <li> I alternate this scrub with the other Biore scrub and it&#x27;s been great for my adult problem spots. Makes my face feel clean and tingly, right before I moisturize. Great Product and I recommend it to every age that has problem skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this scrub for years and love it! I use it twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin very much. I have oily prone skin with big pores, and I feel like the bead size in this scrub really gets in there and gets rid of all the dirt and oil. I have used foam cleansers in the past, and my face still feels dirty afterwards. I would recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I think the beads would irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cool， and I like the smell</li>
    <li> I use thus when I&#x27;m having breakouts. I like that it leaves your face tingly. It seems to do a good job with cleaning out pores.</li>
    <li> I like Bior&amp;eacute; products, and this is no exception.  This unclogging scrub does an excellent job of exfoliating, and after using the entire container over more than a month, my skin felt smoother and cleaner and seemed not only to breathe better, but to be softer and smoother - less dehydrated.  I used it daily, but just a small amount, and put a little bit of lotion on after showering.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Clears my face during my cycle very good</li>
    <li> I suppose everybody has a different body chemistry, so perhaps this scrub works better with some compared to others.  I personally do not like the feeling after using it.  It is a very heavy pasty cream, and my face feels smooth.. but waxy afterwords.  This causes the clean feeling to go away rather quickly and leave my face feeling greasy.  As far as &#x27;Pore Unclogging&#x27; goes, I haven&#x27;t seen any hardcore results there either.  The product is okay, but I certainly have used better...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and it works great!  It is the best thing I have found on the market and it is reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Works well in the sense my skin feels clean and a bit smoother after using it. The first time I used it, the smell really hit me as unpleasant. It had that odd, almost salty Play-Doh smell. I&#x27;ve since grown tolerant of the smell (as in I&#x27;m able to at least use thr product), but I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and its really hard to find a product that is great for my face. I saw a YouTube guru use it and decided to give it a try. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a face scrub that is not too harsh on my skin, but one that also does not leave my skin feeling greasy like the Neutrogena one I have been using. This scrub really seems to deep clean my skin and unclog my pores, all while leaving my face feeling clean. It arrived on time without any issues!</li>
    <li> This seems to work fine as a facial scrub.  I don&#x27;t use it exclusively because I don&#x27;t think that would be good for my skin, but it&#x27;s nice to get my face exfoliated a bit occasionally.</li>
    <li> Its a good product and i love the beads in it, for some reason its has a strong smell but it isnt bad.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week or more.</li>
    <li> This cash washed worked more for my wife than it did me. After using it for about a week, I broke out. On the other hand my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in pore condition after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product that is shown in the picture, and received a different version. It cost me more to buy it online; next time ill just go to Walmart or Target.... UGH!!</li>
    <li> Really good stuff! It makes your face feel really refreshed during the scrub and after the shower.</li>
    <li> too creamy, smells bad</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for that long but I like it so far!</li>
    <li> This really works great</li>
    <li> Ive used this product 2 times only and I love it already.  I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends. Makes my skin look so much better</li>
    <li> This worked well on my face when I used it. It does seem a little over-flaky. But if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, you may like it. A customer has asked if it respected the Cruelty To Animals Act. So I called Biore to ask them and they said Biore does not test their products on animals.</li>
    <li> I love biore facial cleansers. This is a great deep cleaning scrub</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!! It gives my face a fresh feeling, like toothpaste and mouthwash give your mouth. It also left my skin feeling softer and smoother since the initial use. The beads are great. I have been repurchasing ever since!</li>
    <li> Another great product from Biore. I love their warming cleanser, and I often use that in conjunction with this exfoliator. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use daily, but it&#x27;s not the best makeup remover (because it&#x27;s not really foamy), so I tend to use this in the morning when I don&#x27;t have makeup on. It a nice gently texture, and it&#x27;s good for oily or acne-prone skin~!</li>
    <li> The scrub did a decent job, but the smell wasn&#x27;t that great. I probably would not purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Pretty good scrub. It&#x27;s a little rough if you have sensitive skin, but mixing it with water makes it gentle enough.</li>
    <li> Scrub is of good quality. However, be aware that this product texture is more along the lines of a cream. I personally prefer the gel scrubs.</li>
    <li> After using it I feel my face clean.</li>
    <li> Have not used it as of yet but the sample I had was good.</li>
    <li> Not a bad face wash/scrub.  The smell is not bad either, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell actually.  The scrub beads themselves are small and between them is a gel-like substance.  If you have sensitive skin or regular skin, it probably would be best to use a couple of times per week, not every day.  The price is affordable, and a small amount goes a long way.  This is a smaller size to try, there is a larger size as well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my combination skin. Smells terrible.</li>
    <li> This product is minty and leaves your face cleaned, I like the beads in the product that help exfoliate. The product was fairly good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash that feels like it actually helps to clear up my skin. I&#x27;ve tried the charcoa cleanser, as well as the Cetaphil Facial Cleanser, and they both did more damage than good. I&#x27;ve recommended this, and will continue to.</li>
    <li> I had had clogged pores and acne for quite awhile. Like, 17 years. At the age of 28, it seems to have gotten worse. I&#x27;d been using something by Neutrogena, but I began to suspect it wasn&#x27;t helping. There was a good deal on this Biore scrub at Target*, so I tried it out last night. My face was considerably better this morning! My existing blemishes had shrunk, and my pores seemed to be less dark. Usually, in the morning, I can see small white spots where the clogs have poked out of my pores. This morning was the first time in about ten years that I didn&#x27;t have that experience. The really amazing thing, though, was that my face wasn&#x27;t dry and uncomfortable - the usual marker of a facial product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Amazon&#x27;s price still beats the pants off the deal I got at Target. Buy it here instead!</li>
    <li> This Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub does exactly as its description says. It clears the dirt in your pores, and makes your pores appear smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every other day according to the directions on the container, to a great result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of facial &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; but this one I can get along with. It has a nice pleasantly clean scent, and doesn&#x27;t overpower your nose and sinuses like other acne scrubs. I&#x27;ve noticed a great amount of difference in my skin, my pores are definitely starting to breathe again! But you must use this product daily, specifically if you&#x27;re using it to help clear acne. Also, remember to drink TONS of water every day! I cannot stress this enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this scrub is fantastic for face, neck, shoulders, hell... behind the ears, arms, wherever you get acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I withheld one star because I had heard raves about this scrub, and I&#x27;ve got terribly oily skin. I was under the impression it would keep my skin oil-free throughout the day. While it certainly cuts down on the oil I naturally get vs. regular bar soaps used on my face, the oil is still noticable. Perhaps that&#x27;s my fault? Who knows. But this is definitely no cure-all for oily skin as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it&#x27;s a wonderful scrub and does get your pores nice and clean and does not strip your skin like Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> its ok, but not that much better than other products</li>
    <li> This stuff does work on my sensitive skin. I like how soft it leaves it not bad for the price. I bought this and a couple other biore products for the first time. Im pretty happy. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product contains little beads that are killing the ocean&#x27;s fish.  I discarded it immediately.</li>
    <li> Wow I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this face wash. Yes it&#x27;s gentle enough for everyday use; yes it takes off makeup. With any exfoliator though, I follow with a really really good moisturizer. All of my breakouts virtually disappeared.</li>
    <li> It is a fairly thick paste-like product with grit.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Nothing special, works ok.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Yes I have used EpiDuo, Proactive, Murad, Clean7Clear, L&#x27;Oreal.. you name it...but this cheap Biore product actually gave me unbelievably- amazing results in just 4 days.I have very oily skin, and I have been fighting acne since I was teenager. I made my appt.to see dermatologist on Monday-but now I am not sure if I should even go! I have run out of Murad wash-and I just stopped in a store to get anything to keep me going for a 5-6 days. Grabbed Biore- and gosh was I surprised. MOst of my acne disappeared, some got smaller, blackheads almost gone-and all that in just 4 days. I am so excited and I cannot wait to see how will this product work in a longer term! Acne free face-PLEASEEE!</li>
    <li> This product is used by me (70 years old), my daughter (50) and her two daughters (13.)  It works well on all our various skin types which range from my dry-and-fragile to a granddaughter&#x27;s young-and-oily.  It has a nice, fresh, light menthol scent.  We all like the texture -- not gritty and coarse, because the tiny, round beads make it surprisingly smoother and creamier than most exfolients.  Sometimes this type of cleanser can feel like clay, but not this one.  It rinses easily and leaves skin fresh and clean without feeling sanded or dried out.</li>
    <li> Product works very well</li>
    <li> I took a gamble and bought this off the shelf at the local Walgreens. I typically use Proactive, but I didn&#x27;t have any and needed something temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for a product containing the same active ingredient used in Proactive: Salicylic Acne Treatment (2%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I wash my face twice per day, morning and evening. It has a creamy smooth texture with exfoliating particles that leave my skin refreshed and evens out my complexion and skin tone. Another big plus is that this product is oil-free. I have an oily t-zone so finding a decent cleanser to balance it out is a challenge. This one works. If you use this product combined with an on the spot acne treatment (also over the counter at Walgreens and other places), your skin will just glow! Just be sure the product you use has the same active ingredient as the skin cleanser, or you might end up drying out your skin or irritation might occur.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face scrub.  And I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It cleans your face real well and exfoliates nicely, without being too harsh and scratchy.  Leaves my combination skin clean and smooth, not tight or red.  I use this twice a week and am very happy with my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a scrub with salicylic acid and I think it&#x27;s a great innovation. I was worried that -- while it would exfoliate well and help reduce breakouts -- it might be too strong for my no-longer-teenage-skin. So far, that has not been a problem and there&#x27;s no incremental redness. Also, a little scrub goes a long way. I just wish there was a little less fragrance.</li>
    <li> I can always count on Biore for a great face wash. This scrub is no exception. It really does work and I feel as if the dirt in my pores have been lessened from using this. I like the way it tingles as I use it, which makes me believe it&#x27;s working fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend any Biore product, including this one, for those who want a successful face wash/scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this product when I saw the color but in spite of that it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always interested in trying a new scrub that might be better than what I buy for my 20+ yr old adult kids. They still prefer Aveeno scrub and products to keep their complexions relatively blemish free.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter was just starting to break out on her forehead so I was looking for a good scrub for her. The Neutrogena product she was using, while gentle and smelled good, did not control her acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Biore product does a much better job - she does still get minor breakouts (it isn&#x27;t a magic product) but not red and pencil eraser sized like before. She likes the quantity of the beads and does not find them too harsh on her skin. She also likes the scent of the product.  Since she is willing to use it and it controls what was quickly becoming bad acne, this product is a winner in our book</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used many of Biore&#x27;s Skin Care Products, my favorites being the peel strips and pore unclogging scrubs. Using this basic pore unclogging scrub was quite a surprise, as Biore has obviously changed it. Instead of a nice deep cleaning from the product, I now got a deep burning from too many chemicals, alcohol and acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why Biore changed the old deep cleaning scrub, as it was a wonderful soft cleaning that left your skin nice and soft, in comparison to this different one leaving it burning and irritated. At least they haven&#x27;t changed the cleaning peel strips. As for deep cleaning, I&#x27;ll use a nice refreshing clay mask that won&#x27;t burn my skin with chemicals.</li>
    <li> Since my skin is both ageing and oily, I am always delighted to find a scrub that does not irritate or excessively dry the surface. This scrub has excellent exfoliant properties, with no irritation, redness, or scaling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love the cooling tingles from the little bursting micro-beads!  Leaves you with that fresh new skin feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I get so much dead skin build up around my nose and it clogs my pores and feels so dry and rough. I used very harsh scrubs before this because I thought it was the only thing that would work. This scrub feels SO gentle while doing the same job! When I first used it I was sure it wasn&#x27;t doing anything because it didn&#x27;t feel like a typical scrub but it makes my skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> This s the best for black heads and pores, I wben use it around my neck, hands and chest I am 50 and keeps my skins glowing and refresh a must buy !!!</li>
    <li> Cursed with problem skin since pre-adolescence, I&#x27;ve definitely tried my share of products. I was pleased to try this scrub. It&#x27;s fresh-smelling and leaves your skin feeling tingly clean. Also, you only need the smallest dab - put it in the palm of your hand and add a little warm water! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I previously used lush dark angels scrub and it cleared my skin right up, well to save a few bucks I decided to try this stuff to see if it kept my pores just as clear..... Within a few days I have blackheads on my chin and cheeks. It seems to be largening my pores rather than shrinking them and my skin looks dull. Going back to my old product right away. Never buying &amp;#34;over the counter acne medication&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> Good Scrub. It works well on my sensitive and at the same time oily skin. It does not have those harsh beads that most face washes have. The beads in this one are gentle, the wash itself is creamy and it takes a bit more water to wash off. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was its smell, not too pleasant.... but it gets the job done. Bought it with a $2 off discount.</li>
    <li> It is great for daily cleanse and I notice the clear skin in the morning when I was using this product. I just recently ran out and changed to a different cleansing product and noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Im in my mid 30&#x27;s and going through this weird adult acne/ seriously dry skin phase all of a sudden. I have to be really careful about what type of cleansers I use because I don&#x27;t want to irritate my skin and make it worse. After finding the right cleanser I realized that I needed a good exfoliant to get the dry flaky skin off. I started using this only in the mornings (while I shower) and I love it! The texture is of course gritty, but it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell and most of all it&#x27;s not tingly on the skin. Don&#x27;t you just hate those tingly feeling cleansers? Ugh! It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re supposed to make your skin feel clean all for the purpose of convincing you that your skin if officially clean, haha! It has no actual benefit to it whatsoever. Ok back to this scrub! I use a dime sized amount and work it into circles all over my face. There is no residue or icky after effects. It gets the dry skin off without irritating my skin and that for me is huge!! So far I&#x27;m hooked and will repurchase this scrub once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. Its not to abrasive and it leaves your skin nice and soft. It also has a nice little fragrance but it is not over powering. I also like the new look.</li>
    <li> I routinely use products with salicylic acid and they keep my skin clear.  I did not have any breakouts while using this, so in that respect it was a success.  However, calling this a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; is misleading.  The scrub particles are few and far between.  Further, they are suspended in a lotion that has a very unpleasant feel to it.  I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s muddy, slimy, waxy, or what, but I don&#x27;t like it.  The fragrance, while not especially strong, is also unpleasant.  Another thing I noticed is a burning or stinging sensation around my lips and nose after I rinse it off. The Biore isn&#x27;t so bad I&#x27;ll throw it away, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I will go back to the Neutrogena pink scrub I was using before, which is a bit more expensive, but much more pleasant all around.</li>
    <li> The Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub is suitable for use daily as it isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin. It helps in those trouble spots on your face and reduces instances of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in the shower and have no more pimples or blackheads, after using this they all vanished. I only wish I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I order this for my wife and daughters and sometimes myself. It works awesome. Keeps our skin clean and with a tingly feeling. I recommended it. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. Cleared up my acne.</li>
    <li> Because it has fragrance in it, my skin broke out after 1 use. I don&#x27;t recommend for acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Scrubs you clean without drying out your face. Whole family uses this stuff. From the wife to teenage sons everyone loves it</li>
    <li> I have fairly typical combination skin -- some areas are oily, some are normal, a couple have a tendency to dryness. My usual facial cleansing routine is a foaming cleanser like [[ASIN:B00006FRW9 Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ounce]] in the winter and a scrubbing cleanser like [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]] in the summer, with a light facial moisturizer like [[ASIN:B005TI7L7I Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] year-round, and that keeps my complexion pretty clear as long as I use [[ASIN:B006RFZ66K Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, 24 Count]] a couple times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time trying a cream-based scrub. I thought it would be gentler than my usual apricot scrub, so that I would need less moisturizer in the summer, and it does in fact moisturize my skin in a way my usual scrub doesn&#x27;t. However, it completely fails as a scrub! It takes forever to rinse the cream off my face because it&#x27;s so heavy and waxy, and two days after I started using it the hollows under my cheekbones broke out like they haven&#x27;t in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this&#x27;ll teach me to mess with a system that was already working. . .</li>
    <li> I found biore pore unclogging scrub effective but I couldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis. Products like this have various amounts and sizes of scrubbing beads and this product&#x27;s combination of size and quantity are too harsh for regular use with my skin. I find it more effective to use a daily product that prevents clogged pores from forming. I suppose I could use Biore Pore Unclogging for the inevitable clogged pore but just a little too harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> These scrubs are great.  There&#x27;s little beads in there to give you some traction and the very mild (2%) salicylic acid content gives it some power without making it like the full on 10% treatments that can quickly dry out your skin.  The scent is mild and pleasant and it delivers a nice cool sensation to the skin (probably from the menthol).  I see a lot of negative reviews for this stuff and I confess I don&#x27;t have a lot of basis for comparison since I rarely use scrubs but I do have oily skin and I thought this product did a good job.  I love the fresh and clean feeling it leaves.</li>
    <li> The scrub feels like I&#x27;m rubbing tiny slimy balls all over my face. I don&#x27;t feel a difference after I use this.</li>
    <li> I have used foam cleansers in the past, and my face still feels dirty afterwards. I would recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I think the beads would irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I found this to be one of the few scrubs that did not irritate my skin. This product feels smooth and smells good. I definitely notices that my skin became softer and my pores are not full of ....whatever it is they were full of. As result of daily use, my pores shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teens have fewer acne breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning because I use Retinol cream in the evening .</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; pricing.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product fo acne and beaty...the skin looks like more younger...I use it since I was 20, now I&#x27;m 26.</li>
    <li> My skin is actually pretty clear except for a tendency to develop whiteheads (or blackheads on rare occasions) on my nose. In the past, I have used Biore strips to remove them about once a month, but the strips tend to tear a bit at my skin (sometimes breaking fine blood vessels or leaving some read patches) and I can only use them irregularly. I wanted to try this as a way of dealing with this problem with more regularity and less potential damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I tried this on my entire face, but I found it left some red patches on one of my cheeks. The little blue beads that act as gentle \\&quot;pumice\\&quot; for exfoliating are a bit too much for skin in some areas, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too harsh for my nose. After the first two days, I just focused using it on my nose and thoroughly (though not excessively) rubbed it in. The first day, I didn&#x27;t see much change, by, by the fourth day, I could notice a difference in my pores. It is, slowly, starting to unclog them and clear out the whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed, however, is that just after scrubbing, the skin can actually look worse, but it looks better the morning after using the scrub (I shower at night). I think the alcohol in it causes mild swelling that can make the pores look worse in the short term. That being said, it&#x27;s supposed to help dry out the oiliness and help clean skin more thoroughly of sebum (the build-up of which causes the whiteheads). It also produces a pleasant and mild tingle on your skin after using this scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that each person has different skin with varying properties. I can talk about how this product interacted with my skin, but that&#x27;s no guarantee that others will have the same experience. I think that regular use will likely result in cleaner skin, but each person&#x27;s mileage may vary. This might be too weak or too strong depending on your skin&#x27;s properties.</li>
    <li> Not very pore-unclogging, but super acne treatment. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser! Although cheap, it works better than the more expensive brands I have purchased throughout the years. Since it has Salicylic Acid, I avoid using it directly under my eyes. I love the cool tingly feeling as well as the effective yet gentle microbeads! A definite win!</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Susan C.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people who have oily skin. I have bought so many products for my hubby&#x27;s oily skin, and this one works. Leaves the skin dry, Now If I can only get him to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans very well. Did not irritate the skin. Price was reasonable  it was cheaper her than at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and really feel a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> A great scrub ok. I love this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t blown away with this face wash.  I&#x27;ve used Biore in the past with decent results, but the reason I gave it only 3 stars is because of the long term experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash certainly delivers on its promise to be pore unclogging.  The little gel balls inside the face wash are invigorating, cleansing the skin, and effectively washing away dead skin cells with its scrubbing power.  The good thing about the face wash is that the scrubbing power is not too intense (some face washes feel like you are scrubbing your face away).  This product doesn&#x27;t do that, instead it leaves you feeling fresh and revived.  It has just about the right amount of scrub power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this only a 3 was because of the long term effects.  I used the product for several weeks and at the beginning of my experience my skin was primarily clear, but after a few weeks my skin seemed to revert and the product was less effective.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is because of outside influences or the face wash.  But in hindsight I would use this product a couple times a week in order to exfoliate your skin and follow up with a gentle cleanser in the interim.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a result of a miserable sunburn and peeling process I recently endured. I had hopes using this product would help the peeling and flakey skin to sluff off sooner.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing to help the peeling.  I&#x27;ve continued using it on my face and do feel it cleans well and unclogs pores that I could be unaware of but it doesn&#x27;t do much more.  There is no fragrance or sense of cleanliness when I&#x27;m finished with the product.  It works well but like other items of this nature, nothing extraordinary.</li>
    <li> Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub with 2% salicylic acid is a fantastic product.  Although I don&#x27;t have acne, I have very fine facial pores and they tend to become easily clogged, especially since I spend so much time out-of-doors in a dusty rural setting.  For years I used various facial cleansers for oily skin, but none of them seemed to be very effective because I kept having problems with oily patches on my nose and forehead.  Next I started using an apricot scrub, but the product turned out to be way too harsh and sometimes left some raw patches; the idea was to exfoliate my skin, not perform a do-it-yourself dermabrasion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Biore scrub two weeks ago, and the results have really been incredible.  My skin feels clean after I use the product; it&#x27;s tingly, as though I&#x27;ve also used an astringent, but it doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry.  Best of all, my pores have remained unclogged, and the product hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all.  My sister noticed the difference within a week&#x27;s time, and a couple of days ago, the teller at the bank complimented me on my \\&quot;shining face\\&quot; and my \\&quot;nice skin.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I bought it. Very good for me</li>
    <li> My daughter having used this for 2 weeks was totally unimpressed. Did not differentiate from other scrub solutions she has used - neither better nor worse. Okay for Vine but would not buy.</li>
    <li> The product was good, but not great. There are a ton of other similar products on the market similar to this that may be a bit better. As a scrub, I didn&#x27;t feel as much of the grains, but it did lather easy w/o wasting much of the cream. So a little goes a long way. Did I notice any difference in the product? Only a small bit. If you have achne problems, I don&#x27;t hink it will help with that, and it does dry out your skin to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but with so many other similar products on the market, it&#x27;s not that remarkable.</li>
    <li> I had been using Skinceuticals anti blemish product to control my black/white heads and \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on my face. While the product worked great, it was leaving my skin dry and it was too pricey.&lt;br /&gt;As per my dermatologists&#x27; recommendation I decided to try a scrub instead. I have been using this for 3 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the leave-on product did. And Biore costs one tenth of the price I paid the other product.&lt;br /&gt;I like that&lt;br /&gt;1. The beads are not too abrasive, yet effectively exfoliates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. I get a smooth feeling after wash.&lt;br /&gt;3. The fragrance is mild.&lt;br /&gt;4. It is gentle enough to be used everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild eczema and sun sensitivity. If I don&#x27;t use sun screen when I use the product my skin gets more sensitive. I guess minimum sun exposure and sun screen is a must with any product with salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update after couple of months of use.</li>
    <li> Biore products make my face feel awesome!</li>
    <li> This facial scrub is really nothing special.  It may be marginally effective, but it is hard to tell.  It is very creamy and does not have much in the way of scrub beads.  If you really want a good scrub, you might want to try something else.</li>
    <li> I think skin products are hard to evaluate for Vine because everyone&#x27;s skin has different issues (or none, for you lucky ones) and reacts differently to the ingredients in skin care products. For me, this seemed pretty mild and not aggressively abrasive (this could be good or bad, depending on your preference; for me, it was fine). It didn&#x27;t perform miracles re: unclogging pores, but my skin did feel pleasantly smooth afterwards (if this was due to wax, as another review claims, I don&#x27;t know, but it felt fine and looked fine). FYI, for those for whom fragrance is an issue, it does have a smell that&#x27;s a bit like rose or lilac, it&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it&#x27;s not unscented. If none of this is a deal breaker, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably worth trying, imo at the discounted price.</li>
    <li> The hard scrub detox the unnecessary clogs that live deep down under my skin, my skin can finally breath.</li>
    <li> the wife and daughter loves this stuff.  it cleans their skin squeeky clean.  they say it gets the dirt and makeup out of the pores and your skin just feels cleaner.  so girls if you trile on the makeup this product is for you.  it cleans all that makeup off so you can reapply it the next day with a new layer.</li>
    <li> I have a blackhead issue. I am working hard to combat it and I feel that this works, but not quite as well as I like.  It is a mild exfoliator (sparse scrubbing blue balls. Gentle isn&#x27;t always bad, but it is too weak for me so if you also have a real issue with your pores this may not be best for you. Additionally, it just feels kind of greasy going on and feels a bit filmy when i wash it off. Usually I love Biore products but this one was just not right for my skin. I would recommend for sensitive skin with mild pore issues and no aversion to cream cleansers. It should be noted that while I don&#x27;t think it worked well for me it did not cause irritation or break outs which was great.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was about 20, I have used nothing but bar soap on my face.  I&#x27;m a rather \\&quot;low maintenance\\&quot; woman with regards to my skin.  I don&#x27;t have many blemishes, I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen (even though I know I should), and I&#x27;m not concerned about preventing wrinkles.  I thought my bar soap was working well and had no plans to add any other product until I happened notice some blackheads on my nose.  I found this product just after that and decided to try it.  All I can say is WOW!  I saw such a difference in my skin with my first use!  My face feels really rejuvenated each time I use it and I can feel the scrub working while it is on.  I use it several times per week and it is gentle enough that it has not irritated my skin at all.  I even noticed a big difference in the blackhead problem I had - after the first time I used it.  The only thing I do not like about this product is the smell.  It smells bad to me, but not bad enough to knock a star off.  I plan to continue using this 5-star scrub going forward.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this is my absolute favorite face wash. i have problem skin so i have searched high and low (high end brands included) for something that would work for me and i have finally found it in this, and have been using it daily for months since. feels great on the skin as your using it and actually helps stop my breakouts like nothing else i have tried, granted my breakouts are not 100% gone but this is the best that  have found for my sensitive skin. my sister also uses it and she doesnt deal with breakouts and it works great for her as well. highly reccomended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: this is still my everyday facewash and the only thing that works. One day I decided to make sure I was using the best stuff I could be for my acne and did some research on the top recommended acne cleansers and to my surprise this was actually one of their top picks. Link: (http://www.acne.org/biore-pore-unclogging-scrub-reviews-266/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone dealing with annoying acne. I&#x27;d always dealt with the constant small bumps under my skin specially around my chin and then the daily breakout. This and recently along with this treatment by Roshe Posay (http://smile.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Effaclar-Action-Treatment-Fluid/dp/B004L8J15C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424961739&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;roshe+posay+acne) and the Aztec healing clay mask (http://smile.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Cleansing/dp/B0014P8L9W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424962249&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;aztec+clay+mask) have kept my skin clearer than it&#x27;s been my entire life. My mom suffers with acne as well (at her 50 years of age - yes) and she&#x27;s been using these three things and her skin has cleared up as well. Try this!</li>
    <li> I have severely clogged pores on my forehead and my nose.  I knew from my mother and sister that Biore is the best option for pore-care.  So far the scrub has seemingly helped; several pimples are coming to a head (which is a good sign). There&#x27;s not a lot of improvement but I&#x27;m very hopeful that Biore will live up to its name.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job of clearing our pore.  I still recommend getting in there and pushing out the little buggers.</li>
    <li> perfect face solutions</li>
    <li> Most amazing face wash ever. Purchased so many! Definitely recommend this for blemishes, blackheads or anyone with sensitive skin. Also smells amazing</li>
    <li> This was a great product. I was amazed at:&lt;br /&gt;how little went such a long way-you really only need a nickle or even dime-sized amount of it. I was used to using a whole handful of St. Ives Apricot scrub and ended up exfoliating neck, face, chest, shoulders and arms!&lt;br /&gt;the exfoliating feel without it being like sandpaper&lt;br /&gt;the creaminess of the cream and how well it holds up to water in the shower. It is sort of the consistency of cold cream once you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;the heating sensation when you left it on for a while&lt;br /&gt;how clean and soft and acne free my skin was after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks-this is a 2% Salicylic Acid treatment so it might be harsh for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell-not the greatest, but not too medicinal either.&lt;br /&gt;The full price-$10 is not outrageous for a product like this but it could price it out of the teen market, who would definitely!! benefit from a great product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing well-because it is the consistency of cold cream once you have applied it, it takes a fair amount of time to wash it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, with the provisos listed above.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product free through the Amazon Vine program.  I would certainly buy this product if I had a coupon/it was on sale/discounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 8/30/13&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product EVERY day and STILL have the same tube! I am coming to the end of it now, but consider that to be excellent value because a little really does go a long, long way.  I actually look forward to washing my face in the morning because my skin feels wonderful afterwards. I am not a great fan of acne products due to the smell and harshness of many. This is by far one of the best ones I have ever used, and will keep on using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good scrub for a slightly oily complexion, helps to keep pimples down, and moisturizes just the right amount. Biore always makes quality products, and this one is no exception.</li>
