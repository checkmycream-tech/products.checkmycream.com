### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best mask I have ever used.</li>
      <li>dry&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything lol</li>
      <li>but the results are great.   </li>
      <li>If it makes me breakout tomorrow I&#x27;m gonna move it to one star lol.</li>
      <li>The rest of my skin feels great but that pimple is driving me</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great on my skin.</li>
      <li>but it is a good mask.  </li>
      <li>this can be good for my skin.</li>
      <li>good product</li>
      <li>That does amazing things for the cystic acne</li>
      <li>My skin feels great for the first time in years!</li>
      <li>It gets nice and warm when you first rub it on and feels truing amazing.</li>
      <li>The cosmetic benefit is that lines are reduced, skin is more supple, makeup glides on, and your skin will glow like you are 18 again.</li>
      <li>It felt like a layer of the mask was still on my skin after rinsing, but I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for that type of thing you&#x27;d love this.  </li>
      <li>So my problems with this product are many.  </li>
      <li>The immediate warmth you feel upon this mask touching your skin is just the beginning.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it a lot.  </li>
      <li>I love this face mask.  </li>
      <li>Too many cons for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will temporarily change the texture of your skin to have a more creamy, buttery-smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Squeezing it out of the tube is challenging</li>
      <li>I love the feeling of my face after I use this.</li>
      <li>I love that when i wash it off it leaves my skin moisturized and smooth</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t go on easy</li>
      <li>However if I leave it on for more than 10 mins, my cheeks get pinkish, so it might not be good for sensitive</li>
      <li>so why would it rinse off easy?</li>
      <li>I used an alcohol free toner, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide to get that film off and nothing worked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warmth is really relaxing and nice.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth, hydrated, and radiant, plus it has healed some of the redness from leftover blemishes.</li>
      <li>They do say pomegranate is filled with antioxidants.</li>
      <li>The humectants helped keep moisture in my face making it smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this one but didn&#x27;t care for it because of the residue it leaves on your face.  </li>
      <li>like I originally planned.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>If you want a clean and refreshed feeling, though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
      <li>you like the skin on your face to feel squeaky clean</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably good for your skin, but I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels when it is left on there, so I started using it as a body mask instead of a face mask.  </li>
      <li>Good product, definitely will make a repurchase.</li>
      <li>quick.</li>
      <li>Overall I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I have tried sooo many masks and never had one that produced the WOW effect that this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mask makes my face feel so fresh.</li>
      <li>I recommend putting this on before you shower so that you can get it off more easily without making a huge mess.  </li>
      <li>This mask is great for a relaxing warmth, but is very hard to clean all-the-way off your face.  </li>
      <li>I got this first as a sample from beautyarmy, and tried it.</li>
      <li>I wondered if it was supposed to have this effect, and based on the first review here</li>
      <li>I usually love using masks, especially clay ones, to refine my oily/combination skin.  </li>
      <li>It was the first time I had ever tried a clay mask, maybe it was just a shock to my face intitialy</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t in the whole 5 minutes</li>
      <li>/&gt;Leaves face really greasy</li>
      <li>this was a real treat to use.  </li>
      <li>It cleans and tightens the pores but it does leave a really oily greasy residue</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about masks.</li>
      <li>In fact, I have had 3 in my whole life, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for now, instead of 2</li>
      <li>I used a gentle cleanser, wash cloth and face brush</li>
      <li>The mask does warm but only for a second</li>
      <li>The warming quality makes it feel like it works even more than other face masks.</li>
      <li>this mask in your bag of tricks to use before a special day or big night out.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for the winter months.</li>
      <li>When you rinse the mask off, your wet skin will have a smooth parrafin-like feel and once dry will be dewy, plump, glowing, and full of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I see people saying they have a hard time working with the mask, but the instructions tell you to moisten your face before applying the mask and it seems to spread out fine with the right amount of water.</li>
      <li>As soon as you wash it off, you are left with amazingly soft, fresh skin.</li>
      <li>I tried again in the autumn when the humidity was non existent and WOW!</li>
      <li>I can not imagine trying to complete my skin care routine hoping my serums and moisturizers will absorb while there are remnants of this mask on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a old product and defected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could tell because the half I didn&#x27;t put it on, the water ran and absorbed into it normally.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am 29 and have normal skin but am starting to see some noticable signs of aging- laugh lines that don&#x27;t go away when the laughing is over and more dull, less supple</li>
      <li>First of all, the warming happens for just a sec when you apply it on the face and then goes away.</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling soft and it was glowing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The &#x27;warming&#x27; action lasted for only a few seconds but the smell nearly gagged me the whole time I had the mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The effect lasts until you wash your face and maybe even a little longer if you use a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The effect lasts until you wash your face and maybe even a little longer if you use a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My face was red, dry and irritated for an hour</li>
<li> Even after rubbing, it leaves an oily (lipid) layer on the face, which is similar to if you rub whole milk or some thick emollient on the face.</li>
<li> Admittedly, it is very thick and hard to get out of the tube, but once rubbed between wet fingers becomes nice and creamy.</li>
<li> I passed on to my mother, who is a long term clay masks user; still waiting for her insight on this.</li>
<li> /&gt;Really a strange experience.  </li>
<li> I find that moisturizing, and that is why after my sample finished, I bought it from amazon to use during the dry, winter months.</li>
<li> Like Sahara desert dry and aren&#x27;t expecting a clay mask result.</li>
<li> I had just gotten a blow dry when for some reason I thought a mask was the thing to do.</li>
<li> I used a single use packet and I would not recommend it unless you have dry skin.</li>
<li> so I did a test run on half of the back of my hand.</li>
<li> I resorted to using a towel to get the majority off and then washed and scrubbed the rest off with a wet</li>
<li> And like other people said, it leaves a residue.</li>
<li> but it calmed down</li>
<li> I have dry skin, and so I usually avoid masks which say purifying as they tend to be drying.</li>
<li> The product half?</li>
<li> and there was still a film on the half I put this stuff on.</li>
<li> Really want to like it, but the mask is very very thick and impossible to wash off completely even in the shower!</li>
<li> lastly, did not warm up at all!</li>
<li> I had it on.&lt;br /&gt;Second round of work out happen when you have to get it off.</li>
<li> Like other reviews I read this product was a bit hard to use and did leave a waxy residue on my face.</li>
<li> Again, it was very difficult to squeeze out and even more difficult to spread and distribute, I let it sit for about 7 minutes, didn&#x27;t feel any warming at all, then I went to wash it off.</li>
<li> ( I don&#x27;t usually break out).</li>
<li> I only like this product because the first time I tried it I had a horrible allergic reaction to it</li>
<li> For starters, it is really hard to spread thinly and even harder to get off.  </li>
<li> stuff is thick, hard to get out of the tube and spread it on your face.</li>
<li> and I firmly believe it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it could have been only becaue I took it off immediately.  </li>
<li> As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is a bit difficult to wash off with just water.</li>
<li> and it isn&#x27;t hard to use or offensively scented!</li>
<li> My skin does feel moisturized and glowy after using it, and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out yet</li>
<li> Beware it has ingredients that are not good for you!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a old product and defected.&lt;br /&gt;No answer from seller.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Too many cons for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything lol&lt;br /&gt;Hard to wash off&lt;br /&gt;Leaves face really greasy&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, did not warm up at all! Not even for a second. nothing. I used a single use packet and I would not recommend it unless you have dry skin. Like Sahara desert dry and aren&#x27;t expecting a clay mask result. If it makes me breakout tomorrow I&#x27;m gonna move it to one star lol.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about masks. In fact, I have had 3 in my whole life, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for now, instead of 2 like I originally planned.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is thick, hard to get out of the tube and spread it on your face. I do not know how they want you to apply a thin layer, spreading it is almost a work out in your arms! I cannot figure out how to do this evenly and I ended up leaving multiple places of my face without the mask.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m a beginner in this, so tell me: am I suppose to feel anything? I certainly didn&#x27;t in the whole 5 minutes I had it on.&lt;br /&gt;Second round of work out happen when you have to get it off. It does not come off. And like other people said, it leaves a residue. No way you can convince me this can be good for my skin. Not letting my skin breath equals to break-out next morning. In fact, I did break out the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product. However, I recommend almost everything made by BeFine. I passed on to my mother, who is a long term clay masks user; still waiting for her insight on this.</li>
    <li> quick. low price. good product</li>
    <li> I have used this mask for a year now and it&#x27;s great on my skin. Squeezing it out of the tube is challenging but the results are great.   I love that when i wash it off it leaves my skin moisturized and smooth, maybe it&#x27;s the oils in the mask, my face is radiant and rejuvenated after using this.   They do say pomegranate is filled with antioxidants.</li>
    <li> I have a variety of allergies and am prone to break outs. This product clears my skin and helps me prevent future break outs. My skin feels great for the first time in years!</li>
    <li> This mask is great for a relaxing warmth, but is very hard to clean all-the-way off your face.  For some reason there is a film that is left.  It&#x27;s probably good for your skin, but I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels when it is left on there, so I started using it as a body mask instead of a face mask.  It&#x27;s warmth is really relaxing and nice.</li>
    <li> Although I like this clay mask and have used it before, when I received it, the product was oozing out the bottom of the tube.  Ended up finding some heavy-duty tape and taping up the seam where it was coming out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask about a month ago and have been using it twice a week since then. My skin feels smooth, hydrated, and radiant, plus it has healed some of the redness from leftover blemishes. I see people saying they have a hard time working with the mask, but the instructions tell you to moisten your face before applying the mask and it seems to spread out fine with the right amount of water. Overall I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of my face after I use this. It gets nice and warm when you first rub it on and feels truing amazing. Good product, definitely will make a repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, and so I usually avoid masks which say purifying as they tend to be drying. I got this first as a sample from beautyarmy, and tried it. First of all, the warming happens for just a sec when you apply it on the face and then goes away. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is a bit difficult to wash off with just water. Even after rubbing, it leaves an oily (lipid) layer on the face, which is similar to if you rub whole milk or some thick emollient on the face. I find that moisturizing, and that is why after my sample finished, I bought it from amazon to use during the dry, winter months. I use it after washing my face, and put a face cream afterwards to lock in the oil layer. My skin does feel moisturized and glowy after using it, and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out yet( I don&#x27;t usually break out). However if I leave it on for more than 10 mins, my cheeks get pinkish, so it might not be good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would also not recommend it to people with oily skin, or to use during humid conditions.</li>
    <li> this was a real treat to use.  I enjoyed it a lot.  It left my skin feeling soft and it was glowing.</li>
    <li> The immediate warmth you feel upon this mask touching your skin is just the beginning. As soon as you wash it off, you are left with amazingly soft, fresh skin.</li>
    <li> This mask makes my face feel so fresh.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received an old tube of this product or if it just designed to be terrible. Just from the way it squeezed out of the bottle, I knew I didn&#x27;t want to put it on my face so I did a test run on half of the back of my hand. Again, it was very difficult to squeeze out and even more difficult to spread and distribute, I let it sit for about 7 minutes, didn&#x27;t feel any warming at all, then I went to wash it off. It didn&#x27;t go on easy so why would it rinse off easy? I used a gentle cleanser, wash cloth and face brush and there was still a film on the half I put this stuff on. I could tell because the half I didn&#x27;t put it on, the water ran and absorbed into it normally. The product half? The water beaded like there was a waterproof sealant on it. I used an alcohol free toner, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide to get that film off and nothing worked. I can not imagine trying to complete my skin care routine hoping my serums and moisturizers will absorb while there are remnants of this mask on my face.</li>
    <li> I only like this product because the first time I tried it I had a horrible allergic reaction to it and I am not allergic to anything.  My face was red, dry and irritated for an hour but it calmed down and I firmly believe it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it could have been only becaue I took it off immediately.  However I kept it and 6 months later I decided to give it a go again.  That time nothing happened.  It was the first time I had ever tried a clay mask, maybe it was just a shock to my face intitialy but it is a good mask.  It cleans and tightens the pores but it does leave a really oily greasy residue so I recomend using it at night.</li>
    <li> The mask does warm but only for a second and it leaves my face feeling oily. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this face mask.  I see instant results and my face feels so refreshed after I put it on.  The warming quality makes it feel like it works even more than other face masks.</li>
    <li> Really want to like it, but the mask is very very thick and impossible to wash off completely even in the shower!</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. I got one for each of my daughters and daughter-in-laws for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I usually love using masks, especially clay ones, to refine my oily/combination skin.  I was excited to try this one but didn&#x27;t care for it because of the residue it leaves on your face.  I left it on for the instructed five minutes and when I went to rinse it off, I found that it left my skin feeling sticky and unclean.  I wondered if it was supposed to have this effect, and based on the first review here I guess it does.  It felt like a layer of the mask was still on my skin after rinsing, but I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for that type of thing you&#x27;d love this.  If you want a clean and refreshed feeling, though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to spread on skin, but leaves skin feeling supple and moisturized after!</li>
    <li> So my problems with this product are many.  For starters, it is really hard to spread thinly and even harder to get off.  I recommend putting this on before you shower so that you can get it off more easily without making a huge mess.  I had just gotten a blow dry when for some reason I thought a mask was the thing to do. I resorted to using a towel to get the majority off and then washed and scrubbed the rest off with a wet cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately had a pimple after removing the mask. My friend had the same result!  The rest of my skin feels great but that pimple is driving me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;warming&#x27; action lasted for only a few seconds but the smell nearly gagged me the whole time I had the mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a strange experience.  If I were you, I&#x27;d stick to the coconut pore refinement treatment.  That does amazing things for the cystic acne I get when my hormones are acting out and it isn&#x27;t hard to use or offensively scented!</li>
    <li> I have tried sooo many masks and never had one that produced the WOW effect that this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 29 and have normal skin but am starting to see some noticable signs of aging- laugh lines that don&#x27;t go away when the laughing is over and more dull, less supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this mask once, I knew I had found a keeper. Admittedly, it is very thick and hard to get out of the tube, but once rubbed between wet fingers becomes nice and creamy. It does have a momentary warming effect, but I don&#x27;t think this actually provides any practical benefits. When you rinse the mask off, your wet skin will have a smooth parrafin-like feel and once dry will be dewy, plump, glowing, and full of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the skin on your face to feel squeaky clean, this is not the product for you.  It will temporarily change the texture of your skin to have a more creamy, buttery-smooth finish. The cosmetic benefit is that lines are reduced, skin is more supple, makeup glides on, and your skin will glow like you are 18 again. The effect lasts until you wash your face and maybe even a little longer if you use a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep this mask in your bag of tricks to use before a special day or big night out.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews I read this product was a bit hard to use and did leave a waxy residue on my face. I tried again in the autumn when the humidity was non existent and WOW! The humectants helped keep moisture in my face making it smooth and glowing. Highly recommend for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Beware it has ingredients that are not good for you!  Check the cosmetic safety database and punch in the ingredients. Made my face itch.</li>
