<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Karmick Hot/Cold Lavender Eye Pillow is used to relieve stress and sleep better at night. It can be used hot or cold and can be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a cold pack, I just put it in a plastic ziplock bag, toss it in the freezer and leave it there for about 2 hours. It has a cooling effect without the painful feeling of an ice sting. It works to relieve headaches, aches and pain. I don&#x27;t suffer from migraines so I can&#x27;t tell if it helps against migraines but it&#x27;s one of the uses for the cold pack as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold pack also helps against puffy eyes and the scent of the lavender helped me relax and on the days when I had trouble sleeping, help me fall asleep easier. The cold pack also helped me relieve the tension in my eyes. Since I write reviews and spend some time in the computer, my eyes get tired but when I use the Karmick as a cold pack, it soothes my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot pack is used for sinus pain, dry eyes and allergies. My 3 year old daughter currently has a sinus infection and is taking medicine for that. Her nose is a bit congested before going to sleep and I tried the Karmick as a hot pack for her and she says it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hot pack, using a spray bottle, I misted the eye pillow with water, put it on a microwave safe plate and microwaved it for 30 seconds. It&#x27;s not advisable to overheat the eye pillow. The warmth will last approximately 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is too big for the eyes and slippery.  I&#x27;ll be 100% satisfied if a cover is included.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! Smells wonderful and chills up nicely for headaches. Where it every night to sleep. Great Customer Service as well!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the sleep better mask. The lavender scent is very slight. The pack only stays cold for a very short period of time, maybe 5 minutes. I keep my house at 67 degrees so that isn&#x27;t the cause. I put the mask in the freezer last night and took it out first thing this morning and it only stayed cold, maybe 5 minutes top. I use it on my eyes. I did notice yesterday when I put it between my chair and my neck it stayed chilled, not cold, a little longer. Sorry to give a poor review, because in concept this is a good idea. Maybe if the designer had used a jell substance or clay, it would of worked better. I haven&#x27;t tried it hot, and can&#x27;t see where I ever will, so that may work better.</li>
    <li> This looks good, i never used it because its WAY to small.. won&#x27;t even extend to my temples.. i was going to use it for my migraine i get. It came in a package that all i had to do was pull the side to take it out.... ANYONE could have stole it super easily. so maybe better packing would be nice. I&#x27;m returning, but its only about 8 inch long.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something similar to the eye mask I already have to deal with a chronic migraine problem. I found this product and ordered it. My older one has flax seed inside just like this one and works great. I had occasion to try this one now and it is terrific. I have hesitated traveling with my older one lest it get damaged or lost. I now have one I can take along if I will be away from home. I have not used the cold application yet, but the heating effect is great and relieves the migraines I get that start behind my eyes...it is well made, the fabric is constructed very well...and it arrived on time! Definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> Feels great but the aroma is very strong</li>
    <li> I have been using this only as a cold mask for over a month. I can say ,coldness wont stay for more than 10-15 mins and also I didn&#x27;t feel as relaxed as I expected. 20 $ is more for this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome eye mask. Great gift idea. Smells lovely and spa-like! Works well. Nice size and comfortable! Great gift for any woman (or guy)who loves the relaxing lavender spa feel.</li>
    <li> It would be better for a 1/2 inch elastic strap to better hold the heavenly herbal scents mask in place.  The essence of the herbs is lovely and immediately relaxing.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe dry eyes. This is exactly what I needed. My oil glands tend to clog up and this helps them not be as dry. Also I loved the Amazon Prime same day delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of the this so light and refreshing. Perfect for that migraine or sleepless night. I put mine in the freezer for about 30 minutes and it comes out cold enough for me and really soothes that stress away. Put it in the microwave for about 45 seconds and it makes it so easy to fall asleep without the help of a sleep aid. Long lasting and durable.</li>
    <li> Item arrived VERY quickly! Love the packaging/box which makes it a great gift. Smell is amazing and not overwhelming. Fabric is soft and quality is very good! Worth the money. Love that it&#x27;s made in USA.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use both warm and cold.  Everyday and/or night.  This is my new best friend.  Often spritz with lavendar essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Filled with flax seed and we all know the health value of flax... because of the composition of flax the seed warms nicely and retains its heat... also chills well.  Great for relaxation, tantric  breathing,etc.  Also freshens the eye area, gives a rested appearance, removes puffiness. When heated it works well for sinus/nasal congestion...  great idea and good marketing.  Buy two, have a backup ready... :-)  ... or for a friend</li>
    <li> Although the smell is lovely and it does feel good when it stays in place, it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well. Bought it for long plane trips and it doesn&#x27;t stay on unless you&#x27;re lying flat on your back.</li>
    <li> Nice mask! My favorite is to use it cold. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> I have Crohns and recently began another flare up of it.  With every new flare up comes new &#x27;problems&#x27;.  This time it&#x27;s what seems to be Blepharitis (eyelid skin is itchy and inflamed) so I bought this, along with The OCuSOFT Lid Scrub ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PY15I2/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) and after one use of the lid scrub and applying the mask after being heated in the microwave, I see a noticeable difference and my eye skin feels so much better.  I love the lavender scent of this as well.  Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I just bought this to relieve headaches, migraines and to help with trouble sleeping. The pillow has a very nice natural lavender scent and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong or artificial. I placed the pillow in the freezer (inside a plastic zip lock bag) for a few hours and used it before bed. When I woke up the bags under my eyes were dramatically reduced on the first night I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product as a great alternative to tea bags, ice masks etc.</li>
    <li> comfort my eyes a lot!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;pillow&amp;#34; design is a nice concept, as it conforms nicely to the face. Really like the soothing scent, too. Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the cold as long as other Cold Masks we&#x27;ve tried. However, it is very refreshing to lie down with this pillow on your face.</li>
    <li> Lovely lavender scent and is wonderful chilled and used on back of neck or eyes.  Great for postoperative facial surgery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this after 8 hours work. Me &amp; my eyes love it. Good product!</li>
    <li> Totally a must have for those who suffers from migraine headaches. It really does work. My husband had a headache and I have it to him. Now he sees why I use it every time I get a migraine. I prefer to place it in the freezer for hrs and use it. You can also place in the microwave, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
    <li> I put this in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge.  Used it for the first time tonight after a long, icky day.  Very refreshing and smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already buying another eye mask before i kill this one.  I&#x27;m heating it based on the recommendation of :30 but I use while soaking in the bathtub so I might want a back-up.  This mask has made me so happy.  Reminds me of one I found in Sonoma at a spa 20 years ago but never could find again.  Love the satin pillow case, strong lavender scent and size.</li>
    <li> I recently read some articles about the benefits of using an eye mask so I started checking online to see what I could find. I found a Karmick hot/cold eye mask that was actually filled with organic lavender flax seed. Lavender is an herb that has been used for over 2000 years. With the popularity of natural ingredient use lavender is in greater demand and has widely been acclaimed for its healing properties. There appears to be enough research to show that it is extremely useful in promoting stress relief and relaxation so I was pleased to see that this eye mask was filled with lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could afford a trip to a day spa but unfortunately that is not an option for me so I have to find ways to get some much needed relaxation at home. The eye mask just might offer some of the same benefits that I could find at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used with heat or cold allowing relief from headaches, fatigue, puffy eyes, insomnia, dark circles and just a time of much needed relaxation with a few minutes of self pampering from stressful days and nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say that it can even be microwaved for 30 seconds to help relieve sinus pressure. A lot of information has been written today about the benefits of aromatherapy and I can just imagine how great the smell would be after being microwaved for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is its ability to completely block out light. If you suffer from insomnia and migraines this could really help. The mask is soft and pliable when frozen unlike many ice packs so it can easily be fitted over your face or on the back of your neck like a cold compress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to roll from side to side so I do wish it had a strap to tie that could hold it into place but I understand some people could find that restraining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from my crew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> Works great chilled or warmed!! Love the lavender scent!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item. Here&#x27;s my initial thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cold method - feels refreshing and have seen a noticeable difference after using. The smell is a bit strong but has helped with my sinuses in the morning.  After having in freezer all night, the mask is not beyond cold to where u can&#x27;t put it on immediately from fridge to your face which is is plus, no wait time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part I don&#x27;t like is that u have to lay virtually still to prevent the mask from moving. It&#x27;s s silky material that slides with any body movement. Any body movements also cause for u to realign the mask. It&#x27;s made to contour to your face which is great but you can&#x27;t move. You have to lay still or you have to readjust he mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the hot method but will do so in the near future.</li>
    <li> It feels great on your eyes, but the scent is overwhelming initially. I had to let it sit out for almost two months before I could use it because the scent was so strong.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an Eye Mask that blocks out light completely and helps with migraine. I can be very sensitive to light when I get migraine and this mask keeps out the light and the soothing smell relaxes my nerves. I have used it cold for the pain and works wonders. Keeps cold for a good 45 mins which is more than enough for me. I go right to it when I know I am tensed and need some &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34; time.</li>
    <li> I put the mask in freezer and used it as a cold pack. As soon as I put it on, it was as if I was in a spa. The mask completely blocked the light. The filling of flax seeds was great, not too heavy or light on my eyes, they stayed in place without moving side to side and were hugging my eyes all around, soothing them. Add to it the refreshing fragrance. I usually wrap my ice packs as I feel an ice burn, but not with this one. It was so soothing and relaxing that I did not want to take it off ! It makes a nice gift as the packaging was beautiful!</li>
    <li> WOW! I have never written a review, and did not believe the reviews previously posted. I purchased this because of the description and it is the best! 2 nights so far and my 5 year old LOVES it. Ohh the smell is wonderful. The texture is awesome in her hands. Then back to the head. Mist it, microwave for 30 sec in a bowl, flip it over for 15 sec, remove and enjoy!</li>
    <li> The hot use of it works well, and I like the scent of it after it gets heated. But I have to say the cold use doesn&#x27;t work long enough.</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of using the eye mask hot and cold.  I put it in a freezer for the night  and use it in the morning, which makes the eye puffiness go away.  If you want to relax or take a little nap, the warm eye mask filled with lavender scent is very soothing, and makes you feel like you are in a spa.  My kids use the eye mask pillow as an ice pack;  it is soft and comforting for their skin. Great present for a mom or a friend!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Does not get that cold at all.  Wish I had returned this.  Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I actually tried this mask out before I recommend it.  I love the mask. Works great hot or cold. It is very relaxing and soothing. It makes a great gift. I highly recommend for a stress reliever.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Chilled from the freezer, it&#x27;s not too cold to use immediately.  The silky covering does not leave lines on my face.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that it could use a detachable strap to keep it from sliding off when you turn your head</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; I am a nurse, mom of three and own a business. Life gets busy and stressful for me. I barely have time to do anything for myself until my husband gifted me this mask. I leave it in the freezer all day and use it on my eyes at the end of my day. It has been so relaxing and really melts down my stress. Very rejuvenating and highly recommend it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Received it quickly.  I have used it once, and it does a great job of keeping out light (completely dark) and stays cooler than the neck ice pack/bean bag I had bought from Kohl&#x27;s.  I bought this for migraines, as I get terrible migraines with sensitivity to light.  I haven&#x27;t had an awful migraine yet to see how helpful it is--but it smells wonderful and I think it will be helpful from using it for my mild migraine the other day.</li>
    <li> I had been having insomnia for 2 weeks and is getting increasingly frustrated. The moment I received this, pop this on my eyes, love the weight. Told myself I&#x27;m just trying this for a little while, don&#x27;t fall asleep, next moment.. I am just nodding off. I&#x27;m going to see if this is going to extend my length of sleep tonight. Compliment the use of this with some nice soothing music. I hope the lavender smell can last a long time.</li>
    <li> Who doesn’t love lavender? I’m pretty much obsessed with it in every way possible, it’s calming, and makes me think of relaxation or sleep! I also equally love eye masks to help me get to sleep on restless nights! They help me achieve that complete darkness I love that sometimes I can’t get without a nice mask covering my face! The Karmick lavender eye mask is safe for everyone in the family and can be used hot or cold. I personally prefer it to be cold but my hubby said he likes it hot. I am prone to migraines so the cold is awesome for me! You can use it in the microwave with no issues and I just plop it in the freezer when I want it cold. We have used it a few times between all of us and we all have had a great experience with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask makes you feel like your at your own little spa… located…wherever you want to kick back and put the mask on! I simply adore lavender I really honestly do and the scent given off of this isn’t a fake smell it’s real lavender that calms you and smells just amazing! All these beautiful and awesome smelling masks are made from all natural, organic materials and they are all backed by a LIFETIME guarantee with replacement &amp;#60;3 I love life time guarantees makes me feel like the company really knows their product and has faith in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Very nice. very relaxing</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! It smells fantastic and came in a very timely manner! I use it before bed, &amp; I feel like I am sleeping better!</li>
    <li> Lavender is one of my favorite scents and this product has that divine smell.  Unlike other eye pillows, the scent of this pillow is not overpowering, just right to provide a very calming experience.  I also love the silky and luxurious feel of this product.  I followed the instructions and left it in the freezer for a few hours and had a relaxing 15 min spa experience. What&#x27;s more, the skin around my eyes felt really soft!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a family thing, but I have tons of problems sleeping. I also deal with anxiety when I get sick. I asked this company if I could review this product because I actually will use this product for my own use. They sent it to me for free and these are my opinions. I also get migraines and sinus headaches that ruin my day. I am sick today, so this was the perfect time to try this eye mask. You just mist water on the mask and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then I put it across my eyes and relax for ten minutes. The smell is pleasant and the mask relaxes me. I also go on road trips for my job and deal with a little bit of anxiety in the hotel rooms. I can&#x27;t explain it, but I will bring this mask with me to help me sleep. This mask also helps with sinus infections. I will be using it when I get those too, which is 3 to 5 times a year. This may be the favorite item I have reviewed so far, because I can really use it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before, but mine was smaller. This one is nicer. My daughter gets migraine headaches and I know from experience that this is going to help her. Love it.</li>
    <li> Received my package right on time and love it! It smells wonderful and the fabric is so soft and comforting.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I suffer from very bad sinus headaches - in fact they are so bad I tell people that it feels like a migraine behind my eyes.  24/7, the only thing that helps is Ibuprofen for me.  I never get relief otherwise.  I have a lot of stress in my life, and when this promotion came up I applied to see if it could give me some relief from my sinus problems.  It has gotten so bad that I have even tried the peppermint oil on my face and temples and even that didn&#x27;t work.  The Karmick mask has lavender in it, and lavender is well known to be a great stress-reliever.  It is microwave and freezer safe and the nice part is it works both hot and cold.  I used the microwave to heat it up for my sinus pressure and then just laid it over my face.  I did actually notice some relief.  Not completely gone, but it definitely did help relieve some of the pain.  Enough that I try to use it as much as possible!  I don&#x27;t get much chance to lay down with a 7 year old running around though.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t sleep on my back so I can&#x27;t really use it while I sleep which is when my pressure gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also freeze this and use it for aches, pains and puffy eyes.  I can see how this would be amazing for people with migraines, it can really help ease the pain and because I have known people who get terrible migraines, I can say that ANY relief for them would be welcome.  This is a well-made mask, nice and silky soft on the skin and not real heavy so that it presses down too much.  With a lifetime guarantee and replacement you really need to try it out, even if you keep it just for the purpose of soothing sore muscles or aches when they occur.  It is a large mask and will cover your eyes and temples.  I am seriously considering getting some and giving them out as gifts, I think anyone would be thrilled to get this and I know everyone has something they can use it for.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> Works good as an eye mask when it is cold for headaches.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet to relax with it warm but can&#x27;t wait to.</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask I highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery I receieved mine on a Sunday it&#x27;s perfect hot or cold,very relaxing</li>
    <li> to silky slips off  face</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Ladies, if you are looking for something for those puffy eyes, this is it!!! I work very long hours and wake up with puffy eyes every morning. I wanted an eye mask that can be heated and cooled so I don&#x27;t have to buy multiple products as I tend to get sinus problems too. This hot and cold eye mask does just that with the added lavender for complete relaxation. The puffiness around my eyes has gone down a lot and I have made it routine for using it. Absolutely love it!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Eram!</li>
    <li> I just recieved my sleep mask a few weeks ago and I love it !!!  It smells so yummy and realaxing, and I love the soft blue cover.  My 5 year old daughter loves it also and tells me she cant wait to go to bed and use my mask : )  The mask also works great as a &amp;#34;booboo&amp;#34; pack - most ice packs are too cold to put directly on the skin, but this is perfect to take down the swelling on any place on the body or face  !!  I use it on my eyes any time I feel puffy and tired.  Also great on light summer night to block out the light or when your husband is watching TV in bed and you want to sleep.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Smells great.  It&#x27;s so versatile.  We keep it in the freezer and can heat it up when needed as well.</li>
    <li> This is basically an eye &amp;#34;pillow&amp;#34; it does not attach to your head like a mask BUT it does the job! It smells fantastic, can be microwaved for heat and put in the freezer for the cold. EXCELLENT for Migraines! *I won this product in a contest*</li>
    <li> Do you suffer from headaches? I do. They stem from having two kids under the age of five. Normally, I would take some Excedrin and the headache would be gone in an hour. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t do that right now. I have to avoid most medications for a while and all I can take is Tylenol. Well Tylenol doesn&#x27;t typically do anything for me, so I need something else for the time being to relieve my headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I discovered that Karmick was looking for bloggers for their review campaign, it looked like the perfect solution. The Hot/Cold Eye Pillow mask has lavender and flax seed in it. It can be used either hot or cold depending on your needs. For it to be hot, you just mist it with water and heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds. It is supposed to stay hot/warm for 10 minutes. If you want it cold, put it in the freezer for 1-2 hours. It&#x27;s to be used for maximum pain and stress relief. They recommend using it daily for dark circles, puffy eyes and induce sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Compress relieves stress, puffy eyes, dark circles immediately and promotes tranquility with natural scents of lavender&lt;br /&gt;Blocks out light completely&lt;br /&gt;Conforms to face and eyes and induces sleep&lt;br /&gt;Lavender scent relieves stress and tension&lt;br /&gt;Relaxes tired eyes from all day technology&lt;br /&gt;Use it for meditation and yoga&lt;br /&gt;Great for Men, Women and Children&lt;br /&gt;Hot pack can be used for sinus pain, dry eyes, allergies&lt;br /&gt;Cold pack can be used soothe migraines, headaches, aches and pain&lt;br /&gt;Cooling relief without the ice shocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a couple of nights now. I am not really sure it is helping the bags under my eyes or the puffiness, but my daughter has had an ear infection which has been keeping me up at night. I will say that is does block out all the light and conforms to your face. It does make you sleepy and relaxes you. I am not crazy about lavender, but that is the normal smell associated relaxation and stress relief. I love heating it up and using it warm. I have had slight headaches lately and this has been helping with the pain relief. I am guessing that the use of it being hot or cold is going to depend on how you like it best. Since the warmth seemed to help my headache more than the cold, this works the opposite for me as they instructed. Everyone is different, so I suggest you try to use it both ways for your various reasons and see which way it works best for you. It&#x27;s going to get used a lot in the coming months I think.lief.

    <li> Great for migraines ! Thanks</li>
    <li> This mask is the best I have ever used, and I have used quite a few. If anything ever happens to this mask I will but it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;I have problems sleeping, and this mask really helps me to fall asleep and sleep comfortably.You feel so relaxed from the moment you put it on, and the aroma , WoW !!!  I would recommend it highly!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was timely &amp; the product is as described. I used it for the first time last night (cold) &amp; am very pleased. It conforms nicely to my face, the material is soft, &amp; the lavender fragrance is pleasing.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Great for sinus problems and headaches</li>
    <li> I have a high stress life. I am currently working full time, going to college full time, doing an internship at a local school, running this website and doing a few other social media jobs. I am SUPER busy. I also work nights and sleep during the day which can be difficult to do. Since I have had so much on my plate recently, I have been having a hard time sleeping. I lay awake thinking about deadlines and everything that has to be done. When I heard about the Karmick Hot Cold Eye Mask I knew that it could help me. Plus, it has one of my favorite scents: Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Karmick eye mask can be used hot or cold by placing it in the microwave or freezer. I personally like to keep it in the fridge. It can also be used as a hot/cold pack to relieve muscle pain which is also useful to me. Karmick Eye Masks are made individually in the USA and they contain all natural ingredients. The outside is a gorgeous blue silky satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the great benefits of the Karmick Eye Mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cool compress relieves stress, puffy eyes, dark circles immediately and promotes tranquility with natural scents of lavender&lt;br /&gt;- Blocks out light completely&lt;br /&gt;- Conforms to face and eyes and induces sleep&lt;br /&gt;- Lavender scent relieves stress and tension&lt;br /&gt;- Relaxes tired eyes from all day technology&lt;br /&gt;- Use it for meditation and yoga&lt;br /&gt;- Great for Men, Women and Children&lt;br /&gt;- Hot pack can be used for sinus pain, dry eyes, allergies&lt;br /&gt;- Cold pack can be used soothe migraines, headaches, aches and pain&lt;br /&gt;- Cooling relief without the ice shocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Karmick eye pillow in every way possible at this point and I love it. I have used it as a calming heating pack for my sore neck and back, I have used it warm and cold on my eyes. As I mentioned earlier, I have even discovered that I like keeping it in the fridge. My freezer has some issues and often leaves ice crystals on anything left in there, so I put it in the refrigerator. It stays cool for a really long time and it is SO calming and relaxing on your eyes. When you microwave the mask, you can only microwave it for a short time. As a result, it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long. That is the only complaint I have about this mask. It is much better cold anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a very distinctive, but not overpowering lavender smell that is amazing. I have been using the mask for a few weeks and it has not lost potency at all. I believe that there is lavender essential oil mixed inside the mask. I am not sure exactly what the natural ingredients are that are inside the eye mask, but they are very small and fine. It allows the mask to conform perfectly to your face. The outside material is satin and feels amazing on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the lavender scent and cool satin relaxing, but this eye mask truly does block out all of the light in the room too. As someone who sleeps during the day, I love this benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this Karmick Eye Mask. It is by far the best eye mask that I have owned and it doubles as a small heating pad or cool pack. It would also make a great gift!erator.

    <li> This is my very favorite sleep mask! It lies comfortably on the eyes, covers out most light, and smells like lavender. Very relaxing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye mask that I ever used! I love the fact that this eye mask is not hard after it&#x27;s frozen. Most are hard after frozen and you can&#x27;t get the mask in the right areas of your eyes in order to help relieve your pain. This mask also has Lavender which smells wonderful. This helps to relief sinuses and makes you more relaxed. The mask itself is of a silk material and so soft. If I want a hot mask, I lightly spray the mask and then put it in the microwave on high for about 20 seconds. This definitely helps to relieve stress and make you very relaxed also. If I want a cold mask, I put the mask in a plastic bag and freeze for a couple of hours. This helps with my puffy eyes.  I tend to get a lot of headaches and migraines. I use a ice pack quite often. None of the ice packs that I have ever used even compares to this one! The Karmick mask conforms to my area perfectly, whether I want to put it over my eyes or on my head. It also blocks out the light for when I do have those horrible headaches and migraines. I am so glad that I got the opportunity to review this mask. It&#x27;s become a definite necessity to me. I become relaxed at night and get a better nights sleep. I did receive this in exchange for my honest opinion. I would definitely recommend this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have had tried different ones but this one is the best I ever experienced.</li>
    <li> GOOD MASK! IT IS NICE !</li>
    <li> Does not get very cold at all</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Smells great, comfortable and easy to use.  I&#x27;m going to order another.</li>
    <li> I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I LOVE this mask.It makes sleeping during the day so much more enjoyable. It blocks out the light and i feel so much more relaxed. I have also used it after a long day when i just want to clise my eyes and relax. THe mask is so soft. The little beads in it feel neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how you can use this mask hot or cold, so it has a lot of ways to use it. I liked putting it in the freezer and useing it to aid the puffyness under my eyes. It felt so nice but worked well. I&#x27;m glad i had the chance to use this item and exchange for my review. Its such a great item . A must have for mommies for sure!!!</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint is that it won&#x27;t stay on the face securely because it doesn&#x27;t have a strap.  With a slight movement of the face, it slips off due to the slippery fabric.  The lavender scent quickly fades out after a single use as a cold mask.  I bought this because of good reviews but imo, it is not woth 20 bucks if it does not come with a strap.  Used it couple times and I find it worth the trouble.  Looking for something else.</li>
    <li> it is not really a cool mask, it only stays cool for a few minutes then it is just a bad of beads on your face</li>
    <li> purchased this product to solve a problem with my dry eye condition and it has helped.I have been using this mask for about a week &amp; I like it very much. It was so soothing and relaxing.I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I am a programmer and I am on the computer for more than 10 hours a day. I get headaches and my eyes get extremely tired at the end of the day. This eye mask really helps me with the headaches and cooling for my eyes. It sits great on the eyes and blocks out every bit of light. I keep the eye mask in the freezer overnight and use it when I feel exhausted from looking at the screen. I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re stressed, always on the computer and need a chance to relax. It really works - and the smell / aroma is also very calming.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great relaxation!!!!!!!! Use it hot or cold, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I like this pillow mask. The lavender is a little overwhelming at first when you heat this, but that just tells me there is a lot of lavender in it so it will probably last for a long time. Sturdy stitching and a soft, satiny cover (not removable), comes in a nice box and made in USA. The label says the flax seeds are also organic, so no residual pesticides I&#x27;m guessing. This does not have a strap, but if you lie back (and just reclining in a chair is enough, you don&#x27;t have to be flat on your back), this pillow stays put and does not slide. It holds heat pretty well, much longer than I thought it would. In a chilly room mine was still a little warm after 30 minutes. I microwave it 30 seconds on each side which I think is twice what they recommend, and I don&#x27;t always mist it (spray a fine mist of water on it for those who asked what misting is). I also have a gel mask that you microwave for only 10 seconds max according to directions. It gets hot, but cools off quickly, so it is not a great option for me. This lasts much longer than the gel mask I have and it is not heavy, so it&#x27;s comfortable on your face. I have allergies and accompanying sinus pressure/headaches. I can&#x27;t take meds for it, so this has been nice for some temporary relief. I would buy it again and recommend it for anyone looking for some heat treatment of the sinuses. I have not tried it cold.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged, seems well made, indeed has lovely Lavender scent. My wife uses it warmed in microwave and says it feels wonderful on her eyes and sinuses. All to the good.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love the product. Bought this to use after eyelid surgery. Much nicer than an ice pack, and very effective. Looking forward to using it warm for sinuses when the need arises.</li>
    <li> I am a designer who spends a long hours on the computer and commutes to Los Angeles from Temecula monday to friday. As such I get black eyes and i am always stressed out. I Bought this product because my friend recommended it and I must say I am 100% impressed with the results. In just a week, I feel rejuvenated and no longer stressed out like I was before I started using this product.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it every night.. even when he doesn&#x27;t have migraines.. says it makes him feel calm and loves the cool feeling of the satin..</li>
    <li> Really really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing, it will be perfect if it has a stripe to attach to the head.</li>
    <li> This eye mask has a great weight which is extremely calming and the lavender scent is perfectly subtle. I purchased this for a long-haul flight and fell asleep for 5 hours. I highly recommend this product, you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing! One of the best products I&#x27;ve bought in awhile. Keeps light compleltly out and is just so soothing. I thought it would have slid off if I turned on my side but it actually like molds onto your eyes so it stayed in place. Love this eye pillow!!</li>
