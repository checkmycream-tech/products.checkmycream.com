<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little too heavy to handle.</li>
    <li> Exellent chair and service</li>
    <li> great chair for the money!  If there is a drawback I would have to say it&#x27;s the tires.  Great indoors or on pavement but too skinny to do any &amp;#34;off roading&amp;#34; with.</li>
    <li> The price was very reasonable.  Easy to use and not real heavy.</li>
    <li> Insurance would not cover a wheel chair and we decided it would make life easier for the months we needed.  It was suppose to take a week and was here in 2 days. Was almost fully assembled/. Easy to use and great price.</li>
    <li> The item was good, and the delivery was super</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product &amp; even better deal!  Add to that it shipped SAME DAY I ordered it, FREE shipping, and arrived 2 days later.  Amazing!  It comes assembled, except for the leg rests, but they are VERY easy to install.  My Dad says its very comfortable.  And its cool looking, the all black and silver...MUCH better (and more deluxe) than those ugly brown wheelchairs in the hospitals and nursing homes that cost an arm and a leg.  Whatever your age or condition, you always want to be comfortable and look cool!</li>
    <li> the chair is okay but the seat does not line up with the back which makes it hard to fold in transporting the chair and it squeaks when it rolls.</li>
    <li> I bought this wheelchair as an extra to keep in the car. I don&#x27;t like to get the indoor one dirty running it through black tar in parking lots.  While it is a very nice chair and was an excellent value for the money, it is too small for my 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; husband.  It looked like the one we have and has the same measurements, but it is a less expensive version and will not adjust as needed.  I have donated it to our church garage sale as it is too expensive to ship it back and it is much too tight and small to use.  However, if one were a normal size it would be very useable.</li>
    <li> I had knee surgery and was to be in a brace for 6 wks. I am so glad I ordered this chair. It may not stand up under constant heavy use but for a couple of surgeries and a broken ankle here and there it and the price were fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great chair for the price. Sturdy and light. You do have to wash the entire chair down with Mr.Clean and wait 3 days for the cemical smell to disipate. I made the mistake of sitting in it before cleaning it. Stunk up my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t plan to use until the smell is washed off and it has aired out.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quicker than expected. It no longer smells. Should last for a long time. Good design. Everything fits. No sharp pieces.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. Well built</li>
    <li> Works well, great price</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, light weight, easily folded or unfolded &amp; transported. Attachments are easily removed or attached. Great price for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this chair for my wife to get around in. have only had the chair for 2 months, but it&#x27;s great I hope it lasts for a long time. great price.pushes easy,great chair</li>
    <li> U get what u pay for.  a small fitting broke off the leg attachment on the second day of using it. It took 2 adults about two hours to get it back together right so it would work. Than had to go to Ace hardware to buy a 40 cent part to keep it together. Ace is the place. Very happy they had what I needed. Otherwise a little flimsy but should do the trick for the next 3-5 months. I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I give this item 5 STARS. Came fully assembled and on time. I only had a slight difficulty in installing the leg and footrest, but not a problem. As soon as it was out of the box, and unfolded I use it right away after I installed the foot rest. Lenght of footrest is adjustable and could be swung away to the side or elevated. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this thing on a whim, way nicer and better than what I could of gotten at the local store</li>
    <li> good price and works great.</li>
    <li> Had chair for cple days and then the small front wheels buckled in middle and no longer could be used. Cheaply made wheels.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and easy to wheel.  It is a bit heavy compared to the transport chair, but the rider feels safer.  Very heavy duty chair!</li>
    <li> It is better than expected</li>
    <li> this wheelchair was mispaportion in it&#x27;s parts, the seat was sunk in and too short, spent the last of my money on it after I had through away the old one that had broken.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great service</li>
    <li> the WHEELCHAIR WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR EXCEPT THE ELEVATEDLEG RESTS WERE NOT IN THE BOX . I NEEDED THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING SEEING MY HUSBANDS SURGERY WAS FOOT RELATED. I GIVE THE SHIPPER -10 SINCE THE PACKAGE CAME VERY BADLEY TORN UP AND TAPED EVERYWHERE WHICH IS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO THE LEG RESTS.  I WAS ALSO DISSAPOINTED THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE JUST BEEN SENT OUT WHEN I CALLED WITH THIS PROBLEM OF MISSING LEGS. I WAS TOLD I HAD TO RETURN THE WHEEL CHAIR. THEY COULD NOT SEND LEG RESTS WHICH I NEEDED. IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO PACKAGE UP THIS WHEELCHAIR MOSTLY BECAUSE THE BOX WAS SO DESTROYED ALSO I HAD TO GET IT TO A UPS DROP OFF. AND I AM NOT A VERY STRONG OR BIG WOMAN AND MY HUSBAND COULD NOT HELP ME BECAUSE OF HIS SURGERY.</li>
    <li> It is comfortable. The leg rests go on and off easily and swing to the outside easily. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that when the chairs just bairly fits my legs when the legs are down low (I am 5&#x27; 11\\&quot;). When you elevate the leg brace up, the pivot point is low enough that the length shortens significantly (at least a few inches) and I have to flip the foot pad out of the way and thus my foot dangles which is not optimal by any means.     However, when I don&#x27;t need elevation it is great, rolls easily, wheels are soft enough that it absorbs road noise, etc. Seems well enough made it should last a while.</li>
    <li> This chair is VERY heavy and awkward and uncomfortable.  However, it will get you from point A to point B if that is all you are after.</li>
    <li> Product is good and serves its purpose well.  I have to date not detected any issues with product and have been using it.</li>
    <li> Compact and was perfect!</li>
    <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and weigh 225 lbs. This wheel chair worked great for getting around the mall during the holidays. I have Sciatica and the foot rest at the farthest adjustment seem to be for someone much shorter than me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34; tall).</li>
    <li> This is a very good wheelchair. However, it was shipped with two right leg rests. Medlife is sending a left leg support, which is very nice of them because, with the tools provided I could not convert the right leg support into a left leg support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the desk is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this wheelchair for my mom. Great price, excellent quality and I would recommend this chair for anyone. The odor issue ill dissipate after it is aired out.</li>
    <li> The chair worked well with a very small amount of assembly.&lt;br /&gt;Brake adjustment only required adjusting one screw on each wheel.&lt;br /&gt;Chair fits in trunk easily.&lt;br /&gt;We used it to roll up a set of three steps with ease, as we saw on a video found on the web.&lt;br /&gt;https://patienteducation.osumc.edu/Documents/wheel-chair.pdf</li>
    <li> This is a good wheel chair, and it functions well.  It is small enough to fit into the vehicle too.  The foot rests are a little tricky to adjust, but everything else is great.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter after an ATV accident that crushed her femur and left her unable to walk or bend her leg for months and had to keep her leg elevated. It is very well built and very sturdy. It is not too heavy to lift into the trunk, although a bit awkward. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a well built wheelchair for a great price.  Pros: Sturdy, well built, elevating leg rests, folds up and fits into the trunk of a car, everything is detachable.  Cons: None</li>
    <li> Was shipped fast and the product is great, my family member loves the chair</li>
    <li> We bought this chair for my wife&#x27;s aging mother.    It arrived quickly and was easy to set up.  I looked on CraigsList and couldn&#x27;t find a comparable used one for this price.  Everything on Craigslist was $200+ for a used one with all theses features.</li>
    <li> It has met my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> My wife tires very easily. I bought this wheelchair so that we could go to food stores,malls, etc. I am a senior citizen and have a mid size car. I have to remove the leg supports but I do not have any other problems with putting in my trunk. I was surprised at how well this wheelchair was made. I did not expect this level of quality for the price. My wife told me that it was the best Christmas gift she has received in years. It returned her mobility.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, although the wheelchair have that smell to it. But it went away after a few weeks. This wheelchair is really nice &amp; have a great price.!.</li>
    <li> This is a great chair.  Very sturdy! Folds easily.  It&#x27;s 49 pounds so it&#x27;s a little challenging to put into the trunk. My only real negative is the smell.  It has a pretty strong paint or dye smell.  We have left it out in the sun for a few days.  I think it&#x27;s better, but it&#x27;s taking a while for the odor molecules to fully escape. If you are sensitive to strong smells, beware. Not sure there is anything else to do but let it air out for a week or so. I think the sunshine might speed up the process, but not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/14/13:  It&#x27;s been out on the porch for a few weeks now.  The smell is still pretty strong. I think it&#x27;s from the tires. It smells like the show room of a tire store. Maybe the tires were not fully curred. May have to send it back. Too bad; it&#x27;s a nice chair otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/22/13: The wheelchair and box weigh 54 pounds. If you need to return it, the shipping is not cheap: Asheville, NC to Houston TX: UPS Ground: $76. Fedex Ground: $68.  There is also a 20% restocking fee.</li>
    <li> Great wheelchair for the money</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy, perfect!</li>
    <li> Was very excited about the wheelchair. The price and the quick shipping. I should know better you get what you pay for......  Heavy and very stiff. I would not want my mother to have to sit in this chair for any long periods of time. Comfort is very important for a chair like this and wrong chair. Very expensive to ship back. Read details carefully~ But you still will not get a comfort test untill it is too late!</li>
    <li> great value, easy to store, unfolds easy, leg rest can be put on or taken on in seconds, rolls or pushes easy.  recommend highly.</li>
    <li> The wheel chair is great! It is comfortable and easy to push---however, it is very heavy for the pusher to lift into an auto. Thank you --it arrived on time and I do thank you.  constance davis</li>
    <li> Might give it a five star later, but for now I will definitely give it a four star on appearance only.  My order looks like it will be a good wheelchair.  We will know more when we actually get to use it in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price, I am very pleased with this purchase. ..  RB, La Mesa, CA</li>
    <li> The only thing that would have made this chair better would be if the seat would have been just a little wider.</li>
    <li> This product is of great quality. I was a little depressed that my disability has gotten to the point of needing my own wheel chair, but I am very pleased that I ordered this item. First of all, it was delivered in 2 days of placing order even though they said about 7 days. Easy to assemble but I did struggle a little with the leg rests. Easy to close up for storage or traveling and brake levers work very well. I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product. Would surely recommend it to other customers.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair arrived ahead of schedule. The box had some damage but the chair was well padded and was not effected. Assembly was easy and the chair functioned perfectly. I should have bought this chair first because the adjustable foot rests is great for my wife who had hip replacement. I certainly would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year or so and it&#x27;s durable, travels well and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair has all the features you need, adjustable legrests, both length adjustable and elevation adjustable, legs swing away &amp; come off easily, arms go on and off easily,  foot things to step on in the back to lift the front of the chair over bumps, door threshholds etc.  The chair is light.  It folds up easily to put it aside.  The metal part is sort of dark gunmetal color, fashionable for a wheelchair.  The price you cannot beat, it is less paying cash than it would be on medicare paying just the co-pay.  Box arrived damaged but the inside packing was very good and no harm came to the chair.  I have a 90 lb person in the chair and so there is lots of room for the oxygen tank, her shopping bag she must always have with her, an afghan. Eva Medical deserves lauds for this excellent chair at this price.</li>
    <li> This wheel chair is a quality product.  It well built, attractive in appearance and comes assembled unlike most things you buy today.  It comes with a good warranty.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is a real fast shipper via FEDEX.</li>
    <li> Was the best price I found for a quality wheelchair.  A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> For the $$ this wheelchair meets &amp; exceeds my needs. I probably only need to use it for about 2-3 months (mostly while at work). The elevating leg rest is the feature that I purchased it for &amp; it has been working well. The black plastic cover on the leg rest handle did fall off, so people have to be extra careful not to scratch their vehicles when loading &amp; unloading it. I have to sit on a pillow after a few hours, but I don&#x27;t think this is uncommon.I&#x27;ve had it for about a month &amp; there are still home care companies that have not even called me back regarding the chair. For the money &amp; delivery time you can&#x27;t beat it! Better to get this &amp; get reimbersed from insurance if possible. I sent all my receipts right away to United Healthcare &amp; haven&#x27;t gotten any response, but like I said, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> The wheelchair chair works very good and is strong&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these chairs and both were returned due to damage. In both cases, the mags were broken and the handrails were split in several places. I will never buy a product made by American Bantex or EVA Medical Group. It is absolute garbage!</li>
    <li> Mom uses this wheelchair all day every day.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Met all my requirements, especially smaller size&lt;br /&gt;For apartment use. Economically&lt;br /&gt;Priced and I ordered it on Wednesday&lt;br /&gt;And it was delivered on Friday! Amazing&lt;br /&gt;Customer service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this chair from Amazon.com.  In general&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the positive points of other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;This chair is offered by a number vendors on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this particular item because the&lt;br /&gt;capacity is specified as 300 pounds.  Most of the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;similar\\&quot; chairs have a 250 pound capacity specified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chair is clearly marked on the lower support rod&lt;br /&gt;as having a capacity of 250 pounds.  Hopefully&lt;br /&gt;this particular listing has a \\&quot;typo\\&quot; error and is not&lt;br /&gt;a deliberate attempt to defraud the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a 5-star rating if it were not&lt;br /&gt;for the capacity specification problem.  I would return&lt;br /&gt;my unit and get a different one, but I can&#x27;t trust the&lt;br /&gt;capacity specification so what would be the point?&lt;br /&gt;I would probably end up with the same problem after&lt;br /&gt;paying more money.</li>
    <li> A good fitting wheel chair for a small person. Fits my wife just right. The leg lifts could be  a little bit longer. However, it was what we wanted and did the job. Not for a larger person, like my self. Amazon was very helpful.</li>
    <li> Decent. For the price . Easy to put assemble decent price as well to . No regrets. Of. Buying. It.</li>
    <li> If I could give more than just 5 stars to Med Mobile, I would give a constellation consisting of billions and billions of galaxies of stars. My new wheelchair was in the driveway when I returned from my operation just 2 days after ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was free.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t thank you enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add that it fits around the bends in my kitchen and the leg lift keeps my shattered foot elevated like the surgeon ordered...the swing away leg rests also allow me to get into area&#x27;s to fix my own meals and grab dishes out of the cabinets.  Its a real life saver since I have to cook for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a wonderful affordable product in record time!!!!</li>
    <li> This wheel chair is well made and a great value for the low price charged for it. We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good wheel chair for the price. I purchased this particular style of wheel chair because I needed a wheel chair with elevating leg rest due to a recent motorcycle accident that requires me to keep my leg elevated. When the package arrived the right elevating leg rest came out of the box in the extended position and would not release. After many attempts to collapse it, I found that a screwdriver would release the mechanism that controlled the elevation lock. I contacted the manufacturer, Medline and the customer service people were very friendly and helpful. Right away, they FedExed  a pair of replacement leg rests that works superbly and of better quality than the ones it came with along with return FedEx labels to ship the defective ones back. Since installing the new pair of elevated leg rests, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect chair for my needs  I would recommend it anyone</li>
    <li> not for a disabled person, not for a disabled person, not for a disabled person  not for a disabled person,not for a disabled person</li>
    <li> Very easy to transport</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy chair for the price.  We&#x27;ve used it extensively for several weeks with no problems.  Renting a wheelchair  for a month would have cost about as much as buying this chair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a church.  We have already been able to loan it out to a lady on hospice.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality Wish I had purchases two extra to donate to&lt;br /&gt;our BC aging and resoures center</li>
    <li> Love this. WELL worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very high quality, easy to set up/collapse when necessary, sturdy and durable, and an unbelievable price! Purchasing this one was WAY cheaper than the cost to rent a used one for just 2 weeks - makes no sense! Gotta love amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent price, prompt shipping, good communications with vendor, and good value.  Fits great thru hallways, but a plus-size person may not fit well in the seat.</li>
    <li> great chair for the money, it is heavy and at high speed the wheels wobble badly, but for the price it will get the job done. great as a temporary or permanent chair. folds up more easily than any other chair I have ever used.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GOIJWG Self Transport Folding Wheelchair with Detachable Desk Armrests, Swing-away Detachable Elevating Leg Rests, Solid Castors and Large Rolling Rear Wheels.]]  Although it has only been a week, my mother loves her new chair.  She&#x27;s 5\\&quot; 6&#x27; and weighs 180 lbs. and this wheelchairs fits her needs perfectly.  With its easily removable parts, the wheelchair readily conforms to any given situation, from traveling, to eating and napping!  She (WE) love it!</li>
    <li> purchased this wheelchair for my husband, weight 160 lbs. it fits him well , but chair feels funny , like it might fold up , or come apart. I don&#x27;t  know if I would recommend this chair for a grown-up person, better for a child</li>
    <li> This chair is just what we had in mind for my mother.  She broke her kneecap and leg so getting around her apartment was a problem.  This chair is light enough to pack up and bring along with us in the car when we have a doctor appointment and sturdy enough for every day use.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair has been awesome. I broke my ankle and it is very useful. Whenever I go somewhere that requires a lot of walking it is such a relief.</li>
    <li> I was tired of moving my Invacare wheelchair from one vehicle to the other so I wanted to buy another one so I could have one in both vehicles.  I had the Invacare Tracer EX2 for four years and it had been flawless but it was now not available via Amazon Prime.  There had also been times when I wish I could have elevated my legs so I decided to try this one from MedMobile- although the box it came in said it was from ProBasics.  It was delivered quickly.  The shipping box looked a bit damaged but not much.  The product itself was packaged nicely so no damage would incur inroute.  I did a quick test in the house and then put it in the back of my Equinox.  Three days later I had to use it for the first time at a wedding reception and took it out and loaded the riggings on and got in it and started to move.  It was moving very hard so I thought I had left the brake on but had not.  My wife looked at it and said the rubber tire had come off the rim.  The next day my wife and I tried to pull the rubber over the rim but there was no way we were strong enough.  My wife took it to a bike shop the next day and two young men struggled to pull the rubber up and over the rim but they did get it done.  I did a test run in the driveway last night but nothing out in public yet.  My confidence is shattered right now with this wheelchair.  I am going on vacation in about a month and was going to take the new wheelchair but my old faithful Invacare will be taking the trip with me.  I wanted to send it back but what a hassle with an item this big and having already thrown out the book - big mistake BTW - keep the box until you are completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> the product isgreat. It is comfortable and convenient and I found it to be very practical. It was for my wife and was satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is that it is HEAVY so putting it in and out of the car was the problem</li>
    <li> This  chair is great for my purpose, it does have a strong rubber smell to it. The size and the weight is just right.  Shipping was fast, received it within 2 days after ordering it.  The product, price and shipment  is very good.</li>
    <li> Perfect and extremely easy to use on my own.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my wheelchair.  It is sturdier than the ones from medicare!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bulkier than expected but strong for heavier users. Great for airports!</li>
    <li> The chair was too heavy for me to put in my car.</li>
    <li> I purchased this chair for my sister and it has been a blessing.  It is excellent for maintaining in a small apartment.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom and she loves it and not to mention the great price.  Thanks for the great service...</li>
    <li> I needed another chair for my mother that is in a nursing home. It was a great price and made as well as the ones that you buy from a health care facility that Medicare helps to purchase. This was a more economically sound purchase to make. I am glad that I made the decision. At this price, I can purchase one annually, if need be.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair has a strong odor to it which will not go away. The legs stick out to far and will not let down.</li>
    <li> I ordered the chair and was advise it would be delivered in about a week.  Three days later it came.  It looks stronger than the chair I have been renting.  Wheels nicely.  No marks on the wood, vinal or carpet floors.  The arms &amp; legs are easy to remove.  Folds nicley.  We will see what its like after we use it awhile.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair is great! It came early too. Its stable, secure and works well! My 87yrd old Mother needed one for some time. And the sale was a great price! There is NO horrible smell, its just the order of the product like a new car smell. It is not obnoxious at all.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped it promptly and came before Christmas! It was not guaranteed to arrive before Christmas.</li>
    <li> Very durable and sturdy. It is a little bit heavy and big for my mother  in law who I intended to give it to, but just perfect for the big size of my father in law who is using it now .</li>
    <li> I recieved my chain in ONLY 4 days. It&#x27;s light enough I can fold it and move it by myself. The chair is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old son broke his leg and needed a wheelchair initially so he could get around. I decided to order this wheelchair because it was cheaper than renting one locally. After ordering it, it arrived quickly, all the pieces were there, and the footrests were super easy to put on. The footrests were great for keeping his leg elevated. I saw comments about the tires making black marks and someone commented on the smell (rubber?) from the wheelchair. Yes... This was the case but still worth the money. The marks came off the floor and the wheelchair was stored in the garage when not in use. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy but it is very heavy to fold and lift in the car and not comfortable to sit in, needs cushion in seat.</li>
    <li> I bought this wheelchair for my mother who has Multiple Sclerosis. We took her down to Ocean City Car Cruise and this was a lifesaver! Folds up great and fits well in the back of any car trunk. I mainly bought this so I could push her in the MS walk this year! im sure it will do the job!</li>
    <li> This chair smelled horrible.  It contaminated the air in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat it in my garage to try to air it out; it contaminated the air in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have no idea what could possibly make a product this toxic smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned.</li>
    <li> Apparently some sort of chemical from the materials. What is it? Any advice on how to get rid of it?</li>
    <li> A little small and would fit a medium sized child perfect</li>
    <li> Fantastic wheelchair.  Excellent heavy duty construction.  Sturdier than expected. Convenient detachable footrests. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> This chair is great for after surgery.  It is a little smaller than the rental one I was using and is easier to get around in.  I leave the foot supports off and use my feet to propel me around the kitchen.</li>
    <li> much too heavy for most of my family to lift&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the wheelchair.  Great product for the price.  Arrived in perfect condition and will be used on a daily basis during my recovery from foot surgery.  The elevating legs is a fantastic feature.</li>
    <li> Shipping was right on time. The product is of even higher quality than i expected after reading other reviews, especially for the price. Very pleased and would recommend to anyone in need of a wheelchair. [[ASIN:B000GOIJWG Self Transport Folding Wheelchair with Detachable Desk Armrests, Swing-away Detachable Elevating Leg Rests, Solid Castors and Large Rolling Rear Wheels.]]</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with the product I bought here.. the wheelchair was literally brand new from the box and wrapped up!! Everything works perfectly fine and couldn&#x27;t had made a better choice.</li>
    <li> Solid and comfortable! It&#x27;s the same model used at the rehab center. The leg rests and stirrups are adjustable and easy to remove and replace.</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy.  A little heavier than other wheel chairs used.  Arms on chair can flex and rub on wheels slightly.</li>
    <li> I had a severe accident and couldn&#x27;t walk for two months at least. To rent a wheelchair was 75 per week. I found this one and it was much better. It had the elevating legs and is very sturdy. I am glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Convenient and easy to use. Well built, sturdy but attractive. It will serve me a long time and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, sturdy. A little on the heavy side to load in and out of the car. Also wished the foot rests would go down all the way.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber of the wheels have a very strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, great value for the price. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> purchased the chair for my mom.  It is a sturdy, easy to use chair.  It was a great price, I could not pass it up.</li>
    <li> This chair has great adjustability, and is light and easy to transport. I have used this chair for medical appointments and just to get around the house while I recover from a broken leg. The legs aren&#x27;t as sturdy as I&#x27;d like, but for the price, it&#x27;s a really nice chair.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, I will only need this for a short time, and I got it the next day after ordering. It is the perfect size for me At 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;&#x27; but my husband who is 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; could use it if necessary. It fits through all our doors, no problem getting around on my own. With a price like this, it will be put away in the garage for emergency use by me or a friend or neighbor. Good thing to have on hand because you couldn&#x27;t even find a nearby rental so convenient and inexpensive. I know, I tried. My husband said it was best purchase ever. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and prompt delivery!  I ordered it to have at our church for people needing help getting to and from their car and church.  One member used it the first Sunday and ordered her own to have at home the next day.  I placed the order on a Tuesday afternoon and it arrived on Friday morning.  A great buy!!</li>
    <li> Chair was an incredible value at $200. It would have cost me more to rent locally. Already assembled on arrival except for the leg extensions which simply click in place with no tools required. Exceptionally stable and smooth rolling. For those with tender behinds, get a seat cushion if you&#x27;ll spend more than an hour at a time in the chair. They a cushion accessory but I used a patio chair cushion which worked great.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. Thanks to this item we had a great family vacation: Mom was with us everywhere! She didn&#x27;t miss a thing! Even the beach!&lt;br /&gt;I expected a much higher price. Thank you for making it affordable. If we didn&#x27;t have it, my mom would have been forced to stay at the hotel. FYI. It is much lighter to carry than I first thought. You fold it by pushing inward the sides. Compact enough for any small car trunk or closet. Would even fit under a high bed.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  The padded  leg rests are not necessary.  I use this chair for comfort.  Far better than sitting in a hard plastic or wood chair.</li>
    <li> This works great for me. I am about 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; and weigh 118 lbs. It&#x27;s very comfortable, though I haven&#x27;t been in it more than a few hours at a time. I definitely recommend using a seat cushion. Great chair for the price.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair was delivered just a few days after I ordered it.  It was almost 100% assembled and I only had to attach the Swing-away leg rests, which was very easy!  The chair is not too heavy @45lbs.  Easy to maneuver, solidly built, comfortable.  It is easy to transport, not bulky and handles with ease.  My wife took it to Peru and had no trouble taking it on and off the plane (with leg extensions attached!).  I would recommend this product to anyone needing a wheelchair to get around the house, or even outside for short distances.</li>
    <li> bought it for my husband, and it works well, fits under the table, like the leg rest and being able to move them to different heights, wishes he could move the leg rest pads, but they still work as is</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the least bit comfortable. The greater your weight, the taller you need to be in order to be even close to comfortable. Within a couple uses, one of the foot rests cracked to the point of being unusable (they&#x27;re plastic) and the one wheel bent a little and it made a rubbing noise everytime I wheeled to a new location. It was good for the 3-4 day trip we were on, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for more than that. The good part is that I had my own chair for 3 days and for less than a rental. I ended up donating this to the Salvation Army and will be getting a better quality one the next time around.</li>
    <li> Stable, works. Carrier for a Quad cane accessory as next project. Interchangeable wheels would be useful. Standard narrow wheels do not work well on wall-to-wall carpet.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a great deal. Easy to put together and use. Thank you. I&#x27;ll pass the word along.</li>
    <li> Mother has one hand and bad legs so getting around in this is a task compared to her old chair that was broken in. The brakes are really hard to lock, even for a young healthy me. And the arms are a little short, too far back, leaving no room for her side pouch that carries her phone and light switch. The chair is otherwise nice and sturdy. There is a new smell, but we don&#x27;t find it offensive at all. The leg rests are fine, luckily she&#x27;s not tall. Will update once she gets used to it. Overall, satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a very good value.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough to move my 200 lb body around easily.  It maneuvers easily.  It does not fit through the bathroom door but it does fit through all other doors in the house.  I have not tried to lift it but it says it weighs around 50 lbs.  I bought it because I wanted something to use when we visit somewhere where a lot of walking is required.  I think it  will more than do the job. It has padding for the calves of the legs so when and if I have knee surgery, that will be nice to have.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife had a foot operation and the Dr. prescribed a walker for her but said she could put no weight at all on the foot for a month or so.  After a day with the walker which the hospital sold us at twice the going price, we knew she couldn&#x27;t hop around for a month on one foot.  We ordered this wheel chair at 2:00 AM on a Tuesday morning.  I built a wheelchair ramp the next day and we got the chair Thursday. It turned out that she had to use it for seven weeks.  The chair is well made and comfortable to sit in.  It folds up easily and is reasonably light weight.  The foot rests are easy to put on and remove which we did often to help navigate some areas of our home.  We put a wider door in one bathroom for wheel chair access and removing the foot rests made it easier for her to get in and out.  She never got the hang of putting the foot rests back on while sitting in the chair.  It still looks like it just came out of the box.  We are very happy with it.  It is a very popular chair.  We see them everywhere.</li>
    <li> The product was received without delay and is a great value for the price.  Folds easily to put in the trunk of a Honda Civic.  Only negative it has a strong odor of plastic/rubber.  Although we have had it a month it still off gasses but that is a minor problem</li>
    <li> Its a cheap wheelchair. You get what you pay for. Wasn&#x27;t the hospital or $300 quality but it did what it was bought for.  Would recommend for short term use. (2 months)</li>
    <li> The wheelchair is well built and sturdy. It weighs about 50 lbs and folds in half  by grabbing armrests and pulling them towards each other (compressing) so it is not too hard to put into a car trunk.</li>
    <li> Thank you for offering this wheelchair.  It is a great chair, with all of the needed parts.  The price was great and I would recommend this chair to anything needing one.  Linda</li>
    <li> Its very good and i recomended my mom use it for 6 months and this company is the best i have an broken tire they change it to me after 3 days only</li>
    <li> I had been researching wheelchairs for a couple of months now awaiting diagnosis from my doctors (very weak legs, difficulty standing or walking more than half hour, just using cane for balance in the meantime but in tears by the time I arrived to my destination)  Since the motorized wheelchairs are way out of my price range and also very heavy, I decided should I need a wheelchair, this one will be best!  Big plus~ It has elevating leg rests -many OTHER chairs are deceiving, they do not elevate.  It is lightweight enough to take in and out of car (just under 40 pounds) narrow enough to fit through doorways yet my wide body sits very comfortably!  Easily folds, all intact, to put in car. Very happy and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Ok but mine pulls to the left. Send email to company and never heard back.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, good quality piece of equipment.  Emits strong smell of rubber and chemicals.  Heavy, and hard to lift it in &amp; out of SUV, but handy for use on outdoor trips with frail parent.</li>
    <li> Some folks referred to this chair as flimsy but that&#x27;s not the case here.  It shows no signs of wear after several months of use. Recommended</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality wheelchair for a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve seen these in Medical supply stores that easily doubled the price.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the wheels hit my feet sometimes.</li>
    <li> Delivered a day after I made the order...Very impressive! Chair is good and very reliable...The only issue I have is with the stepper because I have to install and re-install it every time it is put in use. Over all however it was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my mom, but needed it within a week.  She was coming to visit and was going to go the the Living Aquarium and has severe knee problems so she can&#x27;t walk a lot.  The order said it would take 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  I emailed the company and they got it to us by the day we needed it.  My mom loved it!  It was very comfortable for her to sit in and easy for my dad to push.  They have since used it several times when they go to the store.  It folds up nicely and fits in the trunk of the car.  Definitely a great price and a great wheel chair.  A big thank you for getting it shipped to me early so we could have it for my mom when she came!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of wheelchair. Received very quickly, very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Really was even nicer than I expected.  To me it seems like a great product for the price.  And it was very nice to get it delivered for free right to the door.  And it came super fast. Like the next day even though I just when with he free shipping option.</li>
    <li> Wheelchair is heavy and seems well built. I purchased for my dad so we could wheel him on long walks from parking lot to his drs office. I tried it out and popped some wheelies on it. Folds up easily and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on floor.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy or the money. Its not the Cadillac of wheelchairs, but you cant get a better buy for the money. Shipping was as advertised. I need a chair desperately and it fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. My mom has Parkinson&#x27;s disease and can&#x27;t barely walk anymore, I was amazed by this chair. We actually had to double check on the price, because it just looks very expensive. And it&#x27;s super sturdy, too. My mom is overweight and she fits in it perfectly. Really recommend!</li>
    <li> We bought this in anticipation of the need.  It is really nice but pretty heavy.  Hoping I don&#x27;t have to load it in the trunk of the car very frequently.  It maneuvers the house very well.  I&#x27;m a strong woman but I am concerned that with the weight of my husband along with the chair, it may be a bit of a challenge weight wise.  Built well tho and extremely affordable.</li>
    <li> Even though I have bought this wheelchair for occasional use I am very pleased with the price, quality and promptness of delivery. I cannot wait until I use it to accompany my childen and grandchildren on their walks along the boardwalk this  spring and summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this wheelchair. I broke my leg and had to have my leg elevated all the time. But I didn&#x27;t want to stay in bed all day long. Plus, I have kids, and household chores don&#x27;t get done as much if I&#x27;m in bed all day. So this chair has given me a little more independence. I only needed the one leg propped up, so I left the other leg rest off. But now I am able to move around the house alot more than using crutches. Because with the crutches, I can only stand for so long before my good leg starts hurting. And this wheelchair fits perfect in my doorway, and folds up pretty easy to be transported or stored.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She broke her leg and the crutches hurt her under the arms. For a very decent price I bought this wheelchair. She uses it to get around the house and plans to use it when she returns to work. The injured leg can be elevated. I am impressed with how well it is constructed. Other reviews noted the rubber smell from the tires. It is there, but not very strong and not at all a concern. My wife spent the day in it and when I asked her if she noticed the rubber smell she said &amp;#34;no&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know how they can make a product like this and ship it to your house for less than $130. If I could rate this purchase higher than a five star I would!</li>
    <li> My mom just had reconstructive surgery on her foot, so she cannot have any weight bearing on her right foot for a while. It was cheaper to purchase a wheelchair than it was to rent one, and she decided on this one. She is in her mid-forties, always on the go, and loves to do things independently, which means I was stressing about her getting around when no one was around to assist her. It came via FedEx this afternoon, already assembled, and ready to go. It was easy to pop on the leg rests. We were already out and about, and I was amazed at the easy maneuverability. Many reviewers are complaining about the smell of the tires, but that is standard with any new rubber equipment. The smell isn&#x27;t necessarily terrible, and it has mostly dissipated. Mom&#x27;s happy, so I am happy! As a side note, I would like to extend the promptness with which it was delivered. We ordered it late Wednesday night, and here it is Friday afternoon. FAST standard shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who is somewhat bedridden.  This chair provided him the desire to get up and out.  It was easy to assemble with what small assembly is required.  I bought the Duro-Med Polyfoam Wheelchair Cushions to go with it. The price is amazing considering that renting a wheelchair is about $60.00 a month at most health and home stores (outrageous).  I would recommend this wheelchair even on a temporary basis.  Much cheaper.  If one does not need it any longer, donate it to a rehab center, nursing home, etc.</li>
    <li> Great chair but the smell is tough to handle. Hoping it will fade, have to keep it outside.</li>
    <li> Great chair, my only problem is that the brakes do not hold the chair steady, it will roll with patient in seat.</li>
    <li> This chair seems nice and solid while remaining lightweight enough for my husband to load &amp; unload to/from the trunk of our car. The handles are too low, causing him back pain, so we&#x27;ve got handle extenders on the way. I only need the chair for mobility away from home, so it seemed that the trunk would be a good place to keep it--but not yet! The formaldehyde smell is SO bad that we&#x27;re leaving it on the deck when not in use for at least a week. If the smell isn&#x27;t gone by then, we&#x27;ll be looking at returning the chair. I need to get around, but I sure don&#x27;t need to be poisoned while doing so.</li>
    <li> These wheel chairs were for my Grandparents who are both 90 years old. These are great prices as the wheelchairs are solid and made of strong material! Very happy customer!!</li>
    <li> Worked really well for my parents during our trip in Europe.</li>
    <li> I bought this wheelchair for my elderly mother who has severe osteoporosis.  I can take it in and out of my car truck fine.  It opens and closes very easily.  For me, the leg rests are a little difficult to put in place, but everything else is wonderful.  Without this wheelchair my mother could not leave the house.</li>
    <li> The chair was heavy and light. Good to use on campus. Easier to move around in crowds. Fits in small cars.</li>
    <li> Appears to be a decent chair, but smells like a tire fire and the stench never goes away. Be warned - the odor will contaminate any room it&#x27;s in, too. Unusable unless you have no sense of smell, but even in that case you shouldn&#x27;t be inhaling what this is emitting.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews that pointed out the odor issue and asked, How bad can it be? The smell lasts for a long, long time. Other than that, the armrests have this plastic ridge which irritated me so much, I taped newspaper on them and eventually stopped using them. For the price it is okay.</li>
    <li> Wheelchair was pretty much ready to use and feels sturdy and is attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Leg rests are especially useful as I have a casted lower leg.</li>
    <li> good for the what I need to do.</li>
    <li> This chair was perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this to stay at my dads  house for when I visit. I works, but it&#x27;s heavy, and the swing away action of the foot rest it tricky and often pinches my fingers. Otherwise for use around the house it works fine. Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Yhe item was ordered soon after my diagnosis of Mesotheoioma make me think I would need the unit. But on reflection I decided to keep it as it will come in handy as both my wife and I fight our cancers.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a really good value. I used it for 3 months while recovering from an injury and it worked out great for me. Definitely the best choice out there!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that it arrived in only two days and she is very proud of it. Thanks. Will trade with you folks again.</li>
    <li> We loved the adjustable leg extensions. It helped greatly with a leg that could not bend much. I was happy that it could fold up. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but not too bad. Just make sure your trunk is not too full. It does take up quite a bit of room.</li>
    <li> Leg rests not as described... too short.  Purchased for transport after knee operation but lag rests not as described disappointing</li>
    <li> I choose this rating as I am well pleased and the price fit my budge.&lt;br /&gt;the only draw back is the leg rests are a little short for my legs and I am only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; tall.</li>
    <li> A good chair but a bit heavy..</li>
    <li> It is too heavy for a transport wheelchair..</li>
    <li> I ordered this wheelchair right after my husband fell and had an extremely serious foot injury and was not able to do any weight bearing for about 3 months.  I was very impressed with the quality for the price. And delivery was so fast!  Would unconditionally recommend this item.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wheelchair EXCEPT for the tires.Wheelchair arrived assembled but tires were off rims.  We took chair to a bike shop where tires were applied to rims. Approximately, a week later a tire came off rim while chair in use and again had to be replaced.  A second and more annoying problem with the tires is the black marks left on flooring everywhere the chair is used.  The problem is the tires as the chair is only used in the house.  Marks are on all types of surfaces,i.e linoleum, tile, carpet .</li>
    <li> Too heavy--Couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the box.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> chair was in good shape when it arrived, I thing it was a good value for the price I payed</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery  light weight my father in law loves loves</li>
    <li> good chair for the price</li>
    <li> The chair is very nice except for the strong chemical odor of the tires. I&#x27;m still spraying them with Fabreze and airing it on our back porch. The odor has demished somewhat, so maybe a bit more time?</li>
    <li> Received quickly and well packed.  Have used this for three months when I had foot surgery .  No complaints, works great</li>
    <li> The first wheel chair I&#x27;ve purchase and im really satisfied . I was able to.take my grandmother every where I went .</li>
    <li> This is an excellent chair for my uncle.</li>
    <li> The best wheelchair I have had.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> This chair is wonderful, and although I had read a review that it leaves marks on floors and carpet, I have never had it mark anything!!!!!!! It is a great chair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I managed to get LYME disease some years ago that effected the nerves in my lower legs. As a result I need support to stand or walk. I have two walkers and can walk with them until about 2 weeks ago I fell and fractured the radius bone in my arm right at the wrist. I could not use the walkers at first as you need both hands so I sat on the one and scooted around the house. I then tried pushing the walker standing with my left hand on the handlebar and my right elbow on the other. This worked fairly well but I have pins in the wrist with bar between them holding the fracture. This pulls on the pins and is painful so we decided to look for a wheelchair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Sunday paper had an ad for a major pharmacy of one with delivery many days from the order plus sales tax. I looked on Amazon and they had the same one for $2.00 cheaper and no sales tax and free delivery and the reviews said delivery was in 2 to 3 days. I read all the reviews and it appeared it was a good chair but several mentioned plastic brackets. Also many mentioned the packaging was very poor. However I was just about to order it and in looking for it, I has turned away and looked at others, I saw this Invacare at the same price so I looked at its reviews. I did not see the mention of poor packaging nor any of the other negative comments. Looking closer I saw one design feature, I am a Retired Engineer, that was better than the other chair. The Invacare has a fork, like a bicycle, over the small wheels so that the axle is supported at both ends. The other had a single support with a cantilevered , only connected at one end, axle. This axle design is more likely to fail sooner than the fork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Invacare on July 14 and it was delivered July 17. The packaging was excellent, heavy boxboard , no damage, chair wrapped in plastic foot supports in separate box in large box. Really professional packaging. Chair was completely assembled, except for removable leg and foot supports. I couldnot find any plastic bracket, all steel. Pedaled around living room without leg supports. Tried to get in computer room, door wide enough but a chest in the way. Leg and foot supports go on without tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual, probably written in China, could be improved. Illustrations small and dim. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with this chair and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the previous remarks about smell is all about.  It smells like a new product with rubber tires.  Similar to a bicycle.  It is no big deal.  The chair is well made, delivered on time, and works great.</li>
    <li> The chair is rugged yet lightweight, a perfect fit for my semi-active life. Comfortable, even for someone like me who tips the scales at 260 pounds. Easy to transport and get into and out of a Honda Civic. I often work from the chair for 6-8 hours at a time, and by adding a second seat pad, I find it comfortable to work from. Best price I found so making it a bargain rounds things out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am 6ft3, 215 lbs and this wheelchair is perfect.  Easy assembly, fast delivery, comfortable, with easy manuverability and inexpensive.  Had ankle surgery and bought this to get around in during the healing process. One of the best decisions I have ever made.  If anything, the instruction book could have been clearer, need more pictures identifying exactly what you need to do, etc. Would recommend it to anyone needing something to move around in.</li>
    <li> After an injury that left me immobile, I purchased this chair.  Delivery in the same week and no damage to the transport chair.&lt;br /&gt;No assembly to speak of, just the arms and that was no problem.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and appears to be very durable.  Very comfortable seat and the back is high enough for back support.&lt;br /&gt;The leg rests have a few positions for elevation.  Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wheel around, small enough to get through our interior doors, yet wide enough for comfort.</li>
    <li> I bought it for when I need operations. I read reviews saying it&#x27;s light. But it&#x27;s not to me. It is strong, quality, has all the bells and whistles a chair can offer. But it feels one the heavy, to medium heavy side. I weighed it on the bathroom scale and it weight 35 pounds without the arm rests and without the feet supports. With everything on it, it weighed 45 pounds. But, all the chairs I saw that claim to be light are only about 1 or more pounds lighter than this. So, the slightly extra weight is worth it to me. I wish they made a less heavy duty lighter version of this chair for the same price, that would be perfect.</li>
    <li> As I commented before on my other post I do love the wheelchair I just received....I do want to add if you are looking for a wheelchair for a long term use this may not be the best purchase. As the wheels on this wheelchair are not as sturdy as other wheelchairs I have come across.</li>
    <li> Good looking chair.  However it&#x27;s bigger and much heavier than I expected.  Was going to return it, but UPS was going to charge $80.00 for a $124.00 chair.  I&#x27;ll keep it and sell or donate it.  Will pay more attention to weight and size next time.</li>
    <li> This chair meets all my requirements.  It is fairly lightweight to it is transportable which is definitely one of my needs.</li>
    <li> So well constructed. Really great price compared to ones I looked at in stores locally where I live.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Sturdy, easy to assemble, easy to fold and transport.  Great quality for the price.  Would recommend to anyone needing a wheelchair.</li>
    <li> This is a great light weight chair.  I purchased it for my 92 year old mother and she is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a nice chair, well built, sturdy. I could have used the one that&#x27;s a little wider but I didn&#x27;t want to admit my butt was that big. If it had  struts, spiny wheels and a V8 it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Purchased the chair for my mom. Please be aware the chair has a 250 lb weight limit. Not an issue for us but I must have missed that when I ordered it. Could be an issue for some. The chair came almost fully assembled. Took out of box and it unfolds ready for use. Nice looking with cool speckled silver and black metal finish. Looks snazzy. The leg assembly pieces fit in two locations on each side of the chair and snap into place fairly easy. Adjustability of the angle and length of the leg rests is fairly quick and easy by pushing in a couple of spring loaded pins on the legs and moving up or down to the desired length. I folded the chair and attempted to put in the trunk of my car but it wouldn&#x27;t fit with the leg assemblies attached. Took them off and fit no problem. Got to our location. Took chair out of trunk, snapped on the leg rests and me and mom were ready to go. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It has detachable armrests, not swing-away, but they come off without a lot of hassle. The leg rests are standard and elevate (a great feature), and it rolls smooth. Measure your doorways first, make sure you are small enough for an 18 inch width chair, and it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
    <li> Second one purchased. Light and easy to get it on and out of a vehicle. Wife likes to use this one when we travel as well as her scooter. Great value and great quality.</li>
    <li> The legs are a little shorter than I would have liked. The knees are bent  and not as comfortable for the patient.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality, price and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this wheel chair because I have Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy and can not walk farther than 20 feet without assistance due to extreme pain. I am out of work and have no health insurance. Now that I have purchased this sturdy low cost wheel chair, I am able to be more active with my family. The elevating leg rests are great for when my legs are swollen and pain prevents me from having them in a downward fixed position. It is also very convient that I can wheel myself or have my son push me around which he seems to enjoy. I may need to eventually upgrade the tires for a smoother ride but would recommend thid wheelchair and the company.</li>
    <li> This chair fits our needs exactly.  I take the arms off to make transfer easier.  I needed it desperately and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it arrived.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husband, very comfortable for him. He is not a very big man and this holds up to 225 I think. It is very sturdy material, and the finish is nice. Pushes easy and comes with a tool to tighten the bolts. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used the chair three times and the right arm rest fabric pulled out of the plastic and the foam rubber came out</li>
    <li> W/heelchair very heavy.  Hard to lift and put in the trunk of my car!  It is very nice, but just too heavy for convenience.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed and has been a huge help. I had no idea I could own one of this quality for such a low price. It&#x27;s a best buy for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty snazzy for the price! Honestly, I saw a lot of used ones on Craigslist, that weren&#x27;t this nice, and people asking $100 for them. So for $25 more I liked being able to buy this brand new one and have it delivered right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a super cool basic wheelchair that actually FOLDS to fit into an ordinary car. I bought it for my 94 yr old mother because she can only walk a few feet before she gets tired and needs to sit down. This makes for a very slow trip and frankly makes it kind of a chore to take her with us. Plus it&#x27;s frustrating for her because she likes to get moving! So THIS is going to make it so we can take her out for a jog or a shopping trip whenever we get the notion, and not just to Target so she can drive one of those handicap carts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a used electrical wheelchair which she is learning how to drive and which also claims it &amp;#34;folds up&amp;#34; to transport, but let me tell you, it&#x27;s so heavy I had to build a ramp just to get it into the car, and then, since it&#x27;s NOT disassembled/folded in order to drive it up the ramp, I then have to drive my car with the hatch window open and gas fumes all around. Choke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress. Let me just say that THIS manually operated wheelchair is the best idea yet for going places with a 94 year old. Even if you already have a motorized one. OH and I chose the one with big wheels on the back (aka &amp;#34;self-transport&amp;#34; not just plain ol&#x27; &amp;#34;transport&amp;#34;) so she can scoot herself around a little on her own once we get to our destination. She&#x27;s kind of feisty so I knew she would not like to always have to wait for a push.</li>
    <li> I am so glad we got this chair. It works wonderful for us. Not to big or small. Thank you so much. We would rate this chair a 5. the highest we could rate it.</li>
    <li> This chair does everything it is supposed to, and at the right price! It was delivered VERY quickly. This was one of those purchases where I really feel like I got a lot for my money!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re 6&#x27; tall like I am, the foot rest will be at the back of your knees, at least they were removable.. This is a tiny chair, ruined any sort of comfort I could have had with my broken leg. A terrible product, the back ripped after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I like it because it  fits in my daughter&#x27;s car trucnk and appears easy for her to handle.  I have no more words.  It appears to be a too product.</li>
    <li> light weight and great price</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for a good price.  However, If you are over 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; tall, it may be a bit small for you.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great price ~ chair a lil squeaky . But over all a great buy!</li>
    <li> Very good wheelchair, reasonably light and easy to unload and set up.  The only negative was the rather strong, unpleasant smell from the fabric in the seat, two weeks after trying methods of deodorizing there is still a slight smell.</li>
    <li> Very good.  This product is better than I expected.</li>
    <li> We got more for our money when purchasing this item , it&#x27;s heavy duty yet still easy to lift in to the car. I would highly recommend this chair, simply for the fact it&#x27;s the same chair you can rent from a medical facility.</li>
    <li> After months of research I chose this item and I&#x27;m happy I did.. It&#x27;s light weight, easy to handle and fit into my budget! This wheelchair is my back up ride and I&#x27;m confident thus far that it will serve it&#x27;s purpose. No problem with this item and if you especially need self transport or just a quick ride out to the store with family, neighbor or friend... this chair will do the job! I suggest you label the legs Right (R), Left (L) so it will be easier to attach when in use.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly and exactly as advertised!!</li>
    <li> I measured my doorways before ordering it and it fit perfectly. Its just what my dad needed. Its a little smaller than the &amp;#34;Average&amp;#34; chair but its totally what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> This chair has a fine build quality, but it was not a good purchase for me.  I weigh 200 lbs.  I believe the description rated the chair to 250 lbs.  I am not comfortable in such a small chair, and the cost to return is so high that I&#x27;m stuck trying to sell it on craigslist new in the box.  I would recommend to a child or small adult, but it was not for me.</li>
    <li> This product arrived super fast! It is good quality, heavy duty, easy rolling, easy to get in and out of. I was more than pleased.Wish I didn&#x27;t need it but glad it exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Fractured my leg just before holidays and was frantic. The chair was crucial for me and more than I hoped for. It arrived quickly and the new smell does go away in a day or two. Only complaint was a few of the leg extensions needed some tinkering and a few nuts need some retightening. I have really given this chair a work out. You should remember it can tip forward if you are trying to lean way out to retrieve something heavy.</li>
    <li> sturdy and dependable. It worked great to push around my injured mother.  Maneuvers well both inside the house and outside.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Item exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am awful when it comes to judging size (my furniture is way to big for my living room) so I was very pleased to see this fit perfectly through the halls and doorways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seat is a little higher than I expected which is great cause the chair is for some one that is tall and needs a higher seat yet, it still fits under the dining room table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable/elevating leg rests snapped easily into place.</li>
    <li> Suited my needs for a temporary condition. The only downfall was the tires left black marks on my kitchen floor other than that it&#x27;s a nice valued item.</li>
    <li> Great Service, way faster than I expected Wife loves it I think after she gives birth we will still use this chair.... Especially after a good nite on the town&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish we had bought it sooner Thanks to ALL who made it and brought it to my Wife. Very happy indeed</li>
    <li> It is a little heavier than it was advertised. It also had a strange smell on it. Other than that it was fine.</li>
    <li> Durable and easy to maneuver, very good price.</li>
    <li> A good stroller. I am happy with its build. No assembly required. East manuevering. Wish there was a brake on the handle, so that the person who is pushing it could apply a brake to slow it down instead of pulling it.</li>
    <li> This manual wheelchair is a fabulous value for the price.  I used it all week while on vacation.  My only disappointment is that the chair does not come equipped with a seatbelt.</li>
    <li> This chair is exactly as described.  It arrived very quickly and was easy to assemble.  The arm rests remove easily which is a must for me to transfer.  The elevating legs are very comfortable.  The price was a big factor when I bought the chair, I looked at bunches on ebay that were used and cost much more.  I did not expect this chair to be sturdy and so good looking.  Imagine my surprise when I received a chair that is not only put together well, is functional and looks good for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable chair that has all the options necessary for some people. Detachable and swing away legs and removable arms. The chair is small, made for a small adult, but durable. The service was Excellant. This really helped us out.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for an unbelievable price.  This seller promised delivery in 7 days and I got it in 2 days.  The chair is fabulous.  I am a large woman and it is very spacious and comfortable.  It glides so easy.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love this, a bit short when you lift the leg rests but for the price and quick delivery it&#x27;s awsom</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with this product. It works well for my mother-in-laws needs. We would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It folds, it came with all the parts. It&#x27;s a little heavy when put together. It&#x27;s slim, it fit right in the closet. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. A better quality chair than I expected. Rivals the typical hospital, nursing home, doctor&#x27;s office wheel chairs for quality and appearance</li>
    <li> well my Mom needed a chair for quite awhile and we were renting it for about $60. a month so when the Dr said she would be in it for almost a year anyway i found this and decide to buy it to save money in the long run. there were many chairs on the site at many diff prices but this was almost exactly like the 1 she was using and had the leg rests as well. which she needs. at a much more reasonable price than some others i saw. Very Happy with this purchase and would recommend if you need to purchase.</li>
    <li> Its perfect, fixs in the back seat or in the truck of my car. Works well.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair is very well made and comes fully assembled (except for easily adding the leg rests). Very nice appearance, comfortable seat, seems like it&#x27;s made to last for years...and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommend this wheelchair!</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price</li>
    <li> Sturdy. No complaint from user yet. Looks nice.</li>
    <li> Little hard to adjust the legs, but otherwise really nice quality</li>
    <li> Great Wheelchair at an Amazing Price!</li>
    <li> My sister had foot surgery today and she has to keep her foot elevated for a couple of weeks.  I placed my order for this chair on Sunday, July 6th, and it just arrived today, Wednesday, July 9th, and after a July 4th weekend!  (One day earlier than the earliest projected delivery time!)  Both my sister and I are very impressed with the quality for the price.  I took it through her house on a test drive, and yes, it fit through even her narrowest doorways!  Mine arrived in perfect condition and it was simple to attach the elevated legs which are boxed separately.  The manual explains how to attach them, and we didn&#x27;t need to use any tools, though they package one in case you need to adjust.  The foot rest swings out of the way if the person is wearing a big boot.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, it does have that service station tire smell, but that will eventually wear off.  I weigh 150 pounds and had about 2 1/2 inches to spare in the seated area.</li>
    <li> Our only problem, the leg extensions need another hole to extend. They were just a little short.</li>
    <li> We have had this chair for two weeks and the wheel is already broken.  We called customer service about a replacement and was told that there is NO time frame in which someone will get back with us as they are busy.  I don&#x27;t understand how you can sell things to those that are handicap and then not have any idea of when they will be fixed.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great wheelchair for a great price! My grandpa thanks you! He keeps this one in the trunk of his car for when he&#x27;s out and about, and his old wheelchair he uses in his house. Great idea to save him some trouble! Looks and works great!</li>
    <li> I fractured my pelvis and  need to get around occasionally, but crutches are not always  the answer. This wheelchair has been a boon! It&#x27;s comfortable for the short term, and very easy to wheel myself. It folds easily to go into the back of my SUV.  While this might not suit a long-term wheelchair person, it will do for my 12 weeks. The quality is outstanding for the money. If you need a wheelchair for a short term, this is excellent.</li>
    <li> What can I say? When you have a broken ankle and waiting for surgery and for post-op this beats my computer chair hands-up for getting around! This has been the best investment for the price this year. The chair shipped fast, was easy to put together, and great size for getting around in my apartment. It also folds with no hassles for getting into the car! Now that I&#x27;m using the chair less &amp; less, it also makes a great cat bed!</li>
    <li> I was quoted $225 for a USED wheelchair for my dad so I decided to try this new one out.  Wow! I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality, value and how quickly it arrived.  It&#x27;s as heavy as you&#x27;d expect a sturdy wheelchair to be so if you&#x27;re looking for something you can swing into and out of a car with ease, this probably isn&#x27;t the chair for you. It can be done but it is a bit awkward. Other reviewers complained about the tires but it hasn&#x27;t left any marks around our house on either carpet, tile or wood.  I suspect that this issue has already been addressed by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> A wonderful chario9t for my sister!</li>
    <li> I can say with confidence this is the best chair for the money. The seat and back are heavy fabric, rather than the standard vinyl seen in hospital wheelchairs which doesn&#x27;t breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is slightly smaller than the average wheelchair, which makes it great for navigating around the house and through standard size doors, yet it is comfortable for a 200# adult. A wider chair may be needed if you weigh more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no odd odors or tire tracks as noted in prior reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very satisfied with this purchase. Shipping was prompt and item was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The best $114 I&#x27;ve ever spent. Much better than crutches after my surgery. Great quality &amp; the arm/foot rests are easily removable.</li>
    <li> Bad SMELL from rubber tires!!! Horible, 3 weeks and still smells! Poor quality tires, chair ok, low end, get what u pay for!</li>
    <li> Excellent in all aspects.</li>
    <li> WAS MUCH BETTER QUALITY THAN I HAD EXPECTED. THIS WAS A GOOD BUY.</li>
    <li> This is better than our 1st wheel chair. Detachable Desk Armrests allow you to pull right up to the table so there is less chance of dropping or spilling food on your lap.  But the seat is not plastic so it is harder to clean up accidents.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this chair and the company will work with you! Great Company and Great Chair!</li>
    <li> Excellent stable chair</li>
    <li> For the price, which included free shipping, this was a good buy. It is very functional and has more than met our expectations for the price.  We&#x27;ve only had it about a month but no problems at all as of yet. Only criticism is that it is a bit heavier than we&#x27;d like in terms of lifting in/out of vehicles when we travel.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!  I have nothing but positive comments about this product.  The chair is well made, comfortable, and easy to use.  After having borrowed a wheelchair temporarily for my mom, I can say this chair was better in all aspects and I am sure it was also  much more affordable.  We bought it originally to be able to access soccer fields, museums, malls, etc.,  more easily and now that she has fractured her femur,  I am even happier with our purchase.  Do not hesitate!</li>
    <li> I love this chair.  It is big enough for my rather large buttock !  LOL  I especially like the \\&quot;leg rest\\&quot; on the foot assembly, it is so comfortable.  It wheels very easy [ hubby appreciates that] and love the fancy aluminum...looks like royalty. The price was great too.  AND it arrived very promptly, thank you seller.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the order and i like the chair and i will order again and again and that is all.</li>
    <li> Love my chair.  It took no time to fine my way around the house and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule and is a wonderful chair for the price. Works for us. Composite rubber wheels do have a chemical odor at first, but this does seem to go away. Overall, an excellent value, and it would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I use it in my home.  I am very satisfied with the chair.</li>
    <li> She is quite happy with this gift and can get around easily with this sturdy yet lightweight unit. No assembly was required &amp; was ready for use in minutes. Yea!</li>
    <li> This also was a great product. Someone put it together for me so I don&#x27;t know  about that. For the price it is a must. To have it at the end of the day was great. It moves all over the house and is really comfortable. I never took it out of the house so I don&#x27;t know how it works outside. Everyone who came to visit sat in it. Cease truly comfortable. Now I don&#x27;t need it and folded it up and put in garage</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. Comes already assembled in the box.</li>
    <li> Excellent wheelchair, a little heave but reasonable to good quality materials.</li>
    <li> Excellent chair for the price. We use the chair as a transport only not daily use. Light weight makes it easy to use. Folds very easy.</li>
    <li> Its heavy and awkward to move into a vehicle but it functions fine.You get what you pay for with this.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research and selected this model, partly because of the elevating leg rests.  It turns out that we leave them off while in the house because they just make turning in tight spaces more difficult.  This wheelchair has worked very well for us.  It folds up easily and fits well in the back of my SUV when we need to travel.  The brakes, a very important item, work well, even on our steep driveway.  We did detect an odor that is probably the rubber wheels and that caused us to leave the chair out of the bedroom at night, but that odor seems to have gone away now, three weeks after receiving it.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
    <li> Product is good except for the fact that the wheels do not roll smoothly. We have a home that is completely tiled with no carpet and yet my husband finds it a little difficult to wheel around the house. I should have paid attention to the previous reviews but I was very hopeful. Overall it is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Good operating equipment, and easy assembly.</li>

    <li> Thank you. My mother loves it. It&#x27;s very comfortable for her.. We&#x27;ll get our useage out of this for sure.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive durable chair!</li>
    <li> This is a great chair and a great bargain.  Does NOT smell as others have said and it rides smooth and easy.  PERFECT...</li>
    <li> This chair has a chemical smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of.  It is still sitting outside because when I had it in the house after I had aired it out in the sun, in the fresh air, plus washed it down it has not gone away.  Also the leg rests stick out too far, you cannot bend them down straight if you need to.  Next time I will try out a chair.  This was a waste of money.  I called the company and they didn&#x27;t offer any solutions.  Other than that the chair is functional, moved well and was easy to push myself in.  I only needed it occasionally so chose a less expensive model but I just can&#x27;t take the smell.  Even if I put it in the garage (and this has been at least six months) it emits a chemical smell.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Everything is good, it&#x27;s felt durable. But the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, very strong new plastic material smell.</li>
    <li> Great value.  They wanted over $300 for this same chair at my local hospital supply place.  It is very sturdy and high enough to seat my 6 foot tall husband comfortably.  It is a sturdy chair but not so heavy it can&#x27;t be lifted to put in the trunk.  It folds easily and can be stored in a closet when not in use.  I highly recommend this chair to anyone in need of a wheel chair for more than one month.  At $75/mo. to rent it was a no brainer to just buy the chair and store for future use.  If you don&#x27;t have space to store it you can always donate it to a local elder care facility and still save money left over a 2 month rental.  It weighs about 25 lbs folded up without foot rests attached and 32 lbs. with the foot rests attached.</li>
    <li> I like the wheelchair it is easy to move around in and go place with it I no problem with it.</li>
    <li> I developed metatarsaglia in my right foot and have severe tendinosis in my left ankle and bad knees, hips, etc., so, was really unable to walk without being in excruciating pain. This wheelchair arrived quickly, was very simple to assemble, is light weight, sturdy and works perfectly. My foot healed so I&#x27;m not currently using it, but it allowed me to get from the front of the house to the back rooms. I did sometimes have trouble getting up and over the doorway ridges but quickly figured out a sort of trick to doing it. My hands would sometimes get dirty from wheeling and the solution to that is to wash them. I never used it outside so can&#x27;t comment on that but see no reason why it wouldn&#x27;t work just fine outdoors, too. If you&#x27;re planning to use this as your regular chair or at least plan to use it for long periods of time, I would suggest getting a seat cushion of some sort. I really don&#x27;t understand why other companies are charging such ridiculously high prices for other chairs which have no features beyond the ones this one do.</li>
    <li> good  and easy to handle and transport by car</li>
    <li> Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> The wheelchair is great but it has a terrible smell to it. Don&#x27;t know how to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I broke my leg so I will be using this chair for almost 3 months. The leg lift is a blessing to keep leg elevated and it is very easy to adjust the height. My husband folds the chair to place in the trunk of the car and says its not so difficult. The tires have a slight \\&quot;new tire\\&quot; smell, but it is going away. This is a sturdy wheelchair.</li>
    <li> I was tired of always using the doctors&#x27; or hospital&#x27;s wheelchair so I bought this. It is of very good quality and definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This I bought it for my mother and she is really comfortable in using this.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to assemble and also to roll.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for my Mom in everywhere during our travel.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It works good. it is just a little heavy when you pick it up to put in trunk. That could be because i am weak. easy to open and close</li>
    <li> Invacare makes this wheel chair and the quality is tops and performance is great plus the price is unbeatable on Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I chose this one because of the features and am glad I did. It is well built and sturdy and is perfect.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wheelchair for my Mother, and she is very happy with it. She did say that there was some kind of issue with one of the footrests. I will check that out when I see her again.</li>
    <li> After doing extensive &#x27;wheelchair&#x27; research when I decided to purchase this for my WIFE her own wheelchair, I decided on this one because of the features and the price. I wanted very good quality as well as elevating leg rests. I placed my order FEBRUARY 21, 2013 and the chair was delivered FEBRUARY 25, 2013 THAT WAS WOW...The chair is practically ready to use right out of the shipping carton. I only had to add the elevating leg rests which are great! The chair is definitely a higher quality than the one supplied by the nursing home. I&#x27;m still amazed at the incredibly low price and blown away by the speedy service! If this chair has the features and size you&#x27;re looking for, go for it! You definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> works well and was already assembled--very content</li>
    <li> The chair is a reasonable price.  It arrived quickly.  It appears fairly comfortable and it is not too heavy for me to sling into my trunk.&lt;br /&gt;What I do not like:  The footrests do not fold back easily and allow locking of the chair in place at the same time.  You have to work it, and then they remain in the way.  It is faster to take them off, which is a pain.  It is another step that I do not need.  Also, after a few uses, it began to make a creaking noise, the cause of which I have been unable to determine.  My mother is short, so this might not be a problem for others, but I found the arm rests too high for her.  A $100 cushion resolved this.  A more expensive chair might have been a better choice for me.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I was surprised at the cost at such a low price compared to local stores.</li>
    <li> Clunky and hard to store.</li>
    <li> needed it for a few days, worked awesome although i wish the legs extended further out. i am 5 foot 7 and it might be good for someone a couple inches less than me, bigger than that i would say its a bit tight.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad.  It is wonderful!!  Great price. And easy set up.My Mom loves it too because she can now wisk Dad down the hall to the bathroom, instead of trying to get him there on time with a walker, which was becomung more difficult every day.</li>
    <li> This is a very good wheelchair. I purchased it recently for my mom who lives in a nursing home. It is very convenient and easy to use but the strong reservation is for tall people. She is 6 feet and around 170 pounds. It is more than sufficient for her weight, but the leg supports are nowhere near long enough for her long legs. When she is seated, even with the leg supports adjusted to their longest length, her knees are still bent up at an uncomfortable angle in order to fit into the footrests. The wheelchair description did not give this particular detail. We have solved this problem by removing the leg supports while she is at the table, but be aware of this before you buy!</li>
    <li> Very good for home use. It is easily manageable. It can be folded and put aside. Very good design which helps the patients.</li>
    <li> Nice chair, but heavy to lift.</li>
    <li> I bought this wheelchair for my husband who is recuperating from major surgery.  Like other reviewers, I considered renting but the cost to rent seemed high.  It is incredible to me that it is possible to buy a folding wheelchair for this price ($126).  When it arrived, all I had to do was take it out of the box, remove some of the plastic protective wrap, and pull it open.  Being only 27\\&quot; wide, it fits through every interior doorway in our house except 1.  I walked around the house with a tape measure fixed at 27\\&quot; to see for myself before purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is 6&#x27;3\\&quot; 225 lbs.  He uses the seat cushion (purchased separately) to raise the seat a bit for his relatively long legs.  With the leg rests on, his legs will be bent a little more than is comfortable.  But for light use (going to appointments, sitting on porch, sitting at kitchen table), this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you thought you could not afford a sturdy, high-quality wheelchair, think again.  Thank goodness for (a) price competition across Amazon products &amp; the internet, and (b) the thoughtful reviewers who posted such helpful reviews of this item.  Thanks to them, quality health aids like this are within reach of many people.  At first, my husband &amp; I thought we&#x27;d get by without a wheel chair during his recovery.  He quickly learned that without it he has a more difficult time getting to the kitchen table for meals (hard to pull regular chair up to table), and has to constantly scout out a comfortable sturdy place to sit when moving between rooms or to the porch.  This way, he can take a comfortable chair with him wherever he goes.</li>
    <li> I am so unhappy with Amazon.  It arrived on time.  HOWEVER, If it is the wrong item it really doesn&#x27;t when it arrives!!!  I needed a wheelchair I could move by myself, NOT ONE THAT HAD TO BE PUSHED BY SOMEONE ELSE.  Amazon seems to have dropped the ball when it comes to private providers.  They don&#x27;t seem to screen the merchants very well.</li>
    <li> I got this wheel chair so I could take my Mom to her doctors appts . The wheel chair is perfect size  and well made . I don&#x27;t have to search for a wheelchair  at hosp or drs appts and its easy for me to get in and out of car</li>
    <li> This does everything I need. Great price, prompt delivery as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable. I haven&#x27;t had my foot surgery yet, but I&#x27;ve practiced going thru the rooms.Who wants to &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; one; but if you do, then get this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this for transporting my handicapped wife when taking her in the car because her electric wheelchair is not transportable in my current automobile. This was a quality made wheelchair because it is an Invacare Wheelchair. It is made of superior material and nothing about it is of poor quality. It is a little heavy to load in the trunk of my car but it is manageable.</li>
    <li> Great transport chair, more than I thought I would get, you should advertise the arms as being reversable as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;desk&amp;#34;  I almost didn&#x27;t buy it cause I thought I wanted a full arm rest but these can be turned backward and become full or desk.  Best price I have found anywhere!</li>
    <li> Chair was perfect for my daughter that was in a motorcycle accident and could not bend her leg.  Just a little narrower than the one she rented so fit through doorways better.  Worked out fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Very versatile and well built!</li>
    <li> A little bulky on the loading into back of car however, it&#x27;s doing what it was intended for and that was for my 90-year old mother to make it easier to take her places.</li>
    <li> I recently fell and broke my left leg - hence this wheelchair was an unspoken &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34;!  The low price and fine product that this is served its use very well!  Is comfortable and very easy to roll.  The price for this chair is incredibly less than renting a chair!!!</li>
    <li> it is exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Unit seems quite sturdy Easy to put on foot supports. Moved easily thru the Mall the first time out.</li>
    <li> It helped alot thank you all for helping me get what I needed</li>
    <li> Great chair for little money. Very happy with chair and service. Thank you</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. No problems, and easy to self propel. I weigh 230 lbs and I&#x27;m 58 years old. As a woman, I was concerned about self propelling my own weight. Low cost was an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> The wheekvhair is too heavy and the foot rest does not need to tilted forward.  I also think the shin guards are mot necessary</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it is a little heavy but the best value for your money.  Bought this for my dad and no regrets. It is comfortable and leg rests attach easily. Fits great in the back of my Escape.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it is a little heavy but the best value for your money. Bought this for my dad and no regrets. It is comfortable and leg rests attach easily</li>
    <li> This wheel chair was well worth the money.  Heavy duty but easy to use.  The legs came off easy.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the $$. Well built and sturdy. Easy to maneuver. Mostly use this for transporting to/from home. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing chair, especially for such an affordable price.  The shipping was phenomenal and I love that the wc is light weight enough that I can still maneuver it by myself when I&#x27;m in it, yet amazing versatility.  I don&#x27;t have to use it full time, so I can&#x27;t rate that part, but for part time use I&#x27;m very glad that I got this one.  The leg rests adjusted to the perfect height and I&#x27;m really short, so we didn&#x27;t think they would work for me.  It fits in the backseat of the Saturn too, which is a major bonus.  I am really pleased with this product and the vendor.</li>
    <li> This chair was perfect  for our vacation.  My father  in law used it every day and was  able to get  around easily and pushing him  was not chore  at all.  It folded easily and fit into the mini van easily.  A little heavy but  that is necessary to hold up to 250 pounds.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old son blew his leg up pretty bad playing sports.  After some pretty radical surgery we were advised that he could be wheelchair bound (needed leg elevated also) for up to 3 months.  Rather than pay the HIGH monthly rental fees we decided to purchase.  This reasonably priced/feature rich chair seemed the perfect solution.  Ordering went well and it arrived quickly.  The external shipping box was damaged but the contents were fine (did a thorough inspection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is a large boy (5&#x27;11\\&quot; and 195 pounds) but that is within advertised specifications.  Within the first day of use one of the rear (large) wheel spokes popped/cracked/broke.  Within 3 days the seams on the upper rear back cushion (where it goes around the upright bars) was pulling apart.  I called Invacare (manufacturer) and opened a quality report.  They advised me to take pictures and contact the selling party (Amazon).  I contacted Amazon and was able to return the unit for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in the quality of the product but the ordering/return/refund process through Amazon could not have gone better.  The product gets two stars but Amazon gets five stars.</li>
    <li> I looked at wheelchairs at stores....and they were all three hundred and up, mostly UP...and I found this deal on Amazon and I love it. Easy to use and for the money I highly recommend this chair.</li>
    <li> The box was damaged which bent one of the parts on the wheelchair.  We were able to bend it back.  The right side brake doesn&#x27;t hold very tight, but was doable.  The right side armrest kept popping off, so we have to put some locktite on it to keep it secure.  Otherwise it was comfortable and worked well.</li>
    <li> I needed a wheelchair for a few months in my house.  I looked into renting but after only 2 months, I would have paid more than the price of the chair.  The chair is amazing, well built, strong.  What I like the most about it, I purchased the one with the removable arms, which makes it so easy to slide in and out.  I also chose the legs holders and it works great.</li>
    <li> We had some hick up in the delivery but the customer support was very cooperative and good. We have to carry the chair on the beach in the sand area, else it&#x27;s pretty sturdy on flat surface. Good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> No fuss easy to use wheelchair. Came all assembled and all it needed was installation of foot rest and that works as plug and play. Easy to carry and fits in my Toyota Avalon&#x27;s trunk. The odor of tire was not that horrible and after a day, It was all gone.</li>
    <li> Loved the chair until the backing and the seat began to start tearing. Had it less than year before it tore and replacement parts cost almost as much as the chair itself. Very sad.</li>
    <li> This was fantastic value for money, worked very well and looked nice too. It made my husband&#x27;s (and my) life much easier at home for 8 weeks while he was recovering from a broken foot.&lt;br /&gt;The chair was delivered in a large box, all I had to do was pull it out and open the chair out. The footrests were very easy to put on and take off. The brakes worked well and it moved around with ease. You could transport this in a vehicle but it would be a bit heavy for one person to manage - especially if you are the one that needs to use the chair.</li>
    <li> fast and nice. easy to asemble</li>
    <li> Great price,good construction,and quality,fits through small doors,super quick delivery. I would definately reccommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Well constructed. Easy to operate by yourself, there are two brakes (one brake each side, at the front of wheel). Can&#x27;t go wrong with this price.</li>
    <li> for the price this is a excellent wheelchair. comparable to the more expensive wheelchairs sold in medical/pharmacies stores. Easy to move around in and is comfortable. Bought a seat cushion to prevent bed sores from forming. The price is worth it.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair meets all my needs and so easy to use. I am a small person and it fits well. My husband said it was very easy to put foot rests on and off when  taking apart to store and putting together to use.</li>
    <li> Came  2 days after I ordered it. It&#x27;s light weight. Love the fact that it has knee support. Would recommend to a anyone that needs a wheelchair.</li>
    <li> The wheel chair worked just fine, met all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great chair for the price. Arrived a lot sooner than expected. I only wish the seat was a little wider. But other than that its a great quality chair.</li>
    <li> Marvelous!!! Superb quality made by Invacare.</li>
    <li> This is a great wheelchair. The quality and price were excellent. Narrow enough to fit thru doorways inside the house. Shipping and packaging were also top quality.</li>
    <li> Nice chair. Right Price.</li>
    <li> This chair has been the best investment for taking care of a family member.  It is a excellent working chair and folds to put in trunk of car while transporting..  Comfortable for user...</li>
    <li> This is a very good buy for the money. It folds easily and is quite maneuverable.  It is easy to add, remove and adjust the leg rests. Itis pretty light weight and can fit on the back seat or trunk of a medium sized car when folded.  I would have given it four and a half stars instead of four.  The half star I would take off is for the chair&#x27;s propensity to make horrible (but easily removable) black scuff marks on vinyl floors.  Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Nice quality too!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&amp;#34;s very easy to handle and fits very well through the doorways. It is not too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair was functional but had a smell of the resin or plastic cover that was too strong. Was a little too heavy for our needs and had to return.</li>
    <li> We were pleasantly surprised that this was such a high quality chair.  Way above our expectations.  Highly recommend this company for your wheelchair needs.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! Good quality, well made. Would have given it five stars but was a bit disappointed it did not have a seat belt otherwise very good value for money!</li>
    <li> It comes assembled except for the leg rests, which just snap in.  My dad got accustomed to it&lt;br /&gt;it about an hour.  It does have a strong new smell out of the box.  I was warned before.  I used&lt;br /&gt;Fabreze right away and that took care of it.  Strong merchandise for such a great price.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair was purchased for my mother and it has proved invaluable.  The only difficult part of the chair is getting the leg extensions on and off.</li>
    <li> Needed the leg rests and swing-away after achilles surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must nicer than the rental we had for the first month.</li>
    <li> I received the producted on 6th from Fedex.  The product was damaged and the carton was tore up.  The top had been riipped off and holes all over it.  I contacted the shipper on monday the 9th and what a mess.  I had to return the whole thing back to Oh where the mfg is.  I took the box to the Fedex store and they refused it.  So had to take the box back home call Fedex for a pick up.  I had a return label.  They could not pick it up the same day so was picked up on the 10th.  When I contacted the shipper was told that i could not get a replacement until the mfg had received the wheelchair back.  I have a broken foot and needed it bad and asap.  Had I known what I know now I would not have used 1800wheelchair I would have went direct to Invacare, or bought it at a medical shop.</li>
    <li> I had rented a chair for $50 a month after a foot surgery.  Unfortunately, complications developed and I needed a w/c for 5 months.  So I didn&#x27;t want to keep renting.  So I searched around and found this reasonably priced chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro&#x27;s:  slightly padded seat and back rest, the legs rise on the chair perfect for icing my leg/foot while sitting. Tires are standard size, the leg rest has a calf and foot rest and the leg rest can be removed, it has break away arms so I can actually eat at the dining room table with family.  The price, this chair was $200 dollars less expensive than the medical supply chair I was quoted.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:  while this is a pro, it was a con for me.  It appears this chair has 2 height positions.  It came in the higher level, which is normal height for most.  But I am short and only my toes touched the ground while sitting.  So I had to schoot up in my seat a bit to reach the floor, when I reached the point I could use my feet to walk/sit myself around the kitchen when I needed to use my hand to prepare food etc.  I did not have someone to help me lower the chair which involves taking off the large wheels and putting in the next hole down.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 5 star for general quality for the price point, more comfy seat then the rental, and this chairs leg risers went up, down and off if needed.  Fits all stages of disability.</li>
    <li> Love wheel chair highly satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product and sold at very reasonable  price. I would have given this product 5 stars if wheel rims were made fo steel. Over all  build quality is good. I am only afraid of wheel rims breaking over period of time because they are made of&lt;br /&gt;plastic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver around the house.  We enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my dad and he was 250 lbs and this wheelchair was perfect...Very nice chair</li>
    <li> Easy to fold up &amp; store, worked great in stores etc.</li>
    <li> Purchased one and found it perfect for home and traveling.  Loaned it to other family members and decided to buy another one  This is the second&lt;br /&gt;and of course I am pleased with it and recommend it to any and all who need to have a comfortable, solid wheel chair that fold easily and fits in&lt;br /&gt;the trunk of one&#x27;s auto..</li>
    <li> works great...bought for mother-in-law</li>
    <li> Great value, good quality.</li>
    <li> My wife had major foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. To rent one was 42.00 a week. She would need this for 2 1/2 - 3 months. Add that up. For far less that the rental I purchased this wheelchair. It&#x27;s unbelievable the features it has for the price I paid. I LOVE IT. Good design, solid, well built. Yet light enough for me to handle and store it.&lt;br /&gt; It has many adjustments for comfort and for medical need.  Has a foot rest, a leg rest, both are adjustable and included.&lt;br /&gt;Folds down easily to put in the back of my Ford Escape. Easy to maneuver even in tight areas and my wife says it&#x27;s comfortable. I have taken her to the show where she has sat for up to 2 1/2 hours with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe that I bought a Great QUALITY item for such an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Great product</li>
    <li> A good quality chair that helps me get around better and makes life a little more bearable and easier to enjoy.</li>
    <li> great chair for the price...im 5&#x27;9 145lbs &amp; chair is very comfortable, I have ms &amp; its perfect for me to use when traveling</li>
    <li> Great sturdy product for good price.  But, There is an obnoxious smell pouring off the thing.  Like new vinyl but far worse.  It stunk up the whole house.  It&#x27;s now stored in garage.  After two weeks the smell is still horrific.  I would have expected it to out gas by now.</li>
    <li> Great Price and good product..!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This an okay wheel chair, But the brakes are very bad and you have to keep tightening them, they keep coming loose.</li>
    <li> The price of the wheelchair was affordable but I had an issue with the odor and the weight. I think the rubber wheels produced the bad odor. I let it out to for two weeks to get rid off the odor but did not go away.  Also, It was to heavy to lift to place it in the trunk of the car.  I&#x27;m a petty woman and it was difficult to carry it.  Otherwise, the price was great.  I returned the item without a charge and the credit was applied after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I searched for a wheelchair that would handle what we needed for someone who is 280 lbs., but is 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and very wide in the hips. This was featured as being able to handle 300 lbs., but the seat is only 18&amp;#34; wide!!!! That would be a 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; stick-thin basketball player. When I contacted customer service, I was told that that was what I had ordered, so....basically...you get what you ordered. The shipping charges to us were free, but we&#x27;d have to pay for return shipping which could be close to the cost of the wheelchair!!! We&#x27;d rather donate this to a local charity and will NEVER use this company again because of their &amp;#34;you ordered it...it&#x27;s your fault&amp;#34; attitude!!! This is not a shirt that we didn&#x27;t like...these are desperately needed items for disabled customers. This company should work with their clients to make things right!!! That was definitely not our experience with this company!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great wheelchair. The large wheels make it easier to push and go further faster with less effort. Nice appearance, sturdy and easily maneuvered,  comfortable seating. The very impressive silver appearance contrasts nicely with the black seat and back. The seller (1800 Wheelchair) was super helpful. Upon being notified that I received the wrong footrests she assured me that I would receive the correct foot rests within 48 hours, which I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any marks left by the wheels on our white carpet.  I suspect this is because we only use it in the house. I guess if you use it outside the wheels will get dirty and transfer the marks to your carpet.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;CAVEAT: While this wheelchair glides smoothly and easily over hardwood, tile, etc. or any smooth hard surface it requires considerable force to move it on carpet, especially deep or plush carpet.</li>
    <li> My mother loves it. Can handle it very well. Nice n light weight for easy car transport. Comfortable and Roomy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom, and she loves it.  This is very comfortable, sturdy and manueverable.  Love the swing away foot rests, they make entering and exiting the chair easy.</li>
    <li> Chair is well made but heavy if you need to lift it in and out of a vehicle. Disassembly and reassembly is a must as well as a nuisance. Biggest detraction is that the wheel rubber stinks ! Highly objectionable smell takes a lot of time to dissapate, if not disappear. Tried various products to mask or remove odor, none worked.  Would not like to sit next to someone in this chair  in a restaurant as it would ruin my appetite.</li>
    <li> Great chair for the value.</li>
    <li> did not purchase chair for myself</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my new wheelchair.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Rubber wheels do smell.  Remined us of Christmas&#x27; past..., sort of.&lt;br /&gt;Came well protected inside their mailing box.  Maneuvers easily.  Fits through all our doorways easily.  I found the seat comfortable, so I didn&#x27;t need to use the memory foam cushion I&#x27;d bought.&lt;br /&gt;The leg pieces come off easily when not needed/storing.  At my 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; height, the foot rest when using my protected boot, wasn&#x27;t long enough for resting my foot so having the back piece for ones calf was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It has an adjustable height, but I need it set for the hemi (shortest) height.  If we&#x27;d raised it up, I might not have that issue with the foot rest?  Would like to suggest to the company they make the leg rests adjustable to accommodate the two chair heights.&lt;br /&gt;The removable arm rests are helpful for transferring oneself to sitting in car, on the toilet, into bed, etc.  Didn&#x27;t always need to remove an arm to do those things though.&lt;br /&gt;Folded up easily enough.  Lifting it into a SUV for transport can be weighty, gives one a good workout.  Has a pocket on the backrest.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought an additional item, a wheelchair armrest tray, it comes in handy for holding small things one needs.</li>
    <li> Great value wheelchair.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for me and my dad. I liked the fact that you could very easily take off the legs and it was not too heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact and light for what it is. For the price I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Mom likes it too.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair is too heavy to be transported, the position of the feet does not allow flexibility and makes it difficult the movement in smaller environments or with many people</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t used this much yet, but so far it seems like a very good value for the price that we paid. It rolls really smoothly and easily. It was very easy to assemble, folds up very easily to transport.</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughter. Needed something smaller than motorized wheelchair</li>
    <li> great purchase, meets my needs, was exactly as described. quality was excellent.. i was surprised at the great quality for the price. would gladley recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality chair at a great price. Very quick delivery and arrived in great condition!  I would  recommend this chair to anyone in need of one!</li>
    <li> This is a nice wheel chair. Works great! Folds easily and good enough to place it in back of my Chevy Traverse. I place it behind third row. I have three kids also so I can&#x27;t fold the third row. This wheel chair was bought for my dad and sits comfortably folded behind the third row.</li>
    <li> The ítem is very good, but I had to pay more tan the double price to clear it in Trinidad and Tobago and it was a big delay with it, so it make no sense to by with Amazon because once the items arrive to Trinidad they charge a lot of money for it.Unfurtunately I paid my unexperience......</li>
    <li> This item was received in only two days, much sooner than estimated.  It was just as described with the adjustable elevating leg and foot rests.  The only thing I had to do was take it out of the box and snap (no tools needed) the foot rests on.  It was all I had wanted.</li>
    <li> We like it very much, it works great for my wife who has cancer, and so she can&#x27;t walk a lot and needs to have her legs elevated.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you! And if we need anything else we will definitely look to you&#x27;re site.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle and very helpful in moving around</li>
    <li> The chair works great but we still can&#x27;t  get the strong plastic smell off the chair.  It was hard to breath near it the first month we had it.</li>
    <li> The chair Is fine but it didn&#x27;t include a cushion.</li>
    <li> Chair was too small for the average adult.</li>
    <li> The chair was promptly delivered and was easy to set up.  It appears to be well-constructed.  The rubber tires did emit a bad odor for a few days, but the odor has dissipated.  I recommend this wheelchair.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble. Works great. Was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair itself is great and fits my needs. However, when it came out of the box it had a smell that I cannot tolerate and causes respiratory problems. What causes the smell? Is it some kind of preservative?  I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell in the house and had to put it outside where it has been ever since. Thank goodness I only need to use it when I need to walk a long distance. It has been outside for a few days and I have not checked to see if the smell is gone yet but hope it will be when the time comes to use it. Can someone tell me what makes it smell so bad?  I would NEVER purchase a product from the store if it smelled like this because I cannot tolerate the smell.  When it comes in a box or ordered online there is no preview of how it smells. So I have to give a lower rating even though the physical wheelchair is fine.</li>
    <li> We bought this wheel Chair and expected it to be just OK for the price .  But we were really impressed with the quality and comfort this chair has .  Can&#x27;t believe it cost so little as compared to other brands . This is a great buy and would give it six stars if I could .</li>
    <li> Very good and steady. Good value!</li>
    <li> Good chair for the money.</li>
    <li> After having an accident that hurt both of my feet, I had to be in a wheelchair for at least 3 weeks.  I have 3 small children at home and my husband has to work.  We rented a chair for 1 week, but found it cheaper to buy this one for the remainder of the time.  This chair is so much better than the rental.  I sit higher,  it&#x27;s more comfortable and more compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company was so helpful!!  They got the chair to me much faster than the estimate, just in time for me to turn in the rental. I can&#x27;t thank them enough.  And would recommend this chair to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> BEST VALUE AROUND.  QUALITY IS WONDERFUL.  YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET BUYING THIS.  DID LOTS OF SHOPPING AROUND.  THIS BY FAR, IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!  ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS.</li>
    <li> Cons:  Very heavy to get in/out of car  Wish the legs extended further to hold leg without bending at knee  When not in raised position, wish legs folded closer to the chair.    Pros:  Beats a walker  Didn&#x27;t leave black marks on wood floors or carpet</li>
    <li> To heavy ...didn&#x27;t think it was that heavy when I got it ..if u r not going to have to people to pick it up and put in a truck up choice to get but I wouldn&#x27;t regret not getting something lighter</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy for use.</li>
    <li> great chair, very fast delivery, works as expected</li>
    <li> Worked out great and got here on time. thanks</li>
    <li> We ordered this for my husband&#x27;s grandmother. We were worried that his grandfather would not be able to lift it in and out of the car but that was not the case. It is lightweight and easy to use. She has been able to go places she hasn&#x27;t been able to go to in yeas. She feels like she has a little bit of her life back.</li>
    <li> It works so well with my grandmothers legs. I am very very pleased it was purchased. The seat is comfortable, and the arm rests not having leather arms are much nicer then the plastic leather ones.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair is very comfortable.  I like the adjustable leg rests.  They help when my legs need to be elevated.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to assemble and folding/unfolding.  The chair easily fits into my car trunk.  It&#x27;s easy to navigate whether someone else pushes it, or by wheeling it myself.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a comfortable wheelchair.  I&#x27;m not a very heavy woman, so I fit in the chair with no problems.  The wheelchair arrived quickly which I really loved.  I can&#x27;t think of any cons to this wheelchair.</li>
    <li> I was in a bad motorcycle accident where a car tboned my motorcycle splitting my bike in half and leaving my right leg shattered and split open in many places. The wheel chair was awesome for the 80$ I paid for it, definitely good quality and it was actually pretty stylish and comfortable compared to most.</li>
    <li> This wheelcahir is wonderful . It came assembled and easy. The leg attachments I have to have help putting on. But it folds wonderfully without them. The chair material is sturdy. The price is great compared to all the other fold up wheelchair providers. I really love this chair..It says it will hold 250 Lbs , but I weight 115lbs. and I can&#x27;t imagine a person twice my size fittling comfortablly in it..</li>
    <li> Great transport chair. Easy to use and fold. Makes life easier for my Mom and me. Not too heavy. Fits in the trunk of most vehicles.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for a friend who had suffered a stroke, and had obtained  one from a goodwill store that was pieced together.</li>
    <li> The owner whom I ordered this hasn&#x27;t complained about the chair, means it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought this wheel chair for my Father-in-law who is blind. I did online research before buying this wheelchair. This wheelchair is just perfect for him. It is very well manufactured with leg rest and foot rest. He feels very comfortable and secure in this wheelchair.</li>
    <li> We purchased this chair for my husband who is in a chair all day. The workers at the memory care unit find this very easy to use with him. I added &amp;#34;Drive Medical Molded General Use 1 3/4&amp;#34; Wheelchair Seat Cushion&amp;#34; for his comfort. The chair itself rolls very smoothly and all of the functions are very user friendly. Assembly was simple and the chair folds up nicely.</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to control. Very comfortable and just the right height for me.</li>
    <li> Have purchased from this company a wheelchair before, so after reviewing wheelchairs online, back to this company we went! The other chair we gave to my Mother and she now can do and go many places she was unable to go before. Will order my next chair from them also. This chair is heavier due to the leg lifts which is needed because of a crushed leg and lymphatic issues.  Easy to push my children said and happy about that! This is a great chair!</li>
    <li> The wheelchair was for my wife. She suffers from Lupus and there are times that her joints ache quite a bit. The wheelchair is comfortable and very light.</li>
    <li> Works great for my 94 year old Dad.  Rolls nicely up to the table for him to eat</li>
    <li> Very good chair.had some trouble taking off foot rest but overall was satisfied</li>
    <li> My husband ordered it &amp; uses it when he goes to church.It is a little heavy, but we usually have someone to help lift it in or out of the car. He likes the freedom it gives him.</li>
    <li> Works well. Lightweight.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> My sister loves the wheelchair. It&#x27;s easy for me to carry up and down the stairs for her.</li>
    <li> chair is so much lighter and easier to maneuver  around house</li>
    <li> I had ankle surgery and needed a wheelchair that I could use in the house or when I go out for doctor&#x27;s visits.  This one fits just great.  I&#x27;m a small woman (less than 5 foot tall) and this chair is a great size for me.  Would probably be too small for a 6 foot tall man.  The only negative is that it smelled very rubbery once out of the package.  We left it in the garage for a week when we first got it and most of the smell has leached out.</li>
    <li> The wheelchair served the purpose for which I needed it.  I am not wheelchair-bound.  I was having some foot surgery, so I needed something safe to get around with rather than hopping around on one foot and perhaps falling.  I only used it for a short time, but I have it if I need it in the future.  I would recommend it to anyone who might need a wheelchair.</li>
    <li> needed wheelchair with raised leg attachment, this quality product fit the bill. Very well made at an economical price. great purchase and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One never really wants to buy a wheelchair, but when your husband breaks his leg and you want to go places, this chair is a great inexpensive option.  The elevating foot rests are easily removable and easy to put back on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a wheelchair sporadically for the last five years. I was surprised at the wheelchair from Prestige. When I tried to lock and unlock the wheels I was hurt by a sharp edge to the bottom of the plastic handle on the mechanism. The sharp edges gouged my hands whenever locking or unlocking the chair. Totally unnecessary. A bad design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also took an unnecessary amount of force to move the handle. It was at least three times as stiff as the handle on my previous chair. I wish I could still use my old chair, I&#x27;d send this one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t someone at the factory (perhaps even a handicapped person, think of that) ever try out the chair?</li>
    <li> The chair is nice and working well.</li>
    <li> This is the best value for the money.</li>
    <li> Looks good rides good built well I like it so far</li>
    <li> very good a wheelchair and great customer service</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and well made.  Needed some time in the sun to dissipate the smell of the tires, but otherwise a fine product.  Fits through ordinary doorways.  Footrests easy to remove, adjustable.</li>
    <li> Seems to be slightly better made than the medicaid cheapo chair (also Invacare). Doesnt roll as easily, but its fine for the money.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t been tried yet but hope it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> My 95-year-old mom can go places with me now, instead of sitting in the car waiting.  The chair is comfortable and easy to use.  Mom can even &amp;#34;walk&amp;#34; the chair with her feet if she wants to get closer to something when I am shopping nearby.  Because it is such a sturdy wheelchair, it is very heavy to load into the back of my stationwagon; my ONLY complaint. Mom isn&#x27;t very large, but the wide seat leaves room for her pocketbook to safely snuggle next to her: a concern for many elderly women.  I would certainly recommend it for large women and men, as well.</li>
    <li> I do love this product. This product filled my needs without disappointment. I needed to have my leg elevated, and this chair was supportive of this need. I have been using this for a few weeks, and it has been a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy for me to wheel about the house.  I did not need this for an extended time, but for a short term use, it was a great product at a price less than going the rental route.</li>
