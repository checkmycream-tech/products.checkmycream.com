      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Works good for my husband</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my breath smelling funky for a good while after the mint is already dissolved.</li>
      <li>ON THE TOP OF A SKI-SLOPE!  </li>
      <li>Good product, better than popping an icebreaker</li>
      <li>These mints come in handy on those moments when you just don&#x27;t have time to brush your teeth after lunch or dinner.</li>
      <li>Most effective mints I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>

      <li>I enjoyed this mint and I would recommend to all.</li>
      <li>I am a repeat customer a couple times over and more to come</li>
      <li>It was a good product and really works!</li>
      <li>It tastes good, and the zinc really helps to treat and prevent mouth odor.  </li>
      <li>Mint isn&#x27;t too strong and it does make the breath smell like strong mint.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i ate them additively like ten a day just because it tasted good and felt nice to have something in my mouth</li>
      <li>I am enjoying these products very much.</li>
      <li>I feel a clean sensation in my mouth every time I have a mint in my mouth</li>
      <li>how can it be good for your long term pleasure?</li>
      <li>but it is very much worth it.</li>
      <li>They do the job and they are worth the money.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy with the results.</li>
      <li>$10.00 for mints may seem high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>since these are hard to find in stores it has been nice to find on amazon.</li>
      <li>But I do encourage the smokers to use, because I am sure it will really kill all that bad odor coming from the mouth :)</li>
      <li>Make your mouth feel clean , unlike some other mints out there that leave an aftertaste ....</li>
      <li>these mints work well for dry mouth better than other solutions I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Go get it and feel like you do have naturally fresh-smelling breath.  Not masked ones.</li>
      <li>THIS LINE (BREATH RX) REALLY WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN &amp;#34;REGULAR&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>A nice, casual mint to have when there is a moment to just consciously inhale and exhale.</li>
      <li>WHEN YOU HAVE AN AFTER LUNCH MEETING WITH A GENERAL WHO MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT !)  </li>
      <li>others are just filled with artificial flavor and too much sugar!</li>

<li> The box is shamefully misleading; looks like you&#x27;re getting twice as many as you actually are, but once you get past that bit of blatant deception, the mints themselves really do the job.</li>
<li> Really nice, unfortunately cannot buy them anymore!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a sugar free product and really refresh the mouth, neutralizes odor and prevent bad breath.</li>
<li> These mints, especially if used with the BreathRX mouth wash have been the only thing that ever worked, but getting harder to find now since Walgreens quit carrying these products</li>
<li> These are a little more expensive but you&#x27;re buying quality mints that actually work.</li>
<li> I was hoping this would last for a few hours but it lasts for about 15 minutes...</li>
<li> Little expensive but worth it...</li>
<li> Very curious to find out why these were discontinued.</li>
<li> now they are no longer available, makes me suspicious there is something bad in them</li>
<li> They are not your average over the counter mints....</li>
<li> Felt like little gum angels in your mouth.</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s really minty, my mouth feel bad when it is</li>
<li> THAT GARLIC-BREATH, OR NORMAL UNPLEASANT MOUTH ODOR ,THESE PRODUCTS HAVE AN INGREDIENT</li>
<li> its addictive and expensive</li>
<li> Not sure why this was taken off store shelves and then discontinued on BreathRX&#x27;s official website?!</li>
<li> AND I ALWAYS SMELLED GARLIC &amp;#34;UNDERNEATH &amp;#34; THE TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH &amp;#34;MINTY&amp;#34;  SMELL,( NOT GOOD</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s just average considering the price.  </li>
<li> BREATH MINTS-INSTEAD OF MERELY &amp;#34;COVERING UP&amp;#34;</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too expensive -</li>
<li> AND UNFORTUNATELY WE LIKE</li>
<li> This product is expensive, so the carefree attitude of sharing and/or offering this mint during a conversation, might not take place.  </li>
<li> HIS BREATH IS LIKE A BLAST OF COLD WINTER AIR</li>
<li> I have been plagued with bad breath all my life and have tried every from chewing Clorettes gum to scrubbing my tongue with toothbrush.</li>
<li> Works well to get rid of bad breath.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a bad odor in my mouth like the smokers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was hoping this would last for a few hours but it lasts for about 15 minutes...this isn&#x27;t helpful if you have bb problems or halitosis. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for a lengthy bb cover up.</li>
    <li> Most effective mints I&#x27;ve ever found. The box is shamefully misleading; looks like you&#x27;re getting twice as many as you actually are, but once you get past that bit of blatant deception, the mints themselves really do the job.</li>
    <li> It kills odor. I don&#x27;t have a bad odor in my mouth like the smokers. Because it&#x27;s really minty, my mouth feel bad when it is in.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am not ordering it again.  But I do encourage the smokers to use, because I am sure it will really kill all that bad odor coming from the mouth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are very tasty and make my breath smell fresh and clean no matter if I ate garlic or onions.</li>
    <li> tasty and delicious&lt;br /&gt;i ate them additively like ten a day just because it tasted good and felt nice to have something in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;and now they are no longer available, makes me suspicious there is something bad in them&lt;br /&gt;if its addictive and expensive how can it be good for your long term pleasure?</li>
    <li> Ever had people sucking on so-called breath mints in front of you and you can smell the masking of their breath with it?  Well, I am happy to tell you that the BreathRx sugar-free mints don&#x27;t do that at all.  It&#x27;s the real deal!  Go get it and feel like you do have naturally fresh-smelling breath.  Not masked ones.</li>
    <li> Really nice, unfortunately cannot buy them anymore!</li>
    <li> Mint isn&#x27;t too strong and it does make the breath smell like strong mint. Good product, better than popping an icebreaker</li>
    <li> This product is expensive, so the carefree attitude of sharing and/or offering this mint during a conversation, might not take place.  A nice, casual mint to have when there is a moment to just consciously inhale and exhale.</li>
    <li> I like these mints a lot</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this mint and I would recommend to all. Works well to get rid of bad breath. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> $10.00 for mints may seem high. And it is.  They work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sugar free product and really refresh the mouth, neutralizes odor and prevent bad breath. I&#x27;m very satisfy with the results.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it&#x27;s too expensive - which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Felt like little gum angels in your mouth.</li>
    <li> These mints do work for dragon breath, which I have.  You do need to eat one every hour or so to continue it&#x27;s effect but it is very much worth it.</li>
    <li> Works good for my husband</li>
    <li> I am enjoying these products very much. I recently purchased these mints along with the mouthwash and I will continue to do so. I feel a clean sensation in my mouth every time I have a mint in my mouth and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my breath smelling funky for a good while after the mint is already dissolved. I always carry these with me. I don&#x27;t leave the house without them. They&#x27;re like my security blanket. I just wish they would sell a bigger packet of them.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works terrific if used with the entire line of products in unison.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s just average considering the price.  If it was cheaper, I may get it more often.</li>
    <li> These mints come in handy on those moments when you just don&#x27;t have time to brush your teeth after lunch or dinner. They do the job and they are worth the money.</li>

    <li> Sugar-free and not harmful to teeth or body.&lt;br /&gt;I an never w/o this product.  My friends appreciate&lt;br /&gt;it when I offer one to them after one of our luncheons.</li>
    <li> Little expensive but worth it... Make your mouth feel clean , unlike some other mints out there that leave an aftertaste ....</li>
    <li> these mints work well for dry mouth better than other solutions I have tried.  since these are hard to find in stores it has been nice to find on amazon. I am a repeat customer a couple times over and more to come</li>
    <li> Great flavor. Good price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It tastes good, and the zinc really helps to treat and prevent mouth odor.  When in close quarters, I pop one of these, and always carry them in my pocket.  Do not leave home without these.  A little pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Not sure why this was taken off store shelves and then discontinued on BreathRX&#x27;s official website?! It was a good product and really works! They are not your average over the counter mints.... others are just filled with artificial flavor and too much sugar! These are a little more expensive but you&#x27;re buying quality mints that actually work. Very curious to find out why these were discontinued.</li>
    <li> THIS LINE (BREATH RX) REALLY WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN &amp;#34;REGULAR&amp;#34; BREATH MINTS-INSTEAD OF MERELY &amp;#34;COVERING UP&amp;#34; THAT GARLIC-BREATH, OR NORMAL UNPLEASANT MOUTH ODOR ,THESE PRODUCTS HAVE AN INGREDIENT THAT ACTUALLY NEUTRILIZES ODORS.  MY AIR FORCE OFFICER HUSBAND OFTEN COMES HOME FOR LUNCH AND UNFORTUNATELY WE LIKE (I&#x27;M CUBAN AND MEXICAN,HE&#x27;S IRISH) GARLICKY/SPICY FOOD-HE&#x27;S ALWAYS BRUSHED HIS TEETH ( AND FLOSSED ) AFTER LUNCH(BEFORE GOING BACK TO WORK)  AND I ALWAYS SMELLED GARLIC &amp;#34;UNDERNEATH &amp;#34; THE TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH &amp;#34;MINTY&amp;#34;  SMELL,( NOT GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE AN AFTER LUNCH MEETING WITH A GENERAL WHO MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT !)  AFTER WORRYING OVER THIS (GUYS DON&#x27;T) I DECIDED TO GET THE BREATHRX LINE (TOOTHPASTE, MOUTHWASH, MINTS) AND NO MATTER WHAT MY HONEY&#x27;S EATEN (MEXICAN FOOD, SHRIMP SCAMPI!) HIS BREATH IS LIKE A BLAST OF COLD WINTER AIR ON THE TOP OF A SKI-SLOPE!  REALLY!</li>
