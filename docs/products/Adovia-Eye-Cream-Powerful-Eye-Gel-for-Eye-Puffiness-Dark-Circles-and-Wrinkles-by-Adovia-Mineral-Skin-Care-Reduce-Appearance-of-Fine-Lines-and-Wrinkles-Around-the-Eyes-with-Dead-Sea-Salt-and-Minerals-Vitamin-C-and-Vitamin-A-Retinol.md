<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really good stuff people and I am psyched!!  Here was the problem PRE-product. I&#x27;m hitting 40 this year and have noticed with decreasing confidence wrinkles and sags every time I look in the mirror. Enough so that I hardly want to look in the mirror - it&#x27;s depressing. Especially my face. What astonishes me is that these changes happened slowly right before my very eyes and I didn&#x27;t take it seriously until the wrinkles, puffiness, and dark circles around my eyes became a permanent fixture. I had given up on trying new eye products that I find in the drugstore. They&#x27;re all the same - full of chemicals, ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce, empty promises, and way too high prices for this girl.  On the other hand, I try to use only all natural products on my face and I have had difficulty finding all natural eye products that actually work.  Soooooo I was skeptical at best when I had the opportunity to purchase this product but I am willing to try anything that might help. The product comes in a cute little container with a silver top that looks like it belongs on my vanity with other silver that I have on it. It is not a thick cream and is more like a lightweight cream/gel. Totally non-greasy. Unscented (yay!). I put a tiny amount on the pad of my ring finger and gently tapped the product gently around my eyes. The first thing I noticed was that it was very cooling and made me feel (anyway) that my eyes were being soothed. I felt very encouraged albeit still skeptical. I mean, it&#x27;s great that it felt good on the first application but for lasting results? The product still needed to prove itself to me.  Only 6 days later, the results are already noticeable! I&#x27;m seeing significantly less puffiness and I look less like a racoon. Also the redness around and even in my eyes has disappeared. I feel better about looking in the mirror - the eyes are the windows of the soul! I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily in the mornings before I put on makeup and at night before I go tobed. I haven&#x27;t once used concealer since I began using it and only lightly apply loose powder to my eye area. No more thick concealers that actually make my eyes look older. Also, I had my eyebrows waxed (she left me with more skin and less brow!  haha) and I used the cream to soothe the skin around the waxing. Instantly cooling, no stinging, and blended the old skin above the eyes and new skin under the eyebrows which also drastically reduced the racoon look.  This is the second eye product I have purchased from Adovia and I am IMPRESSED to say the least. At around 20 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it. This is a product that I will reorder and reorder. My plan is to hit 40 looking radiant and confident. This product is totally, 100% helping me on my way!!  Recommend 200%!!!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Burns my eyes even when I only use a small amount.</li>
    <li> After using this product for over a month now, I notice that the dark circles underneath my eyes have diminished.  I normally apply this during the morning and night.  A little dab goes a long way with enough coverage for underneath my eyes.  There&#x27;s a slight watering of my eyes after I apply this, but it goes away in a handful of seconds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about two weeks, but have already noticed a fair decrease in dark circles under my eyes. I have very pale skin so those circles are a challenge. The other eye cream I was using seems to have been discontinued, and while I wasn&#x27;t so sure about a gel (doesn&#x27;t feel quite as luxurious going on) it is still nice and doesn&#x27;t get sticky. Dries quickly enough that I don&#x27;t find myself waiting around before applying mineral makeup. The container is also a good size and will probably last at least two months with twice daily application.</li>
    <li> This is a knock out, win/win product.  Goes on cool, is great under make-up and without a doubt does the job.  This is a purchase I will buy over and over again.  I am very sensitive around the eyes....not a single problem!</li>
    <li> Tis stuff is thick and my eyes always seem to look like they had cream under them. Used the entire bottle and noticed no difference in my dark circles. As for the crows feet, the cream seems to accentuate them, not smooth them out. Why would I buy a cream that makes me look older? I switched back to my Clarins and within two weeks, no more dark circles. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> We are returned customers. Amazing eye cream,  it really works!! The redness and puffness improved. We use it twice daily-am,pm. Excellent customer service experience with this company,  very happy. Will do business with them again and again.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on the skin, but only upon receiving it, did I learn it does contact parabens which I avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only on day two so I can not comment on eye area improvement.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of adovia products, and this product delivers no less. I love the smell and over time my dark circles have improved.</li>
    <li> As much as I want to love this product, I can&#x27;t use it because it burns my eyeballs!  It&#x27;s like someone poured onion juice into my eyes when I use it.  I don&#x27;t even put it on my upper eye lids or anywhere near my lower eye lids.  The texture is wonderful and I really want to keep using it, but every time I try, it is painful.  Not worth it.  Wish I had read the negative reviews before purchasing!</li>
    <li> I loooove this super moisturizing!</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used it, it made my eyes sting a bit. But after that it was fine, and after about two weeks I noticed that my dark under-eye circles had actually lightened noticeably. I have been using it regularly and really like the consistency. Just a little disappointed that with all the great natural ingredients it also lists parabens. Would likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Because I am a mom to an infant AND a toddler I always get horrible dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there to prevent it (or at the very least lessen it), but I&#x27;ve not had much luck. With some products the darkness doesn&#x27;t even fade. With others I notice fading but then all of a sudden those dark circles are right back where they started. When I had the opportunity to try Adovia I jumped on it…and I am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar it comes in is amazing. It&#x27;s small, cute, and convenient. If you travel a lot it can easily be tossed into a small toiletry bag without taking up much room at all. The smell is great… it is sort of a weak smell, not as strong as most other eye creams so I love being able to put it on first thing in the morning or right before bed without having to deal with a weird and strong scent. I really like the texture as well. Even though it is listed as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; instead of a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s not gooey like most gels would be. It just feels like lotion (but a lot less messy than lotion is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From what I have read Adovia is supposed to help fade wrinkles. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days so I haven&#x27;t had much experience with that aspect of it just yet but I believe it! My skin where this eye gel goes is so much softer than the rest of my face, and that is only after a few days of using it! It has definitely lightened my dark circles too. I&#x27;m pretty sure this product is a keeper for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This review is 100% that of my own opinion, and it has not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached pictures that speak for themselves, but this is great eye cream. Feels light, refreshing, absorbs well, not greasy. A little goes a long way, I expect it will last me at least a month and I use it every morning. Definitely a new part of my morning regimen</li>
    <li> WOW!!! It&#x27;s been only a week and I can&#x27;t believe the results. My  wrinkles are fading away and my eyes look so refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I think it is helping.</li>
    <li> has a gentle and cool feel to it when applied.  I get white spots around my lower eye lid areas.  I was told that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m allergic to the eye cream..  However, regardless what I use, I get them.  So, I can&#x27;t say that it is because of the Adovia Eye Cream.  It could be something else entirely.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works well. No harsh perfumes in this product. I would re-order this item again.</li>
    <li> I have been useing this product for weeks now and no sign of improvement.</li>
    <li> great product, very satisfied.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the Adovia skin care line.  It works well on my dry skin and I&#x27;ve noticed many improvements in my skins texture and the refreshed feeling it leaves.  The Dead Sea Salt products are perfect for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Adovia is perhaps one of my most favorite product lines thus far. In the past when I’ve tried their products I’ve always been impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time is no exception.  The Adovia Eye Cream applies easily with just your finger and leaves no greasy feel.  It absorbs nicely into your skin without irritation and works quickly.  And better yet, they use lots of herbal ingredients and are gluten free!</li>
    <li> I got this to try. As you all know by know I love the Adovia skin care line so when I got the chance to try out the eye cream I jumped on it.  I get the dark circles so badly I sometimes look like I have a black eye.  This cream really did help with my dark circles.  It did leave a little bit of a film so I used this one at night time.  I could feel it cooling in just a few seconds after I put it on.  I could tell a difference in just a few days of using it that my dark circles were getting lighter.  It was very easy to use and a very thin gel.  I just washed my face in the morning and the little film came right off and my eyes looked better every day.</li>
    <li> Adovia never disappoints me! Their mineral eye gel comes in a gorgeous frosted glass jar. You can tell it is a high quality product by the first application. It is not greasy at all. It feels great going on and I think it&#x27;s amazing that just a small bit of this product can provide results of brighter under-eyes!&lt;br /&gt;It takes just a few seconds to apply daily and I saw improvement in my insomnia-ridden dark circles. You should give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free to facilitate review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a super fan of Adovia products in the last few months. Every product is consistently amazing and I can honestly say that have made their way into my top skincare lines list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing how light this product is. Most tend to leave a residue behind which is one of my pet peeves.  Apply directly around the eye area and in moments it makes the skin soft and smooth, visibly diminishing the look of those annoying dark circles and smoothing out those tiny fine lines! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy and unscented, which I love, and it doesn&#x27;t require a massive amount of product... a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to the younger set, those of us who are just beginning to notice the signs of aging. Trust me... your eyes will thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> After only a week of trying this cream, the puffiness around my eyes is gone. The dark circles are lighter. I don&#x27;t really have fine lines or wrinkles, but I have noticed a difference in the way my eyes look. It only takes the smallest amount when you apply. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and completely without any sticky residue.I am excited to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I began using this product every day, right after the shower when the skin is the most absorbent. I used it for a week straight and didn&#x27;t  notice a  huge difference. So I flaked and didn&#x27;t use it for 2 or 3 days. When I looked in the mirror I saw dark circles under my eyes and a slight puffy bag. I mean really dark circles. I was surprised at what a difference it was in retrospect. So I can say with confidence this product does indeed minimize  dark circles under the eye. I started using the eye gel again immediately. I went through some of the ingredients and I&#x27;m really impressed with them. I like natural products so ingredients like rose hip oils, sweet almond oil, chamomile extract, aloe gel, and of course the dead sea salt really impress me. I also have sensitive skin so this product didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  Overall a good product, I would recommend. I did receive this product to review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review and I love it. I saw a definite difference in my puffiness and crow&#x27;s feet but I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my dark circles. But I really like this cream!</li>
    <li> After about 2 weeks, I can definitely see a different.  At first I was using Adovia’s Mineral Eye Gel at night.  It says once a day, and at night is when I use all of my anti-aging products so it made sense.  Honestly though, after the first week I began using it in the morning instead.  This eye gel definitely has a cumulative effect.  I see that the puffy purple mom-bags under my eyes are starting to lighten and I’m not having to put quite as much matte powder on the area to avoid shiny bags.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Adovia products, and this Eye Cream is definitely in my top favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from puffiness under my eyes, and the older I get, the more noticeable it is. To fight this, at night before I go to bed, I apply this to my lower eye area, and go to bed. Then in the morning I apply a little bit more before putting my makeup on. This trick has done wonders for me! I have noticed that since including this not only in my morning routine, but nightly as well, the puffiness has greatly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is very simple. On a clean face, I apply this in 3 small dots under my eyes where I get the puffiness. Then I gently dab it into my skin until it is all gone. It feels lovely on the skin, and has a very nice cooling sensation which I love.  So simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this, and I am giving it a full 5 star rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I think that Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is a great product! For one, it is helping me reduce the look of puffiness around the eyes. I don’t get much sleep so when I wake up in the morning I look like a puffy ball! My eyes look swollen. Using Adovia Mineral Eye Gel reduces the puffiness, and give me a cooling, refreshing effect around my eye area that I love. It’s like a spa day every day when I apply it on my eyes. I’ve tried so many products, and Adovia is the only one that works! Also, I don’t experience bumps around my eyes since it is all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Adovia Mineral Eye Gel if you are like me and experience puffiness under your eyes, have dark circles, or fine lines/wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received Adovia Mineral Eye Gel for reviewing purposes. However all the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eye gel and I am sure you will too. Paired with my other Adovia products my skin has been looking and feeling a lot better. I highly recommend the Adovia line. When I started using the Eye Gel about a week ago I had black circles and bags they are no longer there since using the eye gel especially with the rest of the Adovia products I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read my full review on my blog by following the link below&lt;br /&gt;http://acountrygirlcanreviews.blogspot.com/2014/07/adovia-eye-gel-review.html</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve never used an eye cream before, so when Adovia reached out to me requesting me to write a review on my website, I actually had to sit on that decision before accepting the product. But only for a day, because you see, I am the type of lady who cries when something upsets her, and the following day I had a very unfortunate situation that left me crying, which turns my eyes into the biggest puffs ever. So I figured, hey, if I can try this product to see if it helps tone down the puffiness, it&#x27;s going in my book of best products ever (*not a literal book.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I accepted, and let me just say, it is working. I rub a little on every day and last time I cried, the puffiness was minimal. My dark circles have started to fade, and my eyes don&#x27;t make my 23 year old self look 30+ anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely love it and will continue to use it. The jar lasts quite awhile, I&#x27;ve barely seen a dent. Great value!</li>
    <li> Used it for 3 weeks and nothing!!!!! Waste of $$$$$.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my arms :-)</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this mineral eye gel by Adovia.  I have to say I have tried many products so far from this company and have not been disappointed by the quality of products they put out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to their site it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Mineral Eye Gel - with Dead Sea Minerals, Vitamin C and Ginsent - 1 Ounce. Let your eyes shine again with their natural beauty - get rid of the wrinkles around your eyes and smooth out fine lines. The delicate skin around your eyes requires a special, gentler touch. Our unique, fragrance-free eye gel delivers rich moisture to the area around your eyes, and is gentle and soft at the same time. This sheer, light gel is infused with active minerals from the Dead Sea to soothe and protect the delicate eye area from dehydration and the signs of aging. Adovia&#x27;s unique eye gel is specially formulated for the delicate area around the eyes. This gentle, ultra-light gel absorbs quickly and keeps the eye area hydrated all day. Essential Dead Sea minerals and Evening Primrose Oil provide lasting moisture helping reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Chamomile and Sweet Almond extracts soothe and revitalize the skin leaving it radiant and smooth. Vitamins A and C work to protect the skin from daily damage.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mineral eye gel itself comes in minimal packaging but with the brand and title prominently displayed. The gel contains Dead Sea Minerals, Vitamin C and Ginsent which are all pretty good ingredients to pack into any eye cream.  The jar itself is certainly a generous size.  It&#x27;s not as small as some eye creams I&#x27;ve come across that don&#x27;t give you enough bang for you buck!  I find those gel eye very disappointing that promise you hope in a bottle that come in the size of a dime.  I think for the amount of money we spend on eye cream it should for sure last you more then just a month.  However the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this eye is that it comes in a jar.  Since this contains Vitamin C; Vitamin Cis an antioxidant which starts to break down when it hits air and light.  So in order to preserve the ingredients, it would be wise that the company get rid of manufacturing this cream in a jar form and transfer it over to a vacuum pump container which helps maintain the ingredients in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel is clear (whiteish) in color and has no smell to it which is a bonus when applying cream around the eye.  It absorbs very quickly into your skin which is awesome when you are rushing to get out the door or getting read for bed.  I hate putting on eye cream or any type of cream for that matter that requires time to dry especially at night.  You should be able to put your head down on a pillow shortly after applying this eye cream.  Adovia&#x27;s website says you can apply it in the mornings as well, but I would keep it to just nights.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to potentially have stinging eyes on my way to work.  Since this did sting my eyes a bit I would stay with using it as a night time routine or applying it VERY carefully in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  recently moved and did not have a lot of opportunity to use the eye gel mostly because I was too stressed out to remember, but I will give an account of my experience with it.  First, don&#x27;t apply too close to the eye.  It will end up seeping in at the corners and stinging your eye!  Always apply eye cream to the tops, sides and bottoms (your under eye area) of your orbital bone.  The closer you get to the inside of your eye the higher risk you run of irritation with ANY eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 34 years old, I do not have wrinkles around my eyes but I most certainly have to start using anti-wrinkle cream BEFORE the wrinkles appear!  While we all know that anti-aging, the concept is nonsense as nothing you will ever do will stop you from aging.  However we can slow down the signs of aging by using well formulated product that help to keep the skin looking young and supple.  It&#x27;s difficult to say in such a shortamount of time whether or not the product truly works but I plan on continuing to use it to combat any potential wrinkles.  I really liked this cream and found it useful for my eye area.  Eye wrinkles or not, it is well formulated and worth trying out!</li>
    <li> This gel has not helped me enough I wanted.. 😟</li>
    <li> Everyone knows the traditional remedy for puffy eyes in the morning is to leave a spoon in the freezer and set it against your eye in the morning. That is not only uncomfortable but it is not the best thing for your skin. Using this adovia cream is way more useful and actually reduces the prevalence over time of puffy eyes, even at height of allergy season. The areas of eye puffiness are just healthier and more resilient and are able to fend off the effects. Really pleased with the results on this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Adovia Eye Cream is a great eye care product.  I’ve had very sensitive eyes and skin around my eyes for over 25 years.  This is sensitivity to makeup, cleansers, and even airborne allergens.  Because of these allergies and asthma, I’ve had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Adovia Eye Cream a miracle product?  No, of course not!  Am I 10 years younger looking yet?  Nope, but I’m willing to keep using the product.  I am pleased with the product, so I’m sure that continued use the results will get better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My full review may be read at:  http://dealsfrommsdo.com/adovia-eye-cream-adovia-mineral-skin-care/</li>
    <li> I was intrigued to try Adovia Mineral Eye Gel. I have previously tried Adovia&#x27;s Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts at Home Microdermabrasion and really liked the product and what it did for my skin. Adovia says the benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;* Reduce Puffiness Under and Around The Eyes - Makes Eyes Appear Years Younger and Radiant!&lt;br /&gt;* Gets Rid of Dark Circles Under Eyes - Your Eyes Will Look More Youthful and Refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;* Formulated Specifically for The Gentle Area Around the Eyes - this Light Eye Gel Absorbs Quickly into Skin for  Deep Hydration.&lt;br /&gt;* Dead Sea Salt Delivers an Immediate Infusion of Dead Sea Minerals - Essential for Proper Skin Health and Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;* Contains Vitamin C which Delivers Powerful Antioxidants Deep Into Skin Cells.&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is thick so a little goes a long way. The gel is clear and absorbs into the skin quickly and smoothly. It pampers and rejuvenates the skin, leaving my eyes feeling hydrated and healthy. The Adovia eye gel did help to reduce the puffiness which is always a big help. As far as the dark circles go, it got rid of most of it but not all of it. The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is good for all skin types. It&#x27;s cruelty free and made with all natural ingredients. It&#x27;s reasonable priced compared to other similar products. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a product to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles. I&#x27;ll likely purchase it in the future but will continue to search for my \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; eye gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
    <li> Adovia Eye Cream is great for for Reducing Eye Puffiness, Dark Circles, Wrinkles and Fine Lines Around Eyes.  I got to test it out and I love it!  I always have dark circles under my eyes.  With the busy schedule I lead, there just never is enough time to fit in the hours of sleep that I should!  This eye cream works wonders though.  It is scent-free and nice and soft. It did not sting and I put it on.  Even though it is a bit pricey, you don&#x27;t have to use much in the small area under your eyes, so I can tell that this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Adovia Mineral Skincare products for quite awhile now and I have to admit that I really do love them. You will appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free so that it smells fresh and pure so if you have a sensitivity to scents, you won&#x27;t have to worry about that with this eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this light eye gel because it goes on so smoothly and quickly absorbs without making the area around my eyes look shiny or greasy. I have found that the Dead Sea Minerals in the Adovia Mineral Skincare products seem to work the best on my dry skin and it shows in how healthy and smooth my face and eyes are after using them for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply this Mineral Eye Gel twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You will love the cooling effect that this eye gel has on your eyes but to make it even better, I store mine in the fridge to help reduce the puffiness even faster. I learned that trick from listening to models and their makeup artists talking about how they use ice cold products to help them look better right before a shoot. It doesn&#x27;t last long, but if you have an important event or a photo you want to look your best at, then try using this trick to see some great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much to spread as it&#x27;s a very light and airy gel, so start off small until you get the hang of it. I would hate for you to waste any of the product and this way you can build it up until you see just how much you will need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want fresher, healthier looking eyes then this is the eye gel for you! While I don&#x27;t have dark circles yet, I hope by using this Mineral Eye Gel that that won&#x27;t be ever be a problem. But, for those of you who do, try this one out and see what happens. Because all of their other claims are true, I believe this will work on those also. I know a lot of my friends asked me if I had changed makeup or something since I looked more relaxed and less tired and I had to admit, it wasn&#x27;t the makeup, but the Mineral Eye Gel that made the difference in having a more radiant look.the Mineral Eye Gel that made the difference in having a more radiant look.</li>
    <li> This eye gel feels cooling, and I have noticed a reduction in puffiness.  I will say that consistent use is important when using a product of this type.  One cannot use it off and on and expect to get the desired results.  I do not have dark circles, so cannot attest to that but I do have puffiness. Puffiness can cast shadows that looks like dark circles, and so this is beneficial all the way around for me.  I feel adovia cares about their products and their clients, and I would recommend this to family/friends.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this company. I have most of their products and all of them are amazing! Plus they never test of animals which is a HUGE thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel works amazing, it is light and airy and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after applied. It works its way into the skin fast and really works at getting rid of my puffy eyes and dark circles. I use it every night as a part of my routine</li>
    <li> It is working for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a couple of days now, I get some serious bags under my eyes because I&#x27;m up late working on the computer and I have 3 young children. I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes since using the cream have started to diminish and my under eye area generally looks brighter. I will continue to use it and I&#x27;m hoping to have continued success. I was sent this product free in exchange for an honest/unbiased review, but this is something that I would purchase for myself or my mom because I have struggled with dark under eye circles my whole life.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review Adovia Mineral Eye Gel as part of a promotion from Tomoson.com . I have tried a couple eye creams before, most recently Olay Regenerist from Influenster and I was interested in seeing how well this one worked compared to the other eye creams. So I gave it a whirl. Here is what there packaging had to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Our Promise: Your Eyes will Look 10 Years Younger or Your Money Back! - Reduce Puffiness Under and Around The Eyes - Makes Eyes Appear Years Younger and Radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Gets Rid of Dark Circles Under Eyes - Your Eyes Will Look More Youthful and Refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Formulated Specifically for The Genltle Area Around the Eyes - this Light Eye Gel Absorbs Quickly into Skin for Deep Hydration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Dead Sea Salt Delivers an Immidiate Infusion of Dead Sea Minerals - Essential for Proper Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Contains Vitamin C which Delivers Powerful Antioxidants Deep Into Skin Cells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it work, but it worked wonders. I put the cream on in the evening and even though I wasn&#x27;t expecting any change the next morning, I saw a faint reduction in the puffiness and dark spots when I woke up. After 3 days of use, it reduced the circles under my eyes completely and I had zero puffy eyes! I honestly cannot say enough about this product. Even when applying the cream, it didn&#x27;t have a foul odor and it didn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or messy. I plan on sharing this product with my friends who are a little older than I am and could use the help in the under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> It has a nice light creamy texture to it and it absorbs quickly into your skin. The gel does not have any perfume smell to it and to me it is really  quite scent free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals, Vitamin C and Vitamin A Retinol which are amazing ingredients that help to reduce puffiness and dark circles under your eyes. It also includes Aloe Vera and Sweet Almond Oil to soothe and revitalize your skin. The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is for all skin types which is nice for anyone. Your area under the eyes is very delicate and this eye gel is so perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the Adovia Mineral Eye Gel for a few days I am already seeing a slight difference around my eye areas. My skin looks more refreshed and radiant. I&#x27;m going to continue using this eye gel and would recommend it for any beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I, myself, have a very big problem of those dark circles under my eyes, so I had very high hopes for this particular #adovia product.  Now my dark circles come from a variety of factors such as lack of a good nights sleep, stress as well as Anemia, so I may have set my hopes a little too high.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was expecting a miracle, and that after 1 application the dark circles would be gone.  That was not the case.  Although the product did make the dark circles less apparent, and I think that with continued use, there is a great chance that it will make those ugly dark circles disappear.&lt;br /&gt;But on the other hand, it did get rid of any puffiness I had in the mornings, and I do believe it makes my skin look younger and more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;And as any of the Adovia products, I would recommend them to my friends and family and anyone else who inquired.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all I am still extremely impressed with the results of the Adovia Mineral Eye Cream, and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from dark circles or puffiness around the eyes, and wants to have more youthful looking eyes. Just don&#x27;t be like me and expect the moon on the first application! Like any other skincare product, the key is having a routine and following it daily.</li>
    <li> The Adovia eye cream does smooth the under eye area and makes the skin softer. However, for me it doesn&#x27;t have enough moisture. I found my under eye area getting dry and had to use some moisturizer as well - which kind of defeats the purpose. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of dark circles, but mine aren&#x27;t that prominent anyway. I have not noticed any decrease in puffiness, which is a problem for me. All in all I would say it&#x27;s good, not great. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it may work very well for others.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Have used for three months -- dark circles have receeded, and puffiness has been reduced substantially.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second product from Adovia. They have amazing products and I&#x27;m just as happy with this one. Adovia Mineral Eye Gel makes your eyes look younger and healthier. It reduces puffiness, gets rid of dark circles under the eye, and is formulated for the gentle skin under and around the eye. It absorbs quickly into the skin for deep hydration. Dead Sea Salt delivers an infusion of Dead Sea Minerals which is essential for proper skin health and beauty. This product contains Vitamin C which is a powerful antioxidant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All you have to do is apply a small amount to the under eye area and around the eye and massage in until absorbed. Use it daily for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product since the middle of June and I am extremely impressed. The area under and around my eyes has gotten tighter and younger looking. My eyes always look like I got a great nights sleep even if I didn&#x27;t. Since using this product I no longer get redness or puffiness under the eye. I wear makeup very often and usually always wear browns/neutral colors, so my upper eye lid looked stained and looked like I always had eye shadow on when I didn&#x27;t. This product has erased that look and the stain look is no longer there. My dark circles under my eye are also gone.I also no longer have bags under my eyes since using this product. This product has no scent. It does not leave a greasy feeling after being applied and absorbed. It helps prevent daily damage to the skin.  I&#x27;m super happy with this product. I will continue to use and order this product. Everyone needs to try this product. This product gets 5/5 from a satisfied customer!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use too many products around my eyes, unless they are from a trusted brand and I do trust Adovia. I love all of their other products and have never had any kind of negative reaction. I thought this one might be good for the dark circles I sometimes get under my eyes. I wondered if it would work any better than others that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only have to use a tiny bit to apply under and around your eyes. I like that it&#x27;s not sticky, greasy, or too thick. It&#x27;s very easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I like how cool and refreshing it does feel when I apply it. It feels good in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product. I like that it can be worn under makeup or before bed. I like that it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes. I like the ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do my eyes look right now?&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t think that there is a super dramatic change but there is a noticeable difference. The bags and darkness are not as bad as they were before I started using this product. Even the fine lines on top of my lids don&#x27;t look as bad&lt;br /&gt;My eyes actually do look and feel more refreshed, even though I still don&#x27;t always get enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would completely erase the bags and lines but I also think that if I just sleep more, that might help a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, yes I recommend, especially if your bags or lines aren&#x27;t too extreme. And, maybe it will work for you if they are extreme. You really need to be consistent and use it on a daily basis for best results, or at least that&#x27;s what worked best for me to get the results I actually did get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester, I was sent a free jar to review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Honestly...I absolutely adore this eye gel. It claims to reduce puffiness - it does. It claims to minimize dark circles - it does. It claims to brighten the eye area - it really does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then, I wake up with really tired, puffy eyes. Be it that I had Chinese food for dinner or just didn&#x27;t sleep well, I look a hot mess. I used to just tough it out or occasionally use a hot rag on my face to encourage drainage, but now I just reach for this eye gel. The formula is incredibly light and cooling - it feels lovely smoothing it on puffy eyes and sinks right in. I don&#x27;t have to wait ages for it to absorb before I can apply my eye makeup, but I do like to give it a few minutes to start working its magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And work its magic it does! While it doesn&#x27;t give what I&#x27;d call instant results (aside from the really pleasant cooling sensation), within a couple of hours, my eyes are no longer puffy, they feel more awake, and they look much brighter. I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but I&#x27;m truly glad it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it isn&#x27;t terribly moisturizing, I do recommend using an additional eye cream if you need moisture, but I personally can get away with just this on days I feel I need it. On days my eyes feel great already, I just use a regular moisturizing eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love with this eye gel that I can completely disregard the fact it comes in a pot-style package (which is truly a pet peeve of mine - the fact that I can look past it really speaks to how much I love it!). It&#x27;s a fairly good size, and given that I only use it on days when I need some definite help in the eye area department, it should last me for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a new Holy Grail product for me. It&#x27;s totally going into my permanent rotation, and I highly recommend you try it out!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed starting my morning off with this! It did reduce the dark area and puffiness under my eyes. It was also very refreshing. As with any eye cream be very gentle and try not to get it into your eye. This gel actually takes much less than what I was use to which may attribute to some feeling it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as it says it will. Trust me you don&#x27;t need to use much at all! I would definitely suggest this to anyone with under eye circles as well as those just wanting to look youthful as long as possible! Your eye area is often the area that shows signs of aging first. Feel free to read my entire review at www.my-captivating-life.com</li>
    <li> Been using this product consistently for weeks and have not seen ANY change at all like I expected, most of these products never produce the results like you would hope. I suffer from severe under eye bags and have been searching for years to find a product that would show a small amount of difference.</li>
    <li> This eye cream does not work. It does nothing for puffiness or dark circles or wrinkles.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> After using this eye cream for a month or so, I have had some great results. I like the way it absorbs into my skin, and I am able to apply this, then apply my eye primer, and layer shadow on top without any issues. Adovia sent this to me for review, and I think it&#x27;s going to last me quite a while... good value!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, cream was very irritating. Caused the skin around my eyes to break out.</li>
    <li> I mean it did help a little bit with my dark circles but it did not help with my puffiness. And it burns when i put it around my eyes i found a better one sorry</li>
    <li> This product actually works (puffiness).  It does not irritate my eyes, as so many products do.  It feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. I like the packaging, it isn&#x27;t too big to keep in my cabinet. It is sealed to keep the freshness of the item until it arrived to me. There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent which i prefer since i have allergies to fragrant things. I have used this for  almost a week now and it goes on smooth, not greasy, absorbs quickly and I have already started to see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Adovia via Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice! I am such a fan of this company! They can do no wrong, in my book. Their products are safe and natural, and they do what they say they will do! Try the eye gel (making sure you don&#x27;t get the product IN your eye). Don&#x27;t expect immediate results, but give it a good trial of at least a couple of weeks. I predict you will be as impressed as I am! And...give Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice a try, as well. All their products are great!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, I&#x27;ve applied it both morning and night and my dark circles rcles are fading</li>
    <li> Black circles where? Just what i needed for after long late night shift , look awake when not.So, happy to have been given chance to try this at discounted rate</li>
    <li> I am in love with this eye cream.  I have quite fair skin and nearly always had circles under my eyes that I was trying to conceal.  This cream has helped with the puffiness that went hand in hand with the dark circles and that&#x27;s made the darkness not appear so dark (if that makes sense...). I have also noticed that any first signs of crows feet I was seeing have also disappeared.  I will be using this cream faithfully for years to come if I keep having these same results.  I never experienced the tingling that some other reviews have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream two weeks, I feel bags has been reduced, the biggest advantage is not cause allergies, because my skin is very sensitive. I will continue to use, and then do reviews.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell about erasing wrinkles but I do like the texture and feel after application.  Eye area is soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ll know more after I finish the jar I hope</li>
    <li> As a mom of 4 with 3 of them being 3 and under I am always on the go and do not get much sleep. I suffer from the puffy eyes alsnd black circles. I heard alsndbout this product so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love how the product is light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it soaks right into my sick. I have been using this day and night for about two weeks now. It didn&#x27;t make me look 10years younger but it did improve the way my eyes look and feel. My eyes are not quite as puffy and ares dark as they once were. I will continue to use this product in hopes that it keeps improving the looks of my skin. It seems to have stopped improving it but keeping it where it&#x27;s at now. Only time will tell if it will improve either way the results I have I gotten are enough for me to continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure why they would make an eye cream that is irritating to the eyes. I take special attention to not apply it too close to my eyes and I still get stinging and burning. What&#x27;s more, I don&#x27;t see a visible difference yet (albeit it&#x27;s been 5 days).  My biggest problem is not under eye circles so maybe it&#x27;s just not meant for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product in search of that miracle cream we are all searching for.  To my surprise the product worked better than expected.  After several days use I did notice a lightening of the darkness under my eyes and I really love the way it moisturizes the area around my eyes.  I would definitely buy again.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom to try because I knew she was looking for eye creams. After using it for a few days, she told me (and I noticed) that the area under her eyes that is usually darker than the rest of her skin was starting to get a little lighter. She also has these white dots containing fat in that same area and some started to disappear. She&#x27;s not 100% consistent with the use of the gel because she forgets to put it on some nights, but she&#x27;s very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become of Adovia products. When I was brought up the chance to review another one of their products, I jumped on the chance to do so! I just love it! Dark circles are always a problem nowadays, especially with the stress of the holidays. This stuff has helped me out tremendously! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days and I can see some puffiness going away. My eyes usually hurt towards the latter part of the day and this rejuvenates my eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Advovia Eye Cream for over a month &amp; I have seen a significant difference in the the fine lines around my eyes, they are a lot less visible &amp; my eyes seem a lot brighter. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I definitely recommend this product...</li>
    <li> This eye gel is refreshing and cool to undereye area. It works very well in combating fine lines and puffiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approx. 4 weeks. I like that it&#x27;s a gel. When applied it makes your eyes feel cool and refreshed. It smooths out and softens fine lines making them less noticeable. There is no smell which I like. Sometimes after it&#x27;s applied it irritates slightly but not were I would stop using it.  I have redness around my eye area and still use a concealer. I will continue using this product and send another review in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Aside from blogging, I have two different jobs that involve long hours spent in front of the computer. This can lead to tired-looking, puffy eyes. I also know that the delicate eye area is one of the fastest parts of your face to show signs of age. Thus I&#x27;m always on the look-out for pampering products than can help rejuvenate and refresh me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to have the chance to try out this Mineral Eye Gel from Adovia. It contains a promising combination of Vitamin C, Dead Sea Salt and Vitamin A Retinol. They also offer a money-back guarantee, if your eyes do not look ten years younger! It&#x27;s nice to see a company that stands behind their promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product packaging, the weighty frosted glass container makes you feel like you&#x27;re at the spa. The gel was light and non-greasy on my skin. After testing it for about a week, I do feel like the skin around my eyes is softer and brighter. I think with consistent use over time it will definitely help ward off fine lines and improve the overall health of my face!</li>
    <li> I am a Big Fan of Adovia product. I wish I can get all to try and get look younger with that unbelievable product. I got Adovia Eye Cream from Tomoson.com for my review. Company promise: “Your Eyes will Look 10 Years Younger, let your eyes shine again with their natural beauty, get rid of the wrinkles around your eyes and smooth out fine lines or Your Money Back!” Yoopy ! It’s what I want &lt;br /&gt;Open jar, looks like a Vaseline but acting opposite. No greasiness and very quick absorptions. After my first application at night time, I felt a slight stinging of my upper lids just for few seconds, I was really scared that my eyes would be puffy at morning. No! I woke up with refreshing eyes, bright and younger looking.  At morning I had applied a very small amount with q-tips around eyes with memory of prior night of stinging, nothing occurred. My eye makeup lay very nice on that very extra light gel, no smudges during day.  The delicate skin around your eyes requires a special, gentler touch and Adovia delivers that with a combination of Dead Sea Water, Chamomile ,Algae Extract, Papaya Extract, Aloe Vera , Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose ,Peach kernel oil, Collagen and much more.  All incredible ingredients helping me every day getting my eyes to look more youthful and refreshed.  I got a few compliments from my coworkers about my new way to apply eye makeup and I told everyone that same technique but new eye cream that make my eyes looks brighter. Living in Florida I always look for something that will protect my skin from daily sun damages and Adovia eye cream helps with that goal with Vitamins A and C. Use of gel is very minimal, I believe jar will last very close to a year.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed or feel any stinging after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;Another Prefect product from Adovia.</li>
    <li> Original review:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of THE best eye creams I have ever used.  It absorbs quickly, is wonderful for my sensitive eyes (doesn&#x27;t make me tear or have a harsh scent), and feels dreamy.  Almost instant results!  Within a week I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my eyes, the dark circles are noticeably lighter and my crows feet are the slightest bit less noticeable.  I will continue to use this and re-buy.  Definitely an HG product for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/31/2015:&lt;br /&gt;The first jar of this eye cream was wonderful, no adverse effects and I stand by my initial review...for the first jar only.  I&#x27;m now on my second jar of this eye cream and it makes my eyes BURN.  The tearing and burning I get after using this cream around my eyes, making sure I don&#x27;t smear any too close, is absolutely horrendous.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, the ingredients on the packaging are the same, however the burning is ridiculous.  I&#x27;ve since stopped using it and am looking for a new eye gel/cream. Ugh!</li>
    <li> I use all Adovia products since my skin is sensitive.  I believe in the healing properties of Dead Sea salt.  I use all the facial products they offer including the soap for my body.  I highly recommend this product and other adovia products esp if you have skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to sample another Adovia product. This time I received the mineral eye gel. Once I said I wanted to review this product the company sent me a coupon for me to order through Amazon. Once I placed my order I had this baby in my hands in two days. I was excited to try this. I love packaging. As a graphic design student the branding and packaging is always what I look at first when I receive products to review. The way a product is packaged and branded gives me a good feel for what the company may be about and how much they care for their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the Amazon package is a cute little box. The blue fade and white design on this product works. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the little wave-like symbol under the Brand name. I think it looks off and doesn&#x27;t flow well with this package design. Out of the box, the product comes in a cute little glass jar. After opening the package I set the jar down a little too close to the edge of the counter and little hands got ahold of  it. This little hand was not into opening it but throwing it. At everything. Now my cute little jar has a dent in the edge of the metal lid. It is a thick frosted white glass jar that has a smooth finish to it. There is just something about a smooth finish jar that just gets me. Maybe its a sign showing me that my face could get that smooth with the use of this product.  A girl can dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I opened the jar and took a sniff. That is the first thing I do with every single product I test out. I need to know if there will be any scent, smell, aroma to the product I am going to be testing out. I did not think this product had any scent to it at all. That is a good thing since this is an eye product and will be used in close vicinity to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a look at the product itself. The eye gel is very thick and clear. If you have used any gels before that are this thick consistency then you should know to use a little bit as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company describes this product as a Powerful eye gel for eye puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles. Reduce appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes with Dead sea minerals, Vitamin E and Aloe Vera. So, lets put this baby to the test. I personally do not have wrinkles, puffiness or dark circles. I will try it anyway and see what advantages it has for me. My step-daughter does have really bad dark circles and I wish I could get her to try this but she will not. It is her loss. This product was easy to use. You take a tiny amount on your fingertips, after washing your face of course, then spread under and around your eyes. No force was needed as it spread very easy. It absorbed into my skin quickly so I could continue to apply the rest of my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not leave any greasy residue on my skin. The first time I used this product I could feel it tightening my skin. For the whole next hour I felt this cooling affect along with the tightening. I thought that was pretty neat. Those affects are no longer as strong now that I use it everyday. As I said before I do not have dark circles, fine line or wrinkles but I felt like this product did do something. I think my eyes look brighter and the skin around them does look smoother. The only downside I found for this product was the fumes. I always applied very little to my eyes and made sure to not go anywhere near my eyelashes so there was no chance it would get into my eyes. The fumes however were always strong. So strong I would have to keep my eyes closed until the product fully absorbed into my skin or else I would be a teary-eyed mess. I still love the product and the personally results I am seeing.a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company describes this product as a Powerful eye gel for eye puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.

    <li> Helps with my puffiness and the tiny wrinkles I have. Absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is great.  This will last for a very long time!</li>
    <li> When I don’t get enough sleep my eyes can be pretty puffy in the morning. After using the gel for even just a week I noticed a difference. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> One of the first things I noticed about the Adovia Mineral Eye Gel was its consistency. This Eye Gel is, like it sounds, a GEL, and not a serum. It is very thick and a little goes a long way, so you don’t need to put giant globs of it under your eyes. Use it sparingly and it will last much longer! I applied less than a pea-sized amount of the gel under my eyes and around the edges of my eyes. It went on smoothly and my skin quickly absorbed it. The Adovia Mineral Eye Gel is so lightly touched with fragrance that it is almost fragrance-free.  I did find the Mineral Eye Gel to be very moisturizing.  After using the Adovia Mineral Eye Gel for awhile, I felt that it really helped with my puffy under eyes and that tired out look that I often have when I wake up in the morning. It kept that under-eye area feeling rejuvenated and healthy.  Overall, I think this is a great product to use if you want to try and soften the look of dark, puffy under eye circles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is described as a gel, but upon opening it was a mixture of a cream and gel in one.  It is not clear as I would expect, and is not liquid or gel like. It does have a creamy texture, which in my opinion maintains the moisture a little longer.  I apply this twice a day under my eyes. I do however have to be careful not to apply too close to my eye because it tends to sneak up and into my eye and burn my eyes when it is applied to closely. Not so much the cream but evaporating moisture of the gel. (if that makes any sense) I have just adjusted the application technique for this mineral eye gel. I suppose it is because of the Dead Sea Salt and Minerals. After it is absorbed there is no more burning to my eyes.    I real enjoy how smooth it is and how it leaves my under eye area very hydrated. I applied this one to one eye and another to the other eye and the eye with the Adovia eye get had much less creasing under the eye. The other product I used is a gel and I noticed my under eye makeup showing my fine lines under my eyes before lunch time. Not good.  Ultimately the Vitamin E and Aloe Vera leaves my under eye feeling hydrated and has an amazing buttery texture that is easy to glide on. I was very please and am still very pleased with the ADOVIA mineral eye gel. I like how my ubder eye feels well hydrated and nor dry. I was sent this for review.  I only gave it a 3 star for the reason that it burns my eyes upon application. I received the product for an unbiased and uncompensated review.</li>
    <li> Our Promise: Your Eyes will Look 10 Years Younger or Your Money Back! - Reduce Puffiness Under and Around The Eyes - Makes Eyes Appear Years Younger and Radiant!&lt;br /&gt;Gets Rid of Dark Circles Under Eyes - Your Eyes Will Look More Youthful and Refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;Formulated Specifically for The Genltle Area Around the Eyes - this Light Eye Gel Absorbs Quickly into Skin for Deep Hydration&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt Delivers an Immidiate Infusion of Dead Sea Minerals - Essential for Proper Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;Contains Vitamin C which Delivers Powerful Antioxidants Deep Into Skin Cells&lt;br /&gt;My Review:&lt;br /&gt;Over the past couple of months I have received a number of different items from Adovia and have not been unhappy with them.  This one is an eye gel that helps with dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from puffy eyes this is just the thing for you to try. It&#x27;s a small bottle but you do not need to use alot, so this bottle will last awhile</li>
    <li> I have tried one other eye cream before and it stopped working for me after a while, so I haven&#x27;t tried another eye cream since I didn&#x27;t end up having the best results with my first one. I decided to give Adovia&#x27;s eye cream a shot because I love Adovia&#x27;s products and they have never disappointed me. That statement still stands because I honestly do love this eye cream. I am one of those people that can lie in bed for hours, but only get an hour and a half of sleep a night so I look absolutely horrid when I go to work. This cream basically eliminates the puffiness underneath my eyes as well as soothes my eyes, helping me look much more awake than I am. The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, which is amazing because my eyes are even sensitive to my own tears. Overall I love this and keep it in my work bag for a quick emergency fix. I definitely recommend it an I will be getting a new one as soon as I start running low.</li>
    <li> Adovia is definitely becoming one of my favorite skin care lines. I was given the chance to review Adovia’s Mineral Eye Gel and I was very happy to do so.&lt;br /&gt; Here is what the eye gel is supposed to do (taken from the website):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Promise: Your Eyes will Look 10 Years Younger or Your Money Back! – Reduce Puffiness Under and Around The Eyes – Makes Eyes Appear Years Younger and Radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets Rid of Dark Circles Under Eyes – Your Eyes Will Look More Youthful and Refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulated Specifically for The Gentle Area Around the Eyes – this Light Eye Gel Absorbs Quickly into Skin for Deep Hydration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt Delivers an Immediate Infusion of Dead Sea Minerals – Essential for Proper Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains Vitamin C which Delivers Powerful Antioxidants Deep Into Skin Cells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3 weeks now so I cant speak for the 10 years younger claim. But my eyes definitely look radiant! It has greatly reduced the darkness under my eyes and the puffiness is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt; This gel has a wonderful consistency and absorbs easily into the skin. And it works. The only negative I have about this one is that it does sting the eyes. Just be extra careful when applying! Although, even when I am less than careful it does not cause red eyes.&lt;br /&gt; My final verdict on this product is that it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the first product from Adovia Mineral Skincare that I got for review purpose. I ordered it through Amazon. I have to say the ordering was a breeze and I received this product within two days. My first thought when I received the eye gel was that I liked the way it was packaged. The eye gel was actually in a glass jar and looked expensive. Next thing that impressed me is the size of the jar (1.7 fl.oz) and the quantity of the eye gel. It was generous compared to other brands of eye gels/creams and I am sure it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the eye gel only at nights before sleeping. On touch, the consistency of it was more creamy and less gel like. After application, I found that the gel was light but it did take few seconds longer for absorption. The feature I liked the most was the gel was not greasy and it was also fragrance free. Since I was careful in applying the gel, I made sure nothing got into my eye and so did not end up with irritation of any kind. If it gets in the eye then it does burn and itch so I made sure to apply carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results I have to be honest. The eye gel did reduce the puffiness, but did not eliminate or reduce the dark circles.  I still have dark circles. I think I may have to use it for longer duration to really see some results. At this point I am satisfied with the fact that it reduces the puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for a few days with no noticeable difference. I am continuing to use the product to see if it takes longer than 5 days to see any improvement in the appearance around and under my eye. I will leave another review in two weeks to let everyone know how it is working.</li>
    <li> This product burns like hell if you get it anywhere near your eye. Considering this is an eye cream, this is a major disadvantage. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for maybe 3-4 days with no improvement. I do like the texture and it does seem to be quite hydrating with quick absorption. If it didn&#x27;t hurt so much to use, I&#x27;d probably give it a little more time. Seriously makes me wonder if alm the good reviews on here are from actual people or from bots.</li>
    <li> This cream is soft and applies like butter.  It feels like a drink of water for your eyes.  Sooooo refreshing. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I could see the difference with just a few uses... Sleepless nights led to some dark eyes. I&#x27;m looking younger than ever now! Give it a try I think you&#x27;ll like it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes either if some happens to get in them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream to help me look better ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this on I felt burning.... On my eyes.... I used it a few times with the burning and finally decided to stop using it. This product is one of the worst products on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried giving this eye gel the benefit of the doubt, but from the first moment I applied it beneath (but not actually close to my eyes), it felt like I had just chopped up a bunch of onions and held my face over it. My eyes stung and began watering for a while. I figured it had smudged into my eyes somehow, but nope. Every single time this happens and I become more and more cautious each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the claims it makes, I haven&#x27;t been using it regularly enough to notice visible differences. The burning sensation is enough to deter me.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great</li>
    <li> Can you say love at first site! !!! What a cream. I use this morning and night and since I wear foundation I can see my lines too much. But this cream smooths out the deep lines so I don&#x27;t feel so embarrassed.  Creamy and rich and not sticky at all. Winter times skin is always dry so this does the trick. I also use it on my whole face. If it can help the eyes it can help the whole face..</li>
</ol>
