<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> feels very nice, not sticky more silky oil but it absorbs nicely and quickly. Smells nice, non irritating, works pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;Overall good&lt;br /&gt;Not the best for serious water time, but good for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;I use something different on my face if I lap swim</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kinesys for awhile now. Its goes on easily without feeling cold like other sprays. I tend to spray it on my hands and rub it in. My only issue is if I apply it late or I&#x27;m already sweaty it dosen&#x27;t apply very well. This is true of most sunscreens though</li>
    <li> No greasy mess on your collar or sleeves and it really works.  I am never burned while in the sun 5 hours during 18 holes.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for my husband and myself for our beach vacation this summer.  We play a lot of volleyball and spend a lot of time in the water.  This sunscreen really did a good job of staying on through the sweat and ocean water.  We reapplied about every 45 minutes just to play it safe, but we never got a sunburn!  Plus, we love that it is safe from harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on easily, don&#x27;t have to worry about such harsh chemicals and best of all does not discolor my or my family&#x27;s clothes.  Will definately be buying this every season.</li>
    <li> My girls are pretty picky about the sunscreen that gets applied to their skin. I have tried lots and it seems to bother their skin as they squirm when I put it on and complain.  This one they line up and stick their arms out and rub it right in, no complaints!  So far no pink so seems to do the job against sunburn too. Priced a little high but worth it since they will actually let me use it on them.  It feels very light and nice on my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Last year, a friend of my husband&#x27;s had this at an all-day outdoor music festival that they went to.  My husband usually hates the texture and feel of sunscreen, but he didn&#x27;t mind this at all, so we got the name of it from his friend and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a superlative sunscreen in terms of its feel and ease of application, it just didn&#x27;t do the job of protecting my husband outdoors.  We just got back from a beach vacation in Mexico, and the first day that he used this, he ended up with a terrible sunburn from playing volleyball on the beach for one hour.  Refusing to believe that it was the sunscreen&#x27;s fault, he used it again the second day, and ended up with an even worse burn.  He does sweat a lot, but this just didn&#x27;t hold up to the sweat.  I&#x27;d expect a sunscreen billed as \\&quot;performance\\&quot; to be able to withstand an hour of sweating, and this just didn&#x27;t, so we used our stand-by Coppertone Sport spray the rest of our trip, and had no more sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this for non-sports-related activities, though, then it&#x27;s great.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy going on, and has a pleasant smell.  The spray coats evenly, and rubbing it in is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice sunscreen, but just be careful if you do tend to sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> SPF protection is so important but it&#x27;s not always so easy to remember to apply. I like to keep this in the car and apply on especially hot and sunny days. No smell, non-greasy, absorbs immediately. Plus, I LOVE that I can keep this in my car. Because it is a regular liquid spray (as opposed to those pressurized/can-sprays) it can and will survive. Mine was a gift from a friend last April. Today I just received mine with Amazon Prime. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Kinesys sunscreen for 10 years now, ever since I had to buy some while skiing in Whistler.  I use it while I am skiing during the winter and all summer long around the house and at the beach.  It comes in a pump spray bottle, so it isn&#x27;t as convenient as a pressurized spray bottle that has a constant spray.  Spray it on and let it dry.  No need to rub it in, unless you just want to make sure you are fully covered.  It is very light.  It is not sticky or greasy once it dries, which is just a few minutes.  The mango sent is light and it does stay with your clothes.  My wife and I like it because it reminds of the beach when we pull out the warmer weather wear in the spring.  I find it lasts a long time, even through sweat.  I have very fair skin and find this product protects me as advertised.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best sunscreen I have ever use, bar none, I have been using it exclusively since 2000.  I was doing PR at a sporting event and had forgotten my sunscreen, they had a booth demoing Kinesys, I had nothing to lose but sunburns, they sprayed me and I have not had a sunburn since.  I spend a lot of time on the water sailing as well as outdoors in general, I would not leave the house without spraying first</li>
    <li> Not many stores sell this stuff. I originally found it at a triathlon store, the owner said it was the best - very sweatproof, broad spectrum (uva &amp; uvb), oil/alcohol free, etc. All true - it is great. I&#x27;d add that it smells nice (mango!) and the spray application keeps your hands clean and takes just a few seconds to apply. With sunblock, the easier it is to use, the more likely you&#x27;ll use it - and that&#x27;s what matters most. Also, The Good Guide ranked it as one of their top choices as well - it has minimal ingredients that raise health concerns, and creates minimal societal/environmental problems.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best sun block for athletics and working outdoors.  Yes it is pricey, but it is outstanding.  Easy to apply. Smells nice.  Lasts long.  Chicks dig it!  BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen in Florida and I think that&#x27;s all that really needs to be said. The Sun in Florida is brutal and KINeSYS held up perfectly to all of the UV rays. I did not get burned at all and it protected me completely. I will say that it is the best sunscreen out there hands down, and it&#x27;s alcohol free. I can&#x27;t have alcohol in or around my body and Its so great that they are making a product like this for people like me. I would recommend this product to anyone! KINeSYS is the only brand of sunscreen I will ever need.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best sunscreen for outdoor exercise or just relaxing at the beach.  Easy to apply and works excellent.  Our last trip to Hawaii we ran out on the last day and bought a name brand spray on sunscreen,  Big Mistake.  Coverage was not as good nor was the protection and got a little burn.  Next trip we were overstocked.  Especially great product for kids.  As a father of triplets the ease of use and more importantly the excellent sun protection is the best.  It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we will use!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product on the market. Not greasy at all and stay on for hours. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and light, the whole family can use it, does not smell (actually like wearing this) and it works what more could you ask in a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen. I bought it at Costco on a whim and then checked it out on skindeep.com and it is a very low toxic sunscreen. It&#x27;s wonderful. You need to know what you&#x27;re putting on your body and your children there are alot of name brands that just don&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve done the homework and this product is great. Don&#x27;t believe me...check it out yourself. Love this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunscreen on the market. It&#x27;s easy to apply, the scent is very light and pleasant, drys to a soft lovely feel, isn&#x27;t at ALL greasy, and works.  I&#x27;ve never been sunburned wearing it...used it for 3 years now.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, not too greasy. Does a great job of UV protection. Smell is not overpowering. Great for keeping next to the bathroom sink when you&#x27;re on vacation.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  Super easy to apply and dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for kids and adults. Light and safe to use. No cheap fillers. Have been using it for years. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Just spray on and rub in.  The bottle is ergonomically well-designed for easy grib while spraying.  The mango scent is nice.  We used this for our trip to Hawaii and did not get sunburned at all!</li>
    <li> I know that good quality sunscreen is more expensive but for the amount we use, I would go broke buying this brand.  I do love the way it feels going on my skin and it does the job but I would need to go through about a bottle of this a week for my family of four and that it just too much money to spend on sunscreen.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen!!  And my kids&#x27; favorite sunscreen as well. The pump creates a light spray, the f</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen we have found for sensitive skin that does not cause a rash.  We love it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and smells great. You know you&#x27;ve found the right product when your 6 year old gladly lets you put sunscreen on his face because he &amp;#34;loves the smell of this stuff.&amp;#34; It goes on a little greasy, but quickly absorbs in and just adds some moisture to the skin. Not like other greasy sunscreens that stay greasy all day. We don&#x27;t burn easily (well, I guess I do in spots) but this seems to do the job. Does need several applications on me at the beginning of the summer or I will burn through it, but works great for me and my kids after the first few days out in the sun. I&#x27;ve tried others and just keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used. I am restocking with this purchase. I first bought it for a fly fishing trip to the Bahamas. We were out in a boat all day for 5 days and never once got burned. It&#x27;s very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel oily, so it&#x27;s perfect in hot humid climates. Hard to find locally but did see it for sale this week at Pharmaca, but only in a very small bottle.</li>
    <li> KINeSYS was recommended by my skin cancer Doctor and I find that it works better than others and does not irritate my skin. This is important as I have had some fairly bad reactions to other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! A little pricey, but worth it!</li>
    <li> Greatest sunscreen ever made. Smells great, stays on, easy to use, and is more gentle on eyes than any other I&#x27;ve ever used. Fantastic for kids and athletes! It&#x27;s a life saver during soccer season. My kids play three season competitive soccer and during summer we are always outside. This is my go to sunscreen. I also wear it comfortably under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years now.  My husband found this in a sports magazine. We use it when we play volleyball for hours and when we go swimming . Never had a problem with it washing off in the water or sweating. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this sunscreen. It&#x27;s not sticky like other sprays, and I love the scent. I was hesitant as it is a pump spray, not a continuous spray and I am very into the convenience factor, but it is so easy to quickly rub it in. I don&#x27;t yet know how long it will last compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I am a triathlete and swimmer and unfortunately am allergic to many sunscreens.  I am always trying to find a balance between a sunscreen that stays on and actually works in all conditions and one that is sensitive to my skin.  I found it in KineSys.  The only brand I will use.</li>
    <li> I just needed a good sunscreen and this did the job.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good if you like the mango smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is inexplicably oily.  It&#x27;s literally like you rubbed yourself with oil.  It remains pretty slick even after being rubbed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the spray though; it covers a large area and sprays evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely won&#x27;t be repurchasing .</li>
    <li> Questionable UVA protection.  Octinoxate (7.5%) is know to destabilize Avobenzone (2%).  Avobenzone is the only UVA absorber in Kinesys.  These two ingredients should not be used in combination and Kinesys should strongly consider reformulation.  Be advised that it is difficult to tell if you are being protected from UVA because UVA rays do not cause sunburn but do contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.  I would not risk using and product containing Octinoxate and Avobenzone together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.futurederm.com/2012/10/12/how-does-octinoxate-degrade-avobenzone/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.skinacea.com/faq/sunscreen/s03-sunscreen-stability-avobenzone.html#.U92CHqiWZss</li>
    <li> This is the same formula as the unscented version, which I can&#x27;t seem to find on Amazon except in the tiny bottle.  This one has a fairly light mango scent.  I hate scented sunscreens, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.  It&#x27;s great to spray on arms and legs and neck and ears, but I use a heavier product on my face, because this one (as well as the unscented version) will eventually run into your eyes if you&#x27;re sweating a lot.  It works really well on hair parts like arms and legs, because it&#x27;s a watery liquid and not a thick gel or cream.  It gives great sun protection, though, and I&#x27;ve never burned after swimming or sweating a lot.</li>
    <li> I spent a huge part of my spring, summer, and fall outdoors training for triathlons and it&#x27;s always a struggle finding good sunscreens. The mango scent of KINeSYS plus the easy-to-spray version makes this a winner in my book. I wish that they made an aerosol version (hence only 4 stars). The pump can take a few seconds to get going but otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> Protects well rated from the sunscreen web site, no chemical smell you get from other sprays, but is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is really nice.  It looks like water, nice and clear so you don&#x27;t get the creamy ghost look.  It does not require any rubbing in but you can rub to spread it around if you like.  It does take a few seconds to dry.  Once it does dry there is no slick oily feeling on your skin.  It also has a really pleasant but very subtle smell.  Nothing like a medical smell, more like a super light perfume.  If you don&#x27;t like it I think they have a fragrance free version plus the smell only stays around for a few minutes.  It is super waterproof.  I use this while training and racing outdoors.  The best part about this sunscreen is that it comes in one ounce spray bottles.  These one ounce spray bottles are about the size of a pocket knife or four packs of gum.  This way you really can carry it with you anywhere and if you always have it with you there is a good chance you will use it.  I keep a bottle in a bunch of places so there is always one around.</li>
    <li> An excellent clear and non toxic sunblock that I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
    <li> Love this product but greasy so trying out some other things.  I feel great about using this around the water because who cares if I get it on beach/ pool clothes.  Not what I reach for if I want everyday SPF with casual clothing.</li>
    <li> We really like the non-greasy formula.</li>
    <li> I put sunscreen on myself and my daughter every morning, and this is my favorite brand of sunscreen by far.  It goes on pretty greasy, but dries fast, and then it feels like you&#x27;re not wearing anything. I also like that you don&#x27;t have to really rub it in, like other spray sunscreens, so applying it to a wiggly toddler is quick. The mango scent is also nice.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very highly rated by EWG and it works great.  Really isn&#x27;t oily.  Sprays on evenly.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as the aerosol kind but I like what it does for our skin.  Aerosols can be really harsh.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use KINeSYS Sunscreen SPF 30 religiously. We go to Jamaica twice a year and met a couple from Canada there. They swore by this product and my husband had been breaking out from all the other brands we had tried. Could not find KINeSYS in US stores, so ordered it from Amazon. It is expensive, but for us, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I will use this always.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what I needed it to do.  We used this while on vacation in Arizona.  I&#x27;d start the day with a rub in sunscreen and use this one throughout the day to refresh every couple of hours.  No one on the trip got sunburned!  It smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> I travel to some very hot spot in Asia that are close to the equator.  As you might expect, protection from the sun is a goal but all other sunblocks contain a lot of alcohol.  This is very bad for the skin, and when you add the damage caused by the sun, using those other blocks speeds up the what you&#x27;re trying to prevent in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand/model has been very good for providing protection without the harmful alcohol.  It&#x27;s a must buy for me.</li>
    <li> This was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist. I now use it on my two young children as well. Easy to apply. Not sticky or slimy. And it works, for a long time. Simply the best.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreen sprays I have found without all the chemicals.  It takes a bit to get used to it but if you give it chance you will love it.  It goes on a bit oily and I normally give it a quick rub in once I spray it.  It takes 2 minutes to dry and done.  At first I thought it was too messy since I was used to the spray cans where you spray and go.  Once I started giving it a rub and letting it sit for moment, I found it way exceeded other spray sunscreen.  No noxious odor, no chemicals and safe for the kids.  Really really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff! Easy on, and stays on a long time even when cycling for long hours. Not dense slightly viscous but easy to apply to complicated areas - like ears! Awesome product, will be back for more, again!!!</li>
    <li> Here is a summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not sticky when dried and feels light on your skin (no need to wash your hands after applying)&lt;br /&gt;2. Safer choice than other brands out there in the market&lt;br /&gt;3. Scent is mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;4. No need to rub it on your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.  During 4 mile run, I saw white stuff dripping down on my forearms from the inside of elbows.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not like a spray bottle, you can&#x27;t use it upside down or spray your back by yourself.  When you try, it drips/leaks down on the bottle and now the bottle is slippery.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen my husband will use.  Dries quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky.  I also make my kids put it on everyday before leaving the house.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after learning about the many sunscreens that use dangerous chemicals that can do more harm than good.  We took it on a trip to the beach and it works very well.  None of us ended up sunburned and it protected our skin just as well as other products.  I also like that it&#x27;s a spray, but does not leave a greasy or oily feel on your skin.  Yes, it is more expensive than traditional sunscreen, but worth it for the peace of mind.  I feel good knowing that I am not applying anything harmful to my children&#x27;s delicate skin.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great sunscreen.  Never greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a chemical smell or feel on skin.  Protects as well as any other sunscreen.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> I liked this product and would recommend. After having got badly sun burnt during my last trip to Hawaii, I tried to use the Kinesys sunscreen this time around. It worked really well in both water and outside. I applied it about 2-3 times a day, and that was sufficient. Nice product!</li>
    <li> A) I&#x27;m a dermatological disaster. I have tons of freckles and have spent too much time in the sun over the years. Only my legs don&#x27;t burn -- they just reflect out of their sheer whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) I have periodically had rash reactions to certain sunscreens. This has been painful and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) I try to wear sunscreen whenever I&#x27;m outside, but even the better spray on sunscreens eventually seep towards my eyes. This is also painful and unpleasant. Don&#x27;t even get me started about cream-based sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) As one might guess, my children are also fair and prone to burns and freckles. They, too, love to be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E) We live in Denver, which is incredibly sunny. (Shhh. Don&#x27;t tell anyone. We wouldn&#x27;t want to overpopulate that place!) Therefore we require lots of sun coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered KINeSYS sunscreen several years ago at a little sports store in California. I simply love it. I love it so much that I have a standard order in place with Amazon where they send me two new bottles every two months. This way I always have it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never gotten a burn while wearing KINeSYS, never a chemical rash and it never, ever pesters my eyes. I frequently forget I&#x27;ve even put it on! I once, mistakenly, sprayed it directly into a friend&#x27;s face and her eyes didn&#x27;t even react. Not that I would recommend that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my children all the time. They, too, have excellent protection from the sun. The sunscreen mists out easily. For the face, I will spray into my hand and then apply it. Otherwise I shoot a little spritz on the arms or legs and we are good to go!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years and absolutely love it. I started using it when triathlete friends of mine swore by it - it really stays on in the water and through rain or sweat. I&#x27;ve even not reapplied as often as I should and I rarely get sunburned. It smells good, there is no alcohol (to my knowledge) and it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;hurt your lungs&amp;#34; alcohol smell that some sunscreen sprays. Heck, this even kept us from burning (or even looking tan, this coming from a redhead who burns easily) during Spring Training in Scottsdale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a travel spray, we purchased the 2 ounce size and just refill it from the 4 oz bottles. Plus I can take the smaller size out with me on long runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t go on dry and takes a bit to dry, it doesn&#x27;t take long. It doesn&#x27;t stain, I really can&#x27;t think of any downsides to it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff disappears on skin in a few minutes and last a very long time. Need to offer unscented in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY recommended. This works great and is easy to apply</li>
    <li> This is the easiest sunscreen to apply on my young boys. I have been using it for years. It doesn&#x27;t have the cold spray that other spray sunscreens do, and it smells fantastic! I never have to chase down my boys to get them to apply this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> My girl loves it, but don&#x27;t be fooled by &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34;. This stuff creates a sheen on the ocean when you jump in.</li>
    <li> Kinesys is a sun protection product I highly recommend.  This is the only product I have ever used that DOES NOT run into my eyes when I am sweating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the YouTube video \\&quot;Dear 16 year old me\\&quot; and make/suggest your children, friends, and extended family watch it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanoma kills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily sun protection by using this wonderful product is a very good way to try and stay protected.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen! Works great. I do apply it every 2 hours or so because it doesn&#x27;t last that long to make sure I don&#x27;t burn. I love that it is safe from many harmful chemicals.  I use it on my 2 small kids as well. My daughter has very pale skin and burns very easily.. so far this sunscreen worked very well for us. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for cycling and boating for years and it&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve been able to find for using with active sports.  It&#x27;s one of the only ones i know of that allows your skin to breath.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product! Once applied, it has a slight mango/coconut scent. We use it on the whole family. It is hard to find a non-greasy and light product with good coverage - I&#x27;ll search no more. When swimming or sweating heavily, I&#x27;d recommend a thicker product like Badger, but this is great for day to day coverage. Love it.</li>
    <li> My new brand.  I won&#x27;t be going back to the drug store stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great even if it is a little pricey.  I wore it during a June backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon and I didnt burn.  Did I mention I&#x27;m a redhead?&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about it is there is ZERO greasy residue on your skin.  Once it dries you dont feel a thing.  Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in a 3oz size for air travel.</li>
