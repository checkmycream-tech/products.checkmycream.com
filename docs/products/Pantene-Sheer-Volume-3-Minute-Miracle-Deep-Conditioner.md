      <li>Her hair always looks and smells WONDERFUL - silky, shiney, manageable!!!</li>
      <li>Have used this shampoo for years, great stuff.</li>
      <li>and I got a great price for 25.4 ounces.</li>
      <li>great shampoo</li>
      <li>At this price point, this is one of the best volumizing shampoos, great quality and very mild scent.</li>
      <li>Well, in good faith I tried it for a couple weeks.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel so good.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is really good.  </li>
      <li>I found a shampoo that I love!  </li>
      <li>Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love this shampoo, My hair is softer and more fuller :)</li>
      <li>I was hoping this moisture additive would produce more volume.</li>
      <li>I keep touching it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love feeling it at night</li>
      <li>I just love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s available in this 3 pack and for subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>Rinses easily too.  </li>
      <li>I am super pissed!</li>
      <li>This shampoo works great on my fine hair and provides some extra volume which helps with styling.  </li>
      <li>My hair is much thicker when I use Pantene and people comment on how nice my hair smells.</li>
      <li>but I still prefer the smooth and sleek version of Pantene</li>
      <li>What I got was hair that did not feel clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...</li>
      <li>Thank you so much, Amazon, for making it easy to use your site.</li>
      <li>I have used the former Pantene Pro-V FINE Shampoo and Conditioner for many years, and nothing made my hair look fuller and shiner.  </li>
      <li>the Pantene Pro-v fine hair solutions volume shampoo makes my hair soft and gives me volume</li>
      <li>It leaves hair very clean like a clarifying shampoo but not dry or feeling stripped like they do.</li>
      <li>Thanks Pantene!</li>
      <li>I cannot imagine switching back to salon shampoos because Pantene is so much better.</li>
      <li>but truthfully I had low expectations.  </li>
      <li>As always, the product arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>We have been through 3 bottles and alternate with Pantene Agua light Weightless shampoo or An Aveeno Nourishing shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a large bottle and true to the 25.4 fluid ounces.  </li>
      <li>I used Pantene for years, and it made my thin, stick straight hair so healthy and full.</li>
      <li>highly reomended.</li>
      <li>They have discontinued that line in favor of this \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; line.  </li>
      <li>Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again.</li>
      <li>Looking for new product line.</li>
      <li>Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers.  </li>
      <li>Clear shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hair, but adds body.  </li>
      <li>I buy this product for my 16 year old granddaughter - she loves it.  </li>
      <li>When I am traveling and occasionally use the hotel shampoo I can really see a difference.  </li>
      <li>it is so soft</li>
      <li>Anyone knows with oily hair it is hard to get good volume because the oil weighs it down.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>But this new formula leaves my hair brittle, fly-away, and dirty-looking by the next day.  </li>
      <li>Please bring back the old formula!  </li>
      <li>From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers&#x27; preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo because as my hair has turned white it has naturally become thinner.</li>

<li> It actually gives my long, flat, straight hair a little volume.</li>
<li> Pantene Pro-V solutions Flat to Volume has given my hair a ton of body.  </li>
<li> This \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
<li> I have been a faithful user of the Pantene Volume line for a very LONG time.  </li>

<li> Purchasing in bulk also saves a few extra dollars.</li>
<li> I hate using cream based shampoo and this one is clear and light.</li>

    <li> As always, the product arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted.  Thank you so much, Amazon, for making it easy to use your site.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of the Pantene Volume line for a very LONG time.  They have discontinued that line in favor of this \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; line.  Well, in good faith I tried it for a couple weeks.  SORRY PANTENE, THIS STUFF DOES **NOT** WORK. This \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. No volume, no shine, no manageability.  My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...from off the shelf to salon lines.  Believe me...been there, done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers&#x27; preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers.  \\&quot;Flat\\&quot; indeed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out.  I am super pissed! Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair.  I never thought that I could make a difference to my hair by just changing my shampoo, but I have.  Pantene Pro-V solutions Flat to Volume has given my hair a ton of body.  Who would of thought a shampoo could make the difference.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Finally!!  I found a shampoo that I love!  My hair is usually very oily and I have to wash it everyday which sucks!!  No more!  This shampoo makes my hair feel so good.  I love feeling it at night it is so soft I keep touching it and I have a lot of volume. Anyone knows with oily hair it is hard to get good volume because the oil weighs it down. I just love this shampoo.  Thanks Pantene!</li>
    <li> I tried to use a cheaper shampoo and have to come back to Pantene Volume Shampoo (and conditioner). It can&#x27;t be beat for the fullness it gives to my hair.</li>
    <li> Awful formulation. Please bring back the old formula!  I have used the former Pantene Pro-V FINE Shampoo and Conditioner for many years, and nothing made my hair look fuller and shiner.  But this new formula leaves my hair brittle, fly-away, and dirty-looking by the next day.  I have just spent a ton of money buying the old formula online.  Don&#x27;t know what I will do when the supply runs out, unless Pantene comes to its senses and ditches this loser formula.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  I used Pantene for years, and it made my thin, stick straight hair so healthy and full. Now it makes my hair heavy and lifeless, I think they have changed their formula. Must be a lot of silicone in the formula.  Looking for new product line.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for years, great stuff.</li>
    <li> great shampoo but I still prefer the smooth and sleek version of Pantene</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo, My hair is softer and more fuller :)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and I thought people were exaggerating how it left your hair frizzy.  I tried it two times and then threw all three bottle away.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It actually gives my long, flat, straight hair a little volume. I hate using cream based shampoo and this one is clear and light. I love it.</li>
    <li> In the past I had used expensive salon shampoos for my hair, hoping to achieve volume.  Some have worked some haven&#x27;t, the commonality of them all were they were pricey.  I tried Pantene Flat to Volume, thinking that it might give me a little volume but truthfully I had low expectations.  Well, not anymore.  This shampoo is really good.  I have body and bounce and this is not an overly priced product.  It works well into a lather with only a little dollop.  Rinses easily too.  I cannot imagine switching back to salon shampoos because Pantene is so much better.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle and true to the 25.4 fluid ounces.  Lower price than buying it in the store.  It was packaged well and arrived without damage to the bottle.</li>
    <li> the Pantene Pro-v fine hair solutions volume shampoo makes my hair soft and gives me volume and I got a great price for 25.4 ounces.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair very clean like a clarifying shampoo but not dry or feeling stripped like they do. My wife and I both can see that our hair looks thicker. We have been through 3 bottles and alternate with Pantene Agua light Weightless shampoo or An Aveeno Nourishing shampoo. Buying in bulk with the coupon that they sometimes offer on Amazon make the price as  inexpensive as COSTCO or other wharehouse store.</li>

    <li> I buy this product for my 16 year old granddaughter - she loves it.  Her hair always looks and smells WONDERFUL - silky, shiney, manageable!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. I love that it&#x27;s available in this 3 pack and for subscribe and save. Saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> At this price point, this is one of the best volumizing shampoos, great quality and very mild scent. highly reomended.</li>
    <li> Ordered wrong product... Picture confused me, thought was 2-1.. my bad</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because as my hair has turned white it has naturally become thinner. I was hoping this moisture additive would produce more volume. What I got was hair that did not feel clean. It felt like I had made an error and shampooed with only a creamy moisturizer. I just felt I looked like I needed a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene Volume shampoo for a few years now and I really like it.  When I am traveling and occasionally use the hotel shampoo I can really see a difference.  My hair is much thicker when I use Pantene and people comment on how nice my hair smells.</li>
