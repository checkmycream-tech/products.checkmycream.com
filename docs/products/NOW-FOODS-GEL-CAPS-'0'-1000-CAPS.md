<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use these for powder medications for our dogs.  They work well at holding approximately 1/8 tsp of dry medications.</li>
    <li> The price of these capsules was 1/2 to 1/3 of what a health food store would charge.  Filling and closing them was fairly easy.  The company worked with me when I realized I had ordered the wrong size; and immediately sent out the right size, trusting me to return the ones delivered to me.  Wow--I really was surprized, and appreciated the integrity of the company and the individual that handled this.</li>
    <li> like these - thanks for making them available - a bit expensive for what they are but i do use them and they don&#x27;t crack or anything -</li>
    <li> Very good price for this many capsules!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I like to fill my own capsules with bulk herbs. You can sometimes save quite a bit by filling you own. These caps are a good buy and fairly easy to handle.</li>
    <li> all good, worked well</li>
    <li> Size as expected. Use them to take my essential oils orally. No issues, very straightforward.</li>
    <li> Appreciate quality &amp; price...</li>
    <li> These capsules were not brittle like other capsules I have tried.  The only caution is the bag will not stand upright on a table, so it falling over and sending capsules scuttling to the floor is a bother. I sat my bag in a large bowl. (after having to locate about 50 capsules on the floor...)</li>
    <li> For what it is and the price I really don&#x27;t think you could find a better deal for a better price shipped any faster. It&#x27;s a decent product, was shipped very reasonable time-wise at a great price... what more could you want?</li>
    <li> everything is fine no prob. OK just fine very good useful helpful not a prob. love it ok good great</li>
    <li> Now Foods Gel Caps &#x27;0&#x27; 1000 Caps work great.  They worked fine in my machine.  I have filled over a 1000 Now Food Caps with very few problems.  Would recommend to any one who fill there own caps.</li>
    <li> Like this, but need away to fill that&#x27;s not so time consuming. I might make my own if u don&#x27;t have anything. Make a formula i take anywhere from 6-9 daily so use alot. So need to fill alot and by hand its time consuming please help me with this PLEASE!!! THANX!!!  ♡PH</li>
    <li> Great price. No complaints. All the caps appeared to be in perfect condition. Easy to separate the cap from capsule.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> No problems with them at all.  It would be helpful if they had a desiccation bag in there if using a pill stuffer to absorb the moisture and keep them drier.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so I can make my own capsules for Young living essential oils. They are prefect for making my own .</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, good quality. They are easy to take apart to fill. It does not have too much packaging.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I fill my caps by hand and have no problems opening and closing these.</li>
    <li> Now Foods gel caps are the least expensive gel caps I&#x27;ve found and they work exceptionally well.  For the money spent, I have zero complaints. Actually, even if I spent more I wouldn&#x27;t really have any complaints... I use them without issue in my capsule filling machine and each package I buy works equally as well as the last.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and probably will continue for years to come.</li>
    <li> Good capsules you can easy fill them up with creatine or any other supplement you may think of. The go down easy. And the price is great.</li>
    <li> This was a real good price for a great product!!</li>
    <li> gel caps work so much better than the vegi caps I&#x27;ll never go back! The hold up to the machine, and I filled the caps with no mangled caps,</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! Easy to fill and close.  Exactly what I expected,  easy to swallow, does not stick to throat like some gel caps</li>
    <li> The only problem is I didnt know sizes when I bouhht these...I wanted 00 or 000 but I ended up with these.  And then they got stolen.  So I bought the 00 capsule machine with the 1000 caps for 29, it works great, I love it!</li>
    <li> I came very close to writing a nasty review on this product. Im glad I didnt. Im using these size 0 gel caps in my size 0 capsule machine. During the first couple attempted runs with these caps I was having a problem getting the top half of the caps to fit in the top portion of the capsule machine. Two runs in a row I tried to join the caps before finishing the the filling process due to being flustered from the caps not fitting correctly. At this point now angry with myself and the caps I decide to calm down and give it one more try before writing a nasty review and sending the caps back. On my next attempt and each following attempt paying very close attention the caps loaded ,filled ,tamped ,and joined perfectly. Every cap every time. The problem had been that with these caps being clear (my first time using clear caps) I couldnt visually tell which slots of the top portion of the capsule machine had been filled. If your planning to use these in a capsule machine I would recommend paying close attention to what slots have been loaded or loading them with a plan ,system , or some level of consistency. These caps are perfectly fine. I on the other hand may need some help.</li>
    <li> These are great if you want to pack your own herbs. There are a allot of them in a pack and they last a long time. They are good quality.</li>
    <li> Worked great for capping up the mineral oils and natural  extracts.</li>
    <li> easy fill them by hand</li>
    <li> The local leaf monopoly charges an arm and a leg for these things but they work as supposed to</li>
    <li> Capsules end up breaking on me half the time when filling. The capsules will crack or bend literally half of the time. The worst part isn&#x27;t even that they break. The capsules themselves seem to be too small. I can&#x27;t even tamper them correctly in my capsule maker. This means that the half of the capsules that don&#x27;t break aren&#x27;t even completely full. Only good thing I can say is that the product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with these gel capsules... they fit my little encapsulation machine perfectly! It is important to put a silica pouch in the gel cap bag to make sure it stays really dry.</li>
    <li> I use these manually with the help of some tweezers - the compound I put in the capsules is very sticky, so I stick the bottom part of the capsule in the tweezers and scoop up the powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using them with capsule loader</li>
    <li> Good quality, great price.</li>
    <li> No problems here, except I ordered the wrong size one time, this is a good price on enough caps to keep you going for a while.</li>
    <li> This item met our expectation and arrived in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Will not hesitate to purchase again from this mfg.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for providing quality products at a good price.</li>
    <li> I make vitamins and these are a great product for a good price.  I&#x27;d like to do the vegetarian caps, but for doing business it&#x27;s not cost effective.  I like that I can get these at a good price to keep my overhead cost low.</li>
