### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have always used Mink Hair Spray and it works perfectly for me.  </li>
      <li>Besides, Amazon has had the best prices for this product.</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Also, I lived in Florida for a number of years and found Mink worked best in that humid climate.</li>
      <li>This is a very good hairspray.</li>
      <li>This would be great if you had oily stringy hair and wanted to keep it that way.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
      <li>This is a great hair spray that holds well and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>And I liked the high humidity formula best, but I can no longer find that--not even through Amazon.</li>
      <li>For a special occasion this is great.</li>
      <li>It is even better than Mink&#x27;s own humidity control hairspray.  </li>
      <li>It gives your hair body more so than stiffness.  </li>
      <li>I was able to buy it at Walmart and most drug stores.</li>
      <li>it is still available online!</li>
      <li>I like it much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a creature of habit, I suppose, but I have been using Mink hairspray for many years.</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I used to buy it at Walgreens, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there anymore.  </li>
      <li>I have used this hairspray off and on for many years.  </li>
      <li>Tres Ame is fine but nothing like Mink.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is by far and away the most effective product for controlling frizz after you blowdry and/or set your hair.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it has great hold without being stiff or sticky like most hairsprays.</li>
      <li>--particularly since I stopped being able to find Mink on the shelves of most stores</li>
      <li>Smells great, soft hold not stiff, and brushes and combs out easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and just love it........makes the hair very manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine fragile hair and Mink works better for me than anything.  </li>
      <li>, is not stiff, and leaves my very fine hair with some body even after I comb through it and remove the \\&quot;hold.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I like the \\&quot;original\\&quot; better than the \\&quot;new, improved\\&quot; formula.</li>
      <li>next day my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it did at first</li>
      <li>Great product that holds your hair in place but is not sticky or stiff.</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m paying over twice the cost of what I was paying at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has good holding power without being stiff or drying.</li>
      <li>I tried every other kind of hairspray imaginable, and nothing can close.  </li>
      <li>It use to be available in the stores but the only place one can find it is on line.  </li>
      <li>I like it as it does not seem as drying as some and really seems to add volume and hold to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product.</li>
      <li>It has the right amount of holding power, not to stiff, but good enough to hold my hair style in place all day.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other hairsprays</li>
      <li>It is becoming a rare item and very few stores are stocking it in our area - thank goodness</li>
      <li>I finally turned to the internet because it was worth having it shipped.      </li>
      <li>You can run your fingers through your hair and not even tell you have used hairspray; it&#x27;s soft and falls right back in place.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and have for many years, it is just very difficult to find in stores</li>
      <li>I have that hard-to-handle naturally curly hair, and this product keeps it natural looking and managable.</li>
      <li>love it but takes a little long to get here</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of products to keep my hair from frizzing when the humidity gets high (including all of those oily serums that have the word \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; in the name of the product), but this is the only one that keeps my hair frizz-free.</li>
      <li>There is no other hair spray on the market that leaves your hair as shiny and manageable while holding your style in place as Mink.</li>
      <li>I use natural make-up like Bobbi Brown or Laura Mercier, sold only in stores like Nordstroms, Macy&#x27;s, Saks, etc.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product and have for many years, it is just very difficult to find in stores these days.&lt;br /&gt;The only place to purchase now is online.&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend Mink Oil Hairspray to all my female friends.&lt;br /&gt;It has good holding power without being stiff or drying.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years, but after moving to another state 3 years ago, could not find a store that carried it.  I tried every other kind of hairspray imaginable, and nothing can close.  I finally turned to the internet because it was worth having it shipped.      I don&#x27;t like an artificial look.  I use natural make-up like Bobbi Brown or Laura Mercier, sold only in stores like Nordstroms, Macy&#x27;s, Saks, etc.  Mink Difference is the hairspray of equivalent quality but not price.  It holds your hair in place, but does not feel stiff at all. You can run your fingers through your hair and not even tell you have used hairspray; it&#x27;s soft and falls right back in place.  I have that hard-to-handle naturally curly hair, and this product keeps it natural looking and managable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a creature of habit, I suppose, but I have been using Mink hairspray for many years. I have tried many other hairsprays --particularly since I stopped being able to find Mink on the shelves of most stores I shop in-- but none did as well for me as Mink. I like Mink because it does hold, is not stiff, and leaves my very fine hair with some body even after I comb through it and remove the \\&quot;hold.\\&quot; Also, I lived in Florida for a number of years and found Mink worked best in that humid climate. I like the \\&quot;original\\&quot; better than the \\&quot;new, improved\\&quot; formula. And I liked the high humidity formula best, but I can no longer find that--not even through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this hairspray. It has the right amount of holding power, not to stiff, but good enough to hold my hair style in place all day. I was really sad when I could no longer find this product in our area. What a relief to have come across this on Amazon. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used Mink Hairspray for years.  It use to be available in the stores but the only place one can find it is on line.  Love this hairspray.  Smells great, soft hold not stiff, and brushes and combs out easily.  Doesn&#x27;t dry or break my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have no complaints. It gives my hair just enough texture to hold well</li>
    <li> love it but takes a little long to get here</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for years. I love it because it has great hold without being stiff or sticky like most hairsprays. I also get compliments on my perfume when I use it. I don&#x27;t use perfumes. Would recommend it to anyone who uses hairspray!</li>
    <li> I have very fine fragile hair and Mink works better for me than anything.  Others are too heavy or even create breakage but this does the job without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed that it was described as \\&quot;pump\\&quot;, but it is \\&quot;arosole\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Still is my favorite brand, but I wanted the pump bottle.  Anybody know where I can get the pump bottle?</li>
    <li> This is a very good hairspray.I have been using it for years.These last years I could not find it,..in my area,..to buy it anymore.So,am ordering it off the internet.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair spray that holds well and washes out easily. It is becoming a rare item and very few stores are stocking it in our area - thank goodness it is still available online!</li>
    <li> I used this and I looked like a wet rat. This does not work on a hair style that has some body. This weighs down your hair and is discusting. This would be great if you had oily stringy hair and wanted to keep it that way. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This spray holds like I need it to, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; hair. Keeps hair smoother and shinier. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Use to use it a lot but no one carried it on the shelf.  It gives your hair body more so than stiffness.  Doesn&#x27;t break your hair or dry it out.</li>
    <li> There is no other hair spray on the market that leaves your hair as shiny and manageable while holding your style in place as Mink. Been using it for years and years.</li>
    <li> Just like the cheaper brands of hair spray to me an overrated and expensive to me,  So will look further and see what is out there,</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of some of the reviews, but I find that it is drying out my hair and I will have to stop using it. Also, it has a scent somewhat like a cheap men&#x27;s cologne, very unpleasant. This product did not work out for me.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is by far and away the most effective product for controlling frizz after you blowdry and/or set your hair.  It is even better than Mink&#x27;s own humidity control hairspray.  I have tried dozens of products to keep my hair from frizzing when the humidity gets high (including all of those oily serums that have the word \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; in the name of the product), but this is the only one that keeps my hair frizz-free. It also leaves no residue on your hair and does not make it fill stiff at all. It is too bad that it is difficult to find anywhere but the internet.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! WISH I COULD STILL BUY IT LOCALLY!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will do business again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and just love it........makes the hair very manageable.  I used to buy it at Walgreens, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there anymore.  Besides, Amazon has had the best prices for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for the last 15-20 years. I was able to buy it at Walmart and most drug stores. Then about 8 yrs ago, Walgreens was the only place I could buy it. Now they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it and Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found that sells it. So disappointing!  I&#x27;ve tried other hairsprays and have not found anything close to Mink!! Tres Ame is fine but nothing like Mink. As long as Amazon sells it, I&#x27;ll buy it unless the cost goes up. Right now, I&#x27;m paying over twice the cost of what I was paying at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> On December 4, I tried to place an order for Mink Difference hairspray [[ASIN:B000GCUOS0 MINK DIFF AERO HR SPR X-HOLD Size: 7 OZ]]and the system would not let me.  I really wanted this product.</li>
    <li> Does not leave a white residue on dark hair. The smell is a little dated and overpoweringly feminine. I am a man with dark hair and I just want it to stay put without smelling like a granny. It did cause some blemishes around my hairline, but that can be avoided by protecting your face when you spray. I ended up switching products to L&#x27;Oreal® Paris Elnett unscented Satin Hairspray. I like it much better. My big issue was the white residue on my dark hair and that leaves none.</li>
    <li> Great product that holds your hair in place but is not sticky or stiff. Have used it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray off and on for many years.  I like it as it does not seem as drying as some and really seems to add volume and hold to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The next day my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it did at first so I always have to wash my hair.  For a special occasion this is great. Does just as advertised</li>
    <li> Wish they still made in the pump.  Have used this brand for years as it the only one I have found that does not yellow my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I have always used Mink Hair Spray and it works perfectly for me.  My local retail stores do not carry it any longer so I had to look elsewhere to purchase.  It is the only hair spray that does not affect my allergies.</li>
