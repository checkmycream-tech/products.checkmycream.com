      <li>Have been using this product for years and will continue to do so - amazing stuff!</li>

      <li>It feels so good when I apply it</li>
      <li>Always a good product but dispenser does not work as well this time...</li>
      <li>I am seeing good results as my skin&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
      <li>Your skin will love it!</li>
      <li>Smooth application that just feels great on skin</li>
      <li>It is a nice vitamin C and E cream.</li>
      <li>Recommended by my cosmetologist, using it 2 years now, goes on smoothly, silky feel, loved the way my skin looked, got compliments.</li>
      <li>The lotion went on very smooth.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>it seems to keep my skin more even toned and smoother.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks better than it has in ages.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff?</li>
      <li>I was glad to find  it at a discount at Amazon.</li>
      <li>look a bit more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Always love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this line</li>
      <li>I have to resort to taking the top off and taking some out with a Q tip.</li>
      <li>Love the way this feels.</li>
      <li>Love it today, loved it yesterday, and will continue to love it next week.</li>
      <li>The results are fabulous.</li>
      <li>It feels fantastic on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Helps smooth out skin.</li>
      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if the &amp;#34;antioxidant protection&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;helping to improve the appearance of skin tone, texture and firmness.&amp;#34;  I will continue to use it because it feels so nice and just hope for the best!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>The blurb on this product says, &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, which is absolutely true.  </li>
      <li>Great product, but not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Everyone should use some kind of C&amp;E product on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>great moisturizer, eliminates the facial oily appearance, gives natural glow to the skin.</li>
      <li>It feels like silk when I first put it on.  </li>
      <li>This is the 2nd time that I have bought this product and not been able to get the pump to work correctly.</li>
      <li>but if you can start much earlier in life, all the better.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I really do like this product.</li>
      <li>I really do like this product</li>
      <li>Very timely in delivery.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>Is I didn&#x27;t like the product so much</li>
      <li>This difference is very visible.</li>
      <li>I like this product, and I believe it is authentic, but as other reviewers have noted here, the pump does not dispense the product correctly.</li>
      <li>Nothing magical, just average lotion/moisturizer.</li>
      <li>One small dab will cover your whole face and then add daily moisturizer with SPF 30 (I use Cerave) and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>to high priced</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>While I did see some improvements to my skin with it, I won&#x27;t be buying it again because as much as I can try and guess at what I should be applying each day, I went through it much faster than I should have with having to dump it out each time and then excess would spill over each time after screwing the pump back on so</li>
      <li>love it; only comment is the pricing, sometimes it is up or down.  </li>
      <li>Much better but for two weeks my face was a mess- peeling, red, burned.</li>
      <li>Fabulous silky serum I use everyday.  </li>
      <li>After comparing the pump to another one I purchased directly from Skin Medica, it seems to me that the pump in the product I purchased on Amazon is defective.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist  recommended this  creme and gave me a few free samples to try out</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I have been using it for nearly a year.</li>
      <li>The only down side is the initial cost, but when you have it last for over two months it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>After pressing it into skin, let dry completely before applying foundation.</li>

<li> Have used other products in the past.</li>
<li> It is not greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> , it is not greasy and seems to firm my skin.</li>
<li> it would either go to waste or I would over apply.</li>
<li> Like many other reviewers I was very disappointed with the packaging and dispensing of this product.</li>
<li> Dont see any difference in appearance of skin in past month.  </li>
<li> I have been using the Vitamin C &amp; E complex for a few years.  </li>
<li> and E complex is healing as well as a cure for dead tired skin.</li>
<li> This Vitamin C and E Complex  </li>
<li> Very frustrating, not to mention wasteful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is definitely the &amp;#34;Real Thing&amp;#34;......and was received by me in a timely manner.  I&#x27;ve used this product for about 10 years and while they&#x27;re gouging pricewise....I haven&#x27;t explored a companion product.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective cream that helps diminish skin blemishes and sunspots on the face and neck areas--My skin looks great! My esthetician&#x27;s recommendation of this product was a great one!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for my face.  It feels so good when I apply it and I know I&#x27;m enriching my skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my cosmetologist, using it 2 years now, goes on smoothly, silky feel, loved the way my skin looked, got compliments. Last few months, it is &amp;#34;hohum&amp;#34;, maybe my skin is used to it. May not re-order.</li>
    <li> It is good, but I thought perhaps it would brighten up my day look a bit more.</li>
    <li> Nothing magical, just average lotion/moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My dermatolgost reccemmended this product a year ago and I have been using it ever since. I truley believe this product helps prevent wrinkles and makes my skin look younger. You only need a small amount. I use it every morning under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and received as promised.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I have been using it for nearly a year. It is the best corrective moisturizer for your face. Everyone should use some kind of C&amp;E product on a daily basis. One small dab will cover your whole face and then add daily moisturizer with SPF 30 (I use Cerave) and you are good to go. I didn&#x27;t start using it until my 60s but if you can start much earlier in life, all the better. It may seem expensive but it lasts a long time at one squirt a day and at Amazon it is more affordable than the doctors office. Your skin will love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with results I see.  Have used other products in the past. This has worked best for me.  I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product</li>
    <li> Fabulous silky serum I use everyday.  This difference is very visible.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, eliminates the facial oily appearance, gives natural glow to the skin. It is a bit pricy</li>
    <li> Although I love the product because it makes my skin feel very moistured and soft, I hate the container it is in. This is the 2nd time that I have bought this product and not been able to get the pump to work correctly. I have to resort to taking the top off and taking some out with a Q tip. Is I didn&#x27;t like the product so much I would not go through this again.</li>
    <li> Dont see any difference in appearance of skin in past month.  to high priced</li>
    <li> Love it today, loved it yesterday, and will continue to love it next week. Did I tell you I love this stuff?</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and will continue to do so - amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> The lotion went on very smooth. It is not greasy or heavy. With that said,  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in skin appearance at all. it is a pricey product as well.</li>
    <li> Skinmedica products are the best.  I have been using the Vitamin C &amp; E complex for a few years.  I also use the serum by this same line.  This product line is well respected and sold in dermatologists&#x27; offices so I trust it. You will see the results I promise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s s knock off. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Not used it long enough to see anything dramatic. My PS recommends skinmedica products.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product., it is not greasy and seems to firm my skin.</li>
    <li> The pump did not work with this container.  I am having to use a q-tip to get the solution out.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and I believe it is authentic, but as other reviewers have noted here, the pump does not dispense the product correctly. Either nothing comes out at all, or the product shoots out like a projectile and ends up all over my bathroom. Very frustrating, not to mention wasteful! After comparing the pump to another one I purchased directly from Skin Medica, it seems to me that the pump in the product I purchased on Amazon is defective. So yes, the price on Amazon is great -- if you don&#x27;t mind having to unscrew the container and shake the product out into your hand every time you want to use it. Not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Always a good product but dispenser does not work as well this time...I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Dislike the container. Needs priming every use even after using as directed.</li>
    <li> Arrived in excellent condition!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product it seems to keep my skin more even toned and smoother.  The only downside of it is that it is actually a small amount for the price.  So I usually end up buying one a month because it doesn&#x27;t last long so a little pricy for the amount they give you.</li>
    <li> Skinmedica was prescribed my doctor. I found a great price on amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, especially for those of us over 40. The results are fabulous.</li>
    <li> In the two months I have been using this I have noticed my skin is softer looking and the lines are not as pronounced.  It feels like silk when I first put it on.  The only down side is the initial cost, but when you have it last for over two months it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Very timely in delivery. This product was exactly what I wanted. It is a nice vitamin C and E cream.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin. I am seeing good results as my skin&lt;br /&gt;is looking smoother and softer. It is not greasy or oily like other&lt;br /&gt;Vit. C serums. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers I was very disappointed with the packaging and dispensing of this product. While I did see some improvements to my skin with it, I won&#x27;t be buying it again because as much as I can try and guess at what I should be applying each day, I went through it much faster than I should have with having to dump it out each time and then excess would spill over each time after screwing the pump back on so it would either go to waste or I would over apply. Great product, but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with tri retinol Es for about five days then my skin started burning and I had to stop. I am now using the vitamin c &amp; e again but with tri retinol regular strength. Much better but for two weeks my face was a mess- peeling, red, burned.</li>
    <li> Your skin will thank you for using skinmedica, and this prod it c and E complex is healing as well as a cure for dead tired skin. Love this line and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product the first time I used it.  It feels great upon application and you can feel it penetrating the layers of skin.  It dries almost immediately and almost feels like a talc.  And the results are great, firmer and fresher looking skin.  My only issue is that I think I got a bottle that was half used up.</li>
    <li> The blurb on this product says, &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, which is absolutely true.  It feels fantastic on your skin.  However, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if the &amp;#34;antioxidant protection&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;helping to improve the appearance of skin tone, texture and firmness.&amp;#34;  I will continue to use it because it feels so nice and just hope for the best!</li>
    <li> Always love this product.</li>
    <li> Smooth application that just feels great on skin</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C and E Complex  Skin Lotion is the most wonderful face creme I have used.  My dermatologist  recommended this  creme and gave me a few free samples to try out and I fell in love with it.  My skin looks great when I use it.  I was glad to find  it at a discount at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. My skin looks better than it has in ages.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth out skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. After pressing it into skin, let dry completely before applying foundation. Stings when drying.</li>
    <li> love it; only comment is the pricing, sometimes it is up or down.  Hope the pricing remains affordable.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product, great service</li>
