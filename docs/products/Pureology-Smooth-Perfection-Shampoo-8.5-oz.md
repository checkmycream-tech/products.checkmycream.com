      <li>and it gets my hair clean, but I prefer the moisture one to this one.</li>

      <li>The shampoo was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>It really worked well to smooth my hair especially when used with the smooth conditioner.</li>
      <li>very nice shampoo for thick, curly, colored hair.  </li>

<li> I do wish the price would come down, though.</li>
<li> The shampoo was watered down.</li>
<li> An added bonus is the fact that my scalps itches much less when I use the Pureology products than when I use others.  </li>
<li> (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday) and you&#x27;ll get the results you want in a smoother.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times and it&#x27;s usually thick and creamy, this product was thin and watery - will not order from them again.</li>
<li> Small size for price.</li>
<li> Although I have thick, wavy hair...</li>
<li> I know the purology products are expensive</li>
<li> ;  It also protects your expensive dye job from fading or losing its color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like Pureology and I&#x27;ve used a couple of different variations of their shampoos.  While I like this one a lot, it&#x27;s not my favorite one and I will not get it again.  It&#x27;s a good one and it gets my hair clean, but I prefer the moisture one to this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  I have very curly, very wavy hair.  This shampoo tames the masses.  Further, I can go two days between shampoos without my head itching and my hair stinking because of this shampoo.  I hope they never take it off the market!!!</li>
    <li> This is a.good shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair has been keratin treated many times. This shampoo works to prevent build-up and to keep hair looking healthy. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Amazon&#x27;s price is great!</li>

    <li> Great product, smells good! I recommend for people to use. Super happy got product super fast. Good price to buy</li>
    <li> Great shampoo but it makes my hair feel oily. Its &amp;#34;too smooth&amp;#34; for my hair. I have med length hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was exactly what I ordered. It was also delivered quicker that indicated! I would recommend the shampoo and I plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell of the product. My hairdresser uses the brand but I did not care for this one . Small size for price.</li>
    <li> if you color your hair this is a great product that helps keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> Loved this shampoo. It really worked well to smooth my hair especially when used with the smooth conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Makes my hair feel clean without leaving a lot of residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! I really like the way it cleans my hair. I also enjoy the clean smell &amp; you only have to use a small amount to get lots of suds.</li>
    <li> My salon turned my on to this line of color-care shampoo &amp; cond. and I love the &#x27;super smooth&#x27; the best for when i flat-iron my curly hair.  It has the most amazing scent..you totally don&#x27;t need a lot which is awesome because its a bit pricey but it lasts for a while!  I use it as my alternate usually doing a high end one day and a low end brand another so my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to the same thing and be dull.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for over 2 years along with Neuma, Bumble &amp; Bumble and Obliphica which are also great smoothers. Although I have thick, wavy hair...people think my hair is straight after using Pureology Smooth Shampoo. I also use the Pureology Smooth conditioner. Although a bit pricey, these products will last quite a long time (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday) and you&#x27;ll get the results you want in a smoother. Go for it!</li>
    <li> All you need is a small amount and your hair feels so nice and soft. Best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
    <li> The shampoo was watered down. I&#x27;ve used this product several times and it&#x27;s usually thick and creamy, this product was thin and watery - will not order from them again.</li>
    <li> Great salon brand/quality line of shampoo and conditioners recommended by hair stylist and salons for color treated hair. And while it is recommended and great for color treated hair anyone can benefit from these quality shampoos.  I use this kind for shiny hair.  I don&#x27;t color my hair but my hair lacks moisture and shine.  This combination shampoo and conditioner does help restore luster and softness to my dry unmanageable hair.  And its Not Tested on Animals!  Actually even better....Its 100% vegan ingredients and &amp;#34;Zerosulfate&amp;#34;  It also protects your expensive dye job from fading or losing its color.  But I don&#x27;t color my hair so I can&#x27;t speak to this personally.  But others seem to like it for this reason, too.</li>
    <li> My hair is really delicate and I always had problems trying to find the right shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Purerology works and I love it!</li>
    <li> I know the purology products are expensive but I LOVE them.  They always make my hair look great.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Thank you</li>
    <li> pleased with product and delivery</li>
    <li> My stylist says this is the best shampoo for color retention. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now and agree with her. It&#x27;s very thick and lathers up great which means you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
    <li> love this color-safe shampoo. It&#x27;s healthy for me and healthy for my hair - can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel great, but more important I love it because it&#x27;s sulfate free!!!</li>
    <li> I already knew this was a wonderful product.  Amazon pricing is the only way to go!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser started me on this shampoo and its coordinating conditioner, and though I have tried to use less expensive shampoos, I now use only Pureology Super Smooth Shampoo.  I am 62, and my lovely auburn, sleek hair has changed to gray, frizzy, difficult hair.  With these Pureology products and two others, I can wash my hair and let it dry without paying it much attention and not be embarrassed when I go out.  Of course it looks better if I blow it dry and flat iron it, but my point is that it is much more manageable with the Pureology products than without them.  An added bonus is the fact that my scalps itches much less when I use the Pureology products than when I use others.  When I travel and visit a salon other than my &amp;#34;home territory&amp;#34; I take my Pureology products to assure I don&#x27;t have to have something else put on my head.  This product is just that good!  I do wish the price would come down, though.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo. Have been using it for a month and my keratin treatment is intact.</li>
    <li> I love purology!!! Amazing products my hair is so smooth and I don&#x27;t use any hair dryer</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair so soft.  I bought it here because the price is so much lower than at my hairdressers.  The conditioner is awesome too.</li>
