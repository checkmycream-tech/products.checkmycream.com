<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this every time I get a bath.  I love it.  No strong smell and I don&#x27;t feel like it leaves anything on my face.  I love it!</li>
    <li> absolute winner  A must have</li>
    <li> This is one of the few cleansers that will make my face feel clean and not dried out.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a really great facial cleanser, my face always feels so&lt;br /&gt;refreshed and supple after I use it. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a very impressive product! I have very sensitive combination skin that is quite dry but prone to breakouts. Many cleansing products either worsen the dryness or lead to acne flare-ups. This cleanser is gentle enough for my skin, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and removes makeup effectively (even waterproof concealer and eye makeup). I use this in the evenings to remove makeup and soothe my skin (in the morning, I use a salicylic acid cleanser like St. Ives Green Tea Cleanser ([[ASIN:B003JT4F3C Naturally Clear Green Tea Cleanser for Unisex By St.Ives, 6.75 Ounce]]) to gently exfoliate). With once daily use, the 8.5 oz bottle has lasted several months. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I used to use Arbonne NutriMinC cleanser but I read the reviews for this product and decided to try it! It is my new favorite cleanser !!  I won&#x27;t be purchasing Arbonne cleanser again! I love the smell of this, very clean!  No residue and takes off even waterproof mascara without drying out my skin!!!</li>
    <li> The best brand out there for the price--Thus is comparable to Dr. Haushka products that are nearly triple the price. I will be trying the other BWC products!!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS A WINNER IN MY BOOK IN MID FIFTIES NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT HERE... LEAVES SKIN TIGHT CLEAN AND RADIANT LOOKING HELPS TONE AND CLARITY YOULL LIKE IT TOO!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many cleansers over the years from Neutrogena to Clinique to Noxema and everything in between.  I came across this by accident when I was looking for a face wash that was not tested on animals and free of chemicals.  I&#x27;m 32 and have combination skin that is usually oily by the end of the day with occasional zits.  this face wash has a pleasant smell and makes my skin feel so balanced!  I am on my 3rd bottle of it and will continue to buy it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this better than their cream.  The smell is subtle, but clean.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face try or oily.  I like the consistency of it.  A few reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  First of all, nothing about it screams 5 stars to me.  I feel like I have to use a bit more of it than I do other face cleansers in order to clean my face.  And I didn&#x27;t experience some king of transformation in my skin.  It loos like it always looks.  This includes a brief time of just using body wash on my face.  So could definitely be better.  But for the price, the pleasant smell, the evenness in oils, and the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free, I&#x27;m happy with it and have stopped looking for new products to clean my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser a couple weeks ago from a store locally. I started using it slowy as I do with any new product. After washing my face with it for almost a month, it has my praise. It truly cleanses, and is very powerful at doing so. It leaves no residue on your skin, no oil, no weird stickiness, nothing...it REALLY cleanses!! At the same time it is drying. Personally I find pat drying my face with a towel right after washing, then applying a good moisturizer does the trick. This isn&#x27;t listed as an acne cleanser, but my skin has improved greatly since using it. The vitamin C really helps with scaring. This product is awesome in my book, and I will be purchasing again :)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for use in the shower.  It lathers up nicely using as little as a dime&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and will not try anything else.My face never breaks out and it feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love how this cleanser smells and how it feels.  My face feels very clean after using it and the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals makes me want to give it 20 stars.</li>
    <li> Love  the smell. It takes all my makeup off easily  Only flaw I experienced is it&#x27;s a little drying.</li>
    <li> I had terrible acne, I used all the products you can think of to get rid of my acne and nothing worked. Finally, my doctor prescribed antibiotics to stop my break outs. This helped but only once I began seeing pimples and going to the doctor became pricey. I finally  began using this cleanser twice a day and my acne has gone away and my skin looks healthier. I haven&#x27;t taken antibiotics in over 2 years thanks to this cleanser. Thank God! Try it, it really helps!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Bought this elsewhere online because I didn&#x27;t know it was available on Amazon.  I am leaving this review for safety of anyone who purchases.  First night I used it to wash my face.  When I woke in the morning I had puffy bags under my eyes.  I thought to myself, am I getting run-down or sick?  Used it again that night and the next morning my eyes were swollen and big puffy bags, plus skin from my nose up is red and hot.  Looks like a chemical burn.  Now I do not have allergies and have never considered I had sensitive skin.  My boss told me I looked like I was in a bar fight and got punched in both eyes.  I did not use it last night but redness and swelling is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called the company and they said sorry that happened;there are many essential oils in there and you may be allergic to on of them.  Go to the doctor and bring the bottle.  They asked the lot number and I gave it.  They told me it was made in Sept of 2012; about four months ago so it was still good.  The refunded my money.  That was it.  I wondered to myself, so I get burned by your product and I have to pay the doctor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well just be very careful because there are no warnings on the bottle at all.  Do a test in one area for at least two days before you use all over your face.  Your face is precious and you would not want to look like I do at the moment.</li>
    <li> I bought the BWC plain blue label cleanser last year and wanted to try this with Vitamin C since it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin.  This stuff smells a little weird and it left my skin kinda dry.  Not terrible, just not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this brand and decided to try based on reviews.  A few days before it arrived, I had \\&quot;ruined\\&quot; my complexion by trying 2 different fade creams/illuminators.  My whole face was ruddy, and I had these red itchy bumps and little pimples all over my face. Obviously an allergic reaction.  I&#x27;m 53 and felt like a teenager again, but not in a good way.  Thank goodness it arrived sooner than expected, 3 days after this ruddiness/rash/breakout started. I cleansed my face, a little worried that I might react to the essential oils in the product and make things worse, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results after one use.  I had ordered the BWC Vitamin C Renewal Cream as well and it arrived the same day as the cleanser.  After using both these products, I woke up the next morning to see 80% of my face had not only cleared up, but had a glow and more beautiful tone than even before I reacted to the fade creams. Not every product will give everyone the same results, and there&#x27;s always that chance of an allergic reaction, but boy, am I glad I found BWC!  I will be trying more of their products.</li>
    <li> AWESOME  CLEAN FRESH FEELING ON FACE.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product it being vegan and I love the name but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out.  Within minutes of using it my face felt like it had a mask on it (dry).  I put a little lotion on it but I when I woke up the next morning my face was red, blotchy and irritated (thank god for my foundation).  Too bad cause even my boyfriend&#x27;s face got very dry after using it and his skin is nice/soft/clear (mine is sensitive/dry).</li>
    <li> This is a very gently cleanser, it feels the vegan production in it, something that won&#x27;t hurt your skin, but won&#x27;t do anything more than just clean your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this would work well for someone with oily/combo skin. It smells nice, cleans well, but it was a bit too drying for my skin. I have dry skin and felt it dried out my cheeks.</li>
    <li> This product needs only a small amount to work so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C doctors say is very good for facial products so I use it and&lt;br /&gt;have found this to be true. Further, being an animal lover, I always&lt;br /&gt;use products that never involve cruelty to animals!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Completely cleared up my face and didn&#x27;t irritate when I washed like other products do!</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. I have been using the other BWC with the blue label, which I like as well, but I think this is my favorite. I really like the herbal smell and it makes my oily/combination skin feel clean.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting use to but the wash is still very drying to my skin even after several weeks.  I have to stop using and re-try it so its is not an instant satisfaction.  It should not say beauty without cruelty because it is somewhat harsh to skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has gotten rid of a dry patch on my face within a week of using.  Also, it washes off nicely, and my skin feels softer after using it.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase of this.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has my face smooth, I have naturally and acne prone skin it cleanses without drying it out.  In addition a littles goes a long way!  Will buy again, wish I could find it in a store.</li>
    <li> I found this once in a local health food type store and never saw it again there. It is cheaper on line and I like it!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and does not dry out my skin. Clean smelling and does not leave a residue. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the best Facial CLeanser I have used. It makes your face feel wonderful. It leaves my face soft and clean. I also use the mositurizer as well. Seems like it has really improved the health of my skin.</li>
