      <li>My hair is 3C-4a with lots of gray and for protective styling I am wearing a 1B/27 curly wig (La Jay, its awesome too from Amazon) and use this product in both brown and gold to match the front of my hair with the wig and it makes my hair match the wig</li>

      <li>This would be great if it stayed in.  </li>
      <li>It Is Great</li>

      <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>so nice  hair color</li>
      <li>I have medium blonde hair with both highlights and lowlights and this blended in perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I love it, can go longer between pricey hair colorings.</li>
      <li>Love It</li>
      <li>Tested this temporary color spray out on some paper towel before using it in anyone&#x27;s hair, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
      <li>Great for the short term use.</li>
      <li>Great overall product...</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair is washed really good and dry before application.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be an exact match to my hair color</li>
      <li>however, if you are in a humid area, this case may not be true.  </li>
      <li>And you can&#x27;t manipulate it much once its applied so be sure to do your styling BEFORE applying the spray.  </li>
      <li>A very effective spray that showed up golden on my black hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not for swimming, it washes right out.  </li>
      <li>Has certainly added pizzazz to my hair!</li>
      <li>Very Fast</li>
      <li>It is very much temporary and washes out immediately.</li>
      <li>It is very much on the gold side.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to try it first.</li>
      <li>but I might have to try a more blonde color</li>
      <li>so I rinse or co-wash it out of the front of my hair at night or first thing in the morning.  </li>
      <li>the color wouldn&#x27;t shake up and i always got some red color out of the can, and it rubbed off way too easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey and you could probably shop around for a better value, nevertheless, it&#x27;s still worth</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it out...</li>
      <li>I really like</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to put so much on to get some color in my hair.</li>
      <li>For Temperary Golden Blonde Hair Color</li>
      <li>It will only last about a day and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily and somewhat can be brushed out so make it the last step in your styling process.</li>
      <li>It may take a few trys to find your correct shade but this stuff is great for covering grown in roots between hair colorings--a quick spray down parts and crowns and dark (or gray) roots disappear.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of spraying new product over old, your hair will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was so pleasantly surprised that it is.  </li>
      <li>Not much spray within the bottle, especially given that you have to spray the same surface a few times to get the full effect of the blonde high beams as pictured on the can.</li>

<li> It WILL dry your hair out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the product, and wish we could&#x27;ve found a better one for temporary blonde hair in time for Halloween.</li>
<li> I was thinking of using a temporary hair spray to turn my auburn hair a blonde/gold wet color.</li>
<li> Not for streaking your hair unless you have one of those caps to pull strands of hair through, the spray nozzle is not precise enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> Does not lighten on Dark brown Hair.</li>
<li> I had been using those mascara-like touch up products and found them to be messy and dull on my hair.  </li>
<li> unbelievably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The color comes out as bronze and is very hard to see on the hair.</li>
<li> The quality and color are terrible.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t use this brand. The quality and color are terrible. Save your money. Go with the &amp;#34;Jerome...&amp;#34; Brand.</li>
    <li> This would be great if it stayed in.  I&#x27;m wondering because I have dreadlocks is the reason it comes out without me washing it out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this spray intending for it to look like highlights on my hair.  I would never put it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for Halloween!</li>
    <li> Does not lighten on Dark brown Hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to color my hair for school spirit but it&#x27;s really good. I used this before and it worked great on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great overall product... It Is Great For Temperary Golden Blonde Hair Color&lt;br /&gt;I Love It a And It Shiped Very Fast And That&#x27;s A Plus!!</li>
    <li> Has certainly added pizzazz to my hair! Only wish it wasn&#x27;t so temporary.. but I wanted to try it first. A good buy! I love it!</li>
    <li> This looks brassy and makes my hair clump together in globs</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be an exact match to my hair color but I was so pleasantly surprised that it is.  I have medium blonde hair with both highlights and lowlights and this blended in perfectly.  It covers my gray beautifully and allows me to go a bit longer before I spend another $200 at the salon.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The color comes out as bronze and is very hard to see on the hair.</li>
    <li> Not much spray within the bottle, especially given that you have to spray the same surface a few times to get the full effect of the blonde high beams as pictured on the can. Buy a bigger size if you are doing a bigger project.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I had been using those mascara-like touch up products and found them to be messy and dull on my hair.  My hair is 3C-4a with lots of gray and for protective styling I am wearing a 1B/27 curly wig (La Jay, its awesome too from Amazon) and use this product in both brown and gold to match the front of my hair with the wig and it makes my hair match the wig unbelievably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice, this product contains alcohol so I rinse or co-wash it out of the front of my hair at night or first thing in the morning.  It WILL dry your hair out.  So after co-washing, I apply a leave-in (Giovanni), coconut oil, and Shea Moisturizer&#x27;s Hair Smoothie) and then let my hair air dry and then re-apply the spray.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of spraying new product over old, your hair will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for swimming, it washes right out.  And you can&#x27;t manipulate it much once its applied so be sure to do your styling BEFORE applying the spray.  Not for streaking your hair unless you have one of those caps to pull strands of hair through, the spray nozzle is not precise enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it cheaper at my local Korean beauty supply at only $3.99 a can.  I&#x27;m seeing it today, Oct 6, 2013 for $7.57 a can on Amazon!  And I was just checking on Amazon today to see if I could get a quantity price, obviously not.</li>
    <li> A very effective spray that showed up golden on my black hair. Great for the short term use.</li>
    <li> Tested this temporary color spray out on some paper towel before using it in anyone&#x27;s hair, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. Not only is it not light colored, it&#x27;s actually ORANGEY RED. I&#x27;m really disappointed in the product, and wish we could&#x27;ve found a better one for temporary blonde hair in time for Halloween.</li>
    <li> This worked well for my son&#x27;s hair (he just wanted a patch). Make sure your hair is washed really good and dry before application. It will only last about a day and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> i would never buy this again!  the color wouldn&#x27;t shake up and i always got some red color out of the can, and it rubbed off way too easy.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of using a temporary hair spray to turn my auburn hair a blonde/gold wet color. It is very much on the gold side.  It might work but I might have to try a more blonde color so I don&#x27;t have to put so much on to get some color in my hair. It is very much temporary and washes out immediately.</li>
    <li> The product is too reddish in color, when used on my hair.  It is not like Gold Blonde I always use.</li>
    <li> It may take a few trys to find your correct shade but this stuff is great for covering grown in roots between hair colorings--a quick spray down parts and crowns and dark (or gray) roots disappear. Washes out easily and somewhat can be brushed out so make it the last step in your styling process. I love it, can go longer between pricey hair colorings.</li>
    <li> If you need instant highlights, go with this product.  It&#x27;s a little pricey and you could probably shop around for a better value, nevertheless, it&#x27;s still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it out...however, if you are in a humid area, this case may not be true.  In that case, if you are sleeping with a friend, I wouldn&#x27;t use white pillow cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myself?  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Best to You!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RLM</li>
    <li> so nice  hair color so shiny ilove it this spray look good on the hair</li>
    <li> Used for gold finger party and it was great</li>
