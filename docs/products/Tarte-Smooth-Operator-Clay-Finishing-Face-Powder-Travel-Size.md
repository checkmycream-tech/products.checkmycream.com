      <li>Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>best finishing powder i ever used!!</li>
      <li>but my customer experience was great!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful results.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that I am really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Stay awesome :)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I would give this product 5/5 because it&#x27;s amazing at keeping you matte.</li>
      <li>So, honest mistake.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own after moisturizing for skin perfection.</li>
      <li>Nice powder</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product, as my experience with the Tarte brand has been so-so at best, but this is a pretty great powder.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look flawless and so soft!</li>
      <li>Tarte is by far the best make up I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Clay Finishing Powder is by far the best I have ever</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase this product, It is MUCH better and lighter than any pressed powder I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Amazonian clay makeup and just about anything from Tarte.  </li>
      <li>Thank you LAST_ITEMS :)</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>I loved this product not only because tarte is a great brand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to use it more to maybe give a better review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS POWDER.</li>
      <li>It is very light, keeps my face from being shiny, and also seems to smooth, and lessen the appearance of imperfections (brown spots, acne,etc}.</li>
      <li>I make sure I put a light coat of tinted moisturizer as cover up, but this powder over it seemed to significantly minimize the imperfections.</li>
      <li>the powder itself is fantastic, i should have paid for the full size which is twice the price, but contains much more of the product</li>
      <li>It is a joy to put on rather than a daily routine.  </li>
      <li>It gives my skin a nice velvety finish that my normal mineral makeup would&#x27;t give.</li>
      <li>This magical white powder is amazing.</li>
      <li>This works great for people with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good hings about this powder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice, mat, airbrushed finish and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, like most other finishing powders do.</li>
      <li>I got this in the mail in no time and the merchant was so kind to wrap my gift and include a cute little message.</li>
      <li>The price alone makes it worth trying.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I will not only purchase from this merchant but also refer her to all of my friends and fam!</li>
      <li>ON RIGHT OVER MY EYESHADOW</li>
      <li>Right?  </li>
      <li>and it just blends right in.</li>
      <li>I do wish the container made it easier to dispense the product, but overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, now that I tried and absolutely love this product, I will be ordering full size and will be testing their other products.</li>
      <li>Still, I suggest not using any more than absolutely needed if you have dry skin issues.</li>
      <li>It glides on so smoothly and makes your makeup look less makeupy and more natural.</li>
      <li>I work in a high paced restaurant and get hot and sweaty a lot, and I have noticed that my face stays matte for longer with this on.</li>
      <li>It really smoothes and brightens imperfections.</li>
      <li>Item was packed very well and shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be much money, probably, but it&#x27;s the principle of the thing.  </li>
      <li>My skin appearance has improved so much since I have been using this.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Smooth Operator from this seller and the picture shows the white one (which is the one I want).  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between it and the ELF HD powder.</li>
      <li>Which I don&#x27;t really mind seeing how it was so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I cant really tell if this is working or not.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and my oil-prone skin looks pretty awesome with minimal touch-ups required throughout the day.</li>
      <li>so I have to use a different top to another makeup to actually pick it up with my makeup brush.</li>
      <li>any product that&#x27;s a bit pricey, I recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried a product yet, to get a sample from a department store or see if the main website for that particular product is providing samples or carry travel size items.</li>
      <li>However, the powder did break me out on my forehead, so I only using it  from the eyebrows down. :)</li>
      <li>Worn this a couple of times so far</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients are a major bonus!</li>
      <li>if you have a regular normal foundation that matches your complexion you would skip the mineral makeup mix step.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how small the container was, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin around my T-zone and needed a powder that would not make me look older.</li>
      <li>Just to be clear, JJabooks is the seller and they are not only advertizing the wrong powder and not giving an accurate description, but they are also trying to stick me with return costs.</li>

<li> but it&#x27;s just too small.</li>
<li> This is a small container</li>
<li> It definitely is a small travel size container, almost a sample size.</li>
<li> It is difficult to get on a brush</li>
<li> They need to pay that cost since THEY SENT ME THE WRONG MAKEUP!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this \\&quot;travel\\&quot; sized powder is .07 oz. and is not convenient for travel in any way. you still need to pack a brush of some sort and the powder gets everywhere. the powder itself is fantastic, i should have paid for the full size which is twice the price, but contains much more of the product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product, as my experience with the Tarte brand has been so-so at best, but this is a pretty great powder. A little goes a long way, and my oil-prone skin looks pretty awesome with minimal touch-ups required throughout the day. I do wish the container made it easier to dispense the product, but overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nice powder but it&#x27;s just too small.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I was surprised how small the container was, but it is worth it. I have very dry skin around my T-zone and needed a powder that would not make me look older. This works great for people with dry skin. Still, I suggest not using any more than absolutely needed if you have dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> This is a small container and I carry it with my mini kabuki brush to apply on the go. This stuff is amazing! The natural ingredients are a major bonus!</li>
    <li> Tarte is by far the best make up I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is a joy to put on rather than a daily routine.  My skin appearance has improved so much since I have been using this.  Goes great over the Primer from Tarte that I use as a base.  Beautiful results.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good hings about this powder. It is very light, keeps my face from being shiny, and also seems to smooth, and lessen the appearance of imperfections (brown spots, acne,etc}. I make sure I put a light coat of tinted moisturizer as cover up, but this powder over it seemed to significantly minimize the imperfections. I will continue to purchase this product, It is MUCH better and lighter than any pressed powder I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POWDER. I HAVE OILY EYELIDS AND MY EYESHADOW LOOK CRAPPY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. BUT NOT ANYMORE. I SIMPLY PUT THIS ON RIGHT OVER MY EYESHADOW AND IT LOCKS IT ALL IN AND LASTS ALL DAY!!</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5/5 because it&#x27;s amazing at keeping you matte. Plus, it does wonders keeping under eye concealer in place. However, the powder did break me out on my forehead, so I only using it  from the eyebrows down. :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my skin look flawless and so soft!</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday. This magical white powder is amazing. And the travel size will last you forever. Apply after makeup or apply on it&#x27;s own after moisturizing for skin perfection. It glides on so smoothly and makes your makeup look less makeupy and more natural. After buying, I can&#x27;t go without it. The price alone makes it worth trying.</li>
    <li> I loved this product not only because tarte is a great brand but my customer experience was great!! I got this in the mail in no time and the merchant was so kind to wrap my gift and include a cute little message. You do not run  across people like this now of days. I can honestly say I will not only purchase from this merchant but also refer her to all of my friends and fam! Stay awesome :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Amazonian clay makeup and just about anything from Tarte.  However, it&#x27;s not the Tarte product or Amazon that I&#x27;m giving the low rating for.  It&#x27;s the seller.  I ordered the Smooth Operator from this seller and the picture shows the white one (which is the one I want).  They sent BRONZE.  I&#x27;m a really white woman and no way would I even think of ordering bronze makeup.  So, honest mistake.  Right?  They sent me a return label that I have to pay the return price for.  Won&#x27;t be much money, probably, but it&#x27;s the principle of the thing.  They need to pay that cost since THEY SENT ME THE WRONG MAKEUP!  I wrote them that I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay the return shipping and still haven&#x27;t heard anything at all from them.  SHAMEFUL!  Just to be clear, JJabooks is the seller and they are not only advertizing the wrong powder and not giving an accurate description, but they are also trying to stick me with return costs.</li>
    <li> Worn this a couple of times so far and I have to say that I am really happy with the results. I work in a high paced restaurant and get hot and sweaty a lot, and I have noticed that my face stays matte for longer with this on. Of course because of life and nature my face still does get a little shiny over time, but I think that&#x27;s just something that happens. It gives my skin a nice velvety finish that my normal mineral makeup would&#x27;t give. I like it as a setting powder but, because it&#x27;s white and I am not (I&#x27;m Korean) it does lighten my face just a little when wearing my BB cream (which already whitens my face a little). But I just mix a little bit of my mineral makeup to it and it&#x27;s not noticeable. I&#x27;m sure if you have a regular normal foundation that matches your complexion you would skip the mineral makeup mix step. Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with the product. This particular size though is very small. Which I don&#x27;t really mind seeing how it was so inexpensive. It is difficult to get on a brush so I have to use a different top to another makeup to actually pick it up with my makeup brush. Other then that I am definitely going to buy the big version of this.</li>
    <li> I never used the \\&quot;Tarte\\&quot; brand before so I decided to try the travel size before investing $30+ in a cosmetic brand or item I know very little about.&lt;br /&gt;I had the need to test it out as soon as I received my order and all I can say is... \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;!! It leaves a nice, mat, airbrushed finish and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, like most other finishing powders do. No greasy shine after an hour or two. It keeps my face mat and flawless for hours. Wonder how well this powder holds up in Summer tho?&lt;br /&gt;This Clay Finishing Powder is by far the best I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Like any product that&#x27;s a bit pricey, I recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried a product yet, to get a sample from a department store or see if the main website for that particular product is providing samples or carry travel size items. My self, got my travel size Tarte Finishing Powder here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So, now that I tried and absolutely love this product, I will be ordering full size and will be testing their other products. Can&#x27;t wait to try this brands concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. _ This product was ordered thru seller \\&quot;LAST_ITEMS\\&quot;. Item was packed very well and shipping was fast. Thank you LAST_ITEMS :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. It&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ve been watching makeup you tube videos and they inspired me to purchase it but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between it and the ELF HD powder. It definitely is a small travel size container, almost a sample size. I&#x27;ll have to use it more to maybe give a better review.</li>
    <li> best finishing powder i ever used!! i have dark skin and it just blends right in. it does not make me look like a ghost. it also mattifies you face.. i will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> This powder is wonderful and will make your face look like a porcelain doll. It really smoothes and brightens imperfections. But this trial size is extremely messy and does not distribute well. You open it up and it all flies out. Use caution as it&#x27;s not easy to use when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> I cant really tell if this is working or not.  I do not like the travel size because the powder is all over the place</li>
