<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I Love this toothpaste, feels great, taste great</li>
    <li> Much smaller than the size I get for the same price from Costco...  toothpaste package is cheap and leaks.</li>
    <li> The FDA banned the use of Novamin in any toothpaste two years ago.  I get mine from Canada, where it is available everywhere.  However, someone has to go to Canada to purchase it.  Luckily I have people who will purchase large quantities for me.  US citizens should be angry with the FDA not the pharmaceutical companies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fixed my sensitivity problem, and makes my teeth feel much cleaner after brushing. I&#x27;ll continue to use it always.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive teeth or even teeth that aren&#x27;t.  I gave it 4 stars only because it is on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
    <li> I bought this product out of curiosity and was greatly surprised at how fresh tasting it is.  It is not pasty but a smooth texture.  It has helped with a couple sensitive teeth that I had.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is low foam, and I love it because of that. It also helps with tooth sensitivity - I have some receding gums with exposed roots, and the toothpaste helps with it. I can tell the difference at the dental office - it used to be real torture to clean those bad teeth and now it is tolerable. My dentist says it is ok to use the paste all the time, unless it is a new pain or in a new place - then I should call to check what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;The paste tastes sweet, but not too sweet, and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  My husband and I have very sensitive teeth.  We have been using this toothpaste for year&#x27;s.  It has really helped us.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Really works for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews that it makes your teeth tingle, but I&#x27;m not so sure that is making the teeth more sensitive or just a reaction to my teeth being sensitive.  It does feel like it puts a coating on your teeth and for some reason I feel like it is protecting them. however, I&#x27;m looking for the type with Noviam which is only shipped from the UK, so I returned.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste.  plus, it works</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste.  My teeth are less sensitive and it tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Contains .454% stannous fluoride, a re-purposed toxic waste, and carries the warning &amp;#34;Keep out of reach of children.  If more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product, sensitive on teeth, tastes good as well. Plus my dentist likes this brand. Winner!</li>
    <li> Any time I feel a little pain or discomfort on my teeth this toothpaste is the first primary dentist that I go to...after using for a couple of time the discomfort is gone... I would recommend daily use or using it with another toothpaste every other day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SOOO glad I bought this as I use the crest 3d white strips and this reassures me that my enamel is protected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over a month and I still haven&#x27;t seen a difference in sensitivity. Also I don&#x27;t think this product has any whitening benefits so I can see that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white. I think this is a totally pointless buy, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It&#x27;s not awful just didn&#x27;t give me any results. It was late in shipping too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I was watching t.v. and seen a commercial for this product pop up, and from what I remember it just leaves a thin film on your teeth to protect them from foods and drinks so the enamel doesn&#x27;t deteriorate anymore than it has. It&#x27;s also supposed to protect the teeth from pain and sensitivity which it really hasn&#x27;t for me but I have noticed that with this toothpaste I can feel that my teeth are kind of slippery, it&#x27;s hard to describe but I can tell there is a layer of something on them after brushing with sensodyne. So...I think this may be a good toothpaste to prevent your teeth from becoming even more damaged and that&#x27;s about it. Also, I don&#x27;t think it cleans them well enough (maybe that&#x27;s just my imagination) so I use regular whitening toothpaste and then I rinse and use this product.</li>
    <li> Helps my teeth feel good</li>
    <li> I would say that its effect of protecting enamel is obvious. The foam is mild. I highly recommend it. This is the reason I bought it twice and going to buy it when my storage is run out.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED SENSODYNE SINCE IT CAME OUT AND ANYTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET DOES NOT STAND A CHANCE. AND MY WIFE STARTED USING IT FOUR MONTHS AGO, AND SHE SAID THAT IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN THE ONES THAT SAY SENSITIVE TOOTHPASTE.</li>
    <li> Love  the convenience and since I have sensitive teeth from time to time due to Lupus.</li>
    <li> This package is a lie, unless your teeth are made out of fluorine, this won&#x27;t repair anything. Get the genuine article from uk here on amazon.[[ASIN:B008VPSTOA Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect Whitening Toothpaste 75ml]]    Also, all of the discoloration reviews are from this paste not the real one, google ingredients for pictures.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sensodyne forever.  I tried other brands with the same active ingredient and for some reason I have to go back to this (due to teeth pain).  I particularly like this one because it is like paste (very clay like).  I don&#x27;t know why I find it pleasing to brush with, I just do.  I like it much better than the gels, and I would not have thought I would.  The flavor is muted which I also like.</li>
    <li> Added fluoride to build tooth strength.&lt;br /&gt;If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT... as I get older my teeth have become more sensitive and Dentist recommended,&lt;br /&gt;It really does work... I can eat or drink without any problems.  I have used it over a year and my last two&lt;br /&gt;Cleanings the dentist indicated he has seen an improvement in gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> The flavor wasn&#x27;t great. but worked well</li>
    <li> good product and its worth the price because inside of the store they sale it way high</li>
    <li> I use it every day. very good.</li>
    <li> I started to get receding gums and the teeth were getting sensitive to hot or cold. Been using now for a couple months and it has improved my teeth remarkedly.</li>
    <li> I did like that my teeth did feel &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; after using this product, but unfortunately the feeling didn&#x27;t last all day.  However, as a side benefit my teeth did seem whiter after using it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dentist...  I had a sensitivity in my tooth since I am using Sensodyne it really helps and 80-85% sensitivity is gone. Very nice product ...</li>
    <li> My new favorite sensitive teeth toothpaste. Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a funky aftertaste in your mouth after you brush.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I use for my sensitive teeth. I am able to use teeth whiteners from my dentist because of Sensodyne Repair and Protect. I appreciate this greatly as having bright, white teeth is one of the things I do for me.</li>
    <li> Its too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Works great, lots of foam so I feel like my teeth are cleaner...probably not actually true but its nice to have a clean mouth feel!</li>
    <li> Better than other brands and doesn&#x27;t taste awful like Colgate</li>
    <li> This is a very &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; toothpaste. I like the other Sensodyne stuff, such as Pronamel, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot for my traveling needs. As others have said, the US version doesn&#x27;t have the chemical that the rest-of-the-world gets...so this is a very forgettable and mediocre toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it taste good? It&#x27;s a very mild toothpaste flavor, nothing offensive or remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it clean well? Hard to say,but it&#x27;s no better or worse than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t bother buying this again when there&#x27;s plenty of other basic toothpastes in the same travel size for half the money. Hopefully a better selection of travel-sized Pronamel will appear on here.</li>
    <li> As others noted, doesn&#x27;t contain the reparative ingredient novamin. Not a problem with me, since most of my teeth have crowns. I bought it for its desensitizing feature and it works as good as any other Sensodyne I&#x27;ve used. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  Was so glad that I did have to make a trek to the store to purchase this.  would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne Pronamel since it first came out and I received a sample.  I switched to this because if it does what it says it does then that&#x27;s what I need.  Of course I&#x27;m no dentist so I probably will not notice a difference.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it is more &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; than Pronamel Gentle Whitening.  If you put too much or you don&#x27;t put it in your mouth quick enough it will drip off of your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for people who have sensitive teeth like me. I really cant bear the tingling like sensation that comes with pain everytime I eat ice cream or drink any cold beverages. With this, I can indulge myself back to eating ice creams. It has been a big help for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, does what it is supposed to, cleans teeth and is recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> Tastes Good.  Lessens my sensitivity to cold products like ice cream.</li>
    <li> After using half of this tube of toothpaste brushing twice a day and flossing once a day, my gums near the base of my teeth and under the tongue became red and sore.  It was almost a burning feeling.  I have used regular sensodyne and regular pronamel with no problem.  After calling my dentist office they shared their issues with the repair and protect.  I discontinued use of the repair and protect and am using the original sensodyne with no problem now.  My gums have healed.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste actually made my teeth more sensitive</li>
    <li> I got this because it was supposed to have novamin as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Not so--even though the search for products with novamin turns up this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Does it repair and protect?  I have NO idea, but it does easy the pain in my teeth caused be microscopic cracks, etc., as do all the Sensodyne products.  My dentist said that if they continue to be sensitive I should rub a small amount down at the gum line before I go to bed, and leave it there.  I have done that, and it works!  So why only 4?  If it IS repairing, why do they continue to hurt?</li>
    <li> I was having one sensitive tooth and whenever i had something cold i felt a sharp pain. So i ordered this and it served well. I used it twice a day and i found it gave better results when i brush before bed time.</li>
    <li> If you have had issues with sensitive teeth, this stuff is almost as good as the prescription toothpaste. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  I suffer with a lot of pain and this has really helped me.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste and does aid with my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I did like this. My only problem with the Toothpaste is that it comes out of the tube like thick milk. It falls onto the brush abd drops into the sink.... I lost more toothpaste that way.... When I finish this tube I will try something else.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the plain Sensodyne toothpaste for my sensitive teeth. It worked well. I took it one step farther by buying and using the Sensodyne Repair toothpaste.  This formulation de-sensitizes my teeth while it fills in the micro-pores of my aging enamel on my teeth.  This is the only toothpaste I will use.</li>
    <li> Happy with it Sensodyne makes great toothpaste, although I have tried other Sensodyne that I have liked better.</li>
    <li> The ingredient that use to actually be used for the Repair/Protect part of the toothpaste has been removed so I don&#x27;t see how this toothpaste can make the claim with the same active ingredients in all other toothpastes.  I guess mislabeling products is no longer an issue to be worried about anymore</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve compared 3 types of sensodyne now and this one works the best.  It&#x27;s milder in flavor than the others which is nice (it&#x27;s less sweet)  Using every day my teeth feel stronger and don&#x27;t hurt.  I think this really works.</li>
    <li> so...I subscribed to receive regularly&lt;br /&gt;I liked it. but the price is little high when we compared with other tooth paste</li>
    <li> I got some dental work done over a month ago, and I started using Sensodyne at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation to help with the cold sensitivity. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all and actually it seems like the pain/sensitivity is getting worse! The flavor is nice, but the paste is less paste-y and more liquid-y. It runs all over the place!</li>
    <li> #1 recommended by my dentist.  Very gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> as far as repairing and protecting, they can&#x27;t get sued for false advertising when you I&#x27;ve no idea how to prove or disprove it&#x27;s effectiveness</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste and the seller is timely.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sensodyne toothpaste as I think it tastes the best. Since using sensodyne I am able to finally eat cold food &amp; my sensitivity has gone away completely. While pregnant I chewed up ice all day. This product is worth every penny &amp; I am happy it is a part of the Amazon subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
    <li> Some dentist have recommended not using this all the time.  I use it on 4 week off 1 week and repeat.  I love it, and I bleed less.</li>
    <li> This product hurts my teeth every time I brush with it. I don&#x27;t know why, but it just doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of relieving hypersensitivity. I recently got my teeth cleaned hypersonically, and using this toothpaste HURT after that especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient which is key behind the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; aspect of things, Novamin (calcium sodium phosphosilicate) was swapped with stannous flouride in the US released Sensodyne R&amp;P. Not that stannous flouride is a bad thing for toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t actively promote remineralization of teeth like Novamin does. Why GSK chose to rush R&amp;P onto the US market without fighting the FDA bull crap and doing it right, I can only attribute to money grubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also strange that all of the smaller toothpaste brands on the US market which contained Novamin are disappearing. Dr. Collins, Burt&#x27;s Bees, and Sultan HC have all been unexplainably discontinued or \\&quot;reformulated\\&quot;. Such a mystery conjures up theatrical images of corporate espionage, but the more likely explanation is that GSK is refusing to supply Novamin to those companies ever since they bought the rights to Novamin. Monopoly, anyone?</li>
    <li> All I can say is, It Works.  This toothpaste has helped to relieve sensitive areas of my teeth and gums when used on a daily basis.  This product will be re-ordered.</li>
    <li> Save hundreds with this instead of going to dentist.</li>
    <li> Sensodyne REPAIR ~ WORKS!  I have problem teeth, recently started using Sensodyne Repair, no pain right away. I went on vacation and forgot my tooth paste. Told my daughter to get some and she picked up the wrong one. I noticed an immediate negative difference.  Came home started using it again and what do you know!!! No tooth pain. I&#x27;m SOLD for life!!!</li>
    <li> Cold water &amp; certain foods would cause me to cringe. I use Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect at least twice a day and it has made a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes fresh and minty. It doesn&#x27;t taste bitter. This product instantly relieved the dull aching sensitivity on my molars. I let the paste rest on my teeth for a minute each time I brush. This toothpaste is also my go to after using tooth whitening products. I love this lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I love Sensodyne.  We used the Pronamel for a long while.  We decided to try this since it was subscribe &amp; save.  It actually uses a different active ingredient than the usual potassium nitrate.  I forget the name since we threw it out.  Basically, it burned our mouths and didn&#x27;t seem to help when brushing our sensitive teeth.  We went back to Pronamel (pricey!) and I started Colgate sensitive and like that product much better.</li>
    <li> Love that Seonsodyne has come out with a Repair formula. It has everything I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;An established product, with a great track record.&lt;br /&gt;Helps my teeth from ice cream scream, and has an ingredient which works to help repair the teeth. As enamel Cannot be fixed, it must be helping my gums. Thinking it&#x27;s working on the teeth as well.&lt;br /&gt;My smile looks mahhhhhvalous dahling!</li>
    <li> I was having sensitivity on the upper right side of my mouth where the large molar is located.  My dentist recommended this product since he could not find anything wrong after taking x-rays.  Well, I&#x27;m delighted to say that after about a week, I no longer have sensitivity to hot and cold liquids or foods.  I would recommend this product in a heartbeat to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever for sensitive teeth. My husband uses this for sensitivy to cold drinks and ice cream. He loves it! Without this toothpaste he is in missory. His Dentist recommended it and it works!</li>
    <li> I have seen the ads for this particular toothpaste brand numerous times and have always wanted to try it because the buyers weren&#x27;t actors but real people. Yet when I finally try one the brand&#x27;s toothpaste, the results just after 1 use is horribly shocking. For example, I thought it would give you a fresh, clean feeling from usage, but instead my mouth felt like how it was when I woke up which is very bad. I actually had to find another toothpaste so my breath wouldn&#x27;t smell bad and my teeth would look visibly clean, which it didn&#x27;t with this toothpaste. Overall, I will never try this toothpaste brand again and would never recommend this to someone else.</li>
    <li> Love it! My mouth feels extra clean after using Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> i t works for me nuttin hurts my teeth after using this found somtin cheaper dollar store doesnt work as well  when my bug is good i will get this</li>
    <li> I mentioned in some other health care product reviews that my hair is the only good thing I got going for me. I wasn&#x27;t kidding. My teeth are always gnawing back at me. I brush, floss, see the dentist regularly but there is no way to get around the sensitivity I experience. My dentist recommended this Sensodyne Repair and Protect product and I went for it. After four or five tubes--pricey tubes, I might add--it was no better than regular Sensodyne or similar products. I mean, it&#x27;s okay, and it lasts for a couple of hours, but then I feel I need to brush with it again, even if I haven&#x27;t eaten anything or had any hot or cold beverage at that moment. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something else. Anyone have a recommendation?</li>
    <li> Good price on by far the best toothpaste if you have sensitivity problems. I have tried the competitors from crest, Colgate, etc. this is easily the best</li>
    <li> Price here is about like Walmart and much more convenient here.  Sensodyne really works for me.</li>
    <li> I only use Sensodyne anymore.  I have sensitive teeth and there was a noticeable difference in how often I would react to hot/cold food, etc. after using this for awhile.  I also have an easy gag reflex, and the taste doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I can use.</li>
    <li> After getting some dental work done I found my teeth were very temperature sensitive.  The dentist recommended another product with stannous fluoride, but I saw that this had the same concentration of stannous fluoride at a much cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of brushing with it, I&#x27;ve been squeezing a quantity into my mouth and swishing it around for ~15 minutes or until my mouth is about to burst open from saliva buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my sensitivity to cold temperatures.  It hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely, but it&#x27;s a lot more manageable at this point.</li>
    <li> Best tooth paste and the price is great here!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the active ingredient NovaMin for some reason in the US.  This ingredient is the only real reason for having the &amp;#34;repair and protect&amp;#34; label, thus this product is not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste. If you have sensitive teeth or any type of pain; invest in this. It&#x27;s a little but more expensive but it&#x27;s well worth it I promise you.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my teeth since a dentist many years ago cut back my gums. This toothpaste purports to repair and strengthen teeth. It does. I was a bit skeptical but I have read independent reviews by dentists and when I went to the dentist for my cleaning everything was in good shape. I alternate it with Pronamel whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has something seriously wrong with it. Every time I use it, my tongue hurts and feels weird afterwards, and the paste itself feels almost warm; it&#x27;s really strange and not pleasant. Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in my tooth sensitivity. I do not recommend this product at all. Other Sensodyne toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried have been fine, but I will never buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the only kind I can use with comfort. My teeth have become sensitive with age, and other toothpastes just set my teeth on edge.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Sensodyne toothpaste. I tried some of their other flavors and couldn&#x27;t stand the taste, but this one has good flavor and does a great job with sensitivity! If I use another toothpaste even for just a couple days, my teeth start to hurt again when I drink cold beverages. This brings my teeth sensitivity down to practically nothing. It may be more expensive than regular toothpaste, but it is worth every cent. I tried other brands of sensitive toothpaste too, and none of them worked like Sensodyne does. They are the only brand for people with heat/cold sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I have learned that  the Stannous Fluoride in this toothpaste  provides more protection for anti-sensitivity (which I have) than all the other toothpastes out there! The other toothpastes use Potassium  Nitrate as an anti-sensitivity protection! It is a little pricey but it works for me! Craig S.</li>
    <li> If your teeth ache because of too much acid, this product takes care of it.  Truly amazing!!!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommends this, and it has really helped with sensitivity.  I hate the little foil cover they put under the cap.  Seems overkill to me since the box is sealed shut.</li>
    <li> My problem with Sensodyne, historically, has been that my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m done brushing. I have exposed roots, so I need sensitive toothpaste, but have avoided Sensodyne for years.  The mint is was mild that I was nervous about my breath, and just didn&#x27;t feel clean. This is no longer the case, as they have kicked up the minty with this formula.  Works well on my sensitive teeth, and gives me fresh breath and a clean mouth feeling.  A very nice surprise!</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste for those of us who have sensitive teeth and gums. It also whitens your teeth and no it is not like sand paper scrub.</li>
    <li> Just as the other reviewers stated, no novamin in the US version. If you are going to buy this because of the novamin technology, don&#x27;t bother. Might as well get a toothpaste at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I will likely stop using this as it hurt the moment I applied it to my teeth to brush them. I have used it for several days, it seems to hurt a bit less now, but have  never had a tooth paste make my teeth ache just using it to brush them.  Uncertain if it may cause long term teeth sensitivity as only teeth product I have ever applied to my teeth in the past that caused them to ache was a tooth whitening product, and even that took 20-30 minutes to ache, it wasn&#x27;t instant.  I am not using Sensodyne with whitener - so not certain why it&#x27;s causing pain.</li>
    <li> Good for those wishing to reduct tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This particular Sensodyne is doing a better job of helping sensitive areas than the whitening one I had been using.</li>
    <li> Good product really works repairing you gums</li>
    <li> As I to have searched, Fda hasnt&#x27;t approved it yet for U.S. Sells... Stupid! I hope it comes sooner rather then later.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Sensodyne, and regular use of this toothpaste has staved off a root canal for a really sensitive tooth.  Five starts for the product, 2 stars for the amazon price.  It&#x27;s a much better deal to buy this toothpaste in the four packs at Costco.  You get almost twice as much for the same price.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my dentist when I complained that I get sweet tooth when eating any chewy sweets (like my favorite Skittles). After a week I already noticed the difference and been sweet-tooth free ever since! It&#x27;s also a great and cheap subscribe &amp; save item to add if you are trying to reach that 5th item for the 15% discount.</li>
    <li> I can tell a real difference in the condition of and the lessening in the sensitivity of my teeth.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After using this toothpaste for a week my teeth were in such pain I could hardly eat. Once I quit using it the pain went away. I know the enamel on my teeth is weak so I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try but after one week I had to quit using it. It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve tried the Sensodyne brand (different toothpastes) and it&#x27;s the second time it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used various versions of Sensodyne toothpaste, originally at the suggestion of my dentist, for over 10 years, with great relief of sensitive teeth discomfort.  I even tried similar, less expensive brands, but nothing has ever worked like Sensodyne, any version.  Therefore, when I had a coupon and combined it with a sale to get R&amp;P, I figured it would work even better than the ones I had been using.  WRONG!  From the very 1st time I used it my teeth hurt, and every subsequent brushing was equally painful.  I looked at the ingredients and discovered that the amount of  fluoride is equal to the amount in the prescribed tube of fluoride I use every night.  So I put my Rx&#x27;d tube aside, thinking maybe I was applying too much fluoride.  It didn&#x27;t help.  Finally, I noticed sensitivity while eating something cold that I had not experienced since years ago, before starting to use Sensodyne. That&#x27;s when I decided: enough!  I threw my 1/2 used tube of R&amp;P away (and I NEVER throw anything away!) and went back to using the  regular Sensodyne.  No pain, and immediate relief upon eating hot &amp; cold.  Whether it&#x27;s because it was missing the key ingredient or not, I will NOT use this product again.</li>
    <li> If having sensitivity issues, this toothpaste will help. I started to have issues after eating or drinking cold items and my gums/teeth would hurt. After a few days the trouble went away and I continue to use and no repeat sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I bought on subscription.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste for me</li>
    <li> Helps with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Of all the enamel toothpastes out there, this is one of the best in delivering on its promise to strengthen the enamel. Highly recommended. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the weak flavor it has (in my opinion, I guess some would think its ok since it is a sensodyne toothpaste as well).</li>
    <li> A great toothpaste for sensitve teeth and repair protection.  My dental visits (Dr. and hygenist) tell me my teeth look good.</li>
    <li> Works great and I have really noticed a less tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  I don&#x27;t see a total difference. But, it is not bad either.  Not sure it is is doing what is being marketed.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothpastes I have tried and it is protective of tooth enamel.  It comes in different flavors and forms so I will try another next time.  The product came promptly and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of toothpaste over the years, but this one actually makes my mouth feel better and cleaner.  I was having sensitivity to cold all over my mouth and this made a difference in just a week or two.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I use after my former dentist didn&#x27;t tell me how to use the tooth whitener correctly and my teeth became sensitive to most things I ate.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> A MUST if you have tooth pain.</li>
    <li> love the  idea of haveing  all my things  delivered  if i could i would have food  ect ......I</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps the sensitivity with my gums.  I return here to have this delivered whenever I am running low!</li>
    <li> Like other things, this should indicate in the name that it&#x27;s just the regular version with the Stannous Fluoride, no Novamin at all. So if there isn&#x27;t the ingredient that does the job don&#x27;t sell it to that country that stupidly (of course the FDA) won&#x27;t approve it(like everything else that was helpful before, but they will approve the most dangerous drugs with few short studies), otherwise it&#x27;s just like a counterfeit version because it doesn&#x27;t contain the most important ingredient/s (especially the ones that fit with the claim/s &amp;/or studies/real research). Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just buy the regular one or a different toothpaste, because it&#x27;ll have just as much effect (&amp; might feel better, or the same) after brushing. At least until they let the Novamin come back into it and other alternative toothpastes (whenever that&#x27;ll be).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a sensitive problem for a while and after using this toothpaste it is totally gone.</li>
    <li> Arrived at a perfect descent time. Works like it should.</li>
    <li> When it is recommended by the Dentist, get it.  It is gentle.</li>
    <li> i usually use ProNamel. love it. so figured i try this. makes my teeth hurt???? back to pronamel.</li>
    <li> HELPS TO EASE SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
    <li> A little over 1 year ago, my dentist told me to use this and a bunch of other stuff like soft toothbrushes and to floss.  Last month, they didn&#x27;t lecture about my enamel after using this for over a year, so maybe it works!?!  No cavities after using for over 1 year as well.  Used crest my entire life prior, so was skeptical, but all good reports so far.</li>
    <li> my favorite toothpaste</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and they are cracked because I used to chew ice, drink coffee and citrics...  This toothpaste really reduces the sensitivity. I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> After trusting the &amp;#34;Sensodyne&amp;#34; brand for years, I decided to try this one out. After seeing all the bad reviews, I decided to ignore all the 1 star ratings and still buy it. Huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star reviews are right. This doesn&#x27;t contain NovaMin or calcium sodium phosphosilicate. Ignore all the shills claiming otherwise in that huge comment thread on the first review. This is no better than your average Crest toothpaste - the only active ingredient in it is stannous fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;List of inactive ingredients - glycerin, PEG-8, hydrated silica, pentasodium triphosphate, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, titanium dioxide, polyacrylic acid, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium saccharin</li>
    <li> I have used various Sensodyne toothpastes for more than a decade.  I tried this in the Amazon Subscription service. WARNING! This will burn your gums. It took a few weeks of use before I realized what was causing the problem. After consulting with my dentist, it is determined to be safe to use occasionally, while predominantly using other Sensodyne products.</li>
    <li> First time I bought this.  I will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste for my sensitive and damaged teeth. I love it more than all of the other products that I have tried. It has made a tremendous difference.</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive teeth for years. I bought Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect, but unfortunately this toothpaste has a very hot peppermint flavoring – so hot that the burning feeling persists in my mouth long after I use the product. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Been using a week and notice a difference in my sensitivity.  I miss my Colgate toothpaste taste, but worth giving up the taste to help this cold sensitivity I have been having.</li>
    <li> Taste is refreshing and I feel it helps keep my teeth white despite a lot of coffee.  My teeth are super sensitive and I wouldn&#x27;t switch brands.</li>
    <li> I started using this when I was having some sensitive teeth. The toothpaste itself started out tasting a bit weird but now I enjoy it quite a bit! I no longer have sensitive teeth so I will probably</li>
    <li> It tastes terrible.  I have used Sensodyne products for many years, but this is not up to standard.</li>
    <li> I did not like the taste of this toothpaste. It also did not relieve the pain like it says it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one tube and I&#x27;m unsure of any significant sensitivity reduction. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more and will continue with the product since it is probably as good as it gets. I doubt there are any better.</li>
    <li> J&#x27;ai obtenu ce à quoi je m&#x27;attendais.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well for sensitive teeth. I would like it to whiten also ideally overalll good.</li>
    <li> I would not be able to eat a spoonful of ice cream, a cold salad or even pass air over my teeth without Sensodyne toothpaste. This stuff is amazing. If you try anything else but Sensodyne toothpaste, thinking it will take away the pain in your tooth, think again. Don&#x27;t be fooled. I&#x27;ve tried them all. The only product that works is Sensodyne. Give it a week of using it many times...it&#x27;s effect is cumulative. Once the product accumulates in the painful places the pain will reduce significantly to absolutely bearable to being gone altogether.    Twice I made the HUGE mistakes of trying a different product when on both occassions, all of a sudden after the Sensodne wore off in my teeth a few days to a week later, the pain in my teeth was so unbearable that I was actually seeing sparkly stars. I felt I would need to get all of my teeth pulled out to make the pain go away the last time. It was that awful. I should have learned the first time that nothing but Sensodyne works. But I did not listen to myself. Regretfully, I was curious. I wish I had not been, but I was.     I immediately bought more Sensodyne and a new very soft brush and began brushing my teeth several times a day and even rubbing Sensodyne onto my teeth and just letting it be there for a while before rinsing it out. In a few days the pain was relieved enough to not feel panicky about it. By the end of the week the pain was gone and I could eat normally again.    I will NEVER jump ship and use another so-called pain relief toothpaste again. The only one that actually works GREAT is Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> This is great for super sensitive teeth, &amp; the regular sensodyne doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it anymore. It seems to feel better over time&amp; tastes very minty. Great product. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve bought it anywhere.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what was caused after a few days of using this toothpaste. I&#x27;m trying to get things back to normal, but my mouth is so sore. Beware!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste, along with the same name mouth wash was a great answer for my sensitive mouth and gums. Good advice from a professional has solved my problems!!  I also now use an Oral B electric toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> dentist recomended at a good price and comes to your door</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth less sensitive to hot and cold!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Milder than most which I like.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used for sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this toothpaste but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.  It does help with sensitivity but I don&#x27;t know if it actually repairs or protects.  Since it is so pricey, I probably will not use it all the time.</li>
    <li> It feels like this product provides a lot of good protection for my teeth. However, it also causes the inside of my mouth to produce a good amount of &amp;#34;mouth slime,&amp;#34; which is annoying. This tends to occur with me when I use what I perceive to be a more powerful toothpaste. Melo were versions of Sensodyne do not cause this to occur.</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste.....maybe less expensive in a local store.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you read the directions, this is not an every day toothpaste, you only have to use it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> This worked out great. You can feel it working after you brushed your teeth.</li>
    <li> An update on this product which I have now been using for almost a month.  It is missing Novamin but  has definitely helped with the sensitivity in my one tooth, maybe even more so than the UK version.  It is slightly stickier so if you brush without adding water, the toothpaste clings to the sensitive area more easily and is in my opinion more effective.  I also find it easier to rub a bit of the US version onto the sensitive tooth and it stays there for a while.  Unless you have sever dry mouth, you do not need to add water to toothpaste as it just dilutes it.  This product does not deserve the bad reviews - I wonder whether some reviewers even tried it or just gave it bad reviews because it does not contain Novamin.  I will continue to use it and now have to think twice about buying the UK version next month.  - Older review:  I previously bought mine in the UK, love it for sensitivity but have run out so searched and saw some bad reviews so did some research.  It turns out that the FDA would not approve the use of the most important ingredients Novamin so I will keep buying it in the UK.  I guess that it why some people are not finding it as effective as it should be.  See article below.  I do think Sensodyne works very well so this product will probably help but just a pity it will not work as well as the UK version.  I purchased a tube so see me through until I go to the UK and to compare.  If you have a particularly sensitive spot, apply some toothpaste to the root area, leave it there and do not drink or eat anything for as long as possible.  It will definitely help with more severe sensitivity.  http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth or receding gums than this is the product for you. Cleans your teeth as well as any leading toothpaste without the extra abrasiveness.</li>
    <li> Love this product! works great.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Sensodyne,,which is why I tried it. He said it will keep my teeth from getting sensitive with time. I sure hope he is right in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there is some discrepancy whether this has/has not the new ingredients. Maybe they labeled it wrong, or trying to play us...I have no idea. What I do know, is I got a very good deal on this using Subscribe and save ( 15% off), but I have to find out the quality of the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Good product. I purchase this and others to alternate and this one works great.</li>
    <li> Sensodyne Repair and Protect Pronamel Toothpaste, 3.4 Ounce is a little &#x27;airy&#x27; or &#x27;diluted&#x27; which means that you are getting less toothpaste per tube.  Yet the product is excellent in it&#x27;s cleaning power.  Sensodyne Repair and Protect Pronamel Toothpaste, 3.4 Ounce is a little &#x27;airy&#x27; or &#x27;diluted&#x27; which means that you are getting less toothpaste per tube.  Yet the product is excellent in it&#x27;s cleaning power.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find a toothpaste that has no mint. As much as I like mint, it burns my mouth and lips.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year. And to my surprise, It does repair my tooth, that&#x27;s is incredible. But it also has something to do with your diet. Do not drink soda is the most important point.</li>
    <li> Does not have key ingredient in the USA: NOVAMIN! Only available in the European version of this toothpaste... Novamin is the most promising new ingredient for dental support that is not available stateside... why?</li>
    <li> use it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for sensitive teeth but it can be bought cheaper in a local supermarket</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste. But I would recommend regular Sensodyne paste for sensitive tooth.</li>
    <li> Bought in a local store, but dislike it enough to review here.  Read the label, it states if it causes irritation, discontinue.  Well, it caused irritation!  My mouth after a week started to feel burnt, like I ate something too hot and burned my tongue.  At first I thought I was just dehydrated, but later realized it was this toothpaste.  I have stopped using it, and my mouth after a few days is now feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the Iso-Active, which was great, but after not finding any [realize now it was discontinued....sigh], figured I would try this.  Sensitivity it was good for, but can&#x27;t live with a numb burnt feeling tongue/mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away.</li>
    <li> Great item; will buy again.</li>
    <li> I take this toothpaste with me on vacations.  It is a nice size for that.  I use this toothpaste all the time at home and it has stopped my tooth/gum pain.  If I don&#x27;t use it for several days, the pain returns.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
    <li> This really made a difference in the level of tooth sensitivity both my husband and I were experiencing.  Recommended by our dentist and much more economic from Amazon than when purchased locally.</li>
    <li> The only sensitive toothpaste my husband likes.  Works well, cleans well, and great for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the product. Gentle on tooth with high amount if fluoride to protect tooth. The taste is minty and refreshing. Kills bad breath and even if you have a mild toothache it will relief the pain. Don&#x27;t use it during pregnancy due to high amount of floride.</li>
    <li> I only use this product for obvious benefits. Won&#x27;t ever go back to any other brand.</li>
    <li> Look Maw, no cavities and no more sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This US product does not include Novamin.  Rest of the world includes it in their Repair and Protect product.  Inexplicable to me why GSK excluded that ingredient in the US version.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of Sensodyne for years, until I stopped using it for a week and would get tooth pain until switching back. I came to realize that the Sensodyne wasn&#x27;t reducing sensitivity or repairing my enamel, but simply numbing my nerves so I didn&#x27;t feel the sensitivity. It still contains glycerin to coat your teeth, which will prevent remineralization of your enamel. It still contains fluoride to mimic enamel remineralization, but with a spongy filling that doesn&#x27;t provide the foundation needed for healthy and strong teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I realized what I thought was a great product was simply hiding the problem, not treating it. I switched to brushing with coconut oil and baking soda for a natural remineralization, and also use this toothpaste for on the go.

    <li> works great for keeping my teeth from being so sensitive. the only toothpaste I have found that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried crest, and colgate and they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;is a bit pricey to me at 5 dollars a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does not have the best smell/taste.</li>
    <li> Sensodyne Repair and Protect is one of the only toothpastes to include an unique ingredient called Novamin. Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won&#x27;t react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth&#x27;s surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid&#x27;s compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form. If you just want a stannous fluoride toothpaste it is available in crest pro health and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This really has helped my husband with his sensitive teeth. And surprisingly with my gums. I didn&#x27;t realize my gums were sensitive until using this paste.</li>
