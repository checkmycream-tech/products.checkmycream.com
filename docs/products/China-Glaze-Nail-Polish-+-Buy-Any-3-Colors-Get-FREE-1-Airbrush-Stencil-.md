    <li> Color was abit dull but it was cute for $4,99</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of  China Glaze polishes. They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant plum is no exception. It coats well with 2 coats, no streaking, and no visible nail line. It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails. All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend! I&#x27;ve passed this on as a gift many a time. :)</li>
