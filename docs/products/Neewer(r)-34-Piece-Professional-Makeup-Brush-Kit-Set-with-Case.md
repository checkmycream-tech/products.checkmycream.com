      <li>BECAUSE CAUSE THEY HAVE THIS STRONG SMELL, KIND OF LIKE A PERMANENT MARKER SMELL.</li>
      <li>THERE IS SOME SHEDDING, BUT NOT OUTRAGEOUS.</li>
      <li>THEY ARE OK.</li>
      <li>It has way more brushes than I&#x27;ll probably ever need, but that&#x27;s why I bought it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if that will stop over time and more washings.</li>
      <li>Hope I helped :)</li>
      <li>I still use most of my eye brushes every day.</li>
      <li>I guess they&#x27;re ok if that&#x27;s what you prefer.</li>
      <li>IM SATISFIED.</li>
      <li>I received this fairly quickly and it was packaged nicely with some bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for a pro makeup artist but for someone that loves makeup and wants a variety of brushes for a good price.</li>
      <li>Very well made and are the perfect \\&quot;starter professional brush</li>
      <li>However, there was a very strong smell when I first opened the case.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife, and she really loves it, the brushes are very big, and the carrier is perfect.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased with the quantity of brushes and the many different sizes and styles that come in this package.  </li>
      <li>The quality is good and they come in a nice little roll up case.</li>
      <li>so I can go client to client and have a clean brush already on stand by.  </li>
      <li>(do make up for friends special occasions, weddings, etc.)</li>
      <li>It has been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve purchased these, and I&#x27;ve definitely learned what good brushes are and aren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The brushes themselves are as pictured and good enough quality.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: upon further conditioning, I have come to realize they make a good pain set for crafts.</li>
      <li>Will fix it with some super glue.</li>
      <li>this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact.</li>
      <li>I was able to deal with the shedding because the brushes were very soft, so that was an upside.</li>
      <li>Overall, the bag is of a pretty good quality and definitely worth the $.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and were priced just right for her budget.  </li>
      <li>I think these brushes are pretty cool.  </li>
      <li>The bigger ones seemed to shed a bit more</li>
      <li>Smell funny.  </li>
      <li>I also want to say shipment was fast!</li>
      <li>The small ones like the eyeshadow and eyeliner ones have no shedding and work fairly well.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the carrying pouch.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect too much of them.</li>
      <li>The bristles of the real hair brushes fall out...a lot.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend those for much because they are also scratchy.  </li>
      <li>AND do my own make-up everyday, so I think these are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handles of the brushes were not heavy, very sleek, and I didn&#x27;t see any visible glue.</li>
      <li>It is super long, but not obnoxiously, and holds every brush that I need.  </li>
      <li>Received quickly but the brushes have a lot to be desired reason being that all the brushes are not soft and I don&#x27;t know if anybody else feels this way</li>
      <li>set\\&quot; for someone learning new styles of makeup without spending a fortune.  </li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I use these for my clients!</li>
      <li>They are shedding, but that is natural with a new brush.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for more eyeshadow and blending brushes, sadly they were pretty much nonexistent, except for the one dome/blending brush.</li>
      <li>We ordered these brushes for our 15 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this set to anyone who wants a lot of brush options to try out different makeup techniques and looks.</li>
      <li>It also folds back up really well and holds it form.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but that wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me considering I place my brushes in a different holder.</li>
      <li>but when I am using anything on my face it needs to be soft to the touch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional make-up artist and look forward to using these.  </li>
      <li>THE LITTLE BRUSHES ARE STIFF, WHICH IS GOOD.</li>
      <li>I agree with other comments that the roll case alone is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent brush bag and finally found this.</li>
      <li>No regrets I have actually been learning how to do professional make up since buying this set.</li>
      <li>THE BIG ONES ARE SOFT.</li>
      <li>The roll case aired outside during the day for 2 days in a row.</li>
      <li>There was only one eye brush with natural hair, which was a dome blending brush</li>
      <li>However, the brushes are sturdy and the tops are not loose and have not fallen apart.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the quality quite poor; mediocre at best.</li>
      <li>The roll did smell a little funny</li>
      <li>The bag has a funny smell to it and hasn&#x27;t gone away after a few weeks.</li>
      <li>The large fluffy ones do have a lot of shedding...</li>
      <li>Of course like with a lot of new brushes you have to get out the loose hair which is the only down side I have seen so far.</li>

    <li> Great variety of brushes. The bigger ones seemed to shed a bit more but I can&#x27;t complain for the price. However, there was a very strong smell when I first opened the case. I needed to leave the brush kit open for a few days before putting it in my make up kit.</li>
    <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t too bad...atleast for the price. You get 34 brushes for less than $1 a piece...the brush roll is probably worth at least $15. The quality of the brushes are expected for the price. The large fluffy ones do have a lot of shedding...I&#x27;m wondering if that will stop over time and more washings. The small ones like the eyeshadow and eyeliner ones have no shedding and work fairly well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for a pro makeup artist but for someone that loves makeup and wants a variety of brushes for a good price. Also the brush roll did have a weird smell to it when first opened but that went away after the first day.</li>
    <li> There are so many great brushes in this set that I am over all pleased! Of course like with a lot of new brushes you have to get out the loose hair which is the only down side I have seen so far. I am a professional makeup artist and I use these for my clients! I also want to say shipment was fast! They delivered it to my front porch without knocking which I was not happy about but other then that I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This brush set is a very good deal.  I agree with other comments that the roll case alone is worth the price.  The brushes themselves are as pictured and good enough quality.  The handles have a really nice matte finish with silver NEEWER logo on them.  When the set arrived, I expected the smell everyone mentioned and it did smell like industrial solvents.  I washed all brushes and the roll case in baby shampoo and air dried them.  The roll case aired outside during the day for 2 days in a row. The room I left the case in overnight between the 2 days smelled stongly like the case in the morning. At the end of day 2, the case just had that smell up close.  It will probably have that faint smell for a while, but it is a minor thing compared to the other benefits of the set as a whole.  I would recommend this set to anyone who wants a lot of brush options to try out different makeup techniques and looks.</li>
    <li> We ordered these brushes for our 15 year old daughter.  They arrived quickly and were priced just right for her budget.  Very well made and are the perfect \\&quot;starter professional brush set\\&quot; for someone learning new styles of makeup without spending a fortune.  We are very pleased with the quantity of brushes and the many different sizes and styles that come in this package.  A must for parents / children on a budget with a desire to apply makeup like the pros!</li>
    <li> These brushes are quite a steal for the price so I didn&#x27;t expect too much of them. Unfortunately there are just too many taklon brushes in this set. I was hoping for more eyeshadow and blending brushes, sadly they were pretty much nonexistent, except for the one dome/blending brush.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this set just to try it out, I was under no impression that this product would be of the highest quality. I received this fairly quickly and it was packaged nicely with some bubble wrap. The roll did smell a little funny but that wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me considering I place my brushes in a different holder. The handles of the brushes were not heavy, very sleek, and I didn&#x27;t see any visible glue. I was disappointed with how much they do shed though. The face brushes did this the worst, but since I already have my loyal brushes I wasn&#x27;t too concerned. Some of the eye brushes do shed as well but for the price, what do you expect? I was able to deal with the shedding because the brushes were very soft, so that was an upside. Point blank: if you&#x27;re purchasing this just to learn different techniques and can&#x27;t afford high quality items this isn&#x27;t a terrible buy! I still use most of my eye brushes every day. Hope I helped :)</li>
    <li> good quality brushes for the price i am a mua and i have alot of brushes purchase these on a spur as seeing as my make up trolly had not arrived from a trip i took to paris and need some brushes asap so i got these the fall out is minimum to nun per use and ohh how i used them they applied beautifully and smooth i ordered a back for my back up</li>
    <li> The brushes came promptly, and were in perfect condition when shipped. I DID notice a smell, and took a wet cloth to the pleather roll and aired it out over night by my window; this solved the smell problem. (It smells slightly of gasoline, and I believe its the black dye that does that). The brushes DID need to be conditioned, and the face brushes trimmed a little. If you find that the eye shadow brushes are stiff, flex them gently when you condition them. But after a little elbow grease, these brushes are quiet a find!!! All those sizes and variations (plus eye lash brush and eye brow comb) I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! So yes, they are not MAC. They do need a little work. But I am a semi-pro (do make up for friends special occasions, weddings, etc.) AND do my own make-up everyday, so I think these are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: upon further conditioning, I have come to realize they make a good pain set for crafts.</li>
    <li> I basically bough this for the brush roll and I considered the brushes to be an added bonus if they were good.  The brush roll has a slight chemically smell to it, but it has already faded.  To be honest, I like that smell anyway.  It is super long, but not obnoxiously, and holds every brush that I need.  It also folds back up really well and holds it form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the brushes that came with this set to be used for stage makeup.  The synthetic fibers are great for cream makeup.  The bristles of the real hair brushes fall out...a lot.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend those for much because they are also scratchy.  However, the brushes are sturdy and the tops are not loose and have not fallen apart.</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are pretty cool.  I agree with some of the reviews that it has a weird smell.  I would say it&#x27;s probably because the case is leather.  After it&#x27;s opened everyday I think the weird smell will go away.  I did notice that there are few duplicate brushes.  Maybe they are just different sizes. What I am going to use these for, it will work great. I really appreciate the carrying pouch.  The pouch alone would run you 20 bucks or more!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this product!! It was a great price and great quality. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever. Smell funny.  I use them for my nails</li>
    <li> It has been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve purchased these, and I&#x27;ve definitely learned what good brushes are and aren&#x27;t. And by golly, these are not good brushes. Granted, you get 34 brushes along with the roll up case but that doesn&#x27;t justify anything. I don&#x27;t hate these brushes, I just don&#x27;t like them and would not use them unless I really needed to. There are a couple brushes I keep nearby for backup but I never reach for those either. The face brushes were rough, scratchy, and not soft at all. They shed quite a lot too. The smaller face, eye and lip brushes were stiff synthetics. I guess they&#x27;re ok if that&#x27;s what you prefer. There was only one eye brush with natural hair, which was a dome blending brush and it was the pick of the litter. I washed all the brushes prior to using but the hairs still didn&#x27;t relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a pro mua or let alone a mua, but I still have expectations. And no, I&#x27;m not a makeup/brush snob. Even without any knowledge about brushes, when I opened the package after it arrived I was already disappointed. I don&#x27;t know why so many people are claiming these are excellent brushes. I guess it&#x27;s just preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality quite poor; mediocre at best.</li>
    <li> This set is great. It has way more brushes than I&#x27;ll probably ever need, but that&#x27;s why I bought it, it has a wide variety of brushes. The quality is good and they come in a nice little roll up case.</li>
    <li> I have looked for these for my daughter for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This was a great selection and good quality brush assortment.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and she really loves it, the brushes are very big, and the carrier is perfect.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE OK. THERE IS SOME SHEDDING, BUT NOT OUTRAGEOUS. YOU HAVE TO WASH THEM BEFORE YOU USE THEM BECAUSE CAUSE THEY HAVE THIS STRONG SMELL, KIND OF LIKE A PERMANENT MARKER SMELL. THE LITTLE BRUSHES ARE STIFF, WHICH IS GOOD. THE BIG ONES ARE SOFT. IM SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional make-up artist and look forward to using these.  They seem like a really great quality product for a great price.  They are shedding, but that is natural with a new brush.  Each brush came individually wrapped in plastic and the case is perfection.  I like that there are a few of the same kinds of brush in here so I can go client to client and have a clean brush already on stand by.  I&#x27;ll review further once I put these things through the ringer.</li>
    <li> this product is ok, i recomended, the service is fast, all rigth, the price is the exact. very very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent brush bag and finally found this. It comes with 34pcs brushes. The brushes are slightly hard on face. So will find other uses for them. The bag has a funny smell to it and hasn&#x27;t gone away after a few weeks. Planning to get it &#x27;sunbathed&#x27; this weekend to hopefully ease the smell. Overall, the bag is of a pretty good quality and definitely worth the $.</li>
    <li> Very impressive!  However, when my granddaughter opened it for Christmas, one of the brushes broke.  The brush came off the handle.  Very disappointing.  Will fix it with some super glue.</li>
    <li> Received quickly but the brushes have a lot to be desired reason being that all the brushes are not soft and I don&#x27;t know if anybody else feels this way but when I am using anything on my face it needs to be soft to the touch these feel like they were made out of coarse horse tail hair.But I guess you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> Amazing product, easy storage and transportable. Great for those quick makeup needs.  Need to keep away from my teenager! She&#x27;s a product taker!!  LOL!!!</li>
    <li> No regrets I have actually been learning how to do professional make up since buying this set. No Regrets wonderful selection</li>
</ol>
