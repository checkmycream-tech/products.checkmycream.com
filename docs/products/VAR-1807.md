<li> /&gt;I will likely need to buy another one in a few months.</li>
<li> /&gt;To be fair, it must be difficult to make this type of comb and have the bristles not easily fall off because they are so thin.</li>

    <li> Nice set of brushes.  Very handy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good brow and eyelash brush and comb - well priced and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Great product, seems sturdy and gets the job done.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend more for this type of product when e.l.f. has done such a good job. I really like the thin sleek handle and how it fits in my bag.</li>
    <li> The brush is eyebrow friendly it doesn&#x27;t scratch like some do.&lt;br /&gt;  the comb is smooth,the whole two in one is very nice I&#x27;M GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER,before they stop selling them.</li>
    <li> The brush was strong and was easy to hold. It&#x27;s plastic so I feel metal works better for seperating your eye lashes. For the price it works.</li>
    <li> I thought it will be a small stuff, but i received a big one, it is very helpful for eyelash.</li>
    <li> This seller sent me a different product than what I ordered! I got eyebrow tracing paper or something ... ? And when I tried to set up the return/exchange, they said I had waited too long to do it and they wouldn&#x27;t accommodate me in any way.</li>
    <li> This set was a good buy for the money. Comb teeth are of good length and brush is very durable. Very practical for keeping unruly brows in line and maximizing the line of arched brows. A must have in your personal grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow comb &amp; brush seemed alright at first ... but the wooden handle started splintering on me after a few weeks of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; use ... and I always kept the brush in my (sturdy) make-up bag when I wasn&#x27;t using it.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had any of my make-up cases/brushes/etc. break on me, as I&#x27;m generally pretty careful with my stuff.  I guess this is one where I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Eventually the tool broke but got the job done when I had it. Pretty useful and good considering the price</li>
    <li> I like this com, however it breaks easily. I&#x27;ve had to purchase a new one every few months. I don&#x27;t mind though because it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great dual eyebrow/lash brush. I am enjoying using this handy size brush. Would also slip into your purse for on the go.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. Never really heard of the brand but it&#x27;s VERY durable! I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a need to spend a lot on little specialty tools like this. This brush/comb is great and I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I use an eyebrow pencil every day, sometimes twice a day. I primarily use the straight hard side (not the brush side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product when I first received it, which was less than a month ago. But already two bristles have fallen off. And there aren&#x27;t many to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, it must be difficult to make this type of comb and have the bristles not easily fall off because they are so thin. But I am not harsh on the comb--I just stroke it through each eyebrow once or twice each time I use it. I was hoping it would last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely need to buy another one in a few months. I will try a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush and the price was fantastic.  Unfortunately I left it in the bottom of my purse (unopened) and within a few days the top broke off.  I kept the top and still use it but am sad I did not even get to open it prior to the breakage...</li>
    <li> I LOVE ELF PRODUCTS. Great to comb and brush through your eyebrows or even that previous step before you do your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a short amount of time, and is a really great brush. It&#x27;s very soft and even the comb side is as well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use the comb side of the eyebrow brush, but I really love the brush side! It helps brush my eyebrow hairs into place, make them more \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; (in a good way, it&#x27;s a bit hard to explain..) not to mention that the brush is cheap and conveniently small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
