      <li>Color is as described very nice and the price was amazing</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
      <li>This color is just amazing..</li>
      <li>I have light skin, brown hair and hazel eyes, and this lip color looks great with a warm peach blush.</li>
      <li>but it is a nice color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have to layer it with a gloss if you don&#x27;t want to</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still a nice color</li>
      <li>its really nice colour</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>It would give it a more contrasting look.</li>
      <li>the shade i got would look better if i was a bit more tan.</li>
      <li>Love the color, texture, and shine - but didn&#x27;t like that the color of my choice (Coral Gleam) disappeared from store shelves.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite lip color shades.</li>
      <li>It is discontinued, but I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t necessarily need to stand in front of a mirror for 2 minutes trying to get it to apply perfectly.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good quality</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a nice lipstick, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for just the right coral lipstick.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is fine.  </li>
      <li>This is a great lipstick that goes on feeling super natural on the lips - not too goopy, not too drying, not too sticky, etc.  </li>
      <li>light, almost translucent color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a light shimmery pink color.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty buildable product in terms of coverage.</li>
      <li>i tried this colour first time</li>
      <li>I got this in the color Coral Gleam, and the color is pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon sellers, I was able to purchase four tubes to last for a while.  </li>
      <li>now i love it its light pink natural colour with gloss</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the sheer side which makes it really wearable and there&#x27;s a nice subtle shimmer to it</li>
      <li>It is a very light and natural color as well, and has a tiny bit of shimmer to it, which presents a radiant glow when worn, versus a heavy glittery look.  </li>
      <li>No color really (got two different colors and both have no color)</li>

    <li> I was skeptical about buying lipstick online :/ but it works good. the shade i got would look better if i was a bit more tan. It would give it a more contrasting look. Overall, it is moisturizing and last a while.</li>
    <li> The color was slightly metallic...I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;Still a nice color</li>
    <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;Barely any pigment, mainly just sparkles that cut into your lips with a slight pink tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: Came in on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The lipstick is fine.  I just don&#x27;t like the color on me.</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick for a few reasons. It&#x27;s a bit on the sheer side which makes it really wearable and there&#x27;s a nice subtle shimmer to it that&#x27;s not glittery or overpowering.If you&#x27;re looking for a really opaque color then you&#x27;ll just need a few coats. It is a pretty buildable product in terms of coverage. It&#x27;s nice not to have to layer it with a gloss if you don&#x27;t want to and it&#x27;s one of those colors that isn&#x27;t hard to work with, so you don&#x27;t necessarily need to stand in front of a mirror for 2 minutes trying to get it to apply perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good quality</li>
    <li> awesome! delivered on time and in perfect condition- will order again</li>
    <li> This color is just amazing.. So natural and shiny as I expected...</li>
    <li> I wore it the day it arrived and got several compliments on the color. I was looking for a paler color but this was nice too!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick! It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
    <li> light, almost translucent color</li>
    <li> It was not exactly what I was looking for.</li>

    <li> I got this in the color Coral Gleam, and the color is pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for. It&#x27;s more of a light shimmery pink color. It&#x27;s still a nice lipstick, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for just the right coral lipstick.</li>
    <li> once applied, does not stay long on lips but it is a nice color</li>
    <li> This has a glittery peachy/pink tone. I like it against my darker skin.</li>
    <li> Color is as described very nice and the price was amazing</li>
    <li> Love the color, texture, and shine - but didn&#x27;t like that the color of my choice (Coral Gleam) disappeared from store shelves.  Thanks to Amazon sellers, I was able to purchase four tubes to last for a while.  Only problem was that only 3 of the 4 were the color chosen.  The 4th was &amp;#34;Luminous Lilac,&amp;#34; a color that is not flattering to me......but the lipstick touched my lips, so I guess a return is out of the question.  Should have checked the color accuracy of each tube.</li>
    <li> its really nice colour i tried this colour first time n now i love it its light pink natural colour with gloss look good i tried same coral lipgloss too n that was awesome....i love it</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lip color shades. It is discontinued, but I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
