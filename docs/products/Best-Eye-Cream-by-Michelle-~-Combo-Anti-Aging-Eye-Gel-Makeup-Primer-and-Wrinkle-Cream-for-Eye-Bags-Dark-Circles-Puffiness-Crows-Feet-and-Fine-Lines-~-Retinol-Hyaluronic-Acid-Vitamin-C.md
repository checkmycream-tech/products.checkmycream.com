<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this item is awesome effect to my skin !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with it : )</li>
    <li> This is an awesome serum. It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smoothly, even under makeup. It has a very light, pleasant herbal smell. It is effective in reducing under eye puffiness. I like how smooth and hydrated my eye area is after using it. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this so much. It smells nice and very smooth after I put it on my face. I love it.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews was expecting something wonderful.  Didn&#x27;t notice any difference really.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream.  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I was researching and looking around for a good eye cream when I found this one.  The first few times I used it I noticed a tingling sensation but that disappeared after a little bit.  The serum is thicker so that it doesn&#x27;t just slide right off your finger before you can apply it.  It is a little sticky, but it absorbs quickly.  I have noticed some lightening of the wrinkles around my eyes - and I have only been using it for a few weeks.  I will be curious to see what happens over time.  I am sold!</li>
    <li> This is very good!! I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Cream make under my eyes  smooth look flawless  the best period I would recommended to the fullest the best hands down try it and see for yourself everybody is different I love it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller. I am very fair, never tan and have sensitive skin. I even use it on my neck, ears, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and the back of my aging hands. Of course that means I use it up faster but its affordable! There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking. It does not sting or burn. Ladies, give this a try before you buy something more expensive. The deep lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin and I swear the deep wrinkles on my forehead have softened. Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried. Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum for very large satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Sangkomhan herbal scent and feel better then&lt;br /&gt;Can penetrate the skin feeling moist.</li>
    <li> I love that its working. I would recommend people to use this product.</li>
    <li> I was a Model back in my teens and was always watching the &amp;#34;older aka 20 somethings and up&amp;#34; forever applying facial creams, moisturizers and the like fanatically.&lt;br /&gt;So? When I hit my 20&#x27;s I went to The &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; cosmetic counters and always did my evening &amp; morning routine of facial care depending upon whatever the lady at the high end counter advised me to.&lt;br /&gt;Well? I am now in my 50&#x27;s and realized I needed something else with Results as my facial needs recently changed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried virtually every eye creams, facial washes ( never soap), cleansers, and serums out there.&lt;br /&gt;Not until recently did I find this Extraordinary eye cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;Results? Simply Amazing!! I had the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;s between my eyebrows. Gone! The texture? Like silk. My skin is as smooth and SO silky! My dark circles are virtually gone!!&lt;br /&gt; I felt results immediately.I SAW Major changes in a 2 week period.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely! Absolutely! Give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Love the feel when I put it on. Refreshing rather than greasy. Have noticed improvement around the eye area.</li>
    <li> good products item as described</li>
    <li> Gives my skin the boost it needs</li>
    <li> Great eye cream, my eye area is much smoother after the first bottle</li>
    <li> Feels nice with noticeable  results</li>
    <li> one night of use ad I saw a difference love it</li>
    <li> This seems to work great!!! It is a little cooling and refreshing but no burning or pain as I have sensitive eyes. The price is great and I love the pump, nice packaging.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this eye cream for a few days now,and I have to say,I&#x27;m impressed. Now I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet,however I do see some results in the fading of dark circles and puffiness under my eyes,also I use it morning and night and wake up looking awake and refreshed next morning. I did see some fading in the fine lines around my eyes but it&#x27;s too soon to see an improvement in the wrinkles. It is more of a gel rather than a cream,which is actually better for me because it is easy to wear under makeup. I will continue to use it and can&#x27;t wait to see better results after using for a while. Shipping was pretty fast and packaging was impressive.</li>
    <li> Really great eye cream. My mom says she loves it!</li>
    <li> Not what was expected!!!</li>
    <li> This product is all about quality results! Amazing and not too pricey!</li>
    <li> I sill have dark eye after used the products but I sill going to keep used it</li>
    <li> I have severe allergies and have looked for something that would help the dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used this for 7 days and I can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement in the brightness and elasticity of the skin around my eyes. I don&#x27;t use it every day as I&#x27;m just not that fastidious so I don&#x27;t know whether any irritation would occur with more use but at the rate I&#x27;m using it, every couple of days, it&#x27;s working out great.</li>
    <li> big quantity with good price!</li>
    <li> Works amazing so far!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Makes my skin so soft :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My skin looks so much more smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye cream for about 2 weeks now. I put it on every morning and some evenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it tingles a bit and makes my eyes feel awake.  I think it helps depuff underneath my eyes in the morning.  I don&#x27;t get much sleep since i have a baby. One of my coworkers saod i looked rested and I cant help but wonder if the eye cream is to blame....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let my sis in law use some and she loved it! She went online to purchase</li>
    <li> I apply this every morning around my eyes..I  think it has really helped&lt;br /&gt;with my crow&#x27;s feet. I&#x27;ve learned how to get it to dispense in a small&lt;br /&gt;amount so to make it last longer..(-:  Thankyou for the opportunity to&lt;br /&gt;lesson my eye wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It makes the skin around my eyes feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This eye cream feels good on my skin and I feel refreshed. It did not agitate my skin and is gentle.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this serum a lot, it absorbs completely and leaves my skin soft and hydrated with no sticky or tacky feel. However I did not like the strong scent of essentials oils that linger on my skin and the packaging needs to change because the serum is in a clear plastic pump which exposes it to light that can degrade the active ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love how great my face looks after 2 weeks if using this Hyaluronic Acid! Splotchiness and dark spots are much less noticeable!</li>
    <li> I use this on my stretch marks from after having a baby and I have noticed a decent reduction in visibility.</li>
    <li> Not used it long enough to make a difference but can feel the tightness. Will continue to use it and fully give it a chance.</li>
    <li> Sorry, it has taken awhile for my wife to determine any meaningful comparison data between other product(s) and Best Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The Best Eye Cream appears to be actually &amp;#34;making a difference&amp;#34; when compared to the plethora of other&lt;br /&gt;products she&#x27;s has tried in the past. So far, so good and if the results continue in this vein we will definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Product is Great! It is easy to apply, dries quickly and feels really firming.  When applying makeup, you feel like it is still working and hasn&#x27;t dissolved into your makeup. It  has a great fragrance and it feels really good on your skin! I don&#x27;t know if I look any different, but I sure feel great and that is a wonderful feeling.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eye serum/cream. It provided enough moisture I did not follow up with one. It wasn&#x27;t tacky and it&#x27;s fragrance free which I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a few weeks and it&#x27;s definitely living up to its name and descriptions. Love it!</li>
    <li> First thing you should know about this product is that the ingredient list shown here is a complete lie! There are all types of crazy chemicals in this thing not mentioned here. Also, just do a quick google search for Best Eye Cream by Michelle and you&#x27;ll find out why else I say this is a scam. I made the mistake of doing it AFTER I had already bought the cream. I tried to cancel the order (not even 2 hours after I had purchased it) and it said that it was already shipped. Yeah, they want your money so bad they send the product out right away to make sure you don&#x27;t have time to do anything about it. And on top of that the packaging is sooo unprofessional. It comes in a tub that looks like a toilet paper roll with a cover. The product itself comes in a gel which smells really bad. Honestly, google search this product BEFORE you even think about throwing away your money. You&#x27;ll thank yourself later.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Glides on well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smooth finish and makes my lines smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great eye product!</li>
    <li> Seems to reduce wrinkles around the eyes. I use it once a day in the morning, when skin is driest.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t wear during the day- but makes for a great night treatment-- but  thanks for making it afforable- :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last couple of weeks and have the results have been amazing.  The lines around my eyes are getting better every day.  We went to the beach last week and this usually makes my skin feel pretty bad afterwards.  I used your product and my skin around my eyes actually improved, even with the sun, sand and salt water. I can really tell that you have put a lot of research into this product and it works.  I have recommended your product to my family and friends.  Thank you for developing a product that is so wonderful for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this wonderful gel!  I have seen a big difference under my eyes!  Well worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Love using this serum. My skin is moist and dewy after only a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, never sticky</li>
    <li> I think around the eyes light up&lt;br /&gt;good~~</li>
    <li> Like so so far. Feels light on the eyes.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff. I originally got this for my wife but my mother-in-law managed to sweet talk it out the door. I can&#x27;t say a lot about the details but she seems very pleased. She is still recovering her health from last year&#x27;s surgery to remove a tumor. The process to a horrible toll on her body and she is getting back her radiance finally. Thank you for the great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream that would moisturize and tighten without irritating my skin. I decided to try this one and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have allergies that cause dark circles and I have pretty sensitive skin around my eyes. This has really worked great. I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in the dark circles and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This is an excellent choice and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Cool and refreshing also fragrance free this gel cream feels great after application.  Another plus it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate it a 4 because I do like the feel and the results so far, but it has not been long enough to really see any long term results. However, if the current continues it should be good.</li>
    <li> My eye feels uncomfortable when I use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I have nothing but praises for it. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good. My eyes don&#x27;t feel as puffed up as they usually do when. I lack sleep (a mother to a 1st grader &amp; a toddler), and that makes other people think i&#x27;ve been doing something big and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! - immediate results!</li>
    <li> I will buy this again and again. I love the way it feels on my skin. My make up doesn&#x27;t stick to it and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I accidentally got some in my eye and it didn&#x27;t burn, that&#x27;s always a good thing for those of us that are less than coordinated :) try this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been use this Eye cream for several weeks, I did not notice much changes, but my husband notices, he even took pictures to show me that the file lines around my Eyes are not visible any more. It is a good sign. I will continue use this cream.</li>
    <li> This product was fairly effective in reducing (though not eliminating) the wrinkles around my eyes. I did not make quite the improvement I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure I would describe it as a cream, more like a clear gel, I do like the product. I have sort of crepey eyelids and this helps smooth them out and make my shadow look much better. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;d call it a gel or serum rather than cream, but who cares as long as it works? Delicate lines around my eyes are noticeably diminished. Non-irritant to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The eye cream provided a noticeable difference within days of beginning to use it regularly. Well worth the price, a great value.</li>
    <li> One of the best victim C serums out. Love this</li>
    <li> very good item for my face.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this and want to buy another one!!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this cream/gel but the execution is somewhat lacking as it left my skin sticky when it dried.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it</li>
    <li> The product worked well on my ultra sensitive eyes. Very refreshing, and moisturizing. Am seeing progress on lines as well.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 so do not expect miracles but this eye cream is better than most that I have tried.  I still think Avon Anew line is the best but I use this under the anew and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement in the brightness and elasticity of the skin around my eyes. I don&#x27;t use it every day as I&#x27;m just not that fastidious so I don&#x27;t know whether any irritation would occur with more use but at the rate I&#x27;m using it, every couple of days, it&#x27;s working out great.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have had dark circles under my eyes all my life and this is the only product that has made the shadows and puffiness go away. My crows feet are less noticeable too. I use this gel all over my face and it feels great. I can really feel and see a difference. I will buy this product again (and again and again)!</li>
    <li> Feels really good on my skin.  Not a cure yet but have only used it for about a week - my 65 year old winkles may need lots more time.&lt;br /&gt;I can see some improvement in the crows feet.</li>
    <li> I AM AMAZED AT HOW MUCH BETTER MY SKIN LOOKED AFTER USING THE BEST EYE CREAM ONLY TWO WEEKS&lt;br /&gt;I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE IMPROVEMENT WITH CONTINUED USE!!</li>
    <li> Two weeks of use and I can see no difference.  Eyes still puffy.</li>
    <li> looks no better to face and eyes!</li>
    <li> it works but it take time,</li>
    <li> Three great products in one bottle! I am a huge lover of hyaluronic acid in general. It is an amazing moisturizer. The vitamin c is great for toning and the retinol is great for wrinkles. You really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Baggy eyes runs in the family. At 39 I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but I do have bags under my eyes and I just figured I would be stuck with them for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of money on a number of products that didn&#x27;t work. Well this one does. It has visibly reduced the bags below my eyes. I apply it, let it dry then apply make up as usual on top. This is a great combination treatment with moisturizer, vitamin c serum, retinol, and hyaluronic acid, etc all in one product. I get comments from family, friends, and even coworkers saying &amp;#34;something&#x27;s different&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;you look younger&amp;#34;. Terrific! Some have even asked where I got it and how they could get it and I told them without and hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with his product as the lines around my eyes seem diminished, it is well packaged and super priced.  Love the ingredients and will be a repeat customer, as I am seeing results!</li>
    <li> This is a large 2.4oz bottle! I like the gel consistency, when it dries it leaves my skin feeling tighter. I noticed smoother skin and less dark circles. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very Very Nice~!!! Good product!!!!!!!!!! Best quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, especially for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
    <li> This eye serum is great - smells good, is not greasy, and I can already see a difference after using for a few weeks. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this! I have been very happy with the results. It is helping my under eye bags and the fine lines and laugh lines around my eyes. It is a bit sticky but otherwise it goes on smooth and sinks in quickly. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> it works!!! better for dark circle</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye serum. The manufacturer understands how vital it is to NOT test on animals, and I appreciate that this product is cruelty-free. Looking through the ingredients, I feel like I&#x27;m only putting goodness on my skin. It&#x27;s full of vitamins (A, C &amp; E), aloe, green tea, guarana, and some ingredients I&#x27;ve never seen in beauty products before like watermelon, lentil and licorice. Watermelon! Seriously! Each ingredient has a specific purpose, especially the main active ingredient of hydraulic acid that helps to regrow skin cells. I feel like the puffiness and dark circles are greatly diminished after sleeping with this gel overnight. While I used it at night, I&#x27;m sure you could apply this serum before applying makeup in the morning as well. Fortunately I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes yet, but I feel like this product will keep my skin supple enough to where wrinkles will be less of a problem for me in the future. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been trying different Vitamin C serums and jumped at the change to try this on a promotion. It has the Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid that I have been trying with other formulas but takes it a step further by adding Retinol.  It feels hydrating and cooling; definitely reduces puffiness around the eye. On top of this base serum is another whole spectrum of all natural ingredients for extra support with  Apple, Lentil, Green Tea, Comfry and Watermelon - even Licorice as an antibacterial and dark spot fading. Super nice pump dispenser gives out just the right amount with no wastage.  Very generous sized bottle for the price as well. And VERY important to me its never tested on animals - well done.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Although not yet appeared in effect prior to use, it is considered to be a good product.</li>
    <li> This is good product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a gel with a soothing effect.&lt;br /&gt;Works well and I like that it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> Great/fast results.  I seem to have bags under my eyes every morning and this gives my face a refreshed, healthy look.</li>
    <li> Despite being named &amp;#34;best eye cream,&amp;#34; this is actually a gel. It causes a slight stinging sensation upon application. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing, like I&#x27;m &amp;#34;feeling it working&amp;#34;, or if that&#x27;s a bad thing...  The sensation doesn&#x27;t last very long, and there are no other irritations afterwards. My eye area feels moisturized, but I have not seen a significant difference otherwise.</li>
    <li> Fountain of youth in a bottle. Its amazing after the first use I could notice so much improvement in the orbital dermal layer of eye. After a few days of use I began to receive countless compliments and;  &amp;#34; What are you doing or using John questions? Naturally to a select few I told them the truth, &amp;#34;Best eye cream.&amp;#34; Most believed &amp; speculated on expensive procedures. Try it and if you have a conscious as I do spread the word this stuff is gold in a bottle. Kind- of- like RetinA without the burn or expence. Love ya &amp;#34;Best Eye Cream.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Tingles and makes your eyes feel awake. Would recommend!  Worth it. Plus its got all the good anti aging ingredients</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, more like a gel. It really easy to apply, and is not messy. It has no strong order either. I also have notice a slight improvement with bags under my eyes, but I have only been using the product for a couple days.</li>
    <li> I use this as a preventive measure. You only need a small amount.  It does slightly tingle on freshly washed skin.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since end-August and honestly, I really haven&#x27;t seen any changes around my eyes.  The photo is deceiving and in my opinion does not even diminish fine lines.  I&#x27;m still using it considering what I&#x27;ve paid for an eye cream until I find a product  that really does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give it one star if I had the choice. Used the product as directed and saw no difference at all. Just a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I am still using it, but haven&#x27;t noticed much change in eyes yet.  Perhaps it takes awhile to work.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating cream, seems to be working in my face very well,,, smoothness noticeably...</li>
    <li> Not sure how this products rates so high but it makes any lines around your eyes appear worse then they actually are after its applied, I guessing because it coats the area around your eyes with a thin layer of product that prevents movement by getting stiff, therefore when you smile the area around your eyes look worse. The best way to explain iis, it looks like your skins pulling in an unnatural way..</li>
    <li> Great combination serum! Vitamin C and Retinol in one bottle. Save money</li>
    <li> Sorry, I am not &amp;#34;loving&amp;#34; this product.  I&#x27;m not even sure that I &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it.  It&#x27;s supposed to help with firming....not so much.  For me, it&#x27;s just drying. Bummer.  I was really hopeful.  I will try to return it if it isn&#x27;t too late.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a gel serum, but it has very little consistancy.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s hydrating my skin much at all.  I have tried less expensive products that help hydrate the skin around my eyes more than this one.</li>
    <li> This is a gel formula so doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturising, used for about 2 months - didnt notice any difference to my eye area.</li>
    <li> Another promise without evident results.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, has a cooling feel because of the aloe. But absorbes into the skin quickly and has no tacky feel.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye serum.  It is light, doesn&#x27;t get in my eye or cause any problems with my makeup.  The  area around my eye is moisturized, has less small lines and  no black circles.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Having used the product for three weeks, I’m  still undecided on the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are of quality although I sense my skin type may not be a perfect match for this formula.&lt;br /&gt;Will update post six weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s like having a daily mini spa treatment for my eyes. So fresh and uplifting. My tired and bagged eyes are gone!!</li>
    <li> It works. Within a couple of days I noticed that the puffiness was going away. I still have circles but that is going to take time. Great product and you get a lot for your money. You don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot on your eyes, one pump is enough for both eyes.</li>
    <li> I tried this eye cream and it seems to improve the appearance of fine lines.  It&#x27;s easy to dispense and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Since I started using it my face is so much smoother and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product before and gave it a high rating.  In fact, I used the whole bottle and ordered more. When I started using the second bottle, my eyelids broke out in a scaly rash.  I don&#x27;t know what they did, but something changed.</li>
    <li> Trying something different.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me</li>
    <li> works just great. and got here in great timing..thank you</li>
    <li> 6 stars!!! I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I know they call it a cream, but really it is in the form of a gel. That aside, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, every night as part of my skin care routine. i have dry skin, starting to really show its 55 years. I think this gel has really softened the lines around my eyes, so I am noticing improvement in skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little sticky, and a little goes a long way. I notice a slight tingling, tightening sensation around my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and goes away quickly. In the morning the skin around my eyes is softer and as I said, the fine lines are much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; (I would have bought it even if they called it a gel) because it does seem to be doing what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a paid sample, and it came as expected.  It seems to have an astringent quality, and shrinks eye circles rather than cover them.  However, it&#x27;s pleasing to use, has a pleasant scent, and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Drys and irritates my skin very much.. messes up makeup around eyes and will not hold the make up on..</li>
    <li> Tightens area around eyes instantly!</li>
    <li> My skin became moist.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time but I have notice that my lines around my eyes are less noticeable and it has a pleasant scent and goes on really smooth.</li>
    <li> good for your skin...</li>
    <li> This is good and i like in my face</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three days and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed by the results Im seeing already. I&#x27;m 29 and starting to notice fine lines around my eyes when I smile. This gel really helped hide my imperfections and even my sisters noticed the difference it did for me!</li>
    <li> This product, while not actually a cream in my opinion, does absorb beautifully and some of the results are immediate. My skin was prepped for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it&#x27;s colorless. No more damaged pillowcases!&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product reminds me of an expensive facial I had last fall in Italy.&lt;br /&gt;From the results down to the pump I can&#x27;t think of anything but praise.</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent. i love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 weeks now and it works great.  I can definitely feel it working.</li>
    <li> Nice eyecream,but I think it&#x27;s more like a serum. Works well and I like that it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My skin feels better, it absorbs easily, and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> so good for me&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream so far!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true it is a good vitamin c serum ,try it,</li>
    <li> Already seeing results in less than a week, and this stuff really lasts a long time, too!</li>
    <li> Not impressed too much alcohol content or other items that does not do well with my fair skin and contact lenses.</li>
    <li> So glad this was a good product, good price to buy. Once you feel is best - use it the better the effect seems to appear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fire product, smells good!</li>
    <li> Good. But I had little skin trouble first time but after 2 or 3 times it was O.K. So, I&#x27;m not sure it is because of this Serum.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference!</li>
    <li> I really like this, doing an amazing job!</li>
    <li> Great eye serum. It goes on very smooth and smells pretty neutral (I&#x27;m big on not having creams/serums have a strange smell). So far so good on results. As with any product, you&#x27;ll need to use it consistently to see results.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream. It feels cooling when you put it on so I feel like it helps when my eyes are somewhat puffy. I&#x27;ve found that it tingles when I&#x27;ve put a little too much on. I would recommend this, especially as an alternative to other somewhat heavy-feeling eye creams.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my skin and it smells good. looking forward to seeing some results</li>
    <li> It is the best product for my eye cream&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep using it</li>
    <li> good&lt;br /&gt;I was really necessary. Very useful</li>
    <li> I am happy I tried this eye cream. I am only in my mid-30s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles. I do have under eye circles and puffy eyes especially in the morning. I like to use it first thing after I wash my face. It tingles, feels good. I have notice a difference, my skin is much smoother. I also use it on my forehead. I&#x27;d recommend this, good product!</li>
    <li> I am seriously happy with this one. I have been experimenting lately with anti-aging products as of late, since I am slowly approaching 40, and there are few products that stand out as really beneficial to my age set. THIS is one of them! I notice an added softness, and elasticity to my skin. No negative reactions to it, in fact with sensitive skin I am quite surprised.  Looking forward to trying more from this line.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for 2 weeks now and I like it :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok for the purpose. Doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or anything.</li>
</ol>
