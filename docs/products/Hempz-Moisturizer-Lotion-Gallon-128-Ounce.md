<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product at reasonable price</li>
    <li> Love this which is why I buy it by the GALLON</li>
    <li> I was buying the 2 pack of the standard size bottles.  This was way cheaper and it also comes with a hand pump.</li>
    <li> I have tried many moisturizers and this is fantastic, does not dry greasy and has a light smell. I would definately rec. this to anyone who frequents any type of tanning.</li>
    <li> Got this lotion for my wife who loves it. The ad specifically says that it comes with the pump, but when it arrived no pump.  I made a complaint on Amazon and the seller contacted my wife and said he was sure that the pump was in the package, but he would send us another one just to be nice.  No pump ever arrived.  Makes it hard to use lotion in a gallon container with no pump, but the lotion is still good.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everday and love it.  It is not too thick, has a faint fragrance, and helps hold my color.</li>
    <li> Our daughter recommended it, so we bought the gal. size and shared with 5 households!</li>
    <li> exactly the same product you pay for in the small pump bottles but buy in the gallon and really save.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It&#x27;s great to buy it in bulk! Would recommend to!</li>
    <li> Hempz is the BEST moisturizer out there in my opinion....love the smell, love how it goes on my skin, a little bit goes a long way, it&#x27;s non greasy....very happy with the looks of my skin after I use it, great for tanned skin, also prolongs your tan......was introduced to it at my tanning salon.....thank you Paradise Cove....thank you Amazon for the great price!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product in a economical size. Comes it pump. I used Hempz for over 10 years. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  The Hempz original smell is my favorite! I was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t be the same, but it is!  A great buy on a fantastic product!  I didn&#x27;t realize it came with a dispensing pump, so I bought a separate one - glad I did, the one that came with didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, absolutely the best body moisturizer.  I live in the desert and couldn&#x27;t be without it.  I buy it by the gallon about 3 times a year and am very thankful that it continues to be a product I can purchase as needed.  The box arrived a little smooshed on one corner but product was undamaged.  Delivery was on time.  All in all, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> works great  shipped fast</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of lotions for my diabetic feet and this is the best I have found. I have used it for over 8 months now. It helps to soften the skin. Rub it on and it will last all day.</li>
    <li> I order this volume every year.  Can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other lotion. This stuff smells great and keeps my skin hydrated for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than individual bottles. Great lotion. Highly Recommend. Wish there were more flavors available but is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Supre Hempz Herbal Moisturizer is the best my wife has ever used. She has me order a backup gallon long before she needs it as she cannot imagine not having it daily. It is amazing. Her skin is incredibly soft and smooth. It is truly a great lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to buy this lotion retail is $15 per 8 ounces I got  Great price</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion ever.  Makes skin super soft and silky feeling.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Honestly one of the best lotions on the market.  Never greasy, pleasant smell, works fast on very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly bought this lotion when I was actually looking for \\&quot;Hemp Nation\\&quot; lotion by Australian Gold.  The smell of this lotion is a tad strong, though it doesn&#x27;t overpower once it is soaked in.  It is reminiscent of \\&quot;Sweet Pea\\&quot; lotion from Victoria&#x27;s Secret so if you liked that one, you are sure to like this.  Overall, the moisture power is pretty good. Many lotions I have tried don&#x27;t keep me moisturized for very long, but this one has staying power.  Another bonus is that it didn&#x27;t make me itch at all, like most flowery-smelly products do.  I will definitely use this until it is gone, but next time I think i will go back to my Hemp Nation.  The smell is much more crisp and light and the texture is more lotion-gel than just lotion like this one.</li>
    <li> I love thsi lotion and it&#x27;s at a great price</li>
    <li> Yummy smell and super moisturizing. The lotion absorbs into skin easily and leaves skin feeling amazing. Great deal to purchase the gallon size - save $$! Seller was fantastic to work with and even included an extra goodie in the shipment. Item arrived earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> This formula is just amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 12 years, and I have always noticed a huge difference in the health of my skin during breaks.  I don&#x27;t even tan, I just really love the formula and smell.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Smells wonderful and feels great on my skin. Came with pump. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> great product great servive</li>
    <li> Have always love Hempz original and am very glad to have found the gallon size for a reasonable price. I will be a returning customer</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I was so happy to get it in the gallon size, because I go through a 17 oz. bottle in about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because the product description says \\&quot;with Pump\\&quot; but I didn&#x27;t get one with my order. The pump is kind of important here; it&#x27;s not exactly practical to pour lotion out of a heavy gallon container, either into your hand or into a smaller bottle. Now it&#x27;s just one more thing I have to go out and buy, which is a pain. It should come with the product, as advertised.</li>
    <li> One of the only lotions I use that doesn&#x27;t mess with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> awesome product i buy it every year</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It is perfect for anyone that has a tanning salon or just wants to use it for everyday use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love hemp lotion. I use it everyday after I get out of the shower. I tan and work out  everyday almost and the hemp lotion keeps my skin smooth soft and bright!! full recommendation for buying it!</li>
    <li> If you buy the 17 ounce bottle of Hempz lotion, you need to buy this refill bottle. Its well worth it!</li>
    <li> Half of it had leaked out very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;Packing was not very good!&lt;br /&gt;I like the product! This needed to be packed better for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this lotion for years and it is the best product on the market. It&#x27;s a very good price and I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Has a nice, fairly mild scent and absorbs pretty quickly. Doesn&#x27;t have or get that gross plastic smell that some lotions have (and it takes a while to go through a GALLON of moisturizer) Once absorbed, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or watery feeling behind. Does a great job of moisturizing. This lotion is used at a lot of tanning salons too.</li>
    <li> love the smell, feel and it makes my skin feel amazing.  I use this everyday.  I bought a smaller bottle and refill that each time it runs low.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion, and this lasts, the only thing is the pump didn&#x27;t come with the extender to get all the lotion out of the bottom. So getting the last half of this container out has been hard, since I fill up a smaller pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve ran out in the past and have had to resort to using other products. This by far leaves my skin soft and healthy looking. Love the smell also.</li>
    <li> I love this ver creamy texture. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner/sunbather/tanning salon owner and this lotion the absolute best moisturizer I have ever tried. There is no going back!!!</li>
    <li> The best lotion.. Great price..</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. It has a very thick consistency, so you tend to go through a lot of it. Reading the ingredients it doesn&#x27;t seem as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as the name would tend to imply. I found the smell pleasant, although quite strong and persistent.</li>
    <li> I just started tanning and they had Hempz at their salon. I never even heard of them before. I became obsessed with Hempz. So I bought this gallon and I know it&#x27;ll last me a longtime. The smell is amazing. And I love that its not greasy and absorbs nicely while still being very moisturizing. I&#x27;m a new Hempz addict would like to try more products! Shipping was very fast on this product also. Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I have sensetive skin and even light excema. I researched this product, as I have seen Hempz in many stores for sale at a very high price! I desired it, but then Wal-Mart got Malibu Hemp lotion that I could afford. Now having an option to buy 4 Malibu bottles through Wal-Mart or Venture out and purchase a gallon of Hempz? I did my research from customers with skin like mine, and just over-all reviews. This is a wonderful lotion that has great staying form, and is not needed to apply as much... I highly suggest this Original Hempz (I&#x27;ve never tried any other Hempz &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; than this Original) So commenting on what I personally have used. Very statisfied with quality and price! It sits in a bathroom cuboard and used daily....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I use this product for many years. I&#x27;m glad I found it in a gallon size.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for any skin type!  It&#x27;s a really great moisturizer and smells delicious. This is such a great deal that I couldn&#x27;t possibly pass it up!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from this seller again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Economical packaging for the lotion.  Great product, great fragrance, great feel.  Not greasy.  Thick and emollient rich product.  If you&#x27;ve never tried it, I&#x27;m confident you will like it.</li>
    <li> great for dry skin and also for dry skin problems.  It is easy to rub on and is long lasting on the hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance and lotion. I&#x27;d have to say hat aveeno is better for my skin after shaving than this though. But this is good when you wanna smell damn good before you climb into bed with ya man</li>
    <li> There is no better lotion in the world than this.  I buy it by the gallon because we use it so often.  Great after tanning, sun exposure,  after bathing....everything!  I would suggest everyone try it...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion at a great price by buying in bulk</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the value!</li>
    <li> Outstanding value. This Hempz moisturizer lotion has a beautiful  scent. Not overpowering but delicate. Very satisfied  with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years now and it never fails me.  It is highly moisturizing and affordable too.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well after tanning and also keeps the dry skin away during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all the girls out there.</li>
    <li> To buy this, cost $25 for 4oz... This is worth getting if you use lotion for all over.&lt;br /&gt;There will be no cutting corners when you get this amount.. Great price!</li>
    <li> Love this product since it doesn&#x27;t make me have a tacky/sticky touch on my skin after applying and it was a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years and would recommend it to others who have problems with dry skin.  A little goes a long way and buying it in this size will make it last over a year using it at least 2 times a day.  The cost is very reasonable when you will use it over a year.</li>
    <li> EDIT 2017-03-29:&lt;br /&gt;the price was 45.67 on May 24, 2015, but now it&#x27;s 69.44 (58+11.44 shipping).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just about running out, so the volume is about 2 years worth for me considering that there&#x27;s still some moisturizers around the house in multiple containers (though this isn&#x27;t the only moisturizer I used during that time; I have also been using eucerin).&lt;br /&gt;Price comparison:&lt;br /&gt;$0.062/day for the old price&lt;br /&gt;$0.095/day considering the new price&lt;br /&gt;However, I see more recent reviews that say the quality may have decreased in the past 2 years, so I&#x27;ll be searching for an alternative before settling on this again.&lt;br /&gt;Responding to my original review, I eventually purchased a pump separately, which has been indispensable. I got [[ASIN:B00A1184CY Bon Vital Pump for 1 Gallon Bottles]] for 7.15 (that includes tax, and shipping was free). It doesn&#x27;t work so well now that the bottle is almost empty, but it&#x27;s been much better than trying to get the stuff out by tilting the jug sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review from around June 2015:&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, this appears to be the real deal. I got this instead of the regular size because a lot of the reviews on the regular size said that it was a knock-off bubblegum brand. I felt that I was taking a risk with this, buying in bulk at around $45. It&#x27;s been around 4 years since I used Hempz, and while it&#x27;s true that it smells a bit like bubblegum, I&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s not a bubblegum knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;I saw that a lot of the reviews said that it had said it came with a pump but did not. Mine did not come with a pump, but I didn&#x27;t bother reading the product description, so I didn&#x27;t expect a pump either way. While it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s difficult to put into a container without a pump, it&#x27;s not impossible. At first, I was using an empty lotion container and its pump to pump the Hempz out of this container with the jug standing up. After filling up 3 bottles, the surface of the lotion was getting farther away from the opening of the jug. Since the lotion is so thick, I turned the entire container on its side. It took long enough for the lotion to reach the lip that I was able to pump sizable amount into another container before having to stand the jug up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it smells great, feels great, and is very pleasant to use. Thanks!g of the jug. Since the lotion is so thick, I turned the entire container on its side.

    <li> I&#x27;m a gardener and this is the best lotion for my hands, feet and whole body! We love the fragrance. I see an immediate improvement in my skin texture and appearance.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry skin my whole life, tried many, many products.  This one does the trick!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion. Kind of expensive but the gallon is the better buy. This is my second gallon purchase and I will buy another.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I&#x27;m glad I bought the gallon size, since I keep having&lt;br /&gt;to fill up little jars for my friends to try it out.  My cousin, who has terrible&lt;br /&gt;eczema, has fallen in love with this lotion, so I have to fill his jar once&lt;br /&gt;again, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and the large bottle was adequately packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Job!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this Lotion. The people I ordered from had this package practically over night. Im hooked and This bottle size is appropriate for me. lol</li>
    <li> Works great. I have diabetes and have to moisturizer often. Will continue to reorder this lotion.</li>
    <li> I adore Hempz products!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, will be ordering again. Product is amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Well, I bought 1, then another family member found out, then&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2, then 3.&lt;br /&gt;This is without a doubt the best lotion for you at the best price.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, and quick shipment.  What more could you ask for ???  I would and will buty this again.</li>
    <li> Hempz lotions are the best I have found at moisturizing and there is no irritation for me when using after shaving.  In fact, it is very soothing.  I usually order the pomegranate lotion by Hempz and unfortunately ordered this particular one by mistake.  Beware, it has a very strong flowery scent!  If you like flowery fragrance, it will be fine, but if not, please try another type by the Hempz brand.  I am only giving a three star because of strong scent.  Otherwise, it deserves a five star!</li>
    <li> One pump from the gallon pump and this moisturizer covers my whole body. Best moisturizer ever and smells great!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Isn&#x27;t oily or greasy. It&#x27;s perfect. Leaves skin truly moisturized and feeling great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff  at a great price. Hassle free ordering and receiving item.... Smells better than I do and smoother too !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will be coming back for another one but will be ordering the Cucumber Jasmine Lotion....Thank you for everything.  -Tee</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Used it many years ago and forgot about it then came back across it. Wonderful scent and works wonders for my skin...even came with a pump!</li>
    <li> I received this item fast. Earlier than expected. Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy. Great moisturizer. Will buy again from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  this is the third time purchasing this product and am still as satisfied as the first. This company has great delivery.  I received product within 3 days.</li>
    <li> Great way to save on my favorite hand lotion. I have regular sized bottles from past orders that I used for filling up. Very easy to fill, as the gallon size has a pump (the image doesn&#x27;t show it) and it works well. I found that if you slide the pump down halfway and release it and pump again, it works best, rather than pushing the pump all the way down - you can fill smaller bottles very easily that way.</li>
    <li> Hempz lotion is my favorite. Infused with hemp oil, no THC or drugs though, sorry. Moisturizes deep for really dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelmingly powerful scent. The scent it has isn&#x27;t feminine, so it works good for men.</li>
    <li> Love the gallon size - one big pump moisturizes and entire leg and half a pump for an arm.  Much better than pumping the smaller size too death.  And of course, I love the Hempz lotion, which is why I bought the gallon!</li>
    <li> About a year ago my hubby was having an allergic reaction to everything. We tried all different things. Changing detergent, body wash, shampoos, softeners and we switch to this lotion and it worked. I know buy a gallon every 3 months and got by family hooked on it...</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent!!!! So good!</li>
    <li> I had been given a sample of this product and really liked.  I loved that I was able to find it &#x27;in bulk&#x27;.  Big savings.</li>
    <li> Awesome price compared to the small bottles. I got this and use it to refill the small ones I already had :)</li>
    <li> best lotion I ever found</li>
    <li> I consider this my lotion gem (not many people know about it)! Its not easy to find and when I do its expensive. I love the smell and use it every day. Its thick but doesn&#x27;t get sticky on your skin, it soaks in and leaves you feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and this is the only thing that keeps my skin moist I bought this in January and it is half way gone. I am the only one who uses it all the time it is great stuff and def worth the $ instead of having to but bottle all the time</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this lotion everyday and it lasts us around a year; its so much cheaper to buy it this way then a bunch of small bottles. It keeps your skin so hydrated; and there&#x27;s no girly smell so he doesn&#x27;t mind using it.</li>
    <li> My Mother-in-law bought me a 17oz bottle for Christmas. By April it was all gone between me and our three other family members. She swore it was the best lotion and I agreed so much that I bought this Gallon for our home for less than $50.00. I already know it is worth ever red cent!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this moisturizer.she keeps reordering it.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I am a licensed  beautician and purchased this previously in retail sizes at my local beauty supply store.  This is a great alternative option, allowing for refill of smaller bottles, and economically priced for fabulous savings. I have purchased this more than once and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what the women in my life call Hempz and why I have to purchase it by the gallon.  My wife loves it.  My daughter says it cleared up a rash she had on her arm.  Everyone uses it after tanning.  It feels great, really lubricates, and, while I would personally prefer it to be unscented, the scent is tolerable.  I fill smaller bottles and give them away as birthday and Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> We have been using Hempz for years &amp; we love it!!! Not greasy, light weight &amp; smells great😃</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years now and found none better. I use it every morning and am a sun lover and it has kept my skin refreshed and looking good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion - it makes my skin feel amazing -- BUT the smell is a little fruity, something I had to get use to. But over all i love it!</li>
    <li> great, exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> cant live with out this lotion!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts the most moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve found- and I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  The original (the company does make other scents) has the most delicious fragrance.  I like it sooooo much that I decided to buy it by the gallon!</li>
    <li> I buy this gallon every few months and refill my little dispenser. The scent is light but feminine. Friends always ask me what it is. My favorite lotion for 8 years now.</li>
    <li> have used for about six months now, is great</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter, and this stuff is great.  It doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine, and it keeps your skin moist without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> My wife just love this it nice .I don&#x27;t use it but I got a kiss for it.keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this to anyone I know, it&#x27;s a smart buy compared to the small dose. it will go a long ways and it saved me money. I love this lotion. Smell is great and it&#x27;s not greasy. All natural is the way to go, Always.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Not greasy, smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It makes my skin feel soft and moist; and the scent is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and have used it for at least 10 years.  Good price from the seller and I will be back for more!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps maintain tan. Moisturizes my skin and leaves it feeling silky all day.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this lotion, it soaks in well and is not too greasy.  I love the deal buying it in this size!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and came timely with no issues.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I prefer buying the gallon size do the the value it provides. Best way to use it is to save a smaller pump bottle and refill it as needed. The pump on the gallon size pumps more than needed; the pump on the smaller bottle is just right.</li>
    <li> I got a travel size bottle of this as a gift once and loved it. I decided because of the higher price of the smaller bottles to just go with the gallon and same some money. Not only does it go on nicely but it makes my skin so smooth &amp; soft and the BEST part is that the smell is wonderful. The light clean fragrance actually stays with you all day so I don&#x27;t even have to wear perfume or cologne for my daily routine. The bottle DOES come with a pump top, even though its not mentioned in the description. I tan year round so I use a LOT of lotion and this is one of the better lotions I&#x27;ve used. I would highly recommend it to everyone. Just wish I could get some of the other fragrances in the gallon size like the coconut watermelon. But they do sell various scents of this lotion to suit everyone&#x27;s needs.</li>
