      <li>Over all I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i had to spend more money to get it from somewhere else.</li>
      <li>way better than the stuff you buy at sallys</li>
      <li>i love it an</li>
      <li>I hope the rest of the product is ok.</li>
      <li>so i used forms, okay</li>
      <li>I thought it would be easy to use</li>
      <li>It is strong but takes forever to shape and buff out.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even go on smooth.</li>
      <li>Everything was in the box and secure.</li>
      <li>Would of been great if liquid bottle was bigger.</li>

      <li>and I was really excited to use it.</li>
      <li>The powder is a nice clean color and the little dish is cute!</li>
      <li>Especially for price this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>, The powders are good, The primer does its job, and i love the little brush and dish!</li>
      <li>and this product sets up super fast</li>
      <li>and it was exactly what i was expecting and wanted to use.</li>
      <li>Thank u so much!</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered this was from another seller and never received it until I had to ask</li>
      <li>ha i tried it being the first thing</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews...</li>
      <li>the forms are hard but the product is so good</li>
      <li>there is sooooo much powder there</li>
      <li>works very well</li>
      <li>the primer smells like vinigar but it does work haha</li>
      <li>When I try to do my nails the powder gets really gummy.</li>
      <li>I got a free gift of the stickers used to make French tips in 3 styles.</li>
      <li>I only used the clear it seemed to be ok</li>
      <li>It was too small to work comfortably on your nails and for some reason the beads would get stuck to the brush and wouldn&#x27;t drop easily onto the nails.</li>
      <li>I tried using more and less liquid and still no change no matter how much liquid I use.</li>
      <li>I found one for five dollars less with much more to the set.</li>
      <li>Recommend highly for your self or as a gift.</li>
      <li>It came it early and the little glass dappen dish is adorable.</li>
      <li>But I had to get nail brushes, the one that came with the kit is short and the hairs in the brush fell out in the first application.</li>
      <li>Good product and came with a very small brush, you will need a bigger brush to do better acrylic nails, the brush that came with it is too small for the job.</li>
      <li>This works like a charm I only wished the pink was better quality overall</li>
      <li>With this you absolutely can&#x27;t because it will harden to a gummy texture, and after that it doesn&#x27;t become solid very quickly and stays gummy and is very hard to file.</li>
      <li>Not too bad not too great.</li>
      <li>Took more than a mouth long to get the items , they was very small</li>
      <li>it is really to small but for the price it was well worth it</li>

<li> Not too bad not too great.</li>
<li> Took more than a mouth long to get the items , they was very small</li>
<li> it is really to small but for the price it was well worth it</li>
<li> There would be enough acrylic LIQUID for a profession salon, but the powder containers are big enough for a long time use if you&#x27;re doing at home.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to get used to</li>
<li> With my normal powder I can set a ball of acrylic on my nail and let it sit for a few seconds before shaping.</li>
<li> Only complaint is the brush is WAY too small to easily work the acrylic.</li>
<li> i ordered this product along with about 6 other products at the same time and even though this is coming from a different company they were all coming from hong kong post.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t really see what colors the acrylic powder is because the tubs are black and the writing is black.</li>
<li> I am hooked..just wish it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to get..but</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used the pink or white yet.</li>
<li> Other than my dappen dish already packed broken and missing pieces, I have enjoyed using the product.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t adhere to nail very long.</li>
<li> Plain and simple.</li>
<li> well i got all the other stuff i ordered but not this.</li>
<li> Other than that will consider rebuying.</li>
<li> After waiting three months, two weeks past the last day of eta, it was returned to china.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve seen other reviews stating the packing was opened..</li>
<li> Do not buy doesn&#x27;t work at all don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews this product is horrific</li>
<li> Terrible a lot of vinegar in the product couldn&#x27;t perform good service</li>
<li> its been over a month since i ordered this product and as of today it been a month and a half since they gave me the delivery time frame.</li>
<li> The pink white and clear where all impossible to use.</li>
<li> but a little cloudy.</li>
<li> The little bowl is helpful</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> 2 of the acrylic powder didnt come with even though it stood it would, the powder activator liquid was also missing.</li>
<li> You also get the sticker nail forms a small #4 brush an</li>
<li> As soon as you add the powder to the liquid and place it on the nail it stays put and you can hardly shape it.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to work with</li>
<li> but the primer sucks.</li>
<li> The brush however, sucks.</li>
<li> brush really sucks</li>
<li> Was Not satisfied !</li>
<li> The brush that comes with it is no good so buy another</li>

    <li> Dont buy. Plain and simple.</li>
    <li> Got here before ETA and it was exactly what i was expecting and wanted to use. I am very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This here product Ichose it for the price but I tell you it is so mini I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I only used the clear it seemed to be ok but a little cloudy. I haven&#x27;t used the pink or white yet. So I guess I&#x27;ll come back later.</li>
    <li> 2 of the acrylic powder didnt come with even though it stood it would, the powder activator liquid was also missing.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product along with about 6 other products at the same time and even though this is coming from a different company they were all coming from hong kong post. well i got all the other stuff i ordered but not this. its been over a month since i ordered this product and as of today it been a month and a half since they gave me the delivery time frame. i never received what i ordered and thats bad for business so i had to spend more money to get it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Took more than a mouth long to get the items , they was very small im done with is hole thing</li>
    <li> Terrible a lot of vinegar in the product couldn&#x27;t perform good service it was home made I think</li>
    <li> It came it early and the little glass dappen dish is adorable. It looked really nice and I was really excited to use it. When I try to do my nails the powder gets really gummy. As soon as you add the powder to the liquid and place it on the nail it stays put and you can hardly shape it. I tried using more and less liquid and still no change no matter how much liquid I use. The pink white and clear where all impossible to use. With my normal powder I can set a ball of acrylic on my nail and let it sit for a few seconds before shaping. With this you absolutely can&#x27;t because it will harden to a gummy texture, and after that it doesn&#x27;t become solid very quickly and stays gummy and is very hard to file. I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews...</li>
    <li> Received before shipping date. Everything is here and in good condition. The details say 15gm powder there actually 30gm which is 1oz. Also the name on the product starts with a &amp;#34;H&amp;#34; in the picture for all of the items,  mine are the same company you can tell with the butterfly but my powders start with a &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; the liquid with a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; and the primer with a different &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; than the powders. I didn&#x27;t understand that but like I said you can tell its the same company/maker. You also get the sticker nail forms a small #4 brush an I got a free gift of the stickers used to make French tips in 3 styles.</li>
    <li> I got the product out and used it as soon as it got here, The liquid works well, The powders are good, The primer does its job, and i love the little brush and dish! This is a wonderful buy and everything works very well.</li>
    <li> _,. &#x27;Thank u so much!</li>
    <li> Horrible! It just sticks to your nails and doesn&#x27;t harden. It doesn&#x27;t even go on smooth. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> got this for the grand daughter and she is loving it, just learning the art.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit. But I had to get nail brushes, the one that came with the kit is short and the hairs in the brush fell out in the first application. Nail forms work great, product is good. Good practice kit or starter kit.</li>
    <li> Yeah... this was crap.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be easy to use but it isn&#x27;t.  No instructions were included.  I will be going back to using the gel nails.</li>
    <li> ha i tried it being the first thing and i got tips to do it with but they havent came yet so i used forms, okay the forms are hard but the product is so good i love it an there is sooooo much powder there the primer smells like vinigar but it does work haha</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really see what colors the acrylic powder is because the tubs are black and the writing is black. Also the acrylic liquid is smaller then stated. Nothing is in English so I am guessing the bottle that looks like a nail polish is the primer. Everything else is good though.</li>
    <li> The powder is a nice clean color and the little dish is cute! Forms a good strong bond. Use in a well ventilated area!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> It ok for the price but the primer sucks. The nails only last about 3 days before they start to lift. The brush that comes with it is no good so buy another and this product sets up super fast so it&#x27;s hard to work with</li>
    <li> Please do yourself a favor and save your time and money. I waited three months and I&#x27;ve seen other reviews stating the packing was opened.. My item was returned to sender upon arrival in US Post, I&#x27;m guessing because it was leaking. After waiting three months, two weeks past the last day of eta, it was returned to china. I had a az claim amazon immediately refunded my money. I found one for five dollars less with much more to the set. Check out olymstore for their acrylic powder set http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00HUOGAGC</li>
    <li> Full set for a great deal. Great first timer kit for acrylic nails. Recommend highly for your self or as a gift.</li>
    <li> 1. It has a ton of monomer&lt;br /&gt;2. A TON of powder&lt;br /&gt;3. The little bowl is helpful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush really sucks but I had another one. It&#x27;s a brush made for nail art painting. It&#x27;s pretty hard to get used to but it didn&#x27;t turn out too bad. The quality of the acrylic is great.</li>
    <li> Was Not satisfied !and worst brush ever</li>
    <li> Finally I received this. I tried writing a review before but wouldn&#x27;t let me post. The first time I ordered this was from another seller and never received it until I had to ask were my stuff is and they didn&#x27;t know. Crappy. So I ordered from a different seller and it finally got here. The liquid was a lot smaller than I thought it would be but it is a nice size. Everything was in the box and secure. My brush though, was smashed and bent now it&#x27;s trash, I can&#x27;t use it. Over all I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I just opened up my primer to find no brush!!! The brush fell off and is soaking in the primer all over the place! Smh I hope the rest of the product is ok. Its bad enough my brush is useless now I have to find a brush for my primer.</li>
    <li> Especially for price this is a good buy. Although it took a while to get to me I used it the night I received it and was very happy! Only complaint is the brush is WAY too small to easily work the acrylic.</li>
    <li> Do not buy doesn&#x27;t work at all don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews this product is horrific</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Arrived on time. Great!</li>
    <li> Not too bad not too great. Good starter kit.</li>
    <li> It came well packaged, secured and no leaking. This is good for in home users like me or for beginners. There would be enough acrylic LIQUID for a profession salon, but the powder containers are big enough for a long time use if you&#x27;re doing at home. Good product and came with a very small brush, you will need a bigger brush to do better acrylic nails, the brush that came with it is too small for the job. But otherwise, GOOD PRODUCT GREEEEEEAAAAAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Great product love it..way better than the stuff you buy at sallys..I am hooked..just wish it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to get..but its worth the wait!</li>
    <li> The brush however, sucks. It was too small to work comfortably on your nails and for some reason the beads would get stuck to the brush and wouldn&#x27;t drop easily onto the nails. All in all a good set but buy another brush. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> It is strong but takes forever to shape and buff out.  Doesn&#x27;t adhere to nail very long.</li>
    <li> works very well did my nails that day I got it and they look great. It got here about a week earlier than said. all products were nice size the brush that comes with it is really to small but for the price it was well worth it</li>
    <li> Other than my dappen dish already packed broken and missing pieces, I have enjoyed using the product. Not a fan of the quality of the white powder. Would of been great if liquid bottle was bigger. Other than that will consider rebuying.</li>
    <li> this is really great for beginners i would suggest to buy a better brush but it is very good kit.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm I only wished the pink was better quality overall I would&lt;br /&gt;Buy it again..it took forever to come so beware</li>
