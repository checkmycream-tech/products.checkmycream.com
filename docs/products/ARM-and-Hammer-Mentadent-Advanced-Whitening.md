    <li> My elderly father-in-law lives with us and has used this toothpaste for years. It is designed to provide just the right amount of toothpaste, in a combination, for brushing your teeth. Makes it perfect for someone too young, or too old, to do it properly on their own. The unfortunate thing is that I can no longer find it in local stores and I am afraid that it won&#x27;t be too long before it is no longer available. If you are already using it, you might want to stock up. If you aren&#x27;t already using it, you probably don&#x27;t want to start.</li>
