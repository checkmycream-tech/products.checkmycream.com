      <li>was excited when I found this one because I thought the brush looked great.</li>

      <li>The mascara itself, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my lashes.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Use it and love it.</li>
      <li>I never wear waterproof mascaras because I don&#x27;t like to use makeup remover, I love that I can just wash my face, and all of my makeup will come off.</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite mascara.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>and I &#x27;ve had to suffer to use the better mascaras.  </li>
      <li>I love and and won&#x27;t ever use anything else.</li>
      <li>Buxom Buxom Lash works much better than any drugstore brand.</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara of all time..</li>
      <li>The mascara is awesome to separate lashes, although I use three different mascaras each time because based on my exp.</li>
      <li>Definitely not disappointed with the results!</li>
      <li>no anything that looks like mascara, just too good to be real lashes.  </li>
      <li>probably it wasn&#x27;t touched, but it would make me feel better if it were in its original packaging.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear, doesn&#x27;t flake and comes off easily when I wash my face at night.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great but you can never get enough mascara on the brush to apply like most mascaras.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find it easy to apply the mascara.  </li>
      <li>The product stays in place all day, but smudges easily if I accidentally brush against my eyelashes or rub my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have medium length lashes that clump easily</li>
      <li>I got it free from Sephora and so far it has worked great.</li>
      <li>I have decent lashes, and a good mascara does wonders for them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I just love, love, love this mascara and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I ever ran straight from trying a product for the first time to the computer to write a review because I&#x27;m so impressed!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands and a huge number of department store brands and this is my fave.</li>
      <li>The brush is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I had tried this before from a friend, and I absolutely needed to own it.</li>
      <li>It seemed to take a few months, but now my eyelashes look great!</li>
      <li>One important note:  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth no clumps.</li>
      <li>...makes my eyelashes long and beautiful...</li>
      <li>The lashes are long and curled, the color is perfect, the lashes look so amazingly perfect they must be fake</li>
      <li>So full, each one so well defined but not too separated.  </li>
      <li>So I was scared when I bought this one as I really can&#x27;t afford to be experimenting with any more $20 mascaras.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this mascara in the trial size and liked it so much I bought the full size.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara, it really adds volume to my lashes.</li>
      <li>Not only did this irritate my eyes more than most, it did not stay put at all.  </li>
      <li>The last one I tried was Lancome because of their great user and expert reviews but it was just okay and for the money not nearly as worth it as most that L&#x27;Oreal makes.  </li>
      <li>I have tried dozens varying from $5 to $35 and this is right in the mid price range and is just a superior product.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It really does give your lashes a bit of a bump!!</li>
      <li>It builds volume very naturally without feeling stiff or getting clumpy and best of all</li>
      <li>Overall, its an amazing mascara and I recommend it to any person.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work better than any other mascara you would pick up at the drug store. Very disappointing. Save your money and pick up loreal lash stiletto for $7. Does the same exact thing.</li>
    <li> The very first time I tried this mascara was when Sephora gave me a sample tube (half the size). I tried it and fell in love! I&#x27;ve tried to find a replacement but nothing comes close to this; I&#x27;m close to finishing 3rd full sized tube now. I have a lot of mascaras and this is the only one I use daily. Its very buildable so I can choose to have natural looking lashes or lavishly full ones. The formula is less \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; than other brands out there. It has an almost waxy consistency which is great for me because with the other brands I usually end up getting mascara on my lids. With this, it&#x27;s almost instantly dry. The brush is fantastic. Its the rubber-like or silicone bristles which I like because they&#x27;re soft. They really do the job well and coat my lashes beautifully with no clumps. This mascara lasts me over 8 hours with no running. I just love, love, love this mascara and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My eyes are pretty sensitive. Not quite to the extent that I&#x27;m swearing off eye makeup, but definately enough so that the irritation has caused me to pull out a bunch of eye lashes on numerous occasions. Anyway, this mascara lengthens, defines, curls, it&#x27;s the wonder mascara. It builds volume very naturally without feeling stiff or getting clumpy and best of all I can wear it all day without any problems.</li>
    <li> One of my friends who has purchased all the high-end department store mascaras recommended this to me.  She said that it&#x27;s her favorite mascara, and outperforms the heavy hitters like Dior Show.  I&#x27;ve been buying this now for two years, and keep coming back to it.  Although the price is high (the reason I&#x27;ve strayed from it), it lasts a long time, makes your lashes look full and lush with just one coat, and is easy to remove (doesn&#x27;t require pulling and tugging at the delicate eye area).  It does flake a bit and leave some creasing under my eyes after about seven hours of wear, but I keep a small stash of Q-tips in my desk drawer at work, and can easily clean up any black strays.  This is a great mascara!</li>
    <li> I am amazed that this has so many good reviews!  I was especially hopeful about the review that mentioned it was great for sensitive eyes.  Not only did this irritate my eyes more than most, it did not stay put at all.  Flakes and smears, and wasted money. I tried CoverGirl LashBlast after this, and it was SO much better.  Stays put, looks great!</li>
    <li> No flakes, no clumps (when applied correctly) and super long, thick lashes. I get so many compliments on my lashes. This product is amazing. Use it and love it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a mascara fanatic. I&#x27;m always looking for new kinds to try, while I do have a few favorites that I tend to go back to now and then. I&#x27;ve yet to find the perfect one to stick to. I have decent lashes, and a good mascara does wonders for them.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I found this one because I thought the brush looked great. It was similar to one of my favorite mascara brushes and I liked that it was a larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;Upon using it the first time, it wasn&#x27;t bad. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed but I decided it was workable. After that it was not so great. After the first use I started to notice that the mascara dried up very quickly and made my lashes appear dry and clumpy. It did not separate my lashes well and dried to fast to shape them well. Also, the brush, having shorter bristles inside, got mascara all over the edge of my eyelid which I&#x27;d have to try to carefully remove after having applied mascara already. (not easy without messing up lashes further)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever ran straight from trying a product for the first time to the computer to write a review because I&#x27;m so impressed!  This mascara is perfect.  I have really sensitive eyes and this doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all, in fact, it barely feels like I&#x27;m wearing anything.  I did one eye and they both feel the same.  The most amazing thing though is how it applies and the finished look.  I have tried dozens of mascaras from drug store brands to higher $ ones.  The last one I tried was Lancome because of their great user and expert reviews but it was just okay and for the money not nearly as worth it as most that L&#x27;Oreal makes.  So I was scared when I bought this one as I really can&#x27;t afford to be experimenting with any more $20 mascaras.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to try another one though.  This one does everything I want.  It gives you that tons of lashes, fake lash/doll lash sort of thing.  So full, each one so well defined but not too separated.  You get a perfect fanned million lash look like they all advertise but you never get.  The lashes are long and curled, the color is perfect, the lashes look so amazingly perfect they must be fake BUT it does it in a way that looks totally natural, you can&#x27;t see the mascara on the lashes... no glumps, clumps, flakes, no stuck together, no anything that looks like mascara, just too good to be real lashes.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I have always been torn on what to go for in mascara because I always wanted both worlds.  I love makeup in the \\&quot;brings out your natural beauty and hides flaws\\&quot; sort of way.  I want to look perfectly natural but still look perfect and until now, I thought the only way to get voluminous, big, black, long lashes was to settle for the caked on mascara, BUT NOT NOW!  And the great thing is that you can do it in layers, let it dry and apply another layer until it&#x27;s all perfect and it still doesn&#x27;t get gunky!  Best wand ever, never had such perfect and easy application!  It&#x27;s amazing!  I don&#x27;t know how to explain those bad reviews, they must have been stored improperly before they received it or something because I have never tried a mascara more perfect than this one!  I haven&#x27;t had it on long enough to say for sure how well it lasts but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to be disappointed. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the best mascara ever, as some reviews claim, but I do like it a lot. I got it free from Sephora and so far it has worked great. No clumps, no crumbling during the day, no raccoon eyes. It does a nice job of giving me long thick lashes without creating the dreaded three lashed monster look. You can layer it for a more dramatic effect, or just use one swipe for everyday.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara about like any I can find in the local stores.  It&#x27;s allright.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara EVER!!! I have short thin eye lashes and have never been able to get them to look full or thick. It seemed to take a few months, but now my eyelashes look great! Way thicker and longer than I could have ever imagined. I&#x27;ve also noticed that this mascara doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t flake at all after all day wear. It doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes or irritate them like cheaper drugstore brands. I love and and won&#x27;t ever use anything else. If only they would make a brown/black color.</li>
    <li> I have paraben allergies and I &#x27;ve had to suffer to use the better mascaras.  This is now my favorite mascara.  My eyes don&#x27;t itch or burn and it goes on nicely, not a thick goo or clumps.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara because I can no longer find it at my local store (I think it&#x27;s been discontinued).  I love the coverage I get, it lengthens my eyelashes to incredible lengths and I have received a lot of compliments on my eyes.  When using this mascara, it really makes my eyes pop, even if I just wear it alone.  I really wish it hadn&#x27;t been discontinued, because it&#x27;s a great mascara.</li>
    <li> I had tried this before from a friend, and I absolutely needed to own it. Definitely not disappointed with the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sampling and searching for the perfect mascara for many years. Some miracle formula to make my thin, sparse, short lashes look pin-up worthy without falsies. It seems like a new mascara hits the shelf every month and I always take the bait! With Buxom, I&#x27;ve never spent so much on a mascara but now that I&#x27;ve had to finally toss out the dried up tube, I am unsatisfied with anything else. I&#x27;ve purchased three different drugstore brand mascaras (to include ol&#x27; faithful that was pre-Buxom) since I ran out of the Buxom brand and I just tossed them in the trash and ordered a new tube of Buxom. It&#x27;s not waterproof but it&#x27;s certainly water/sweat/tear resistant. And unlike waterproof mascaras, it leaves my lashes feeling very soft and full. Give me the doe-eyes I&#x27;ve always wanted. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it really adds volume to my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or get clumpy. I do, however, notice that it may drop some mascara flecks on my cheeks throughout the day. But still, awesome product.</li>
    <li> THIS MASCARA IS FAKE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! FAKE DRY AND NOT REAL BUXOM MASCARA</li>
    <li> Im not a mascara person. I normaly wear cover girl waterproof eye lights. I got tis wore it once, and smudged every where. I didnt how it felt. Greasy and heavy, but i do go for more natural looks and feels. Wasnt happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras, from drug store to high end and back again. The wand does a fantastic job of separating lashes, the black is a nice, deep black, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with flaking.  I may actually be convinced to switch to Buxom as my go-to.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Really lengthens and thickens my lashes</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to get a sample of the buxom lash and I absolutely loved it. The brush is very full and thick, but the bristles are too close together that the mascara will clump your lashes. The brush is in the shape of an hourglass so it fits the contour of your eye, and its very easy to apply mascara to lower lashes. I have long lashes, but not thick and this makes them very lush looking. It also made them very soft feeling, even with two coats (this creates a false lash look easily).     After a couple months use, it didn&#x27;t get the same terrible smell nor did it dry up like some other mascaras do. Overall, its an amazing mascara and I recommend it to any person.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, I thought I had found a mascara that gave me the length and lift I needed but after trying Buxom this is the best!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this as it seemed like a very large brush but I love it. I use it everyday and have replaced it more than one time since I first bought this one. It doesn&#x27;t clump and if you use 2 mascaras like I do I use this second ,and it unclumps any clumps from the first one. It really does give your lashes a bit of a bump!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all mascaras.  This is the only one I found that I can where.  So, what makes this a better product for us who can&#x27;t where mascaras, the INGREDIENTS!    *One important note:  You do have to change it every 6-8weeks.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals products, but I don&#x27;t care much for this mascara. I love the brush on it, but I feel that after a few hours, it starts to get flakey and Starts to smeer on my face, and get in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara!  Takes a few coats to get the fullness I like, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Love the brush too.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes all stuck together.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them). This is definitely worth the $18 I paid. It adds volume and length! Buxom Buxom Lash works much better than any drugstore brand. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not only does this mascara make my lashes look thick &amp; long they never ever clump. Now I have used this product with the changeable brush and had problems with that so I went back to this one.  You can never go wrong with BOXOM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;Does not Clump&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens Lashes&lt;br /&gt;Thickens Lashes&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wipe off without tugging skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age Range: 40-45</li>
    <li> Bought this product after reading the reviews and decided to spend the money for it.  Have been disappointed in the results so far.  It&#x27;s not a bad product but in my opinion isn&#x27;t any better than products I&#x27;ve used that cost a lot less.  Will go back to a cheaper product on my next purchase.</li>
    <li> Obviously this was my own oversight, but FYI, this is sold new WITHOUT BOX.  Given that this is mascara, I think that&#x27;s unhygienic - probably it wasn&#x27;t touched, but it would make me feel better if it were in its original packaging.  I am returning this, and the seller was very courteous about accepting the return.  1 star for the product, 5 stars for the seller, so an average of 2.5, rounded down to 2 because this is technically a product review.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be disappointing.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my lashes... they certainly weren&#x27;t thick and lush which is what I was hoping for.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands and a huge number of department store brands and this is my fave. It doesn&#x27;t smear, doesn&#x27;t flake and comes off easily when I wash my face at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this product under the recommendation of another person. This is not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great but you can never get enough mascara on the brush to apply like most mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;It usually takes at least 3-4 applications to even appear that I have any mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;Too much aggrivation and too expensive in comparison to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I first tried this mascara in the trial size and liked it so much I bought the full size. I really like the way it covers all the lashes evenly with the big brush. Some might not like the brush size, but I do. I find it easy to apply the mascara.  Now this is the only mascara I will ever buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara on a whim and initially I loved it.  I thought it did make my lashes lush and full.  The problem is I was incredibly sensitive to it.  After a week or so I noticed that I had a red itchy rim around my eyes.  It was dermatitis.  There is something in this product that may irritate certain individuals it seems.  After I switched out to a different brand of mascara I no longer have the problem now.  Bottom line: if you tend to have allergic reactions and sensitive skin, beware of this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new mascara, so I read some reviews online and decided to give this one a try. I purchased it at Sephora for a fraction of the price. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this mascara. I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything too dramatic, but something appropriate for everyday wear. I have long eyelashes, so I&#x27;m more concerned with color. The brush makes it easy to get all of my lashes, even the little one in the corners. I do get small clumps when I apply, but they are easy to take off. The product stays in place all day, but smudges easily if I accidentally brush against my eyelashes or rub my eyes. I only use on my top lashes for an everyday look.</li>
    <li> At first, I found this mascara pretty disappointing. Here&#x27;s my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is large and plastic, and looks like it would define/coat lashes well, but I think the formula is way too thin for my liking. I like how I didn&#x27;t get clumps, but it simply didn&#x27;t make much of a difference even after a few coats. When I wear mascara, I want drama!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is high-quality, but just isn&#x27;t ENOUGH. I can see myself reaching for it as a layering mascara because it&#x27;s such a thin, non-clumpy formula, but it&#x27;s not really what I want out of a mascara. There are many drugstore mascaras I prefer over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my UPDATED review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While multiple coats of this mascara isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;intensely volumizing,&amp;#34; as written in the product statement, it has become one of my go-to natural, everyday mascaras. It isn&#x27;t dramatic, no, but it&#x27;s clump-free and doesn&#x27;t smudge much either! I typically use this as my first coat because it doesn&#x27;t create clumps. On a low-key day, I&#x27;ll stop there. If I have extra time in the morning or I&#x27;m taking extra care to make myself up, I&#x27;ll add a coat of a more dramatic mascara (I LOVE Lancôme Hypnose and Benefit They&#x27;re Real!) and it&#x27;ll really make my eyes pop! Using this as a &amp;#34;base coat&amp;#34; is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done for my eyelashes. They really stand out, much more than with just a regular coat of dramatic mascara, and they don&#x27;t clump up either, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like anyone with naturally long eyelashes (e.g. all my naturally eyelash-blessed Italian friends) will benefit the most from this mascara, since it enhances what you already have naturally and clump-free. If you have short, thin, or straight lashes, you might want something that provides more volume, length, or curl.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it. So much oomph for so little use! Will purchase this again and again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara on earth. I have tried dozens varying from $5 to $35 and this is right in the mid price range and is just a superior product. Makes my lashes look like really good extensions have been added. No clumping and not too extreme.</li>
    <li> They sell it for $19.  Not $32.  I don&#x27;t know why this seller is price gauging so badly, and then to add an extra $5 for shipping.  I love this mascara but apparently I need to swing by JCPenny that has a sephora inside if I want my mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara. I have medium length lashes that clump easily and I have been searching for a mascara that lengthens without it looking too fake. There is no clumping and my eyelashes always look longer and fuller after I apply this mascara. I think it has to do with the wand too, it makes the mascara go on smooth but thick. I just love this mascara and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Mascara was dried out and inefficient upon arrival.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and this has never happened before.  Lesson learned not something you buy online.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few days ago and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Adds great volume and length.  I like the big brush and so far, have not experienced any flaking.  However, I did not and probably will not ever purchase this product from Amazon. I do purchase a lot of products from Amazon because of the great deals but this is not one of them. As the other reviewer stated, this product can be purchased at Sephora for $19.00.</li>
    <li> You know, I know it&#x27;s just black gunk that goes on my eyelashes, but they are certainly not all created equal. The mascara itself, it&#x27;s ok. It does clump, I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why people seem to think it doesn&#x27;t clump. The problem is too much mascara is left on the brush, when you pull it out of the tube not enough is wiped off. If they could just fix that, I would like this product a great deal more. It does layer well if I can wipe off the extra on a tissue first.... I also don&#x27;t care for the shape of the brush. The bristles are nice, they&#x27;re short and separate well, but the end of the brush is so bulbous I can&#x27;t get it in the corner of my eye as nicely as I&#x27;d like. I never wear waterproof mascaras because I don&#x27;t like to use makeup remover, I love that I can just wash my face, and all of my makeup will come off. That is not true with this mascara. Even though it is NOT the waterproof version, I have to use a makeup remover. Using my normal face wash is not enough, and am left with what looks like smudged day old black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the tube is finished, I will not repurchase. However it is not a terrible product where I will be throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara EVER!!!  I am picky and I think I have tried every brand.  It is worth the money.  Buy some today:)</li>
    <li> Works just as Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real.. BUT I don&#x27;t know why is priced at $29 here when even retailers like Sephora sell it for $19. The mascara is awesome to separate lashes, although I use three different mascaras each time because based on my exp. there is not one mascara that has it all, so I use this to define my lashes, then one for volume and another to make them long.  Also, I wear contacts and the waterproof version is perfect for me, doesn&#x27;t flake at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara of all time..doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on perfect...makes my eyelashes long and beautiful...Would recommend this to anyone!  Great product</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have found since I started wearing mascara (I&#x27;m 27).  It just makes my lashes look longer and fuller than any other, and it separates them really well.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth no clumps. It really plumbs up my lashes and makes them look very long. would buy again.</li>
