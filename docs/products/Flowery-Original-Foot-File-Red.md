      <li>I was so glad to finally find this - it is the very best</li>

      <li>It may be a bit more costly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best, and the only one I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
      <li>This is the best ever and the only file a now use.</li>

      <li>It is worth the money!</li>

      <li>strong, just bought this one to replace my old one that lasted for years!</li>
      <li>My advice is go to the beauty supply store, buy one rough and one smooth file and they will work better than this version of the Swedish Clover foot file.</li>
      <li>Was pretty excited about this product from reading the high reviews.  </li>
      <li>love this foot life, this is my second one, so I can keep one at my friends house on his nightstand..........</li>
      <li>Okay I had my last one since 2008-</li>
      <li>I use the rougher side first, then the smoother side.  </li>
      <li>I do think the original Swedish Fot-Fil lasted a little longer, as the last 2 we&#x27;ve had, the sanding stickers lost their adhesive more quickly than the original.</li>
      <li>&quot; I still made sure to dry it off &amp; stand it up at an angle</li>
      <li>but it last for quite a l o n g time and does a fine job.</li>
      <li>I find that using this after a shower or bath really helps.  </li>
      <li>This works very well - a bit too well in one case -</li>
      <li>My original Swedish Clover Foot File was actually made in Sweden.  </li>
      <li>I thought if I bought the more expensive file it would be better but it is not.</li>
      <li>While its not as good as my Diamancel, it costs about $40 less and can be used in the shower (the Diamancel products should be used on dry skin.)  </li>
      <li>Please note that NONE of the superlative reviews for this once widely-loved product are new.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time so it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have used a foot file like this since I first discovered the original-way back in the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I use it a few times a week to keep my feet soft and callus free between pedicures.  </li>
      <li>I really like this Clover foot file, and this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought as a gift.</li>
      <li>This is the same kind my professional pedicurist uses, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not doing something right, but I expected it to be longer lasting.</li>
      <li>I found out about this file from my local day spa: It really rubs off the calluses and lasts longer than other files I have tried (that are not metal)</li>
      <li>The foot filer now made by Swedish Clover is a cheap imitation of the one made a few years ago.</li>
      <li>Even previously satisfied customers have left negative reviews, sadly noting that they&#x27;ve found no substitute for the original.</li>

<li> I had to buy a new one only because the old one got lost when we moved this past summer.  </li>
<li> However, they are reasonably priced, so I&#x27;ll still purchase replacements when the sander become unglued or just plain wear out.</li>

<li> I use this at least once a week, and it is very durable - even in the shower.</li>
<li> so cannot at this time rate their long term quality.  </li>
<li> The one I bought for myself earlier this year is starting to have the black file part peel off.</li>
<li> Feels like getting a professional pedicure for very little money.</li>
<li> While it is waterproof it works about the same whether you use it while you&#x27;re still in the water or after you get out, as long as the skin has soaked a little</li>
<li> It can be used on a dry or wet foot.</li>
<li> Not the same quality as my previous Flowery Swedish Clover.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t want to have rough feet sliding into bed</li>
<li> I started using this file a few years ago after trying several things.</li>
<li> While this file was lost I was using an expensive Diamoncel file which is almost 4 times as expensive, can&#x27;t be used in the shower, and wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
<li> so take a little care in using it.</li>
<li> it was getting a little worn out-lol.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how it could be waterproof.  </li>
<li> …they hardly have to file them.  </li>
<li> I have crazy calluses on my heels, especially in the summer when I wear sandles all the time.  </li>
<li> Bought one from a salon got it home and realized it was a china one- thin, peeled etc.</li>
<li> crap.</li>

    <li> I love this file.  I have one that lasted about 10 years and was lost until I found this one online.  I think it is the best file available for feet.</li>
    <li> This is a good foot file.  I have crazy calluses on my heels, especially in the summer when I wear sandles all the time.  I find that using this after a shower or bath really helps.  While it is waterproof it works about the same whether you use it while you&#x27;re still in the water or after you get out, as long as the skin has soaked a little so it&#x27;s softened.</li>
    <li> Was pretty excited about this product from reading the high reviews.  After 2 weeks of use, the abrasive paper started peeling off on both sides.  Even though it says \\&quot;Waterproof\\&quot; I still made sure to dry it off &amp; stand it up at an angle so any water I missed would drip off.  I&#x27;m not sure how it could be waterproof.  After it peels up, it looks like it&#x27;s cardboard underneath.  If this product stayed together, I would have given it a 5.  But for the money this cost and how long it last, it&#x27;s a big 1-star.</li>
    <li> The foot filer now made by Swedish Clover is a cheap imitation of the one made a few years ago. I thought if I bought the more expensive file it would be better but it is not. My advice is go to the beauty supply store, buy one rough and one smooth file and they will work better than this version of the Swedish Clover foot file.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. My hairdresser sold me one 7 years ago and it looks as good and works as well today as it did then. I made the mistake of buying one that looked similar (but was cheaper) and it fell apart almost immediately. I will always go for the Swedish Clover now.</li>
    <li> I have bought these as gifts for friends, but regularly paid $14!  While its not as good as my Diamancel, it costs about $40 less and can be used in the shower (the Diamancel products should be used on dry skin.)  This is a good product for your travel bag also.</li>
    <li> I have had this file for years, literally.  I had to buy a new one only because the old one got lost when we moved this past summer.  It is amazingly durable, hangs in the shower without being ruined, and does an amazing job on my feet.  I use it probably 4 times a week at the end of my shower so my feet have softened a bit.  I use the rougher side first, then the smoother side.  Whenever I get a pedicure at a salon they are always so surprised that my feet are so nice…they hardly have to file them.  While this file was lost I was using an expensive Diamoncel file which is almost 4 times as expensive, can&#x27;t be used in the shower, and wasn&#x27;t as good.  This file is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to me.</li>
    <li> This works very well - a bit too well in one case - so take a little care in using it.</li>
    <li> Okay I had my last one since 2008- it was getting a little worn out-lol. Bought one from a salon got it home and realized it was a china one- thin, peeled etc. crap. Found this and bought it immediately. My feet are now in bliss again.</li>
    <li> I started using this file a few years ago after trying several things. This is the best ever and the only file a now use. It lasts a long time so it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> My original Swedish Clover Foot File was actually made in Sweden.  These version are made in China - not the same quality.  They look just like the original one and seem well made.  I bought them as gifts so cannot at this time rate their long term quality.  My reason for the 4-stars rating is that the word &amp;#34;Swedish&amp;#34; is misleading.  It should say &amp;#34;SWEDISH STYLE&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had one was glad to find another works great on feet.</li>
    <li> My daughter came across this product, she had paid twice the price( at a beauty supply store) She had it for years and loved it . When I went on line and found it and ordered it, I was very happy I did ,It does the job better than any pumice stone and I believe will last longer. It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Used these files all the time, they are the best things invented. Feels like getting a professional pedicure for very little money.</li>
    <li> This is the only file I use cuz its the only one which truly works.It is amazing.Ive used these for 15 years.Each one is guaranteed to work perfectly for 5 years,and it does.Worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> It may be a bit more costly but it last for quite a l o n g time and does a fine job. It can be used on a dry or wet foot. I have used this product for many years.</li>
    <li> This item appears to be a knock off. Not the same quality as my previous Flowery Swedish Clover.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to finally find this - it is the very best and I&#x27;ve tried alot of them. I stocked up, but then ended giving them to sisters, friends, so I need to reorder and replenish my supply!</li>
    <li> I really like this Clover foot file, and this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought as a gift. The one I bought for myself earlier this year is starting to have the black file part peel off. This is the same kind my professional pedicurist uses, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not doing something right, but I expected it to be longer lasting. I still continue to use it, I may try super gluing that part peeeling back on, because it files beautifully!</li>
    <li> This is a great foot file!  I use this at least once a week, and it is very durable - even in the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this after my cousin recommended it to me, and she&#x27;s had hers fro years.  It&#x27;s design is perfect to help get the leverage you need to use this in the shower.  I use it a few times a week to keep my feet soft and callus free between pedicures.  Great product!</li>
    <li> the best! strong, just bought this one to replace my old one that lasted for years!</li>
    <li> My pedicurist recommended this - she says it is the only foot file she would recommend.  I agree.  The best!</li>
    <li> have used one of these for years and loved it so i bought another one for my son as a gift. his feet look a whole lot better now!!!</li>
    <li> This was used in a salon I visited.  It was marvelous, so I ordered a few as gifts for my adult kids. They loved it.</li>
    <li> I have used a foot file like this since I first discovered the original-way back in the 1980&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the best, and the only one I&#x27;ll ever buy. Others just don&#x27;t hold up. My husband &amp; I each have our own personal one. I do think the original Swedish Fot-Fil lasted a little longer, as the last 2 we&#x27;ve had, the sanding stickers lost their adhesive more quickly than the original. However, they are reasonably priced, so I&#x27;ll still purchase replacements when the sander become unglued or just plain wear out.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for the bottom of my heels!</li>
    <li> I found out about this file from my local day spa: It really rubs off the calluses and lasts longer than other files I have tried (that are not metal)</li>
    <li> love this foot life, this is my second one, so I can keep one at my friends house on his nightstand..........don&#x27;t want to have rough feet sliding into bed</li>
    <li> This is one ogf those life altering discoveries.  Just buy one.  I discovered these at Aveda when I was a student.  Best there is.</li>
    <li> Please note that NONE of the superlative reviews for this once widely-loved product are new.  This is because the foot file is now made in China from inferior materials.  It doesn&#x27;t matter which merchant you check with, the reviews all tell the same story.  Even previously satisfied customers have left negative reviews, sadly noting that they&#x27;ve found no substitute for the original.</li>
