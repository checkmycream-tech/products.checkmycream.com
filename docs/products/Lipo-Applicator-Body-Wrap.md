      <li>These lipo wraps are extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 5 wraps.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty good at eating right and exercising.</li>
      <li>These are great to use if you have a photo shoot coming up fat that you need to lose weight quick for, my cousin uses them for a week before a shoot to make sure she has no extra body fat.</li>
      <li>I was hoping these would smooth my stomach a bit, and they did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work like most, but it really does!</li>
      <li>so I was excited when these came in the mail.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that the results would continue if I used the product 5 days in a row which I plan on doing.</li>
      <li>I did exercise during and eat clean but the tape measure cannot lie.</li>
      <li>received this product at a full discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I found this item to be very helpful in my tummy area that needed most improvement.</li>
      <li>With that being said, I gave this four stars because this is a temporary fix and would be great to use if you have an event coming up that you need to lose a few inches for.</li>
      <li>This product is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>, Item described very well and love the instruction send before the product is send, it does work I will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>Product was received complimentary for review purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
      <li>I put this on right before bed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still an advocate for eating right and exercising in order to get the results.</li>
      <li>Every time I gain weight it goes right to my stomach.</li>
      <li>I did see a noticeable difference right away</li>
      <li>It actually felt pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery I would buy again from seller</li>
      <li>First, I noticed the menthol smell, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>My skin was soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The first time I wrapped I didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
      <li>I have two more applications left.</li>
      <li>However lately I have been eating more junk and less of the good stuff and my waist line was beginning to show a muffin top.</li>
      <li>I was sure I drank about double my normal amount of water and was so excited to see about 7 inches gone from my big ole belly.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need saran wrap because this sticks very well.</li>
      <li>and then you can really feel them working.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>This wraps really works</li>
      <li>The package suggests wrapping saran wrap over the wrap, however I didn&#x27;t have much luck with that</li>
      <li>Application was easy, you just peel the wrap off of the sticky paper and wrap it around your waste.</li>
      <li>When I awoke and took the wrap off I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at the difference I saw after one application.</li>
      <li>They definitely tighten up the fat and skin creating a more firm area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After full treatment my skin was tighten and firm;</li>
      <li>I have seen various forms of this product in the direct sale circuit but could never justify spending money on something that may or may not work.</li>
      <li>Even as I write this I&#x27;m kind of skeptical.  </li>
      <li>I just got this and put it on; its easy to use, but it feels so hot and cold at the same time and smells a lot!</li>

<li> Now, I did change the saran wrap because it doesn&#x27;t stick if you&#x27;re a bit active but that has nothing to do with the wrap</li>
<li> and they&#x27;re hard to conceal under a basic t-shirt.</li>
<li> Keep in mind this tightens and breaks down your fat in the area you apply.</li>
<li> Anyway my only complaint is that when you take it off it&#x27;s a buggery mess.  </li>
<li> My skin was still a little damp and part of the wrap tore</li>
<li> I felt like my belly wasn&#x27;t hanging over as much as usual.</li>
<li> after one wrap my stretch marks were hardly visible abd after 2 wraps you could no longer see I had stretch marks from my pregnancy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just hard to believe.</li>
<li> Everyone is talking about body wraps lately, so</li>
<li> As I slept, I wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, or restricted.</li>
<li> I hate seeing the bulges</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the best products out there. .I seen results instantly I would kept buying this and would recommend it to friends and family. ..</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this product at all. I saw no results and after using them I had a sticky residue left on my skin that took 20 minutes to scrub off. I would recommend saving your $60 and finding another product.</li>
    <li> I have seen various forms of this product in the direct sale circuit but could never justify spending money on something that may or may not work. So when I was given the opportunity to try this in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the opportunity. Application was easy, you just peel the wrap off of the sticky paper and wrap it around your waste. Your skin does need to by dry. My skin was still a little damp and part of the wrap tore and I blame that for the wet skin not the product. The package suggests wrapping saran wrap over the wrap, however I didn&#x27;t have much luck with that and I took the saran wrap off within 5 minutes. You really don&#x27;t need saran wrap because this sticks very well. I put this on right before bed so I could see what kind of results I would get after about 8 hours.  The wrap does have a menthol smell and tingling sensation kind of like what you would use on sore muscles. It actually felt pretty nice. When I awoke and took the wrap off I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at the difference I saw after one application. Let me first say that I am on the small size, I have never had kids and I&#x27;m pretty good at eating right and exercising. However lately I have been eating more junk and less of the good stuff and my waist line was beginning to show a muffin top. I did see a noticeable difference right away and I&#x27;m pretty sure that the results would continue if I used the product 5 days in a row which I plan on doing. I wonder how these would work if you wrapped them around your thighs? With that being said, I gave this four stars because this is a temporary fix and would be great to use if you have an event coming up that you need to lose a few inches for. I&#x27;m still an advocate for eating right and exercising in order to get the results. A flat tummy is made in the kitchen not from a wrap.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work like most, but it really does! Awesome! Keep in mind this tightens and breaks down your fat in the area you apply. I lost several inches using the body wraps. However, if you don&#x27;t use them correctly the wraps will not be effective. When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 5 wraps. The first time I wrapped I didn&#x27;t notice any results.  After full treatment my skin was tighten and firm; and I did it along with healthy eating and exercise. It is not a permanent fix, but is great for using before vacation. The reason I give the product 4 stars and not 5 is because I wished the results lasted longer. This product is worth a try.  Product was received complimentary for review purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Everyone is talking about body wraps lately, so I though it was time to try it myself. The wrap itself is easy to use. Remove backing and stick around your waist. For best results wrap Saran Wrap over the body wrap and wear overnight. I tried this method, as I need all the help I can get. First, I noticed the menthol smell, not overpowering. Then the cooling sensation, it was refreshing. As I slept, I wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, or restricted. In the morning I removed the Saran Wrap, then the body wrap. A couple spots of sticky residue were left here and there, I just wiped them off. My skin was soft and smooth. I actually felt thinner. I put on a pair of pants, that I&#x27;m usually self conscious in, and wore them with just a plain tee. I felt like my belly wasn&#x27;t hanging over as much as usual. It is a great feeling. You can use these once a week. I will definately use these again. They work great.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a full discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery I would buy again from seller, Item described very well and love the instruction send before the product is send, it does work I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> So I had to give these a thorough test and used all 5 wraps in about two weeks. I have always wanted to try wraps so I was excited when these came in the mail. Every time I gain weight it goes right to my stomach. I hate seeing the bulges and they&#x27;re hard to conceal under a basic t-shirt. I was hoping these would smooth my stomach a bit, and they did.&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I am extremely impressed with my results from these and will definitely continue to purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;First, they were very easy to put on and I used some saran wrap to keep them in place.&lt;br /&gt;I wore each one for about 18 hours, including sleeping in them overnight. They were very comfortable to have on, hid well under my clothes, didn&#x27;t feel sweaty either.&lt;br /&gt;I ate, drank, watched TV, ran errands, slept, did chores around the house, all while wearing an Ultimate Body Wrap. Now, I did change the saran wrap because it doesn&#x27;t stick if you&#x27;re a bit active but that has nothing to do with the wrap itself.&lt;br /&gt;They start to heat up with your body and then you can really feel them working.&lt;br /&gt;After my test, I can see a noticeable difference in my stomach and waist. My shirts look better on. The bulges due to rolls are smaller. I measured and my stomach, measuring at my belly button, is three inches slimmer.&lt;br /&gt;These would be fantastic to use in preparation for a special occasion, event, or vacation that you want to look your best for. They definitely tighten up the fat and skin creating a more firm area.&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY impressed with these. I kept going on and on about them to my husband and his sisters and now they all want to try them. I can&#x27;t believe how successful these were for me. I&#x27;m very happy with my results and with prolonged use I can see these keeping my stomach looking firmer and better *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and it really works. I give it 5stars!!!</li>
    <li> This wraps really works</li>
    <li> I found this item to be very helpful in my tummy area that needed most improvement.</li>
    <li> I used this without believing it would work. After three applications I have lost 2.5 inches on my waist and 1.5 in my hip.  I have two more applications left. Even as I write this I&#x27;m kind of skeptical.  It&#x27;s just hard to believe. I did exercise during and eat clean but the tape measure cannot lie. Anyway my only complaint is that when you take it off it&#x27;s a buggery mess.  Very gross.  So that part I could do without.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Going to try the IT WORKS brand next time because from what I have seen on YouTube videos it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.</li>
    <li> I just got this and put it on; its easy to use, but it feels so hot and cold at the same time and smells a lot! Did anyone else feel that?&lt;br /&gt;Cant say anythung about results before end of month.. Fingers crossed</li>
    <li> I have used 3 out of the 5 wraps. I have yet to see a change in the tightness of my stomach area like the wraps say they will do, but... after one wrap my stretch marks were hardly visible abd after 2 wraps you could no longer see I had stretch marks from my pregnancy. So even though there hasn&#x27;t been a big change I give 4 stars for reducing the visibility of my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Love these! Recommend them to all my co workers and work out buddies! I love how these wraps make me feel and look at 47,I  just came back from FL and wore a Bikini and looked good! I recommend these  Ultimate Body Wrap Lipo Applicator Wraps!! as the finishing touch to your diet/exercise routine.</li>
    <li> These lipo wraps are extremely easy to use. I simply take it out of the package, apply it to the area of my stomach I want, wrap it with cling wrap and go about my day! The package also says that you can put it on and sleep with it but I like doing during the day. I have yet to have any sort of redness, swelling, or any kind of reaction from using them. They are helping me get rid of fat that I don&#x27;t want one day at a time! These are great to use if you have a photo shoot coming up fat that you need to lose weight quick for, my cousin uses them for a week before a shoot to make sure she has no extra body fat. They are also great because summer is basically here and with these hot days in the 80s and 90s I will be going to the beach and I want to look my best in my bikini and with the help of these body wraps I WILL look the best in my bikini! When you put them on you put the sticky side to your skin and it gives you a mental like feeling on the spot of your body that you are targeting that is how you know it is working. While using this product I always drink lots and lots of water. He&#x27;s absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I love these body wraps! Paid more than this for one visit to a salon that was offering this wrap service!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, just ask a friend for help with the Saran wrap!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product this is the 3rd time that I order This patch cause I notice my belly looks slimmer</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and I received the wraps in great condition. I wore the wrap overnight and noticed a big difference in my stomach area. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these wraps. I was invited to a wedding and had no clue how I&#x27;d make myself look and feel good about my appearance, that is until I tried this product. I wore the wrap for just about 24 hours, and used cellophane wrap over it. I was sure I drank about double my normal amount of water and was so excited to see about 7 inches gone from my big ole belly. This is a great product for anyone that needs to quickly shed some inches. I love the confidence I had after wearing this and will use again the next time I have to look my best. Just remember the results aren&#x27;t permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any result at all</li>
