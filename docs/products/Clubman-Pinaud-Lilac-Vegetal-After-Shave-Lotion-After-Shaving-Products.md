      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great on every guy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells very refreshing  and feels great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>almost as good as I remember it, did putting it in a plastic bottle change the fragrance?</li>
      <li>Great product, Men in my family have used it  for many years, I would not use anything else.</li>
      <li>Really nice.</li>
      <li>Smell upon application also depends upon one&#x27;s own body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to strong perfume and this after shave is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>great scent nice and fresh</li>
      <li>The formula has changed somewhat and it doesn&#x27;t have quite the delightful odor that the original had, but pretty darn nice post-shave face splash, and I always found that my wife (as well as others before her) enjoyed the fragrance of the Vegetal.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brut would have been a much better choice, and he doesn&#x27;t even wear that......</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not flowery or potent smelling.</li>
      <li>I have noticed however since it has beenpackaged in plastic bottles the scent has changed, and not for the better.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s used it for many years</li>
      <li>I lost track of it for many years.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>It has always been my favorite.</li>
      <li>I really love the company.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give it a better review...</li>
      <li>My favorite, always compliments from the ladies</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed the scent.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is wonderful, similar to an Emeraude I knew of many years ago.  </li>
      <li>This after shave is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>also let me add, my wife...sprayed her cotton candy perfume on me and said i smelt more manly with that on than the lilac vegetal...</li>
      <li>It honestly smells like a clean urinal at a bus station.</li>
      <li>Great old-timey scent, and the bottle&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;for professional use</li>
      <li>The scent was light and it really did a good job closing the pores.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong.</li>
      <li>smells as good as high school</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cloyingly sweet, and feminine like so many newer products.</li>
      <li>but one is the lowest available.</li>
      <li>And I really tried to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they make great products.lilac veg is carried by other companies to not just pinaud.</li>
      <li>Excellent, better than the overly expensive colognes.</li>
      <li>You get a great deal for a little price and that isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s an inferior product.</li>
      <li>Or they just can&#x27;t handle the sting on their freshly shaved pores.</li>
      <li>Smells like a fresh urinal cake.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light but refreshing and lasts quite a while (even sparks up in the shower the next day).  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort to return it for a refund.  </li>
      <li>while I can see how this is a very realistic description, for my money it is more of an \\&quot;old lady meets formaldehyde\\&quot; smell - overpoweringly floral while pungently clinical</li>
      <li>A hot towel applied afterwards.</li>
      <li>Very manly!</li>
      <li>i know in the wet shaving world this is a popular scent, but not in my world.</li>
      <li>He has tried many others but this is the only one that does the job and isn&#x27;t overly perfumed.</li>
      <li>The exact one we had been looking for.  </li>
      <li>Hot towels, shoe shine and manicure while you were in the chair, guy with a whisk broom to brush you off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Lilac Vegetal is a very polarizing scent - it is not the sort of thing anyone would ever be middle-of-the-road about.  </li>
      <li>Makes you want to buy a straight razor and a badger hair shaving brush.</li>
      <li>believe men really buy this stuff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For years I used Aqua Velva because of its light scent but have recently switched over to the Lilac Vegetal.</li>
      <li>Deposited straight to the circular file.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
      <li>A very floral smell.  </li>
      <li>With so many other scents available (including the original Clubman), it&#x27;s difficult to see why anyone would want to use this unless they have a special attachment to it.</li>
      <li>Pasqualle may no longer give you a haircut, but Lilac Vegetal will at least remind you of the good old days.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that your father probably used it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product since High school.</li>
      <li>For a real masculine, spicy, woodsy scent, try the Virgin Island Bay Rum cologne instead.</li>
      <li>I first became aware of Lilac Vegetal as a young man when my local barber used it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it took me back to the olden days because no barber in his right mind would splash this on a 12 year old.</li>
      <li>The first time I left it on for three hours before I had to shower.  </li>
      <li>Its unique aroma takes me back to my younger days.</li>
      <li>have read that John Wayne wore this, and friends who are old enough tell me there has been no reformulation through the years - as much as I wanted to like it, I just cannot figure out how this ever got invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That and the atmosphere of dust or mold,something &#x27;old&#x27; that made this feel like an abandoned building type of odor</li>
      <li>Gave it to my neighbor because my wife said I smelled like &amp;#34;A really old guy at a nursing home&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch............</li>
      <li>Remember those old time barber shops when you were a kid?  </li>
      <li>Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Clubman products are great but after having used many others in the past I was somewhat disappointed by this Lilac Vegetal aftershave.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully the smell isn&#x27;t very strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger long (at least for me).  </li>
      <li>The real downer, though, is that it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call masculine.  </li>
      <li>Your experience may be better, or worse...</li>
      <li>Very subtle yet intoxicating fragrance, women would love the smell of this on a man.  </li>

<li> after the second time, I just poured it down the drain.  </li>

<li> i put it on and waited a little while thinking maybe the scent would change, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Its not too heavy handed like some aftershaves can be.</li>
<li> (and this is just my own opinion), it is awful.</li>
<li> It seems like they are one of the last classic men&#x27;s grooming companies out there, but I feel like I got ripped off with this crap</li>
<li> Total disappointment.</li>
<li> Subtle.</li>
<li> Even the wife was not impressed by the aroma.  </li>
<li> Smells like baby powder used to cover the smell of a dirty diaper (doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
<li> This is bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really nice. Its not too heavy handed like some aftershaves can be.Plan to buy it again when needed.</li>
    <li> The scent is light but refreshing and lasts quite a while (even sparks up in the shower the next day).  You get a great deal for a little price and that isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s an inferior product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  However, the smell is truly horrible.  It smells awful in the bottle, and while it might change after it has been applied, it still smells disgusting.  I have tried it twice.  The first time I left it on for three hours before I had to shower.  The second time, I could only stand it for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> My grandfather, who started shaving around 1905, used to use this stuff, along with a scary looking straight razor and strop. On a whim, I purchased some and I&#x27;ve decided I like it quite a lot! Smells kinda like an old-fashioned barbershop, and of lilacs. The scent changes about 10 minutes after you put it on. Not for everyone- some folks says it smells like urine- or a nursing home- but I don&#x27;t get that at all. Great old-timey scent, and the bottle&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;for professional use only\\&quot;. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth at least trying as a Pinaud/Clubman product...some people aren&#x27;t affected by floral aftershaves.When I put this on I felt like I wandered into a abandoned funeral home and there was a bouquet of lilacs.But a cat got in the building and urinated on the flowers...nasty.That and the atmosphere of dust or mold,something &#x27;old&#x27; that made this feel like an abandoned building type of odor and I thought it was nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst smelling men&#x27;s after shave out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be too rude for me to express what it really reminds me of!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe men really buy this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brut would have been a much better choice, and he doesn&#x27;t even wear that......</li>
    <li> I have used this product since High school. I always like it. It&#x27;s not cloyingly sweet, and feminine like so many newer products. I have noticed however since it has beenpackaged in plastic bottles the scent has changed, and not for the better. It seems olier, and does not smell the same. I still use it. I do this the plastic has been detimental to the product.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> The Veg is not for everyone. The scent is strong. It is different, but the scent goes away. It is now in my after shave rotation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  For years I used Aqua Velva because of its light scent but have recently switched over to the Lilac Vegetal. This stuff smells very refreshing  and feels great on my skin.  Best of all is that my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent, better than the overly expensive colognes.</li>
    <li> I thought they stopped making Lilac After -shave. After trying this item, I still think they stopped making Clubman Pinaud Lilac After- shave!</li>
    <li> A very floral smell.  Lite and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The initial blast of urinal tablet hit me when I took a whiff. I splashed some on anyway. It mellowed out and I enjoyed the scent. I can&#x27;t say that it took me back to the olden days because no barber in his right mind would splash this on a 12 year old. But I can see how people would associate that powdery-vanillaish dry down with the olden days. With so many other scents available (including the original Clubman), it&#x27;s difficult to see why anyone would want to use this unless they have a special attachment to it.</li>
    <li> i like it. gets your face&#x27;s attention when you put it on. smells great!</li>
    <li> This after shave is my husband&#x27;s favorite. He has tried many others but this is the only one that does the job and isn&#x27;t overly perfumed. I am allergic to strong perfume and this after shave is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> My favorite, always compliments from the ladies</li>
    <li> Great old-school barber shop scent!  Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> The exact one we had been looking for.  Just like the barber use to use in my hometown barber shop.</li>
    <li> My husband could only find giant sizes of this brand. The 6 oz size is perfect for him. He&#x27;s used it for many years and I never get tired of the clean smell. It&#x27;s not flowery or potent smelling. Very manly!</li>
    <li> I saw this and remembered this in the barber shop as a kid.  Along with other Clubman aftershave.  The scent was light and it really did a good job closing the pores. Gave it to my neighbor because my wife said I smelled like &amp;#34;A really old guy at a nursing home&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch............</li>
    <li> I want to like this, I have gone through half of the bottle trying to like it. But every time I wear &amp;#34;the veg&amp;#34; my wife says I smell like urinal cake. I wonder how she knows what that smells like...</li>
    <li> Works well as an aftershave in that it cleans and tones your skin after shaving.  Smell is subjective, but it smells rather horrible to me.  Smells like a fresh urinal cake.  As it dries it goes from fresh urinal cake smell to dirty urinal cake smell.  Thankfully the smell isn&#x27;t very strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger long (at least for me).  Smell upon application also depends upon one&#x27;s own body chemistry.  Your experience may be better, or worse...</li>
    <li> now i know the description said a floral scent, but since it said a MASQUELIN  SCENT  i figured it probably had just a hint of a floral scent, NO...you smell like a bouquet of flowers. i put it on and waited a little while thinking maybe the scent would change, but it didn&#x27;t. i know in the wet shaving world this is a popular scent, but not in my world. in my world men do not put on cologne, aftershave, or etc. that smells like flowers. now if this review offends you i don&#x27;t apologize because this is america folks i can give my opinion without being executed or having a body part cut off and besides amazon asked ME for my review and so i gave it. also let me add, my wife...sprayed her cotton candy perfume on me and said i smelt more manly with that on than the lilac vegetal...that&#x27;s rough. i dumped it out in that front yard. this opinion does not reflect on pinaud whatsoever they make great products.lilac veg is carried by other companies to not just pinaud. let me make a suggestion, pinaud&#x27;s bay rum, now that is an awesome man scent.</li>
    <li> I use Clubman Gel, Shave Cream, Aftershave, Talc, probably others. I wanted to change up my aftershave and gave this a try. It honestly smells like a clean urinal at a bus station. I wish I could give it a better review... I really love the company. It seems like they are one of the last classic men&#x27;s grooming companies out there, but I feel like I got ripped off with this crap</li>
    <li> Clubman products are great but after having used many others in the past I was somewhat disappointed by this Lilac Vegetal aftershave.  The Lilac fragrance is there, but just barely, and it doesn&#x27;t particularly last long.  The real downer, though, is that it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call masculine.  Even the wife was not impressed by the aroma.  For a real masculine, spicy, woodsy scent, try the Virgin Island Bay Rum cologne instead.</li>
    <li> Total disappointment. Big fan of the other Pinaud aftershaves but this is absolutely awful. Smells like baby powder used to cover the smell of a dirty diaper (doesn&#x27;t work). Had to wash it off when I used it. Deposited straight to the circular file. Would rate it zero but one is the lowest available.</li>
    <li> smells as good as high school</li>
    <li> Remember those old time barber shops when you were a kid?  Hot towels, shoe shine and manicure while you were in the chair, guy with a whisk broom to brush you off.  Well, Pasqualle use Lilac Vegetal when you were through.  Pasqualle may no longer give you a haircut, but Lilac Vegetal will at least remind you of the good old days.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that your father probably used it.</li>
    <li> Tried it,  and I didn&#x27;t like it. My wife said it smells like a nursing home. I thought it had an overpowering floral/chemical odor, reminiscent of urinal cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Clubman products. But they definitely need to rethink this one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this for some time, I like the clubmen products, lilac is the best.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great on every guy.  I&#x27;ve heard horror stories over at Badger and Blade, but wanted to check it out.</li>
    <li> I discovered Lilac Vegetal in college 60 years ago.  The formula has changed somewhat and it doesn&#x27;t have quite the delightful odor that the original had, but pretty darn nice post-shave face splash, and I always found that my wife (as well as others before her) enjoyed the fragrance of the Vegetal.  Try it.</li>
    <li> Subtle. Floral. Stings on application. Makes you want to buy a straight razor and a badger hair shaving brush. A hot towel applied afterwards. Naysayers clearly cannot appreciate the subtle nuances of this product. Or they just can&#x27;t handle the sting on their freshly shaved pores.</li>
    <li> I like the Pinaud Clubman scent and the Bay Rum scent, so I thought I would give this a try.  This is bad.  I tried to like it...after the second time, I just poured it down the drain.  It wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort to return it for a refund.  What was I thinking to even order it?  I hate myself now...almost like how I feel about Lilac Vegetal.  I think I was sucked in by the cute little bottle and the nostalgic memories of old barber shops.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful, similar to an Emeraude I knew of many years ago.  Very subtle yet intoxicating fragrance, women would love the smell of this on a man.  I heard Donald Trump uses it...</li>
    <li> I first became aware of Lilac Vegetal as a young man when my local barber used it. It has always been my favorite. I lost track of it for many years. Now I&#x27;ve found it again. Its unique aroma takes me back to my younger days.</li>
    <li> Yup, it smells like a urinal cake.  Not for me or my wife.</li>
    <li> great scent nice and fresh</li>
    <li> almost as good as I remember it, did putting it in a plastic bottle change the fragrance?</li>
    <li> Oh my God.  Where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilac Vegetal is a very polarizing scent - it is not the sort of thing anyone would ever be middle-of-the-road about.  You either love it, or you hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it.  And I really tried to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll hear over and over again the comparison to a urinal cake - while I can see how this is a very realistic description, for my money it is more of an \\&quot;old lady meets formaldehyde\\&quot; smell - overpoweringly floral while pungently clinical/chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that John Wayne wore this, and friends who are old enough tell me there has been no reformulation through the years - as much as I wanted to like it, I just cannot figure out how this ever got invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me (and this is just my own opinion), it is awful.</li>
    <li> Great product, Men in my family have used it  for many years, I would not use anything else. Love it</li>
