    <li> As far as massage oils go, this one perhaps should rate as the number one best oil in the industry. There are no downsides to this oil.

I have been in the massage business for over thirty years, and have yet to find an oil the exceeds the quality of this one.</li>

    <li> I bought $250 worth of new sheets.  Used this product, and ALL of my sheets were stained.  I have been in the massage business since 1998 and have used coconut oil in the past with no problems.  I thought with the new sheets, why not get this oil.  Nope, big mistake.  I contacted Biotone and they would not accept the return after 2 emails with them.  Trying to deal with the people that sold it was difficult.  I will NEVER buy biotone again.  Back to Best of Nature for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m particularly happy with this purchase.
