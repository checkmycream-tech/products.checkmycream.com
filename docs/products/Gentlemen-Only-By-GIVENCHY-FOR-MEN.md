    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Givency.  This is one of the newer lines so I bought it to prove I&#x27;m not in a rut.  While it is a good product, I will return to the original Givency Gentleman.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so Good!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal! $30-$40 cheaper than Macy&#x27;s or any other retailer in my area! The samples you get in magazines never seem to smell the same as they do when you get to test it in person. After smelling a sample in one of my favorite magazines, I thought it smelled amazing; so I went down to Macy&#x27;s to check it out. I was VERY surprised when it smelled exactly like the sample.   Very sweet and elegant. Its lite but strong enough that a little will go a long. I get compliments all the time on this cologne.   You&#x27;ll definitely have my business for a while to come. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really~~~~ gooooooooood~~~~~</li>
