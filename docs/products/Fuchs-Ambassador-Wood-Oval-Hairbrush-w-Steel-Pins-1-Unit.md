      <li>I like the metal pins as they don&#x27;t seem to static</li>

      <li>I like this one better.</li>
      <li>I feel like it snags my hair just barely more than the body shop brush</li>
      <li>As most people on here, I had been looking for the replacement for the Body Shop brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more bushes as backups and recommend doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the brush.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>Plus, his confidence has increased with the playground cuties and they love how the brush hangs out his pocket when he&#x27;s talking with them.</li>
      <li>wife gave me two Body shop brushes for my birthday many many years ago (some gift I taught)</li>
      <li>I love this brush, doesn&#x27;t make hair static or &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>my favorite brush ever.</li>
      <li>but I love the way the steel pins feel on my scalp and in my hair.</li>
      <li>Pretty good brush.  </li>
      <li>I have full 5 star love for this</li>
      <li>First I still own a couple of Body shop hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband now uses this brush and it fine for his thinning hair.</li>
      <li>the best hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned - massages the scalp, doesn&#x27;t cause static and is big enough</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite as nice of a handle as my old brushes, but the pins don&#x27;t have the rubber tips on the end that always break off, so</li>
      <li>The metal tines are cool on the scalp, leave my hair silky and my scalp tingles after use.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of super thick hair, and it gets through it wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I liked the wooden handle and it was comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>They love the brush but only 4 star love I guess??</li>
      <li>They love the brush but only 4 star love I guess??</li>
      <li>so I wait like a loyal dog.</li>
      <li>the new ones as backups and never start enjoying them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more to keep as back-ups!</li>
      <li>He appreciates having his own, personal brush without having to share with the women in the house.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind that works well in my hair, so I was so relieved to find this style of brush is still being made by someone.</li>
      <li>The handle is very different but still manageable to be honest</li>
      <li>I had some older hair brushes with wooden handles and metal pins that I loved, but they were getting old and they aren&#x27;t made any more, so I had to do some research</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out like other brushes and feels good in my hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
      <li>I just wish Ambassador made a tiny version to fit in my purse!</li>
      <li>What is best about this brush is that the metal bristles are long and their round ends are part of the metal, not a separate material stuck on.</li>
      <li>The metal pins are rounded at the top and are connected to the wooden body of the brush by a rubber cushin bed.</li>
      <li>My daughters and I have thigh length hair (2 of us have straight hair, one has curly) and we found that the wooden pin brushes work much better for us.  </li>
      <li>It has a comfortable handle and the bristles are rounded on the ends so it is not a painful experience as some other brushes that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>Am very particular about brush combs with real wood paddle construction and metal, ball-tipped wires.</li>
      <li>While it is a well-made brush (hence the 3 stars), it tugged and pulled at our hair too much.  </li>
      <li>charge my hair as much as nylon brushes.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I liked it enough to definitely buy another.</li>
      <li>These are getting harder to find and are soooo much better than the plastic ones.</li>
      <li>If this is as good as the one from The Body Shop, well then I won&#x27;t be needing to purchase another one for at least 10 years.</li>
      <li>the most requestedddd item we discontinuedah\\&quot; The 13 year old on the customer service line told me the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t see much difference, but the differences in snagginess is just a little more evident.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, they are still making them years from now when we will need new ones!</li>
      <li>it turned out to be my favorite hair brush and soon tossed out my previous brushes away.</li>
      <li>and I planned on ordering more if it was the same or close enough.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I received this brush a few weeks ago and have been able to use it for a while.</li>
      <li>do I save my old brushes and never enjoy them and start using my new brush or do I save the new ones as backups and never start enjoying them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one is exactly as I wanted and I am going to buy another one as a back up!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s feels exactly the same as the discontinued brush from The Body Shop!</li>
      <li>It is not as soft as the old brush but the old brush is overly worn and does need to be replaced.  </li>
      <li>He has complained that their brushes look more like an old wig with a handle; than a hairbrush.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly, course hair and always look for products that soften my hair.</li>
      <li>it took me a while to get a hang of my old</li>
      <li>The 12 year old at the store tells me \\&quot;yah</li>
      <li>Soft.</li>
      <li>If you ever used the old brushes from bath and body , they dont make them anymore .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft but, but with the metal bristles, does the job.</li>
      <li>bristles are the same the spongy area where the bristles are attached is the exact same.</li>
      <li>But no other brush would do!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s feels exactly the same as the discontinued brush from The Body Shop! I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for this!!!</li>
    <li> I had some older hair brushes with wooden handles and metal pins that I loved, but they were getting old and they aren&#x27;t made any more, so I had to do some research and I finally found this brush. It doesn&#x27;t have quite as nice of a handle as my old brushes, but the pins don&#x27;t have the rubber tips on the end that always break off, so I think it&#x27;s going to last longer than my previous brushes. It&#x27;s the only kind that works well in my hair, so I was so relieved to find this style of brush is still being made by someone. I ordered six - some for me and some for my mom. Hopefully, they are still making them years from now when we will need new ones!</li>
    <li> Great brush - love that it&#x27;s made in Germany. Bought this to replace a similar Body Shop brush I had for 15 years and just recently lost - I like this one better.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my wife who only likes steel pin brushes. She loves it! One of the best she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Feels amazing on the scalp. I have a lot of super thick hair, and it gets through it wonderfully. I bought it to replace my wood-handled, German-made brush, which I had for 20 years. I&#x27;ve had this for about a year, and the quality seems great– hoping for 19 more.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush and the quality is superb.</li>
    <li> I received this brush a few weeks ago and have been able to use it for a while. I love this brush. I have natural curly, course hair and always look for products that soften my hair. The metal pins are rounded at the top and are connected to the wooden body of the brush by a rubber cushin bed. When you use the brush the bed cushions the pressure and doesn&#x27;t hurt when using heavier pressure. I like using this brush at night. The metal tines are cool on the scalp, leave my hair silky and my scalp tingles after use. I looked for a brush like this at Beauty shops in my city but couldn&#x27;t find any metal pin brushes. I have already recommended this brush to my friends and plan on ordering again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I&#x27;ve had terrible problems with static and hoped that the steel bristles and wooden handle might help matters.  I didn&#x27;t.  When it arrived it was missing pins as well.  I sent it back.  I liked the wooden handle and it was comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> As most people on here, I had been looking for the replacement for the Body Shop brush. this is the perfect replacement! I bought a Phillips one and it&#x27;s nothing like the Body Shop one. This one is exactly as I wanted and I am going to buy another one as a back up!</li>
    <li> Good quality! Nice brush!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my Body Shop brush that they stopped making. It is practically the same, but it does pull my hair every now and then.</li>
    <li> My mom was obsessed with her old (similar) Body Shop brush and refused to throw it out even when it only had two bristles hanging out of a nasty, decomposing plastic material. Nasty. But no other brush would do! Got her this one for Christmas...she loves it and finally threw the other, old Body Shop brush out.</li>
    <li> Good German-made brush and well worth the money. Am very particular about brush combs with real wood paddle construction and metal, ball-tipped wires. Solid, quality construction. These are getting harder to find and are soooo much better than the plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush.  I feel like it snags my hair just barely more than the body shop brush it&#x27;s replacing.  I compared the two, I don&#x27;t see much difference, but the differences in snagginess is just a little more evident.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Gets out tangles without pulling.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> He appreciates having his own, personal brush without having to share with the women in the house. He has complained that their brushes look more like an old wig with a handle; than a hairbrush. Plus, his confidence has increased with the playground cuties and they love how the brush hangs out his pocket when he&#x27;s talking with them. He&#x27;s mentioned how the honeys ask to borrow his brush when he&#x27;s on the basketball court, but he&#x27;s hip to their game and doesn&#x27;t give a FUCHs. They cry when he says &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. He&#x27;s a man now, and he&#x27;ll have to learn how to stand his ground.</li>
    <li> Really good hair brush--light, but sturdy and strong with a nice fit to the hand.</li>
    <li> Got it for mothers day, and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get another for her birthday.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I have medium length thick black hair and this works well I did not give it 5 stars because I cannot style with this brush but I love the way the steel pins feel on my scalp and in my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just right for me. Soft. Good grip. My doughtier loves it too.  I got 3 of them :)</li>
    <li> First I still own a couple of Body shop hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave me two Body shop brushes for my birthday many many years ago (some gift I taught) it turned out to be my favorite hair brush and soon tossed out my previous brushes away. I take it everywhere I travel and guard it like it was my last child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was devastated when I discovered that Body shop stop selling them. When I go to the Body shop with my wife I feel out of place I would go to sears but she hardly spends any time there so I wait like a loyal dog. The last time I went there I wanted a smaller version of my brush and discovered they no longer make the smaller brush but also the larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent the last few years looking on eBay and Amazon Craigslist and everywhere online looking for Backups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I type in steel pin brush on Google and the Fuchs popped up so I ordered one and I planned on ordering more if it was the same or close enough. I feel it no better or worse than the body shop, I would guess they are made from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say they are very much the same brush in doing the blind Pepsi Challenge. Only the handle is different so when you do the comparison you need someone else wheeling the brush. I&#x27;m ordering more bushes as backups and recommend doing the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Think The body shop just to put it in plain words stupid for not listening to their customers. The 12 year old at the store tells me \\&quot;yah it&#x27;s like the most requestedddd item we discontinuedah\\&quot; The 13 year old on the customer service line told me the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a similar brush this is it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are the same the spongy area where the bristles are attached is the exact same. The handle is very different but still manageable to be honest it took me a while to get a hang of my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the dilemma do I save my old brushes and never enjoy them and start using my new brush or do I save the new ones as backups and never start enjoying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time understanding the 4 star reviews. They love the brush but only 4 star love I guess?? I have full 5 star love for this item!!e the new ones as backups and never start enjoying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time understanding the 4 star reviews. They love the brush but only 4 star love I guess?? I have full 5 star love for this item!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, doesn&#x27;t make hair static or &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;.  Have an obsession with this style hairbrush, also doesn&#x27;t collect lint between closely aligned bristles. I like the pin bristles but one unfortunate side-effect from constant use with previous pin-bristle brushes is that the pins begin to slip into the rubber bed as it ages.  I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen with this brush!</li>
    <li> It is not as soft as the old brush but the old brush is overly worn and does need to be replaced.  Little pricey for and adult hair brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Reduces static and feels great on the scalp</li>
    <li> Just like previous reviewers, I was looking for a replacement brush for the one I purchased from The Body Shop...and I am quite happy with my purchase.  If this is as good as the one from The Body Shop, well then I won&#x27;t be needing to purchase another one for at least 10 years.</li>
    <li> What is best about this brush is that the metal bristles are long and their round ends are part of the metal, not a separate material stuck on. In my experience, the ends of bristles of the latter type come off. Because the bristles are long, they can comb through my long hair. The brush is good quality, a practical size, with a nice wood handle. It&#x27;s soft but, but with the metal bristles, does the job. Very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The best hairbrush for my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is a clone of the discontinued steel-pin brush from The Body Shop. It&#x27;s the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever used — and the *only* one I use. I just wish Ambassador made a tiny version to fit in my purse!</li>
    <li> Love this hair brush!  Won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> Love this brush ! If you ever used the old brushes from bath and body , they dont make them anymore . This brush will replace it !!!! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> While it is a well-made brush (hence the 3 stars), it tugged and pulled at our hair too much.  My daughters and I have thigh length hair (2 of us have straight hair, one has curly) and we found that the wooden pin brushes work much better for us.  My husband now uses this brush and it fine for his thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Had a similar brush from Greece and moving to the US, I was wondering if I was going to find the same one. Of course, he who seeks finds, so I am very happy to find this brush and pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this brush -- it&#x27;s light, beautiful, feels good on scalp, can be used as a massage brush. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used to use a wooden brush with steel pin bristles from the Body Shop, but they stopped carrying it. I looked all over for a brush to replace it and took a chance on this one. The brush is perfect. Well made and the perfect size. I will definitely order more to keep as back-ups!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for a hair brush to replace the one I have from body shop. I have finally found it. I love the brush. It&#x27;s the only brush that does not hurt when I brush out the tangles in my thick hair.  The brush is very good quality and inexpensive. I recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
    <li> One of the nicest brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I actually bought another as a back up, but have not needed it. It has a comfortable handle and the bristles are rounded on the ends so it is not a painful experience as some other brushes that I&#x27;ve owned. I like the metal pins as they don&#x27;t seem to static charge my hair as much as nylon brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - best on market. Very happy with this one!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a steel pin brush for awhile.  This one is a little smaller than the one I perviously had but I was very glad to find it.  Shipping was fast and I liked it enough to definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> the best hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned - massages the scalp, doesn&#x27;t cause static and is big enough</li>
    <li> I like it a lot- my favorite brush ever. It doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out like other brushes and feels good in my hand. I would have given it a 5 star but it lost a pin already.</li>
