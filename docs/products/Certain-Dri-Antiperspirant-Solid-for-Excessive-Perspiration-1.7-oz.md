      <li>is a very good product for people with a very sweaty armpits....</li>
      <li>Fresh product, works great</li>
      <li>Anyway, the roll-on seems the most effective but it makes my arm pits itch for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great not to be sweating but the reassurance of unstained shirts definitly isn&#x27;t worth my health.</li>
      <li>The first day was great.</li>
      <li>More that 2 strokes WILL result in caking.</li>
      <li>avon has some underarm antperspirant/deoderant that works better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing for me, and it&#x27;s mostly just tolerated by the others at the dojo.  </li>
      <li>The smell of it also is not my favorite, reminds me of baby powder.</li>
      <li>now my armpits don&#x27;t sweat any more not even when I do my work out.</li>
      <li>The stick is much better.</li>
      <li>I love to use this one for before bed, which it is meant for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  </li>
      <li>BUT be sure to use it every night.  </li>
      <li>My armpits are waxed and I am sure that helps.  </li>
      <li>More updates to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Stuff works ok, under arm pits at night...</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it</li>
      <li>Just Be Sure</li>
      <li>I find that when I was heavier, I did tend to sweat a lot more.</li>
      <li>I feel so much better about myself.  </li>
      <li>I am still wondering if it is a fluke, that the weather was more temperate.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe the roll ons work better?</li>
      <li>am just glad it wasn&#x27;t more.</li>
      <li>I still stand by that the roll-on works much better than the stick</li>
      <li>I still stand by that the roll-on works much better than the stick</li>
      <li>I think I will just try the roll on and see if that works any better.</li>
      <li>Very happy that I&#x27;ve found something that finally works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Certain Dri Solid has proven to be the perfect product for me.</li>
      <li>This is the best product out there in my opinion that actually stops underarm sweating.  </li>
      <li>It is an ok solution-but didn&#x27;t work 100% for me.  </li>
      <li>I simply love this product.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Certain dry does a great job keep my sweat to a minimum, and it smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>But it is significantly reduced!  </li>
      <li>Although there have been isolated and rare occasions in which it was ineffective in stopping perspiration (perhaps 5-6 times in 15 months), it still is highly effective, as it is easy to use, does not stain clothing, leaves no disagreeable residue, and is odorless.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month now, and I have noticed a significant difference:  </li>
      <li>If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>I found it made me smell more and more consistently.  </li>
      <li>Certain Dri roll-on was effective, as was Drysol, for which my dermatologist wrote a prescription.</li>
      <li>I still apply it every night but when I feel fully comfortable with it</li>
      <li>The solid also doesnt irritate or itch my under arms which is great.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing feeling to finally feel comfortable in your own clothing.</li>
      <li>The solid doesnt work as well as the liquid but is still a GREAT product.</li>
      <li>Also, I sometimes sweat at the office when I do light walking or talked to people during presentations, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In day to day life, I&#x27;m one of those who will begin to sweat while doing nothing in a warm room, or just getting ready in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It was totally bizarre.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>In the mornings after I shower, I used the AM Solid which does a great job of eliminating ordor.  </li>
      <li>I just started to used them item not even 2 weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
      <li>The roll-on has been far more effective than the stick</li>
      <li>It might be good for folks who are sensitive to the roll on one.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the solid version has been working great for me.</li>
      <li>This is a great product I&#x27;ve been using for a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formulation changed, but this stuff clumped and made a mess!  Even wearing it at night, it pilled and left residue.  Threw it out.</li>
    <li> Can leave white residue long after application. That may be normal, &amp; maybe I&#x27;m wrong for expecting clear application, no residue later.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the product, but I had no improvement from this product.  It is cheaper than buying the clinical strength secret, but no more effective than that for myself.  I will look in future for a stronger product.</li>
    <li> I tried both perscription Drysol and the Certain Dri roll on.  Both burned and itched so badly that I cried at night.  The itching that remained during the day was worse than the sweating it was helping to control.  (I use the product under my arms).  Then, I stumbled across this and some reviews saying that the solid worked for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.  I guess that&#x27;s me because this stuff is AMAZING!  It started working right away and I&#x27;ve had the same stick for months.  I use it every other night, just a couple swipes under each arm... seriously, I use so little I can&#x27;t believe it actually works.  I had been reapplying Secret Clinical multiple times a day and it didn&#x27;t come near what this stuff does.  I still wear a basic deo/anti during the day but basically never need to reapply and am only sweaty when a person should be - when working out or on really hot days.  It has literally changed my life.  I feel so much better about myself.  PLEASE TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this product at all. It might have helped a little more than over-the-counter products I&#x27;ve used (including the clinical strength products) but I couldn&#x27;t really tell. I switched to the solid because the roll-on was causing so much irritation. I finally had literally NO sweat marks on my shirts. But after using the solid, and sweating enough for it to show a good amount, I just decided to go back to the roll-on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I tried all of the so-called clinical deodorants in the store and none helped.  This is a great product.  I didn&#x27;t read the instructions when I first used it so I had a problem with irritation.  Once I read &amp; followed the instructions it worked perfectly.  I used it nightly for a few weeks then cut down useage to 2 to 3 nights a week.  I don&#x27;t need it as much in the winter but I definitely depend on it during summer months.  Don&#x27;t use too much &amp; be careful not to get it on you arms.  It will burn if you use after a shower or bath.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I am on day one and am extremely impressed. I put it on before bed last night and am completely dry today. I usually have pretty big wet marks by this time of the day which really sucks. Right now my shirt is completely dry. Literally like I just put it on. I hope it stays this way. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Like some others, I switched to this due to the irritation I would get sometimes from the roll-on. While this doesn&#x27;t have the irritation, it also didn&#x27;t work as well. I ended up sweating just like I would have with any other anti-perspirant. I&#x27;ve decided to switch back to the roll-on because even though I&#x27;d get the irritation from time to time, it also kept me dry.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff but unfortunately I don&#x27;t.  I had a number of problems with it.    First, it never stayed on well after I applied it.  Whether I used the recommended amount or less it always rolled up into little balls in my armpits while it dried which I&#x27;m sure prevents it from fufilling its intended purpose.  I would wake up with little crumbs of the product on my sheets (and myself) which was gross.  Again, this happened regardless of the quantity used.      I found it made me smell more and more consistently.  I woke up today (what I&#x27;ve determined is the last day of this product for me) and already smelled first thing in the morning.  I washed my armpits - it took multiple times - and already smelled again about ten minutes later.  I do not have an exceptionally huge problem with BO normally.  Yeah, I stink when I work out, nothing unusual there, but I shouldn&#x27;t smell this bad first thing in the day - AFTER WASHING - when I haven&#x27;t even exherted myself at all.  It was totally bizarre.  Considering I don&#x27;t seem to be sweating today - meaning the product is apparently working - it is really odd.    When I first started using this product I also noticed that I had some soreness in my armpits the next day.  I had worked out harder than usual the day before so I thought it was just muscle strain.  I&#x27;ve realized today, with the muscle soreness gone, that it had nothing to do with it and unfortunately recognize the symptoms as my lymph nodes beginning to swell.  I used the product as directed - never immediately after showering or shaving - so I know it is not because I am using the it incorrectly.  Whether this is a question of me being sensitive or something else entirely is hard to say but I find it distressing enough that I have decided to stop using Certain Dri completely.  It&#x27;s great not to be sweating but the reassurance of unstained shirts definitly isn&#x27;t worth my health.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help for me.  It performed just about as good as any over-the-counter antiperspirant.  The smell of it also is not my favorite, reminds me of baby powder.</li>
    <li> I started out using the roll on which is great but a little irritating to the skin. The stick is much better.</li>
    <li> Certain DRI roll on was a godsend.But it did burn at times.Burning would last anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes.After that,I could enjoy being dry and burn free for the rest of the day.And when I first started using it,it would last LITERALLY 3 days.After a month or so,I had to resort to using it everyday.Mind you,I didnt follow the directions to a tee.I,like most people shower in the morning and then apply deodorant/antiperspirant (certain dri).Do as it says and use it at night.You&#x27;ll be fine all next day.But back to the point.Due to the discomfort of burning(although not extremely bad,but enough discomfort to get on your nerves),I thought I would try the solid instead of the roll on.I read somewhere that if you had sensitive skin,it would be better for you.WRONG.Bought the solid,went to work and sweated the entire time.IT NEVER DRIED.3 hours into work,I excuse myself,grab my certain dri roll on,and headed to the restroom for a touch up.Thank god Im so finicky about things that I carry a bottle of certain dri roll on to work with me.Anyways Certain Dri roll on uses aluminum chloride which works,while the solid uses aluminum sesquichlorohydrate which does not.If your gonna buy this,you might as well buy a regular name brand,because it would probably dry better than this.Hope this helps you,certain dri roll on helped me.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me even after following the directions to a T. I would end up sweating just as much or more than usual the next day, and I applied every night. On the plus side, I did not experience any irritation like others have complained about. I think I will just try the roll on and see if that works any better.</li>
    <li> I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available. I tried Certain Dri Roll-On, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me. If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable (basically couldn&#x27;t fall asleep cause my pits itched too much). So I gave up on Certain Dri Roll-On and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri Roll-On, BUT in combination with the Certain Dri Solid. Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri Roll-On, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri Solid anti-perspirant. With only 2-4 strokes of the Roll-On it&#x27;s not as itchy, and even if it is a bit, I find the Certain Dri Solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits are FINALLY dry (85-90% reduced or more) after having tried at least 10 other anti-perspirant options (including prescription ones) with no success. This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me. Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
    <li> When regular deotorant stopped working for me I started using Certain Dri. I was using roll on version originally, which worked great, but it was giving me a rash and burning/itching really bad. (I suppose I have sensitive skin). So I decided to try the solid. Man was that an embarrassing discovery. Solid does not work for me at all. I switched back to roll on, but now use it only every 3-4 days before bed and throw on regular deotorant in the morning. (I use an Old Spice solid) Tip: Make sure your pits are completely dry before applying Certain dri at bedtime. And litterally apply right before you lay down. Also I try to let the certain dri dry out a bit before going to bed. Leaving my pits moist from the roll on would irritate my skin. And of course DO NOT SHAVE before applying roll on. Shave in the morning, then apply regular deotorant.</li>
    <li> the only anti-perspirant i use and have used for so many years i&#x27;ve forgotten when first purchased this.  i use this mainly on my feet as it protects from perspiration for 72 hours.  if you have sweaty feet (mine usually sweat at night and become uncomfortable) i highly recommend using this every three days.  unlike other advertised foot deodorant products, this one lasts and doesn&#x27;t become ineffective after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product from the local Walgreens and found that it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used the product as directed for a month and I still suffered with the embarrassing armpit ordor. I used the product before going to bed as the product instructs. In the morning I woke up with ordor and felt my armpits where more wet than when not applying the product at all. I&#x27;ll keep trying other products until I find something that works for my condition.   I believe that each individual is different, with that said, you should give it a shot. It might work for you. The company allows customers to return the product if you are dissatisfied. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok&lt;br /&gt;Armpits still sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much as before but still noticeable.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Certain Dry roll on but that really itched.  This works better than any other \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; anti perspirant for me and I highly recommend it.  No irritation and great control of wetness. I try to remember to use it everynight, but don&#x27;t always.  Still it is a significant improvement over anything else.</li>
    <li> Ugh.. I hate being such a sweat hog.  I have tried the Certain Dri in liquid form, but it burns my arm pits and I simply can&#x27;t use it.  I had read that the solid is better for sensitive skin, so I ordered it online..  It is fantastic.  I use it diligently every evening, and in the morning, after I shower, I use another Clinical strength deoderant (such as the one by Dove or Secret.)  At last, I can enjoy dry arm pits and stain-free shirts.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  BUT be sure to use it every night.  If I skip a couple nights (or three..), I am back to the sweat stains.  I will definitely order more online, and an extra as a present for my \\&quot;sweat hog\\&quot; friend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me....</li>
    <li> This is a great product I&#x27;ve been using for a long time. I love to use this one for before bed, which it is meant for and I buy the Certain Dri AM for daytime use. I love the AM one as it has a great subtle smell and goes on smooth and clear. I have hyperhydrosis and therefore sweat much more than the average person. Although I&#x27;d say Mitchum Antiperspirant is just as good. I just prefer Certain Dri because of the AM formula and how well they go together. Antiperspirant is always best put on at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Too small!  It ought to be at least twice this big. Try it and you will be convinced, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there in my opinion that actually stops underarm sweating.  I use if 2 nights a week on clean and very dry underarms.  In the mornings after I shower, I used the AM Solid which does a great job of eliminating ordor.  I prefer the solid versus the roll-on.  I have sensitive skin and the roll-on is a little too intense and if I perspire just a tiny bit, I tend to get itchy.  This does not occur with the PM Solid.</li>
    <li> It itches at first but it&#x27;s definitely helped my sweating during working out and just general hotness in the day.</li>
    <li> For some odd reason, my pits over sweat!  Especially when I am at all nervous or stressed.  If I use this product 3 nights in a row, almost all sweating is gone-but not all.  I still get small wet patches on my shirts.  But it is significantly reduced!  It is an ok solution-but didn&#x27;t work 100% for me.  But it did make the wet circles much smaller even when my inlaws were here!</li>
    <li> I am a physically active, middle-aged guy with profuse underarm perspiration issues. After months of experimentation with either ineffective or irritating products, I started using Certain Dri Solid over a year ago and have been delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I easily tried over 20 other products to combat my perspiration. Certain Dri roll-on was effective, as was Drysol, for which my dermatologist wrote a prescription. However, both of these products drove me to distraction with itching and burning: the inflammation was too high a price to pay for dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree Clinical Protection did a reasonably good job of combatting perspiration. Yet, it left an uncomfortable residue and did not keep me dry 100% of the time. Moreover, I really disliked the product scent offerings: I prefer odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri Solid has proven to be the perfect product for me. Although there have been isolated and rare occasions in which it was ineffective in stopping perspiration (perhaps 5-6 times in 15 months), it still is highly effective, as it is easy to use, does not stain clothing, leaves no disagreeable residue, and is odorless. My only qualification is that I have found that I must be very disciplined about using it as directed. Also, although effectiveness lasts beyond 24 hours, I have not experienced it lasting even close to the 72 hours claimed. Bottom line: I put it on every night and am delighted to do so, as it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Reliable protection from perspiration&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;Not scented&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain clothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Must be punctilious about using as directed (but be prepared to use every night, if necessary)</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m from the Caribbean where it&#x27;s very hot. This did not work for me. Wasted my time and money.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week straight it did not work for me. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> In sports, at the dojo, I am known as the guy who sweats buckets.  I&#x27;ll be sweating before any movement begins, and I frequently drip sweat onto the mat during the warm up (particularly during stretching).  It&#x27;s embarrassing for me, and it&#x27;s mostly just tolerated by the others at the dojo.  In fact, as a courtesy to those who I train with, I change my gi top mid way through the class because the top will get so soaked with sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nasty?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In day to day life, I&#x27;m one of those who will begin to sweat while doing nothing in a warm room, or just getting ready in the morning.  As many of you know, it&#x27;s a very uncomfortable experience.  I am usually the only one in the room who is wiping sweat from my forehead, which means that sweat typically gets onto the collar of my shirt, which leads to that oh so fun visible wetness around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to sports, Certain Dri mostly reduces the severity.  If I put it on before bed (as directed) then the amount of sweat that soaks into my karate uniform during training the next day is noticeably reduced.  I can still see the wet spots on the front of the gi, which is a bit worse than what others usually have, but it&#x27;s reduced enough that I don&#x27;t always need to change my top half-way through training.  At least that&#x27;s an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day to day life is made easier as well.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my shirts generally stay dry as I&#x27;m going about my normal daily business, or at least the outer shirt doesn&#x27;t show the sweat.  Of course my body still feels uncomfortable in the heat, but there&#x27;s probably nothing that I can do about that short of moving to the Arctic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is useful for the chest, neck, shoulders, and upper back areas in addition to the under arms, assuming that it&#x27;s applied after a shower at night (and your body has dried off).  If applying to the chest and other areas, do not lay down shorty after applying because it requires a good 30 minutes or so in order to not rub off onto your shirt or sheets.  It is NOT useful when applied to the forehead (can&#x27;t blame me for testing it, right?).  It actually worsens the situation for me when applied to the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any stains caused by Certain Dri, so long as I give it time to \\&quot;soak in\\&quot; before I lay down.</li>
    <li> Errr... what is this one supposed to do? Right... keep your armpit sweat at bay? Meh, sorry, did not work at all. Regular drugstore antiperspirants work much better than this one. Sorry, but really does not work...</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - keeps you absolutely dry!</li>
    <li> My armpit won&#x27;t sweat.  It really works.  The only thing is, it burns my armpit so badly.  I am using the roll on so probably i will  probably switch to solid.</li>
    <li> This really works. Get the solid instead of the roll-on. The solid doesn&#x27;t burn as bad.</li>
    <li> After moving from a relatively cool state to a hot and muggy one, I started sweating through my clothes every day.  I switched to Certain Dri roll-on about a year and a half ago, and it almost immediately solved the problem.  However, I have pretty sensitive skin (periodic eczema flair-ups), and the roll-on made me itch like crazy every night I put it on.  I would actually wake myself up scratching.  Last week, I bought the solid.  Problem solved!  The solid doesn&#x27;t itch at all.  It does have a pretty strong talc smell when you first put it on, but it&#x27;s gone by the morning.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up once summer gets here, but so far, I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
    <li> Had issues with rash with some deodorants. Still having issues with this one. But using before bed it seems to last, prevents smell but still had rash issue and burning. But then I seem pretty sensitive.</li>
    <li> While this product may be somewhat effective- it is so flaky! Next time I will purchase the gel formula (roll on) because it literally gets everywhere!</li>
    <li> I bought this product four years ago the first time. I&#x27;m very happy I did....is a very good product for people with a very sweaty armpits....now my armpits don&#x27;t sweat any more not even when I do my work out.</li>
    <li> I actually use this on my feet. I know, i know, the package says to only use it on your underarms, but they actually include a little blurb in the pamphlet about some military doctor who praises this product&#x27;s effectiveness for preventing blisters on your feet by eliminating sweat. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 80% effective for me at reducing sweat. I have to be consistent with it to really see a difference. I put it on at night before I go to bed and then again in the morning if I&#x27;m going to wear my patent leather heels or another type of shoe that doesn&#x27;t breathe well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand wearing those little socks that supposedly won&#x27;t show when you wear flats. They ALWAYS show. So this is my solution, and so far it&#x27;s worked!</li>
    <li> Fresh product, works great</li>
    <li> came on Sunday, could of waited till Monday</li>
    <li> When used as directed, it really works well. And, the solid doesn&#x27;t cause the rash that the roll-on did.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product 3 days ago. The first day was great. I put it on the 2nd night and it worked ok. I will keep using it bc its supposed to shrink your sweat cells.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help make you not smell bad</li>
    <li> I am taking a medication that causes excessive sweat. Clinical strength OTC antiperspirants stopped working, Certain Dri was no better. I will try the roll on version - I hope it works.</li>
    <li> Is the roll-on really like water and no scent? I just got mine today and as soon as I opened it, it spilled like water. Is that really it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure but the one I received is kind of crumbly when I use it</li>
    <li> this is hte best antiperspirant on the market ever, i use it all the time.  I would strongly recommend. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Women glisten, Men perspire, and Horses sweat - then there is me - a category all on my own!  I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; - a size 6 - and gush - when exercising, you can see the water bubbling up to the surface all over (friends are amazed, and say they have never seen anything like it), and when not exercising, I still perspire terribly whether it is warm or cold.  So maybe it was too much of a challenge for this product.  When I got the box, it did say it was the roll on that compared to prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I did find an amazing solution.  I cannot believe it - it is sweat block, but I got it a Walmart - cheaper than on-line.  Less than $7.00 for 5 weeks (1 per week, so for me of course, 2 per week)  I am still wondering if it is a fluke, that the weather was more temperate. But am amazed so far.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe each person&#x27;s body reacts differently - so maybe this will work for you - but me, I almost wondered if I perspired more - it would be hard to tell.</li>
    <li> Works like nothing else.  Best deodorant ever!</li>
    <li> I used to sweat profusely! I had embarrassing armpit stains and was horrified on a daily basis. This stuff changed my life! I highly recommend it. If you have sensitive skin go with the solid as the roll on stings!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a solution to stop excessive sweating during the day by using this at night. So at night it really dried me out which was completely unnecessary. During the day however, the sweating was unchanged. What a waste. I did however switch to mitchum and that is a tremendous difference to my normal antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
    <li> I just purchased certain dri.  I am very pleased with this product. I am a female age 49 and for whatever reason, I think my excessive perspiration is related to some hormonal issues (peri-menopausal) but I have tried other forms of antiperspirant which claim to be clinical strength and I was still having the issue of excessive perspiration. I would apply at night after showering and again in the morning and within one hour of application I would experience the excessive perspiration. Using Certain Dri as directed I have noticed a significant difference in that I am DRY all day.  I simply love this product.  I can say that the solid they claim goes on clear, it did not for me I seen some white residue,not a problem in the winter months; however, I think that once summer returns and sleeveless tops are back I will switch to the roll on and I do use both the pm antiperspirant and the am deodorant.  Great product for me. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve used the roll-on for a long time, but it burns my skin.  So, I decided to switch to the solid instead.  Unfortunately, the solid does not work as well.  It seems more comparable to other deoderants on the market; whereas, the roll-on is strong and powerful and keeps me completely dry. I am switching back to the roll-on asap... just wish it didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I know the general consensus seems to be that the roll-on version of Certain Dri is better, but those of us with sensitive skin that is prone to irritation can&#x27;t really rely on such an option. Luckily, the solid version has been working great for me. I get absolutely no irritation or any unpleasant side effects really. The solid DOES work as well as the roll-on, but it depends on the person and it takes a while longer before your excess perspiration gets under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this stuff I used the higher end of the suggested number of swipes: 6. And even then, I noticed only a slight change for the better for the next few days. However, after about a week there was a drastic change and at about 2 weeks of nightly use, I am totally dry under my arms - all day, every day, under all circumstances. I&#x27;ve dropped down to only 4 swipes per arm, but still every night and I no longer have to worry about feeling uncomfortable with excess perspiration. I also use an additional anti-perspirant/deodorant (Old Spice Sweat Defense) in the morning after showering and the combined effect of the two keeps my underarms dry and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d say definitely give Certain Dri Solid a trial run if you have sensitive skin or have had to stop using the roll-on version - and stick with it for at least 2-3 weeks before deciding it doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*4/8/12 UPDATE*: Well after using this product for so long I must say it has held up quite well. I now do 4 swipes per underarm each night because I find that that controls my perspiration the best. This product really is a savior for those of us with excessive underarm sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*8/27/12 UPDATE*: Roughly 4 months since my last update and Certain Dri solid stick has betrayed me. After working quite well for roughly 5-6 months, its effectiveness against my excess sweating has worn off and it has gotten to the point that I may as well not even put it on anymore. For this reason, I&#x27;ve docked 1 star from my previous rating. The solid may still work well for people who have a much less severe issue with excessive perspiration. I&#x27;ve done what most people seem to suggest and went and purchased the roll-on version despite my hesitation due to my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m happy to report: so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the roll-on for 2 nights but I&#x27;m noticing it&#x27;s already working much better than the solid ever did. If you have similar hesitations about trying the roll-on like me, I can&#x27;t stress this more: READ THE DIRECTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM CAREFULLY. So many people who have written about irritation and rashes fail to follow the directions and apply the roll-on after bathing or shaving their armpits, which will sting like a hornets&#x27; nest under your arm. My current regimen is to put on Certain Dri roll-on at bedtime (as instructed) and regular Old Spice deodorant (not antiperspirant, so as to save my white shirts from yellow aluminum stains) in the morning after showering. I only hope that the roll-on holds up for the long run. More updates to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*9/21/12 UPDATE*: Well after almost a month of using Certain Dri Roll-On I must say I&#x27;m very happy with the results. The roll-on has been far more effective than the stick and I&#x27;ve experienced none of the negative side effects some people have. I hardly sweat anymore, even when working out at the gym. It took about a week and a half to two weeks before I saw a dramatic reduction in my under arm perspiration. I still apply it every night but when I feel fully comfortable with it I might experiment with every other night, etc. I wrote an in-depth review of the roll-on and it is posted under that product page. Very happy that I&#x27;ve found something that finally works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*7/3/14 UPDATE*: Not sure if anyone cares anymore, but I figured I&#x27;d update and say that I have stopped using both the stick and the roll-on for sometime. I still stand by that the roll-on works much better than the stick but somehow my body chemistry changed and I don&#x27;t have the sweating issue I had at the time of writing this review. I still highly recommend the product for people who do excessively sweat - it&#x27;s a life-saver. On the other hand, I&#x27;d caution long-term use of this product as the aluminum present may have potentially dangerous consequences. The aluminum will also paint your white shirts with yellow stains in the underarm region; I&#x27;ve had to dispose of quite a few because of this. Fin.nd the roll-on for sometime.

    <li> UPDATE: 6 WEEKS LATER  At first I was not happy with the Certain-Dri solid due to the baby powder smell and white residue, all of this has changed, please read on:  I have since learned after sticking with the solid rather than going back to the irritating roll on that this stuff is every bit as good as it&#x27;s promised to be.  I still think it smells awful, but this no longer matters, here is why:  apply at bedtime; in my case a couple of hours before, as I take a shower as soon as I get home from work (active job), after getting up early in the morning to work out I take a quick shower to wash off the sweat.  This is when I learned that you can wash this stuff off COMPLETELY and it STILL WORKS!!!  I have since been doing this and then applying a non-antiperspirant body spray or small amount of cologne to control odor and the results have been stellar!  Since it can be washed off completely after wearing all night I have found that the smell and residue are no longer an issue and I could not be happier!  I hope they make this stuff for the rest of my life because there is no going back for me now!  I am also pleased that there is absolutely NO IRRITATION with the solid as opposed to the roll-on which I found BURNS LIKE HELL!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not do what expected. A total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I am just glad it wasn&#x27;t more. Now</li>
    <li> I typically get the roll on, which causes really wicked irritation.  This solid does not cause me any  irritation but it is not as effective at stopping perspiration as the roll on.  Good product but not perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great but itches like crazy</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product as my current &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; OTC product is really irritating.  However I was a little nervous at how my body would react to this product after reading some of the reviews here, so I started using it gradually (one swipe each arm for the first day, two swipes for the next, etc.), and experienced no burning or itching or irritation at all.  I&#x27;m able to use it every other day now.  I was really happy to wake up to no sticky white residue and clean, dry underarms all day long.  You should expect that some of the sweat that your body was producing will move to another part of your body.  From the reviews, where the sweat moves to seems to be different from person to person.</li>
    <li> Bought this because regular deodorant fell short half way thru the day. This works! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s. Tried it for a week. Crap doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy. 35 year male here. Not a lazy couch potatoe. I say again. Don not buy. Save your $8</li>
    <li> I have to say this item is very good, it definitely does justice to those heavy on sweating I just started to use it along with the A.M. version both together and may I say great combo. I sweat much less than I used to, plus have this on mind I just started to used them item not even 2 weeks ago and so far so good.</li>
    <li> like it a lot but this container mightve been defective as the solid fell out and can&#x27;t use the rest of it (1/2 left!!)</li>
    <li> A different concept. You wear it to bed at night and no deodorant during the day. I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it but, it works well. There&#x27;s a touch of stickiness but, I never had any sting. BIG plus for NO animal testing.</li>
    <li> It really works! 150%</li>
    <li> This IS the Only Deoderant that works for me . I can put it on in the morning. &amp; I am good all day.</li>
    <li> This product came on time but I thought it would help my excessive perspiration but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different kinds of strong antiperspirants, including Maxim and the roll-on version of Certain Dri. Despite following the instructions, I always struggled with irritation and itchiness. It was kind of a vicious cycle - apply antiperspirant, armpits are unhappy, skip applying it until the irritation went away, and by then I&#x27;d be sweaty gross mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Certain Dri solid. My armpits are never irritated or itchy, even after applying this right after shaving. I can use it every night, which keeps the sweat/stink under control 100%. I also really like that it applies like normal deodorant - with the roll-on I always had to keep my arms up like Frankenstein for a while to let it dry. I know several reviewers think that the solid isn&#x27;t as effective as the roll-on, but for me it is, probably because I can apply it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do supplement sometimes with the Certain Dri AM refresher when I know I&#x27;ll be doing something sweat-intensive, but on normal days, my nightly application keeps me sweat and stink free (and I&#x27;m the total weirdo who sniffs my shirts at the end of the day, just to make sure).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t deliver on its promises</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I can only find the roll on in stores.  I wanted to give the solid a try because my skin is very sensitive and the roll on was giving me some major under the arms issues.  I have zero complaints... It works just as good as the roll on without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin couldn&#x27;t handle the Certain Dri wet formula.  Even if I waited several hours after shaving, it burned so bad I had to wash it off.  The only way I could handle it was to skip shaving my pits for a day, and who wants to do that?  I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  My skin can handle it just a few hours after shaving, which is good because I like to take evening showers, and you have to apply this right before bed.  It works well.  I apply my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant the next morning.  It&#x27;s really cut down on my anxious sweating.</li>
    <li> i tried secret and doves clinical strength w/minimal results. so i thought i&#x27;d try this stuff in hopes of it helping my excessive prespiration problem. i broke out in a rash all over my upper body. and when i put it on my underarms burned and itched excessively. it was all i could do to not scratch my underarms to a fairly well. i lost sleep over this product b/c of the burning and horrible itching. the product did not even keep me dry either. i tried it for 2 weeks too. no change except a nice rash. do not waste your money. avon has some underarm antperspirant/deoderant that works better. try that before using this stuff. certaindri is alcohol in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a couple of years since I saw the good reviews about it on a You Tube video. Not sure how I found it on U Tube but I did. Anyway, the roll-on seems the most effective but it makes my arm pits itch for a couple of days. This is why I turned to the less irritating but still effective solid. I also use the Certain Dri a.m. as a matter of habit. I have very little problems with unsightly underarm wetness. Now if only they made a roll-on to get rid of pizza dough arms!</li>
    <li> I bought the solid stick after having great success with the roll-on.  I switched from the roll-on because it was giving me a rash every now and then and I wanted to see if the stick would be gentler.  The stick does work, but not as well as the roll on.  I&#x27;m going back to the roll on.  it was worth a try....also, the stick doesn&#x27;t last as long as the roll on.  The stick lasted about a month, whereas the roll on about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. I switched to men&#x27;s deodorant (Right Guard 72hr Defense) instead.</li>
    <li> Certain dry does a great job keep my sweat to a minimum, and it smell wonderful. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having such a hard time finding an antiperspirant.  One that keeps me dry, one that keeps me smelling good and one that is unscented so that I don&#x27;t get a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;I had such high hopes for this because a few people I know use Certain dry and they love it.  Unfortunately, it was not for me.  I still sweat bad and I still smell like a boiled onion on hot days.  I hate it.  :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; products on the market that you apply before bedtime.  The instructions always say that they will take a few days to start working full-tilt.  Well, none of them ever worked for me, and the only \\&quot;regular\\&quot; anti-perspirant that ever worked for me was Sure Original Solid.  However, the consistency of Sure has changed to a very creamy product that does not stay on me.  That&#x27;s why I tried this...I had no other choices left.  I&#x27;m VERY PLEASED with Certain-Dry.  I initially felt like it was a litte expensive, but it&#x27;s actually cheaper than other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; brands.  It&#x27;s also cheaper because it&#x27;s VERY solid and dense, which means you use less product (and therefore it lasts longer). I do have to use the A.M. product in conjunction with this P.M. product...I guess it has something to do with my body chemistry.  I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month now, and I have noticed a significant difference:  I simply don&#x27;t sweat under my arms AT ALL any more, as long as I remember to use both products (sometimes I forget the night-time one).  I would recommend this product to anyone who is constantly being \\&quot;let down\\&quot; by their anti-perspirant or to anyone who just wants to save money.</li>
    <li> Note that this is antiperspirant only - not deodorant. Didn&#x27;t keep me dry.  Sticking with Dove Clinical Strength.</li>
    <li> been trying certain dri anti perspirant for over a week now and my armpits are still soaking in sweats!  waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Once I could no longer find this product at the grocery store or any of the Tar-Marts, I looked it up on Amazon.  It works great for me when applied in the AM, or the night before.  Get the roll on for night before application for best protection.</li>
    <li> I used to sweat a lot; so much that I brought an extra shirt to work everyday.  It didn&#x27;t really matter how hot it was either.  I tried lots of different antiperspirants; none of them made much difference.  Until I found Certain Dri, now it&#x27;s not a problem anymore!  The strange thing about Certain Dri is you put it on before bed, not in the morning, so if you like to shower at night you should consider changing to morning showers so you can use this incredible product.  If you aren&#x27;t willing to change when you shower, then you don&#x27;t really have a problem.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my skin like the roll on kind. Keeps me dry for a few days after using it once.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference between Certain-Dri and something I could pick up at a drug store. Did make my shirts more yellow due to increased aluminium content.</li>
    <li> The solid stick is not as effective as the roll-on, but I had absolutely NO itching or irritation after applying 6 strokes to each underarm. This is compared to INTENSE burning and itching when I applied the roll-on. I could barely fall asleep because of the itchiness of my pits! I&#x27;d rather sacrifice a little wetness for being comfortable!</li>
    <li> Other strong products are so itchy. Sometimes I&#x27;d rather not use them because I dread the itch. This one works without the itch! Keeps me dry all day (I work out) even up to 2 days.</li>
    <li> There are very few products that I can honestly say have changed my life.  This is one of them  I&#x27;m kind of sad that I&#x27;m in my thirties and just recently found out about this - I really would have benefited from it in my younger years.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s super awkward to shout from the rooftops since you are basically admitting to a perspiration problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially tried the roll-on, which worked fine, but made my underarms itch constantly.  Given the trade-off between constantly pitting out my shirts and having some discomfort I would take the latter, but thankfully this solid form of the product exists.  I still do have some itching, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad.</li>
    <li> Works great, but you only need a little. More that 2 strokes WILL result in caking. I like the AM Certain Dri a little better, but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well. In other words, Certain Dri &#x3D; 10/10 while Certain Dri AM &#x3D; 9.9/10 and has NO caking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super active during the work day, but I do move around a bit; enough to get the occasional sweaty pits especially on warm days.  If I use this the night before as instructed there is literally zero sweat the next day.  I don&#x27;t use it every day as it can&#x27;t be natural to completely stop sweating, but it does work as described.</li>
    <li> Would 100% recommend to use this product, it actually work. I&#x27;m very happy with it and never let myself run out.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of weight and gained a bit of it due to an injury that has prevented me from exercising. I find that when I was heavier, I did tend to sweat a lot more. Also, I sometimes sweat at the office when I do light walking or talked to people during presentations, etc. I don&#x27;t think I particularly have hyperhidrosis, but it was definitely horrible to see sweat stains on my shirts and then to have them ruined. I tried many different deodorants/antiperspirants including dove, secret, and degree clinical strength. None of these helped. I tried this the first time fearing for my armpits as I&#x27;ve heard horrible stories about how it can burn and make you feel itchy. Luckily for me, the first night that I used it, it did not itch or burn at all. The next day, I noticed I was very dry throughout the day. At some points in the afternoon, I did feel slightly wet. I checked my armpits expecting sweat stains on my shirts, but there were none. If anything, I found a very tiny sweat mark...barely noticeable. This gave me hope that if I continue treatment, it will eventually work 100% not 98%. I highly recommend it. It might be good for folks who are sensitive to the roll on one. I still recommend you use some type of deodorant/antiperspirant in the morning to feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited/Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect wore off after 1 month. I recommend the roll on. I haven&#x27;t had bad reaction to it. The only time it felt itchy was when I over applied. I&#x27;ve been using the roll on for 2 months, and it has worked great. I even use it every 3 days or 2 depending on the temperature.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the bottle I got, but this stuff is unwearable. When it dries, it smells like elephant urine. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old active female and for the first time since I can remember I can wear anything and feel confident that I will not sweat.  I use A.M. only in the morning and Certain DRI Solid at night as directed.  I wait until my arm pits are extremely dry, about 30 secs and then apply it.  My armpits are waxed and I am sure that helps.  Trust me, you can feel it if it does not go on right.  I do not feel any discomfort but there is a little stinging, it does go away 5 secs afterwards, very tolerable.  I am extremely happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone who excessively sweats.  It is an amazing feeling to finally feel comfortable in your own clothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year now and it is absolutely amazing. I no longer sweat through my shirts and feel uncomfortable. The first few applications would sting but that no longer happens. I used certain dri at night around two to three times a week after a shower. Changed my life, amazing stuff.  The only negative is I can find it for half the price at Wally world.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant on the market - I&#x27;ve tried them all! The Certain Dri roll on can sting a bit when used after shaving - the solid does not and still works as well.</li>
    <li> i recommend this for people that have a hard time with other anti-perspirants working.  worked right from the first day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Certain Dri for years because I sweat like a pig. I tried the solid version of the product and it doesn&#x27;t work at all! Total garbage.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant on the market - I&#x27;ve tried them all!  The Certain Dri roll on can sting a bit when used after shaving - the solid does not and still works as well.</li>
    <li> Actually i bought the roll on certain dri and it really works, but my skin is so sensitive that i decided to switch for the solid one.</li>
    <li> I was using this with certain dri AM refresher and it has not worked at all, I have since switched back to my store bought Anti-perspirant and it works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the roll ons work better?</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this for two days and it has already cut down my sweating about 50%. I have bad hyperhydrosis, so i bought this one and the liquid roll on certain dry. I found that the roll on works better and faster, but makes my armits very irritated ans itchy. The solid doesnt work as well as the liquid but is still a GREAT product. The solid also doesnt irritate or itch my under arms which is great. All in all, a great product!</li>
    <li> I taught it will work but it didn&#x27;t work for my daughter. She gave it a try but wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. Did nothing to stop the sweating. The roll on is the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> Hate buying a product that promises so much and does not deliver,  My son tried it and it was hopeless - he put in on in the morning and by lunchtime he was sweating just standing around.  Needs to come off the market if it does not work!</li>
    <li> This product is frequently recommended by dermatologists, but almost impossible to find in a retail store.  It has a higher concentration of antiperspirant than any other non-prescription deodorant product.  But, it&#x27;s hard to roll on, as the solid is, well, very solid. It works really well, though, as evidenced by its power to work for a full day and a pretty dry armpit in the shower when trying to rinse it off!!</li>
    <li> I wish it worked perfectly but some days it doesn&#x27;t. I do have a very stressful job so that doesn&#x27;t help the cause.</li>
    <li> It keeps me dry.  It definately needs a complement if you have odor because this will not keep that away.</li>
    <li> This Stuff works ok, under arm pits at night...yes do help to cut down the smell n irritation...Just Be Sure The Arms are washed in AM! or they get sticky! ThxLesH</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product; however, the active ingredient is the same as Mitchum Power Gel and is the same amount 25%.  I was looking for an alternative to Mitchum Power Gel as it has not been effective for me lately.  I thought this product might be a viable alternative...until I saw the active ingredient.  So I rate three stars because of the results I&#x27;ve recently had with the similar Mitchum product.  Different active ingredients probably work better for some than others.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the Certain Dri solid isn&#x27;t as good as the Certain Dri roll-on.  I will not purchase the solid anymore.</li>
</ol>
