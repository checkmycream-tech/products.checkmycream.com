### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought these for my father and he was very happy with the quality of these scissors.  </li>
      <li>If you want the best scissors &amp; can afford them, try the Rubis.</li>
      <li>TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS  PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This has to be one of the best nostril scissors out there.</li>
      <li>Excellent scissors and very good value</li>
      <li>Very good product for the money.  </li>
      <li>Seki makes very good scissors, knives, &amp; nail clippers.</li>
      <li>Great size and very good quality.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find them on Amazon after all this time.  </li>

      <li>the scissors, as with all of this company&#x27;s products, are visually attractive.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a good brand as I&#x27;ve got three of their products now and am happy with all of them.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise the good product</li>
      <li>all in all a superior scissor.</li>
      <li>the Seki blade tips are quite a bit thicker than the Rubis blade tips, which means that you can&#x27;t get as close to your skin with the Sekis, which in turn means that your hair won&#x27;t be clipped as closely; again, the Seki does a good job with this, just not as good as the Rubis. 4)</li>
      <li>Good quality and</li>
      <li>These are the best and worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and safe and easy to use.</li>
      <li>These are not as good as the Rubis scissors, but are worth it for the lower price, &amp; they do a very good job.</li>
      <li>These are really good scissors; they cut very precisely, hair does not try to slide out - I use it trimming the hairline around my ears, too.</li>

      <li>This is a very precise instrument.  </li>
      <li>Much better than any of those rotary products.</li>
      <li>more is there to say about a nose hair scissor?</li>
      <li>These scissors work okay after tightening the screw, which seems to need adjusting every time I use them.  </li>
      <li>They are ok but they have rounded tips not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These scissors are okay.</li>
      <li>These scissors work better than battery operated trimmers that I have used.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to budge.  </li>
      <li>Not this one for sure.</li>
      <li>The quality of this item is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I bought these as a back-up pair for my Rubis scissors, which cost about 50% more than these do.</li>
      <li>The material quality seems excellent and I&#x27;ve had excellent past experience with the Seki toe nail clippers (which is the main reason I bought these).  </li>
      <li>This works pretty good.</li>
      <li>It seems to work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>If you want a good to very good pair of scissors for less money, the Seki will do just fine.</li>
      <li>have other seki products that I am very happy with.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought these in Japan about 15 years ago and have found nothing better since.</li>
      <li>sharp slender blades make these perfect scissors.</li>
      <li>and her customers feel they are getting the full treatment!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and cuts precisely.</li>
      <li>She says they work fine</li>
      <li>and I like the ability to cut precisely with the tips.</li>
      <li>High quality &amp; safe!</li>
      <li>Like most men when you get old you start to get more nose hails and ear hairs, even.</li>
      <li>They work fine for me and are well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but they have more heft, a tighter screw, and much thinner blades.</li>
      <li>Hopefully these will last me a good while to come.</li>
      <li>Good enough that I&#x27;m in no hurry to replace however.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned a different pair for over 15 years that cut much better and are more comfortable than the Seki.    </li>
      <li>This is the best pair of nostril scissors I ever had, including the more expensive Rubis.</li>
      <li>the best out there, my last one i had for several years.</li>
      <li>Far and away the best i&#x27;ve used, far superior to those flimsy and dull pharmacy brands.</li>
      <li>The scissors are NOT near as good quality tho, the two halves fit much too losely and the screw that should tighten them together</li>
      <li>Worth the money?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>its worth the money.</li>
      <li>Much better than my old drugstore Revlons.    </li>
      <li>When I first used these scissors, I was able, because of the wonderful light weight and balance of these scissors to delicately trim every single nostril hair.</li>
      <li>Their blunted ends make them very easy to use and allow you to be a little more aggressive without worrying about giving yourself a lobotomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are super sharp, don&#x27;t rust so must be made of a good grade of stainless, and just seem to be well made.  </li>
      <li>These are very nice little scissors, and perfect for regular to small size fingers.  </li>
      <li>These so-called Nostril super scissors don&#x27;t do a thing they cut absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>There has been a slaughtering of nose hairs by the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nostril scissors!</li>
      <li>Again this is my first pair.</li>
      <li>He was able to trim nose, ear and facial hair with ease and precision.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Stamped\\&quot; means that the scissor halves were cut out of a sheet of stainless steel with a powerful press - like a cookie cutter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for great hygiene, so I decided to give these a try.</li>
      <li>My first pair are &amp;</li>
      <li>I do have large hands so...</li>
      <li>I buy large gloves to give an idea.  </li>
      <li>I have a pair of really fine German eyebrow-trimming scissors that put these to shame.</li>
      <li>DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO ,BETTER THAN ANY OTHER  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>Yes every hair, none could resist the strength and might of the twin Seki edge stainless steel blades (though they tried).  </li>
      <li>Seki nail clippers so much.</li>
      <li>Probably not strong enough to cut big toenails but excellent for everything else.</li>
      <li>The scissors are put together with a little screw for two \\&quot;stamped\\&quot; halves; no doubt a very easy and inexpensive manufacturing process.  </li>
      <li>Nice Scissor but way to small for my fingers.</li>
      <li>I have two of these little nose hair scissors, and I&#x27;m satisified with the good Japanese quality.</li>
      <li>like most men do it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for you to be able to put your fingers in that comfortably to be able to use the product this is why I can only give the product three stars</li>
      <li>Maybe I am not aware enough of my surroundings (I have heard that one before LOL), but I only use these less than a minute a week, so who cares how they fit my fingers, altho they seem comfortable enough to me.</li>
      <li>I have small hands and the handles just fit over the my fingertips which actually gives me better control.</li>
      <li>High quality&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>are a bit too small, especially for my thumb; the Rubis has much larger &amp; more comfortable finger openings; if the openings in the Seki are too small for you, you can take out the rubber inserts, which is what I did, &amp; they fit fine now.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that these are stainless steel because unlike my old chrome scissors, they do not rust after rinsing with water.</li>
      <li>I note this only because it keeps the blades in constant contact for clean cuts, which is one of those little qualities that make some things better than others.    </li>
      <li>I compared these to the other scissors by seki edge with the full plastic handle for about $11.</li>
      <li>My pointer finger and thumb fit into the finger holes with little room to spare.</li>
      <li>buying a pair of scissors specifically designed for trimming nose hair makes me feel like an old man.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Makes the may lower proceed China made ones seem like complete garbage</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Always used automatic nose hair cutters but these have changed my mind.  These are the best and worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, they really trim those nostril hairs with the safety of the rounded tips.  Much better than any of those rotary products.</li>
    <li> Nice Scissor but way to small for my fingers.</li>
    <li> There has been a slaughtering of nose hairs by the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nostril scissors!</li>
    <li> These are super sharp, don&#x27;t rust so must be made of a good grade of stainless, and just seem to be well made.  I&#x27;m happy I bought them.  Seems to be a good brand as I&#x27;ve got three of their products now and am happy with all of them.  Would recommend/buy them again.</li>
    <li> Not using them for my Nostrils, using them for those times when I need cut coupons, that hanging thread, or just to cut something out.  Great size and very good quality.</li>
    <li> She says they work fine and her customers feel they are getting the full treatment!</li>
    <li> The craftsmanship and fabrication of my scissors are perfection.  When I first used these scissors, I was able, because of the wonderful light weight and balance of these scissors to delicately trim every single nostril hair. Yes every hair, none could resist the strength and might of the twin Seki edge stainless steel blades (though they tried).  Why, I think I&#x27;ll buy another pair, just in case my present pair are stolen away during the night by scissor wielding Ninja warrior manicurists.</li>
    <li> These are very nice little scissors, and perfect for regular to small size fingers.  If you have man sized hands you will have problems holding onto these, but man are they sharp, be careful.</li>
    <li> I have a pair of really fine German eyebrow-trimming scissors that put these to shame. The German ones were more expensive (25 or 35 bucks?) but they have more heft, a tighter screw, and much thinner blades. With the German scissors, the hair I&#x27;m aiming for always gets clipped, it doesn&#x27;t escape the blades... These Seki scissors on the other hand are lacking. The blades are too thick - that limits how short you can trim the hairs.. Also, they don&#x27;t have the heft and the tight screws my German scissors have... so the hairs sometimes escape the blades and it all takes longer. Meh.</li>
    <li> The material quality seems excellent and I&#x27;ve had excellent past experience with the Seki toe nail clippers (which is the main reason I bought these).  But, the blades on these scissors are too thick to cut hair close to the skin.  Also, the finger holes in the handles are not very comfortable.    I&#x27;ve owned a different pair for over 15 years that cut much better and are more comfortable than the Seki.    Plus, these scissors are considered a personal item by Amazon and cannot be returned (so I&#x27;m stuck with them).  So, be forewarned!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my father and he was very happy with the quality of these scissors.  He was able to trim nose, ear and facial hair with ease and precision.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not comfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
    <li> Man Im getting old. But thats not the point.    The design allows for easy cutting along the inner part of my nose.  The hairs were cut without and pulling at all.  I have average sized hands.  I buy large gloves to give an idea.  My pointer finger and thumb fit into the finger holes with little room to spare. Im not sure you need to insert the entire finger anyway.     The cutting edges are sharp and keep in contact with each other over the entire cutting stroke. Each blade is slightly curved toward the other.  I note this only because it keeps the blades in constant contact for clean cuts, which is one of those little qualities that make some things better than others.    I also like the lengh and narrow profile of these.  I compared these to the other scissors by seki edge with the full plastic handle for about $11. Those had longer blades about the same width.  The shorter the blade the less the fingers need to move to open the cutting edges. I figured I only needed to trim around the inside of my nose and not all the way to the back.      There is no case or protective cap with these, however; the plastic handle model does have a protective case that covers the blades in case this matters.       Again this is my first pair.</li>
    <li> Well made/sharp, precision scissors. I have small hands and the handles just fit over the my fingertips which actually gives me better control. People with larger hands may have difficulty using these unless you can remove the rubber inserts. They work fine for me and are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> High quality &amp; safe! Rounded tips and very sharp. Seki makes very good scissors, knives, &amp; nail clippers. Look them up!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this item is outstanding. It&#x27;s worth the extra money up front. We&#x27;ve had it for years and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty good.  I have very small nostrils compared to most people, so it&#x27;s rather difficult cutting nose hairs.  This works pretty good. The cutting edges are sharp, so I appreciate the rounded edges at the tip.</li>
    <li> They have very smooth movement and they are sharp enough to get the job done in the first pass.  Far and away the best i&#x27;ve used, far superior to those flimsy and dull pharmacy brands.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a back-up pair for my Rubis scissors, which cost about 50% more than these do. These are not as good as the Rubis scissors, but are worth it for the lower price, &amp; they do a very good job. The differences are: 1) the Rubis blades are sharper; the Seki blades are fairly sharp, just not as sharp. 2) I have medium sized fingers, but the finger holes for the Seki are a bit too small, especially for my thumb; the Rubis has much larger &amp; more comfortable finger openings; if the openings in the Seki are too small for you, you can take out the rubber inserts, which is what I did, &amp; they fit fine now. 3) the Seki blade tips are quite a bit thicker than the Rubis blade tips, which means that you can&#x27;t get as close to your skin with the Sekis, which in turn means that your hair won&#x27;t be clipped as closely; again, the Seki does a good job with this, just not as good as the Rubis. 4) although the Rubis scissors are a little smaller in width &amp; length, they are actually 16% heavier, indicating a more solid steel construction. If you want the best scissors &amp; can afford them, try the Rubis. If you want a good to very good pair of scissors for less money, the Seki will do just fine.</li>
    <li> Hard to get my fingers in the hole</li>
    <li> Good quality and they work well. If the finger holes were a tad bigger, then it would be five stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent scissors and very good value</li>
    <li> I have two of these little nose hair scissors, and I&#x27;m satisified with the good Japanese quality.</li>
    <li> These nostril scissors have a nice build and the cutting edges are sharp. They trim hair with ease but due to the thickness of the blades, it&#x27;s hard to cut near the skin. If you don&#x27;t need to cut your hair shorter than 2mm, these should work out for you. I also like the fact that these are stainless steel because unlike my old chrome scissors, they do not rust after rinsing with water.</li>
    <li> I originally bought these in Japan about 15 years ago and have found nothing better since. I&#x27;ve been looking for a second pair for quite awhile so I could keep one in my travel kit so I was happy to find them on Amazon after all this time.  My first pair are &amp;#34;Green Bell&amp;#34; brand as shown in the photo but the Seki Edge appear to be identical with only the name changed. At this price point I doubt you&#x27;ll find better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as comments about the blades being to thick, I haven&#x27;t found that to be a problem and I like the ability to cut precisely with the tips.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase in part because I like me Seki nail clippers so much. The scissors are NOT near as good quality tho, the two halves fit much too losely and the screw that should tighten them together I haven&#x27;t been able to budge.  Also I can only get the tips of my fingers into the handle/holes as they are too small for my big (not fat, just big) hands.  Good enough that I&#x27;m in no hurry to replace however.</li>
    <li> These are well made and are sharp. they do the job, but the finger holes are a little small for me. I do have large hands so... just something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> Like most men when you get old you start to get more nose hails and ear hairs, even. I&#x27;m a sucker for great hygiene, so I decided to give these a try. These met and exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone with overgrown nose hairs or ear hairs</li>
    <li> These are really good scissors; they cut very precisely, hair does not try to slide out - I use it trimming the hairline around my ears, too. Probably not strong enough to cut big toenails but excellent for everything else. Much better than my old drugstore Revlons.    The pivot had some black areas (casting marks on stainless steel?) so I polished them up with a metal polish and the cutting action was even smoother.    The biggest drawback to these scissors are that the finger holes are not meant for men. I&#x27;m about average size but the hole will not even go over my entire thumbnail and constantly slips out, losing control. A trick is that you can remove the black rubber o-ring to make it larger and works well now, just less cushioned.</li>
    <li> cant get fingers in holes comfortably and the blade is much too short and hard to use buy one in drugstore</li>
    <li> This is the best pair of nostril scissors I ever had, including the more expensive Rubis. Great grip, always makes a clean cut w no misses. Highest rec.</li>
    <li> the scissors, as with all of this company&#x27;s products, are visually attractive. they are sharp, easy to use, and seem to be extremely well made. i look forward to years of use, as i&#x27;ve had with other seki products purchased over the years.</li>
    <li> The product is well-made the only problem is that the holes to put your fingers in a quite small if you have larger fingers like most men do it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for you to be able to put your fingers in that comfortably to be able to use the product this is why I can only give the product three stars</li>
    <li> In my view, not great, but not bad. Worth the money? I am not sure it functions much better - or differently - than other scissors at lower prices. The rounded tips are a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Quality product, well made.</li>
    <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO ,BETTER THAN ANY OTHER  THAT I HAVE USED ! NO SHARP EDGES TO WORRY ABOUT</li>
    <li> These scissors work okay after tightening the screw, which seems to need adjusting every time I use them.  A little unhandy considering the cost.</li>
    <li> Precision tool for a delicate job!</li>
    <li> High quality&lt;br /&gt;Supper sharp&lt;br /&gt;Round tips to not cut your nose&lt;br /&gt;Small and discreet&lt;br /&gt;Better than a electric because it doesn&#x27;t tickle&lt;br /&gt;What more is there to say about a nose hair scissor?</li>
    <li> These scissors are adequate for the job and small enough for a traveler.  They are difficult to use if your thumb and finger are large.</li>
    <li> This is a very precise instrument.  It is sharp and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and cuts precisely.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money.  I appreciate the rounded ends as that used to&lt;br /&gt;be a painful part of trimming.  the blades are very sharp without being ridiculous about&lt;br /&gt;it, and the finger holes seem well designed.  all in all a superior scissor.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best nostril scissors out there. Japanese stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the may lower proceed China made ones seem like complete garbage, I know,&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a few of them to find their quality poor.</li>
    <li> These pricey nostril scissors DON&#x27;T cut nostril hair!  Unless mine was a fluke, don&#x27;t buy these things.  They were useless.  And I mean they don&#x27;t cut at all!</li>
    <li> These so-called Nostril super scissors don&#x27;t do a thing they cut absolutely nothing much less hair..lol..very disappointed and paid a top price for this junk..</li>
    <li> From the picture I expected these scissors to be pointed and very sharp.  They are ok but they have rounded tips not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I have other seki products that I am very happy with.  Not this one for sure.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT AND THE RECEPIENT LIKES IT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS  PRODUCT</li>
    <li> There is no curvature of the blades to contour to the topography of the nostrils. You will notice that as you repeatedly clip, little if any nose hair is actually being trimmed. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Scissors were dull and the rubber inserts in the finger holes made the holes too small for your fingers.  I was dissapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> the best out there, my last one i had for several years. its worth the money. sharp but not to sharp</li>
    <li> good product, safe and easy to use</li>
    <li> These scissors work better than battery operated trimmers that I have used.  The blades are a little thick which makes it hard to cut close to the skin.</li>
    <li> These scissors are okay. They feel well made and precise, but I think there is something about how thick the blades are that makes it harder to cut hairs shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some getting used to to learn how to cut my nose hairs with these, but after 3 times, I think I&#x27;m a pro at it. Their blunted ends make them very easy to use and allow you to be a little more aggressive without worrying about giving yourself a lobotomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used them for anything else, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to a friend if they wanted to cut their nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp or precise in cutting as I had hoped - I get hair pulls occasionally. The finger grips are a nice feature.</li>
    <li> sharp slender blades make these perfect scissors. Hopefully these will last me a good while to come. would recommend these to anyone looking to buy a pair of sturdy scissors for trimming the forest that never stops growing lol.</li>
    <li> The scissors are put together with a little screw for two \\&quot;stamped\\&quot; halves; no doubt a very easy and inexpensive manufacturing process.  The finger, thumb holes are very small.  I can barely get my medium male thumb tip in one.  I will be returning these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Stamped\\&quot; means that the scissor halves were cut out of a sheet of stainless steel with a powerful press - like a cookie cutter.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Not much to say about it - works well.  Nothing wrong with it, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and high quality scissors, with thin blades that allow you to get close to the hair, as well as a rounded tip so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself.  Unfortunately though, as other reviewers have mentioned, these scissors have extremely small finger holes that make it difficult to use. I have small hands and thin fingers and these were even too small for me. If not for the small finger holes, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like using these little scissors but they cost way too much! They do have beveled edges though so thats kinda nice</li>
    <li> The holes in the handle are way too small.  I really can&#x27;t use it.  You can&#x27;t put your fingers in the holes.</li>
    <li> works well, the rounded tips make it difficult to get in tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and safe and easy to use. It is effective for both nose and ear hairs with little danger of cutting.</li>
    <li> I see all kind of reviews, but for the price, I think these are really nice. Maybe I am not aware enough of my surroundings (I have heard that one before LOL), but I only use these less than a minute a week, so who cares how they fit my fingers, altho they seem comfortable enough to me. They are staying sharp and cut well, so I give them 5 stars</li>
    <li> the scissors are to thick, its hard to actually trim anything with that thickness unless you have wide nostrils. Otherwise the good product</li>
    <li> Pros: works very well, and the rounded tips prevent you from cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: buying a pair of scissors specifically designed for trimming nose hair makes me feel like an old man. Oh well.</li>
