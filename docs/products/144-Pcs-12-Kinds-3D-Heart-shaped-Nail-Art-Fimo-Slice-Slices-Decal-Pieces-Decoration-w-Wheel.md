<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
    <li> I love these and I&#x27;m having so much fun doing my nails and my friends nails with these.  Very good quality, I will definitely be buying from them again!</li>
    <li> I just love this product...I have artificial nails and love dolling them up with this or that decorations.  I love these hearts and the fact that they come in different colors makes the ability to wear them with anything a possibility.  I recommend these hearts to any DIY nail artist or the beginner.</li>
    <li> Well I got my order today based on the number on the envelope but it was NOT the fimo slices....they sent me a darn cell phone case, I have contacted seller to see how they will rectify the issue and then I will update my rating based on the outcome...but for now, I am NOT happy!</li>
    <li> this are so cute and I love them. Had a grandma day with my granddaughters we did our nails all had a great time and the girls loved all the decals.</li>
    <li> I love these cute little thing it&#x27;s like a cheap but very good addition to my nail collection something u only spend a lil bit on but last and goes a long way and time</li>
    <li> I love these and they are so cute. Who ever cut these were careful because they are fine and fit awesomely on the nail without it making it feel chunky. But my only issue was, that it is not exclusively hearts like on the picture. It was more of a few hearts, bows, and stars. But they are all cute.</li>
    <li> I think these are really cute. I am hoping to be able to use them for other crafts in addition to my nails. They are pretty small which makes them difficult to work with</li>
    <li> i like the product easy to use but its hard to open the wheel for me but its really nice</li>
    <li> These Fimo slices are very beautiful. It is obvious that these were very carefully sliced. I have not gotten a chance to try them yet as I am waiting on curved tweezers. The colors are beautiful. I cannot wait to try them. I will write more after I apply them to my nails.</li>
    <li> I buy tons of fimo pre slice or cane I love the better pre cut because there sliced just right haven&#x27;t used yet but will for valentine day!</li>
    <li> These fimo slices were better than I expected. They are thin enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about using glue, you can just stick with wet nail polish. I used these to do manicures on some friends, and they were really excited about using them!</li>
    <li> So I have a problem getting polish to stick to my nails so I have started purchasing these to use with clear polish. These are cute and I can get them in all holidays and a ton of varieties.</li>
    <li> Tiny but super cute.  Took a while for them to get here but that was fine.  I wish it came with an applicator or something because they&#x27;re so small its hard to handle them!  But super super cute!</li>
    <li> Because I love nail art I get my nails done all the time n y not sometimes bring in your own stuff because sometimes nail designs are all looking the same so sometimes you have to be different...</li>
    <li> These are pretty and unique, however, the negatives outweigh the positive. Each piece seems to be a different width. Easily snag hair. Hard to mold to curve of fingernails (I found soaking them in water prior to application helps with the thinner slices). Difficult to use...just buy the stickers!</li>
    <li> I love the variation that was received and the thickness was good for putting on nails.</li>
    <li> Came in earlier than expected!  I can&#x27;t wait to try them! I love how thin they are. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are ok.  If you are applying them to the top of your nail they stick up way to much.  Would work much better if you are adding them to acrylic while your forming the nail.  They are super cute though!</li>
    <li> Since I love these hearts and these colors, I actually bought these for embellishments on homemade cards and other paper crafts that I make.</li>
    <li> To start of i love the variety there&#x27;s various different shapes not just hearts there is also bows, stars ect... they&#x27;re very well cut theyre really cute very thin so their perfect i love them i will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Fairly good product</li>
    <li> These arrived packaged and in good quality!  I love them.  The container they are in is very easy to use and can be reused again.  fimo cane is sliced nicely and can be used on anything! thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I love them and for the price I was not let down, but they did come in with some greasy black stuff on the case which I did not like so 4 stars</li>
    <li> I love these fimo nail decals I am so addicted to them..they go on easy and stay on your nail well..</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product! i love heart shaped things so i thought these would be cute, they are! i put them on all the time. they are easy to use and all the different colors make doing your nails fun. plus they arent super thick so when you put the clear coat on it makes the hearts stay on longer and better.</li>
    <li> some of the hearts were broken and it was kinda thrown in the wheel . worked ok if u have the time to bend and wait for them to form onto your nail. but its ok for the price. a little work never hurt no one.</li>
    <li> These are going to be a lovely addition to my nail art collection.  They were definitely worth the wait although they did arrive before the expected delivery date.  This are very beautiful fimo slices.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but some of them are cut too thick to really stay on very well. But if you don&#x27;t mind having a ton of glue on your nail then they are fine</li>
    <li> they are so cute. they are cut nice and thin. they sit on the nail perfect without raising. i love them. the colors are so pretty. my favorite ones are the blue ones with the smiley face. cute!!!</li>
    <li> too cute, awesome container, perfect size for nails and very bright pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;too cute, awesome container, perfect size for nails and very bright pretty colors.</li>
    <li> cheap looking&lt;br /&gt;flat&lt;br /&gt;hard to place on nails and just to big, and sticks upinbad way onnail&lt;br /&gt;werid colors&lt;br /&gt;just didn&#x27;t like, I liked the pink one, its only a couple dollars and the shipping isquick soits not a complete lost</li>
    <li> these seem to be pretty good</li>
    <li> these are great for my dough art jewelry. they are tiny and cute. would like to see more colors and shapes done in this category.</li>
    <li> You pretty much pay what u get for. Very inexpensive but feels like cheap paper. It also wouldn&#x27;t stick to my nail.</li>
    <li> Some hearts were in half but other than that the hearts are colorful and pretty colors! I like it and it&#x27;s worth the paying.</li>
    <li> Thank you for quick shipping! They are very cute and colorful.  The only thing is the heart doesn&#x27;t stick flat on the nails. The corners are curled up. Have to figure it out how to keep them flat.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and look great on nails I am very happy with my purchase! Looks exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> When I received this item it was open and a lot of the pieces were in the package and also it wasn&#x27;t anything like the picture...</li>
    <li> They look good, good variety. The do break easily and shipping took a little long. Other than that I think product is good</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and I decided to try these out. They do slip out of the wheel but I can&#x27;t blame them, they are so cute and teeeny :) Totally glad I invested in these, I am gonna have sooo much fun.</li>
    <li> There exactly what I ordered and very cute!!!  What you see in the photos is what you get! Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> Bought for myself and I absolutely love them when I do my nails now a lot of people ask me who did them</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
    <li> so i received this today which means i got it earlier then i was supposed to but im a little upset that they are not exactly like the pic. not only are the colors different but some are completely differenet</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> Good itwm for the price</li>
    <li> I have just gotten into the nail art for me and my girls and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments. We used the green ones to make clovers on our nails for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day nails.</li>
    <li> Nice and thin will rest nicely on your nail.</li>
    <li> These are super cute, but I find it difficult to get them to lay flat on the nail.</li>
    <li> Way too thick to use on nails.</li>
</ol>
