      <li>I wish I had pictures to prove just how awesome this product really is.</li>
      <li>dye is kind of pricey</li>

      <li>Absolute best hair dye on the market.</li>
      <li>I think special effects is great hair dye.</li>

      <li>The color is extremely pink, lasts about 3-4 weeks before I have to redye (which is unavoidable for any bright dye like this), and looks awesome.</li>
      <li>The special effects brand has had superior results.</li>
      <li>I hope this is just cause its awesome and popular and there is more to come :) I don&#x27;t wanna use a different product that doesn&#x27;t work as well...  </li>

      <li>Very nice color when applied, super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even get it to bleach out most of the time, which is fine because I love it!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best product ever for a really rich and vibrant color.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure some people have mastered dyeing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m two months into having pink hair, and it&#x27;s only just starting to fade into a pretty lighter pink (more of a red-pink than a blue-pink). Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for five years and have no desire to find an alternative. It&#x27;s vibrant, long-lasting, and easy to use. Atomic pink shows and stays regardless of whether or not I bleach my dirty blonde hair. I typically reapply every two to three weeks, though the faded pink lasts for months. For those who are worried about staining their sink, shower, or counter, use a brillo pad. A few minutes of scrubbing and the pink should disappear.</li>
    <li> Super cool color!  My daughter loves the pink in her hair!  Received item extremely quick!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used so far, and i had quite a bunch of other colors and brands. &#x3D;D Lasts about two months without retouching in my hair, it&#x27;s always bright, even when the pinkish is vanishing. It stays in the hair very easy, even if it&#x27;s not bleached until white. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you intend to have you hair another color afterwords... it&#x27;s almost impossible to take it out without damaging the appearance of your hair. &#x3D;) Also, I&#x27;ve used the same bottle for a whole year now and it&#x27;s still not over, and i dye all my hair (goes to my shoulders).</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would last longer than Manic Panic, and I definitely found it!  It&#x27;s been almost a month and this hair color (Atomic Pink) has barely faded.  I get compliments on it all the time for how bright and vibrant it is.  If you would like to make it last longer, put a lil of the color in your shampoo or conditioner.  Also, one bad thing I noticed about this dye was that it does bleed more than Manic Panic.  So be prepared for it to end up on your clothes or pillowcase and your shower, lol.  It does come out of fabric pretty easily though, so no biggie.</li>
    <li> Atomic Pink is an awesome hair color! It is bright and vibrant, lasts a long time and gives fantastic color!  Fast shipping from seller too!</li>
    <li> I wish I had pictures to prove just how awesome this product really is. I Bleached my hair first, since its verrrry dark, and then actually used a different product the first time around. This other dye was more expensive and lasted only a week, and was very faded on the first wash anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Special effects. Atomic pink is probably my favorite dye out of all of them. The dye sticks to hair batter and the color is soooo vibrant. I&#x27;m in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This dye will wreck your world if you spill it on any surface that&#x27;s not atomic pink already. It&#x27;ll stain your tub, the counter, the sink, you hands, your head...etc.</li>
    <li> I do like the color but for me, despite so many reviews on other sites by people who like SE better than Manic Panic, I find it runs a lot more than Manic Panic. At they gym I have pink on my face and neck, and the color in my hair does not last as long as MP. I find SE more drying too.&lt;br /&gt;But as far as the color, it is a beautiful hot pink.</li>
    <li> Holy crap, this stuff&#x27;s been in my hair for four and a half weeks and it&#x27;s still the exact same color as when I put it in. Finally a hot pink dye that WORKS!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, and ALWAYS works for me. I have used the Nuclear red and most currently this atomic pink. It&#x27;s more of a hot hot fuchsia. It&#x27;s so bright. My co-workers call me the walking highlighter haha! I dyed it over yellow toned-blonde hair. My hair is medium length, so I had a little left over in the bottle. It even made the black undertones look kind of cool. The only thing I highly recommend is YOU HAVE TO WASH YOUR HAIR IN COLD WATER! if not, your color will bleed soooo bad, and there goes all your time and money invested in the color. I also left it in for 2 hours. YES it is safe. The dye contains no ammonia, or peroxide, meaning it will not damage your hair prior to what people think.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the pink for a little over a month, and it&#x27;s absolutely great still. I did tiny touch ups, but that&#x27;s about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of the dyes I am exposed to, I still would not use anything else on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Special effects dye!</li>
    <li> I did ofcourse do the bleach process first with some L&#x27;oreal Quick Blue Hair Bleach with 40 developer, got as light as I could. I did use the Special Effects Atomic Pink. I did leave it on for about one hour, I wanted a nice bright as can be pink. Before I rinsed I gave my hair a splash of vinegar and water to neutralize the ph. I washed using L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s new line which is phosphate free and expressly a vegan product that with the lack of phosphates makes the color stay fresh and bright. Its been about three weeks and my hair is still a beautiful bright pink. I get compliments and alot of people asking how I did it, trying to do it themselves. I would recommend this product 1000 times over and without hesitation. If you are looking for a bright hot pink that will last and be true to the color, last.</li>
    <li> Sent quickly, in a ziplock bag with tape on the top of the bottle to ensure no spillage/leakage!  EXCELLENT.  Will by again from this seller exclusively.</li>
    <li> I have fairly dark brown hair but i bleached it slightly. The color came out very vibrant, but it only lasted a solid pink color for about 4 showers with no shampooing or conditioning. Pleased with the color but i wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Bleach first!! I have to since my hair is almost black. Dyed the bottom of my hair and love it!! It is such a vibrant color. My fiancee didnt want me to color my hair so I waited till he was in afghanistan. When I showed him the pictures he asked for me to keep it this way. I will be using this product again in different colors.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Bright colorful pink, very rich color, truly lovely.  The order was prompt. I would buy through this company again.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, does not stain the whole bathroom and makes BLAZING PINK when I used it on my very  bleached hair! it really glows and  it lasts much longer than other brands of crazy hair colourings. I use masking tape around my mohawk and some sheets of saran wrap to protect my skin against leaks, but unlike some other people, I did not protect the sink and nothing got stained.  A bit of laundry bleach cleaned it up fine. and the texture of the hair afterwards was wonderful, even tho this is black hair that has been bleached to the max....this is really WONDERFUL for a person who wants glowing screaming flamingo shrieking pink hair!</li>
    <li> Special Effects is the shizzle.  It grabs and holds like nothing else (I&#x27;M LOOKING AT YOU, MANIC PANIC!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been Atomic Pinking a stripe in my hair for many years and the quality is consistent.  It will also turn your hands and towels pink.  There is no extra charge for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; guide to applying this, or any vegetable-based color to your hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Mix with conditioner to your desired shade; if you want a pastel pink like me, mix with toner instead.  It&#x27;s longer lasting (more permanent) than manic panic, so if you are looking for something more temporary to be able to change up colors easily.  This brand does stain quickly, so be sure to use gloves.  Manic panic does not stain much, comes off easily and is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have used a plethora of brands to dye my hair pink over the years, and my experience with Special Effects has been by far the best when it comes to vibrant, long lasting color. I have gotten numerous compliments on my hair and will definitely be a repeat customer of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is highlighter pink and like many of the reviews before me, DOES stain your appliances severely. I accidentally dropped some in my dorm bathroom and now the soap dispenser is forever marked, along with the hair sink.... oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something for a fling, and don&#x27;t want a serious commitment, I suggest Manic Panic&#x27;s cotton candy pink. But Atomic Pink has hit above and beyond my expectations for color dye that lasts for once!</li>
    <li> I had my hair dyed with this on New Year&#x27;s Eve &amp; only now, June 1st, do I have any reason to touch it up, due to roots &amp; lightening in certain places. It is still so incredibly vibrant after 6 months!!! I will never use another brand of dye!</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair pink and it worked amazingly! I love this product! It been two-three weeks and it hasn&#x27;t washed out and my hair, amazingly, is still soft :D</li>
    <li> Sooo I have been using this product for a while but I have never used Atomic Pink!!!!!!! Ive used Fish Bowl, Cupcake pink, and I forgot the purple one I used.  Well recently I decided to go with my dream and dye my hair pink and black.  Its been black soo I decided to finally do it!  I first started with my bleaching my hair, and my hair is dark so the bleaching process turned my hair gold....Well so I went to Sallys and bought N Rage bubblegum or something like that and THAT WAS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It barely colored my hair and would wash out in like 2 washes....with color shampoo....SOOO I should have bought this in the first place but I did not want to do shipping lol.  Anyway, I bought it and basically shipped in 2 days!!!! And I did it tonight and it is my lovely bright pink I was trying to get &lt;3.  Amazing stuff!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this color! This is my go to pink for years now. It sticks in my hair like no other...I can&#x27;t even get it to bleach out most of the time, which is fine because I love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely the best pink hair dye that I&#x27;ve ever used. If you bleach your hair enough, you get exactly the color seen in the preview -  bright neon pink! I need to restock soon!</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE BEST!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands!!!</li>
    <li> works good looks good thank you!!!!!!!!!!! will shop again - fast shipping! Item is just as described / Pictured -- thank you&lt;br /&gt;arrived cracked and leaking but they put in a bag and not too much leaked so it was all good</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The pink is nice and bright. I have very dark hair, and I bleached it before I used Atomic Pink. I love the color it came out, although I did want it to be a bit brighter. However, that is my fault because I didn&#x27;t bleach it light enough first. So if you want it to be BRIGHT bright, definitely bleach it very light before you start. In any case, the color looks really good on me and it&#x27;s still very noticeable. Even older adults, after the shock of pink hair wears off, smile and say they really like it, which is a surprise.</li>
    <li> I dye my own hair and this has been the best dye I have found! It&#x27;s easy to use and it stays vibrant for months! Tip- when using this dye while you wait to rinse it out put your hair in aluminum foil and dry it with a hair drying. This with make it stay longer</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for 4 years, and i wish the company would hire me as advertising, because i have had  many people ask me what i use, and i highly recommend special effects atomic pink.  if you bleach your hair, this color lasts so long!  i suggest washing your hair with cool to cold water if you want this to last even longer.  mixing one part water and one part white vinegar and pouring it over your hair before rinsing out the dye keeps the color in longer by changing the ph level in your hair too.  i LOVE this hair color!</li>
    <li> Great color, long lasting, conditions hair.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color stays bright for a long time. i would for sure say buy this, its worth the price all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again</li>
    <li> lasts longer than manic panic!</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely manner. I like that someone took the trouble to wrap it in plastic in case of a leak during shipping. Vibrant color. I put it on over some Wildflower that had faded(in two Week!). I love the color. Only reason not a five is based on Wildflower fade time. That is with using sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. The color is amazing and it lasts for a good while (2-3 weeks). Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This color was so bright and I loved it.  But, It washed out a lot faster than I had anticipated and every time I showered it stained my shower bright pink.  Also after the first two weeks it started to turn orange, I like orange just not in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Special Effects color. It starts out a vivid pink, and glows under black lights. It fades more gracefully than most colors, and eventually turns into a clean looking light pink (some of the other colors turn dingy as they fade).</li>
    <li> Amazing love this line of colors, easy to use vibrant</li>
    <li> Very bright and lasts a long time. As with any hair dye, it does fade *a little* but not much. I&#x27;ve tried other colors by them (virgin rose) which faded much faster, but all the colors fade into a pretty, lighter color unlike most brands which tend to fade into a tint of the original color.</li>
    <li> Special Effects color is amazing.  I put this color on my hair a month ago, and it is still hot pink.  I will never go back to any other brand!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very vibrant, and lasted longer than Manic Panic. I definitely recommend it if you want to go (very) pink!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff a few times and I have to say it&#x27;s my favourite. It&#x27;s so bright, it lasts FOREVER, and it supposedly glows under blacklight too but I haven&#x27;t seen that yet. I dyed my hair about a month ago and people keep asking me, \\&quot;did you recolour your hair?\\&quot; because it is still THAT bright.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I dyed my hair with this, I had to dye my hair black a few months later while I was looking for a job. After a couple of months, the black was starting to fade, and the pink was still there-- with the faded black, it was a lovely burgundy shade. A few months after that (about 9 months since I initially dyed it pink), I bleached my hair because I wanted bright colour again, and the pink was STILL there, albeit much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Untouched, atomic pink will start to fade after a few months, but it will NEVER go away. Maybe that&#x27;s what makes it atomic?</li>
    <li> Great staying power but if you are a person like me who likes to change their hair color often, definitely stay away from this because it will NEVER come out of your hair, even after multiple bleachings.</li>
    <li> I must say this is a great product. From reading the reviews, I thought maybe it wouldnt take well, and would be quite messy. on the contrary. I had absolutely no messes. I dye my hair with feria bright auburn on a regular basis, and this was way less messy then that. It may have been because I didnt do my whole head though. It took quite well, and didnt rub off on anything afterwards. In fact, it was so bright that I tried to wash it the next day to tone it down a bit, and no pink ran from the water whatsoever. (maybe I just washed really well when rinsing out? )Im still in love with it though.  The key is to lighten your hair first. I used manic panic 40 lightening. It didnt take much. I only used about a quarter of a bottle to do my entire bang area which is about shoulder length.</li>
    <li> This has to be some of the best stuff out there. The hair stylist I went to used this product to dye my hair a bright pink. It&#x27;s been almost a month now and it&#x27;s almost the same color as when I first had it done. If you don&#x27;t want your hair color to look washed out or faded, I suggest using this product. Even if you have super dark hair (mine is dark brown, close to black) just bleach it and use this product! I ordered a bottle for myself because I liked it so much, but I&#x27;m not sure if I need it because I think by the time the color completely fades, my hair will have grown out already!</li>
    <li> I was trying to get a pastel pink and had gone with Pravana&#x27;s pastel line &amp;#34;pretty in pink&amp;#34;. The color hardly stuck to my bleached and silver toned hair. So I went back to the store and bought Pravana Vivids in &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34;. Love the way it turned out but washed out SO FAST. So I tried this brand in &amp;#34;Atomic Pink&amp;#34; - mixed the smallest amount of color in when white conditioner and let sit for an hour. This actually came out more PINK than I expected as I was going for more of a &amp;#34;tinted pink&amp;#34; look. However, after about 5 washes its lightened a little bit but is still really vivid! I haven&#x27;t noticed any bleeding on my white sheets or pillows, but that&#x27;s probably bc I didn&#x27;t use that much color. Also, with going pastel, this bottle is going to last a LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been diluting this dye in conditioner and this stuff 1, really seems to last in my hair, 2, is super brilliant so if you dilute it you really don&#x27;t need much, so you&#x27;ll 3, get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I love my pink hair!!!!!! It&#x27;s a great consistency for covering large areas (feels a lot like a heavy conditioner) and isn&#x27;t runny at all. If you get lazy and don&#x27;t reapply, it fades from magenta to Barbie pink.</li>
    <li> great hair color, shipped fast. came all taped up and in plastic bags so it didnt leak. very vibrant pretty colors and they last for a long time. LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand</li>
    <li> Nice highlighter pink. Used only about two spoon fills diluted with conditioner on my thick long hair. It hardly fades even with shampooing and hot water. Love love this pink dye</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair pink for sometime and have been sad with the results. The color would washout in weeks. The special effects brand has had superior results. Ive had it in my hair for over a month now and there has been little fading. The color is still vivid and constant. I love it. LOVE IT! I recommend this product for anyone who does not want to color their hair every other weekend. Buy it! You wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> The pink came out exactly as advertised and has lasted four weeks without fading at all (this is on bleached hair). I would highly recommend this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I like this color I wish my hair was lighter so this would look amazing on my hair .</li>
    <li> To be fair, it is the only one I&#x27;ve tried, but it lasts for months.  I bleach my hair first and then dye it.  It does bleed for a while, but it usually lasts for six-ish months.  It stays more of a magenta the first month, then fades to a bright pink for the next couple of months and then is a pale but bright highlighter pink.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any dye of an unnatural color to stay in my hair or be as bright as this!!</li>
    <li> Best pink on the market! Hardly fades and holds well on bleached hair. I will be back for more :-)</li>
    <li> I just used this on my daughters hair and we love it ! Her hair is naturally pretty light blonde and the color took very well. We&#x27;ll see how long it stays in !</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product!!! After a lot of time researching and reading reviews, I decided to give this product a shot for my first attempt with fun colored hair, and I could not be more thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a dual color review because I used both the Atomic Pink (base) and the Deep Purple (streaks). We bleached my hair down to a pale orange/yellow, which was about as light as I could get it at home going from a dark burgundy color from over the winter, rinsed, dried, and immediately applied the Atomic Pink. Left it on for about an hour (the bottle says 15 min, and with the Deep Purple 15 was enough, but I decided to go with the suggestion of a reviewer below who had stunning results with this color), then rinsed it out with cold water and apple cider vinegar. It turned out a very beautiful electric fuchsia. Then we applied the Deep Purple over the Atomic Pink by just pulling it through a highlighting cap. And then rinsed again. We did this outside, using medical gloves, in the back yard, with a garden hose. I cannot stress enough that you do NOT want to apply this anywhere near surfaces that you actually like. It will stain everything. The Atomic Pink definitely cleaned up easier than the Deep Purple. I was able to get it (the AP) to come off of the places on my vanity where a couple of fresh drips had fallen, using all purpose cleaner and a magic eraser. The Deep Purple took quite a bit more effort to clean up while fresh, and the couple of places that I missed, well, those are now a permanent fixture in our bathroom. I was able to lighten the spots to where they aren&#x27;t super noticeable, but it took a lot of elbow grease, bleach, and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a pic of the results, after about 4-6 weeks I&#x27;ll come back and update on how the color actually holds out.</li>
    <li> Color on bleached hair came out very vibrant hot pink, love it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the color refresher I have been looking for. I went from black hair to bleaching my hair so I could do magenta. As you can imagine, my color washes out even faster because of this. Well this product changed my life!! I am so excited I found this product. My hairstylist was even impressed she asked for the name. I highly recommend this product. I was refreshing my color every week. Now I can go about a 4-6 weeks!!</li>
    <li> I use it to mix with other colors, or diluted with conditioner. Love the shade and intensity of the dye. Will be purchasing from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> If I&#x27;m honest, I&#x27;ve kept this color for so long because it needs less upkeep than others. Atomic Pink is notorious for it&#x27;s lasting power. Do not purchase if you want something that will fade away back to nothing. Bleach hair to pale yellow for best results.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it in my salon. Long lasting results and fades evenly. Prepare to have a pink shower. Lasts 2-3 months before you have to redo your roots!</li>
    <li> Kinda dark shade of pink. I loved it though. I think special effects is great hair dye. It takes multiple times to wash out. So you don&#x27;t have to hassle &#x27;re coloring it every week. No worries. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Absolute best hair dye on the market. Bright, vibrant and super long lasting. The only brand I&#x27;ll use, as I&#x27;ve been dying my hair atomic pink for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to Ontario Canada and was VERY pleased with the shipping time!&lt;br /&gt;This dye is very hard to find in Canada and I was really impressed with both the shipping speed and how carefully it was packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The dye is kind of pricey but in my opinion worth it as it lasts longer than brands like Manic Panic and Splat .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent experience and I will purchase from here again!</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands of pink hair dye and this one is simply the best! The color is bright and stays bright!</li>
    <li> I decided to try special effects after my hairdresser recommended it for touch-ups, and ordered it through amazon because I was unable to find it locally. My pink hair had faded substantially at this point to a light orange color, so I left the dye in for about two hours and washed it out. The color is extremely pink, lasts about 3-4 weeks before I have to redye (which is unavoidable for any bright dye like this), and looks awesome. It even glows under black light! Oh, and I did buy an applicator brush and other essentials for the task.</li>
    <li> Very deep colour, but I dilute it with conditioner. I love how vibrant the colour turns out, but the dye is a bit runny, so it definitely needs to be put with a thick conditioner.</li>
    <li> met my expectations and more!!&lt;br /&gt;kinda lazy, dont wanna type much, but i would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;my hair came out beautifully and evenly coloured!&lt;br /&gt;kicks as</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle of Atomic Pink that I used for three applications, an initial and two touch ups, over the course of six months. I washed my hair almost daily and still had very pink hair. I did use it on pre-lightened hair. It is actually still there after I tried to bleach the pink out (couldn&#x27;t) and cover it with another color (a blue that faded to purple over the pink). Still love it. It is great. My favorite.</li>
    <li> Best haircolor around</li>
    <li> Atomic Pink is exactly as the name describes: Atomic. The product itself is conditioning; I can leave it in for 6 hours, and after it&#x27;s washed out, I can&#x27;t see or feel damage from my hair having been bleached. It takes -months- for AP to BEGIN to fade (I wash 3-4x a week in cool water). The longevity of this dye is absolutely unparalleled. People who&#x27;ve mentioned that the color bleeds are correct in a big way. Prepare for everything to be pink - the inner necklines of your shirts and hoodies, your pillow cases, towels, neck, etc. I gladly accept the slightly inconvenient side-effect for the vibrance and longevity of the color. I&#x27;ve gone 3-4 months without touching up the color, and STILL people ask what brand I use because they think it&#x27;s freshly dyed. Be aware : atomic pink is a lifestyle choice. This stuff doesn&#x27;t dye out, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to bleach out. However.....it&#x27;s amaaaaaaaaazing.</li>
    <li> Lasts 3+ months in my hair. The color of the pink changes over time, but it is still really great. I have brown hair, so I bleached my hair to blonde, but not BLONDE blonde, and it comes out perfect. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years.</li>
    <li> Special effects is top tier. No other semi-permanent color product stands up(that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT!!) the atomic pink lasts forever in bleached hair!</li>
    <li> This is the pink I have been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t stain my skin or clothes or anything of mine like some people have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That honestly depends on how you do the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best advice:&lt;br /&gt;-Bleach your hair to a pale yellow&lt;br /&gt;-Apply color to dry hair&lt;br /&gt;-Leave in for 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;-Put shower cap on&lt;br /&gt;-Blow dry&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the advice I got when going my research on this color and that seems to not only have prevented all of the problems but my color is more vibrant then if you do it by the directions of leaving on for 30 minutes and whatnot. I have read that by doing this process it can last up to 6 months without loosing much of its vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously if you want a HOT PINK - this is for you!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair crazy colors for almost a decade, and I have never found a better hair color than Special Effects. The colors are true to their color swatches. They&#x27;re bright, vibrant, and long lasting. They look bright and vibrant over bleached hair, but they look amazing, deep, and rich over darker, natural hair. This is the BEST hot pink i&#x27;ve ever used! I absolutely LOVE Special Effects!!!!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Hello!! Im Tiffany and Ive been using Special Effects for almost 5 yrs. Atomic Pink is the main color w/ others mixed in.... I need more!! :) Ive been searching for more Atomic Pink for a couple months now.. but i see there&#x27;s a Manufacture shortage? I hope this is just cause its awesome and popular and there is more to come :) I don&#x27;t wanna use a different product that doesn&#x27;t work as well...  I hope to see more soon but ill be patience :)  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why this is the only brand for me thus far....it fades much less than any other brand I have ever used on myself or any of my daughters. I have tried, used, and abused many different hair color products and Special Effects has the staying power. It also glows in black light~ great for dance clubs, raves and our Halloween parties!&lt;br /&gt;I like atomic pink as one of my 2 favorite shades they produce. I wear pink streaks in blonde hair, while it will bleed occasionally into the blonde when washing out, if you coat the strands you don&#x27;t want colored with lots of conditioner and hair clips when rinsing out it will minimize the bleed effect.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to be on the cutting edge of new fashion styles and don&#x27;t want to sport the same ole same ole~ Special Effects is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I used atomic pink on bleached tips of my hair 2 months ago and it hasn&#x27;t faded at all! I use color safe shampoo, wash with cool water, and don&#x27;t wash it everyday, but still I expected some fading. This pink is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!!! It never fails on me! It lasts so long, I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the bright, super powerful color. Also, this seems to be conditioning, not burning or painful at all. Definitely listen to the directions when it says \\&quot;do not apply to scalp\\&quot;. IT WILL STAIN YOUR SCALP and take many, many, days to come out. Also, even the tiniest drop will powerfully stain your bathroom or any other surface. I have used many other hair dyes, red, purple, brown, black, and none have ever stained with the voracity that this has. I am worried because I rent my apartment, and if the pink doesn&#x27;t come out from the bottom of the tub - I am certain my landlord will make me pay for it. However, this is getting a four because I am really happy with the bright, vibrant color and the lack of chemical smell or itching. Also, it is pretty great that you only have to leave it on for 15 minutes. I also am very happy that it is vegan and Made in America. Bleach hair for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like I said ... put newspaper down, towels, whatever is necessary.... IT WILL STAIN EVERY SURFACE IT TOUCHES. One hint to reduce the staining is to apply hand sanitizer to the stain within the first 5 minutes of staining. This also seems to help if you get some on your skin by accident. It reduced the severity of some of the stains around my sink, but did not remove them totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Many Hours Later: Hair is dry. It is a hot day. I am sweating and the color drips down my forehead and dies my forehead pink. Then. I was brushing my (let me repeat: DRY) hair and some of the hair falls on to the sink. The hair then stains the sink AGAIN. I am very worried about the damage this product has caused to my bathroom. If anyone knows of a way to remove the pink from any of these surfaces: sink, bathtub floor, toilet seat,please let me know. My happiness with how this looks in my hair is very much offset by the stains I now have to contend with. I am an experienced at home colorer. I have colored my hair numerous times. I was outfitted with gloves, shawl, towels, etc. and this still happened.</li>
    <li> For those complaining about bleeding, and saying you&#x27;re co-washing in cold water for 3 weeks after dyeing, for goodness sakes wash that shiz and wash it right away! With harsh shampoo! It&#x27;ll take away all that extra dye that&#x27;ll cause bleeding and rub-off, and heavens to betsy it&#x27;s atomic pink the color won&#x27;t budge!! Leave it in all you want, but wash wash wash it out to death! Then wash it a couple times the next day! Your color will be unaffected and you won&#x27;t have to worry about looking like the Texas chainsaw massacre! Yea!</li>
    <li> The best color I have ever put into my hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff covered my coppery blonde/brown hair and it&#x27;s staying in so far very well! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It is a very bright, neon florescent pink. Stays in your hair pretty well. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best product ever for a really rich and vibrant color. I love it! And really recommend it! Just be careful of the staining. This stuff stains everywhere and everything it touches. Rubbing alcohol will get it off your skin. I had to clean the tub immediately afterwards too. I recommend dying your hair in a place where you don&#x27;t care if you get it on the surface, wear gloves when washing and drying your hair because it will stain your hands and for the next few weeks, it&#x27;ll stain your clothes, pillow cases, couches etc. Pretty much everything your hair can come into contact with for the few weeks following. But still, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2 WEEKS LATER:&lt;br /&gt;Still stains everything. My hands, nails, face, neck, clothing, couch, headrest in my car, MY WHITE CELL PHONE, my earbuds for my headphones, the shower... I tried to put a clear gloss on it to help, but it&#x27;s done very little to help. I love the color and it&#x27;s still as vibrant as when I first dyed it, but c&#x27;mon. This is insane. I&#x27;ve tried everything: Cold water, clear gloss, limited washing. Nothing helps :( I probably won&#x27;t use this again, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for something different.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the actual web site with great results as far as color turn out! was very please with promptness of arrival</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair dyed at the salon and it ended up a really blah purple. I have heard nothing but awesome reviews about Special Effects! So I took the plunge with Atomic Pink and now have an awesome pink over my purple and it soo vibrant! I also bought this brand bc it&#x27;s suppose to be the longest lasting. No complaints so far! Well only to be careful it will turn EVERYTHING it touches Atomic Pink!! Haha I had my son help me and he was covered (I think he did it on purpose) but what wasn&#x27;t on purpose was the sink the shower my shirt!! Hahaha I&#x27;m sure some people have mastered dyeing. Me not so much, but I will be buying this again and probably try all the colors!! :)</li>
    <li> The color was amazing, lasted long, the best semi permanent dye out there. Arrived fast,  I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Would recommend this dye to everyone. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Bright long lasting color. Great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE how bright this pink is. I bleach my hair before using this color and I get compliments such as &amp;#34;your hair is so bright it hurts my eyes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Your boss is ok with your hair that color&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use any other pink on my hair</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, esp. on unbleached hair. I used to love this dye years ago, but idk.. I think I got an old bottle?</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty color and it works really well (at least on bleached hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I read suggested bleaching your hair first for bright colors and to make it last longer. I decided to bleach it. It does last a very long time. I put this in my hair in June. It fades a little bit, but it fades to a pretty light pink. Then it finally started to really lose its color this month, to patches of white where I had bleached my hair. I decided to bleach my hair so I could return to a more normal hair color. The bleach didn&#x27;t do a thing to this color. Its still there, the same color as when I had started. I used a volume 40 bleach and left it in there for at least an hour. The hair that didn&#x27;t have pink in it, was really blond, but nothing happened to the pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that will last months...this is it. You may have to re-dye when it starts to lose its color, but you have months of it to enjoy. If you decide you want to get rid of it....GOOD LUCK</li>
    <li> After using deep purple and staining my entire house purple, I decided to go pink, light punk. I wanted the option to go bright so I chose atomic pink instead of cupcake punk. I mix my dyes with conditioner, slather it on and put a shower cap on and let it set for 5 hours. I mixed thus as light as I could and it is still bright! I&#x27;m not complaining, it&#x27;s pretty! But I used a cup of conditioner to a droplet of dye so I can just imagine how itd look if I were to go full strength!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday gift for a friend in 2011. We tried looking in several stores that carried Special Effects at the time and couldn&#x27;t find Atomic Pink. (Of course, those same stores started carrying it about 6 months later when the demand became higher. Figures. :P ) It was exactly what she wanted and the color looked great in the treated streaks against her natural black hair. She has sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t bother her at all. A little dye also goes a long way with this product. She used it consistently for over a year with no deterioration in the results and I believe she still has some left to this day. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and fun way to do something different with their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this pink hair dye.  I am a breast cancer suvivor and have pink hair at least 6 months out of the year.  I can get 4 uses out of one bottle so go one bottle does it all.  love it</li>
    <li> This color is amazing, and my hair looks amazing. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and it is STILL very vibrant. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROTIP: If you are having problems with the dye staining your bathroom or your face/neck/ears, use rubbing alcohol. I use 70% rubbing alcohol and it gets rid of any of my stains. Put a towel or large, unwanted t-shirt down over your pillow until you&#x27;ve washed your hair a couple times. The dye WILL come off on your pillow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 3 other color hair dyes. The color is easy to apply and comes out true to color!!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick long brown hair, and this stuff is so much fun. It leaves my hair feeling really soft - doesn&#x27;t fry it! It&#x27;s subtle enough I can still go to work but even with relatively dark hair it glows in the sun and people definitely notice the difference. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> i loved the color that my hair turned after using this product. i will definatly be buyig from them again.</li>
    <li> Great shipping, price and product</li>
    <li> Great color, but a little on the messy side.  Blending with the Cupcake pink brought out some awesome tones.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and color looks great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT 100%. It is brighter and stands out more than any pink I&#x27;ve ever done (i love pink so I&#x27;ve tried alot).</li>
    <li> I have used everything any beauty supply store had to offer in the way of pink dyes, none compare to S.E. Atomic Pink. In it&#x27;s purest form it is indeed atomic, the brightest pink you&#x27;ve ever seen and looks stunning under a black light. Diluted it makes spectacular shades of pastel pinks &amp; with a small (dime size or less) dollop of a S.E. blue or purple dye added it creates stunning one of a kind pink shades that are all your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most bright colors it does look its best on pre-lightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has mega staying power and will not fade like the rest, it&#x27;s vegan and not tested on animals, it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it does fade it still looks gorgeous. Unlike alot of other competitors they offer a wide variety of colors and at least a few shades of each.  They are super easy and fun to mix to make you&#x27;re own color. (I like experimenting with mixing the blues with the yellows or the greens, or the pinks with the oranges etc..)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I will never use a different semi permanent dye ever again! Fast shipping, fair price, and great product. The color lasts 1-2 months on my bleached pale blonde hair,(with washing it every day &#x3D;0) no need to redye every week now! (such a pain, and too costly) I got so many complements on how bright my hair was. Will definetly rebuy when im out.</li>
    <li> I love this dye, i mix it with conditioner to get it lighter but the bottle still last me a lot longer than other dyes(ive had it for 6 monthes and im not even halfway through it). its doesnt rinse out when i wash my hair, it doesnt stain my clothes or my bathroom, and there is not very much fading even though i wash my hair a lot and with super hot water. Its such a great dye, ive recomended it to a few people. its a really worthwhile purchase if you&#x27;re looking for pink hair with not much maintenance.</li>
    <li> This brand has been the longest lasting hair color we have used, mostly compared to over the counter colors like Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> I am a hair colorist. I use this on my clients. It is the best, longest lasting pink on the market. If you are looking for a bright, darker, hot pink; this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Bleach hair first always, be very careful not to get product on anything important, it will stain anything, especially a hardwood floor.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other colors from this same brand are not as long lasting, sadly.</li>
    <li> Have been a fan of Special Effects for about 10+ years and using the atomic pink off and on for 8. This past time, 5 months ago, I mixed Ion red with it and the results were stunning, 5 months later I have regrowth but the color has only slightly faded... I use ION sealer after each shower and only rinse in cold water. I only use vegan products on my hair so I always come back to SE. It is very easy to use and you really do not need to bleach to white with this color. I only lifted to a yellow and it was the perfect shade of fluorescent pink and when I used it on my neices light red hair it was a pretty cupcake pink. Be prepared to be stopped regularly as people gush over your candy hair ;)</li>
    <li> if you want your color to stay bright and last longer then a week you gotta get special effects. the color (after bleaching) is so bright and it stays bring for several weeks to come. i&#x27;ve had this pink in my hair for 4 months now and ive only redyed it 3 times and thats because my roots have grown out NOT because its faded...i love special effects and its the only dye ill use now.</li>
    <li> i have ben using this dye ever since i bbought it here and it stays in for ever ..... after using it every month on my whole head for about a year my hair is stained ..... although after the first fiew uses i bleached it out and still got it to white</li>
    <li> Best semi permanent hair dye out there.</li>
    <li> Compared to hair dye I&#x27;ve been using that&#x27;s permanent, this not-permanent dye lasts far longer. I&#x27;m still getting compliments on the color and I dyed it right before Halloween, and it&#x27;s almost Valentine&#x27;s day and I haven&#x27;t redone it yet! All you have to do is bleach your hair if you have dark hair like mine first.</li>
    <li> Atomic Pink by Special Effects is a hair dye that lasts for long...wouldn&#x27;t change it! I have used it for about 8 years!</li>
    <li> I used this instead of a comparable Manic Panic colour because I was sick and tired of reapplying every week when it started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after several months and darker dye jobs to \\&quot;cover up\\&quot; the pink, MY HAIR WAS STILL PINK! Amazing. It turned out to be cute and quirky but if it were green or a similar colour, I&#x27;d be upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite 5 on staying power. Also, be sure to tarp your whole bathroom because this stuff will dye anything you so much as sneeze at.</li>
    <li> Very nice color when applied, super easy to use. Color came out great and vibrant, just washed out very easily after only a couple of shampoos.</li>
    <li> i have been using this hair dye for many years and i love it and never will change to any other hair dye besides special effects</li>
    <li> ordered it, I believe it took 3 days to arrive! I mixed it with some of my left over Blue Mayhem, also from special effects, and I fell in love!! it was a deep pink, almost a depth red. gradually, it&#x27;s faded, of course. but it&#x27;s fading into pink. really gorgeous pink. love this hair dye!! beware though, all of these SE hair dyes run in your shower, may color your tub for a little (comes off with a lil scrubbing) and your neck &amp; hands!! (comes off with soap!) but worth the color</li>
    <li> Looks amazing. I mixed it down with some conditioner to soften the brightness a bit, and it still looks incredibly even. Lasts longer and more evenly than Manic Panic or Punky Colour and I only used about a quarter of the bottle. It&#x27;s been in my hair for about three weeks now without fading AT ALL, and I haven&#x27;t done any maintenance. Other reviews and before/after pictures I saw suggested that it stays looking great for a couple months at a time. I am so impressed and happy I switched to this brand.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, already on my hair, great results, thanks for everything</li>
    <li> This product will give you pink hair - and a pink phone - and a pink pillow - and just about anything else that comes in contact with your fuchsia locks! Due to the size of molecules needed to turn hair pink or red, the shedding of color is unavoidable. I got this for my daughter and for the most part it was a success. We took the product to a professional for application, and it was cute - just messy!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good packaging. Was exactly what I wanted. Will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Special effects colors last up to 6 months if you use them properly. This produces an amazing color that beats any brand i have tried in the past 10 years including pravana.</li>
    <li> Definitely atomic, and even though it eventually fades slightly, has lasted two weeks. Even with daily pool swims. Highly recommend. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
