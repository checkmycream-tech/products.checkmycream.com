      <li>This lotion smells really good</li>
      <li>But this scent is light and fruity, perfect for summer!!!</li>
      <li>I moved out of state and missed the lotion, so I was really glad when I found them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
      <li>Scent: Light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>The lotion is really nice, smells great - a breath of fresh air.</li>
      <li>The price tag may seem steep, but quality is always superior to cheap products.</li>
      <li>Lanolin is able to soak into a deeper layer of skin.....</li>
      <li>The orginal is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE all of the Triple Lanolin lotion products.</li>

      <li>I received this product as a gift and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>anymore :)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>He was so glad to find this at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Overall, the best lotion I&#x27;ve used -- and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
      <li>Too greasy for me &amp; the fragrance was too strong, I returned it.</li>
      <li>I wait tables in huge sections and make literally hundreds of trips</li>
      <li>when transitioning from one task to another, honestly I probably wash my hands nearly as much as a doctor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I finally pulled the trigger after finding it here (of course) and it is just as amazing as I remembered!  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s a fair deal, especially when your skin becomes well-moisturized</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not constantly thirsty for more product.  </li>
      <li>Years and years ago I got a pedicure and was introduced to this lotion for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Five stars and a million thanks!  </li>
      <li>so glad I finally bought some!</li>
      <li>This is my second favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing or anything, but other people seem to like it.</li>
      <li>I work at a fast paced restaurant-</li>
      <li>Too much DOES feel greasy (I just tested it),</li>
      <li>and I think she probably used too much of this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, but find this to be the most beneficial for me.  </li>
      <li>customers, coworkers, family, friends, and boyfriend constantly comment on how soft and smooth my hands always are.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells beautiful, but can get a little too sticky and does not dry well on my skin (which is neither dry or oily).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless lotions, but this one is the first to make a real difference.</li>
      <li>and I live in Colorado.</li>
      <li>It has a light citrus scent but it&#x27;s not very strong after it&#x27;s rubbed in completely.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely required to wash my hands after each and every visit to the back of the house,</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the lotion, so 20 oz should last for months (depending on your usage).</li>
      <li>I had rough elbows and now are very soft.</li>

    <li> My daughter used this every time she takes a shower.  She loves this for her skin.</li>
    <li> The best lotion out there.  Try it.  Love it.  Be it.  Do it.  Rock it.  Move it.  Shake it.  Oh yeah.....</li>
    <li> Love the lotion but the pump came broken and is not useable :-(</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever. I had rough elbows and now are very soft.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion all the time for dry skin. It is also very good for after being in the sun.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! My previous nail salon always used this lotion on my feet and legs when I got pedis. I moved out of state and missed the lotion, so I was really glad when I found them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> My husband, who is a farmer, loves this for his overworked hands. He was so glad to find this at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Too greasy for me &amp; the fragrance was too strong, I returned it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way....it smells good too. The price tag may seem steep, but quality is always superior to cheap products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a compulsive hand-washer and I live in Colorado. Naturally, that&#x27;s not a good combination. Winters are especially hard, and I&#x27;d always end up with painfully cracked hands. I&#x27;ve tried countless lotions, but this one is the first to make a real difference. I can&#x27;t recall having any problems this past winter, since I always had some of this lotion around. Five stars and a million thanks!  Scent: Light and pleasant. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing or anything, but other people seem to like it. (I do NOT like the non-mango versions of this lotion.)  Texture: Soaks in quickly enough for me. One person complained about it feeling greasy, but she only uses Aveeno&#x27;s lotion (which does nothing for me) ... and I think she probably used too much of this one. Too much DOES feel greasy (I just tested it), so you might want to lighten up on the pump if you have problems.  Price: I buy mine at Sally&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cheaper. You don&#x27;t need much of the lotion, so 20 oz should last for months (depending on your usage). I think that&#x27;s a fair deal, especially when your skin becomes well-moisturized so it&#x27;s not constantly thirsty for more product.  Overall, the best lotion I&#x27;ve used -- and that&#x27;s saying a lot! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really good but my wife seemed to have some type if allergic reaction to it. Too bad because she liked it otherwise.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite lotions because of the lanolin. Lanolin is able to soak into a deeper layer of skin.....or so I was taught in cosmetology school. I believe it! It has a light citrus scent but it&#x27;s not very strong after it&#x27;s rubbed in completely. I put it on at night so it can work for hours because I wash my hands too often during the day.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful, but can get a little too sticky and does not dry well on my skin (which is neither dry or oily).</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift and fell in love with it.  I attempted to order this bottle but I received plain lotion .... not the Mango Vera lotion so I returned the item.  I was not given an option to exchange for the CORRECT ITEM.  Bummer for me.  The lotion is really nice, smells great - a breath of fresh air.</li>
    <li> I work at a fast paced restaurant- I mean F.A.S.T! I wait tables in huge sections and make literally hundreds of trips (I work 9-16 hour shifts) to the dishroom. I am absolutely required to wash my hands after each and every visit to the back of the house, when transitioning from one task to another, honestly I probably wash my hands nearly as much as a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;My hands always felt dry, despite my efforts with lotion. my nails would always crack and peel.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;This is the only lotion I use. I had several boutique lotions and even some hand crafted organic ones and this blows them all out of the water, in scent and moisture. I use it after showers, before bed, at work, you name it. The scent is a bonus as I am a total mango freak.&lt;br /&gt;My customers, coworkers, family, friends, and boyfriend constantly comment on how soft and smooth my hands always are.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, my local Sally&#x27;s sells it for less than $10!</li>
    <li> Years and years ago I got a pedicure and was introduced to this lotion for the first time.  I loved how moisturizing it was and the smell was amazing!  I wrote down the name always intending to buy it but I never found it in a store, and never got around to looking for it online.  I finally pulled the trigger after finding it here (of course) and it is just as amazing as I remembered!  A little goes a long way-- so glad I finally bought some!</li>
    <li> I LOVE all of the Triple Lanolin lotion products. This is my second favorite fragrance.  The orginal is my favorite.  But this scent is light and fruity, perfect for summer!!!</li>
    <li> This 20 oz. bottle is perfect to keep in the bathroom for personal use &amp; for guests to use while visiting.  I&#x27;ve tried other lotions, but find this to be the most beneficial for me.  I&#x27;ll never be without some.</li>
