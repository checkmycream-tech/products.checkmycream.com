      <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good solution to summer/beach/pool hair problem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is fairly meh.  </li>
      <li>It always gets the chlorine scent out of her hair and it smells so good too.</li>
      <li>really good for the kids</li>

      <li>product was amazing.  </li>

      <li>Smells nice too.</li>
      <li>I always have this soap handy during the summer for after the pool or the beach.</li>
      <li>Honestly, that&#x27;s what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>and it smells nice, but it stings</li>
      <li>Which has been just as effective, but not quite so drying.</li>
      <li>Nice citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like orange floor cleaner.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice orange fragrance to it.</li>
      <li>and this is as good as any and better then most.  </li>
      <li>but I can honestly say that I have never had such impressive results when skipping conditioner, and then after a swim in the pool to have those results is beyond amazing.</li>
      <li>Love how soft it comes out, plus it smells awesome.</li>
      <li>Works just fine!</li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it, and the results have been great.</li>
      <li>It seemed to work, and my sons enjoyed the orange smell.</li>
      <li>This one did not, so I was able to wash my hair with my contacts in.     </li>
      <li>It is a reasonable price and also works great for swimming as the product states.</li>
      <li>It works better if you lather it up and leave it on your hair for a minute or so before rinsing it off (the longer the better).</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a nice light orange scent.</li>
      <li>Could not be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo for getting the chlorine out of the grandkid&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>instead of using lemon juice as a more cost-effective solution, but I haven&#x27;t tried that one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a pack of three or more.  </li>
      <li>Another satisfied swimming customer who swims about 5 miles a week and needed to get rid of chlorine in the hair.</li>
      <li>Subscription brings an even greater bargain.</li>
      <li>It smells great and my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much damage.</li>
      <li>It removes chlorine and my hair seems getting better, I like it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone, kids, adults, its fabulous!</li>
      <li>This swim shampoo works better then</li>
      <li>My three year old granddaughter has the most beautiful curly blond hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on adult hair!</li>
      <li>It was even more tangled and out of control - she has a lot of hair, but it is fine hair.</li>
      <li>It has worked great for me (a kid of nearly 40).</li>
      <li>works fine</li>
      <li>My daughter said it is fine with her.  </li>
      <li>This is a great value, you couldn&#x27;t find a better deal in a brick and mortar store, if you were lucky enough to find this product there at all.</li>
      <li>Great smell ,very gentle and clean very well .My</li>
      <li>kids are love it!!!I am very recommended !!</li>
      <li>This worked great for us, especially since just putting in a pool.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, no stinging eyes, and my son loves the bottle so much he brought it to preschool to show his friends.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that this is the equivalent of a clarifying shampoo, which is great in the sense that it clarifies the chlorine out, but your hair will need a deep conditioning after use.</li>
      <li>It is so good on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair that I started using it myself, and am buying it again.</li>
      <li>At least it smells nice, a pleasant orange-y scent that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I could tell first use that it helped my boys hair, it wasn&#x27;t so frazzled :)</li>
      <li>Much better than many of the adult products for chlorine removal.</li>
      <li>This is gentle on children&#x27;s hair, and great for adult use as well.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light too, I find some of the other Loreal-Kids scents too strong but this one is subtle and fresh of citrus, very lovely, And for $2.50 with S&amp;S is just awesome.</li>
      <li>B001A4HL6G Redken Body Full Shampoo Shampooing</li>
      <li>I work as a swim instructor/lifeguard and tend to use this between really good de-chlorination shampooing with a different product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mild citrus scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a good kids&#x27; swim/sport shampoo, but for everyday, Suave 2 in 1s are much better.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d even use it in my own hair if I had blonde hair.</li>
      <li>We have continued to use this even in the winter because it cleans much better than &amp;#34;baby shampoo.&amp;#34;  After a day of bike riding his head gets sweaty and sandy and this completely pulls all the dirt out.  </li>
      <li>The plus is it rinses out well and leaves a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only concern is the 2-in-1 seems not quite right, I do have to use some conditioner if I want my hair to be smooth, but I won&#x27;t complain about this :)</li>
      <li>The price is right, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this and using a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that, it is a nice smelling, playfully packaged, mild shampoo.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had used this for swimming ages ago, saw it on here, loved the price, so I had  ordered some to coming in monthly and now I have a stock of them and great item.</li>
    <li> My kids have very blond hair and it gets green from pool water. This shampoo does nothing to remove the green color or to nourish their hairs which becomes dry and brittle from chlorine. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> The only product that worked on swim hair, when I swam daily in high school. Smells nice too. Plus, the bottle&#x27;s really cute, so how can you really go wrong here? Not just for kids. I still use the stuff as an adult.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a swimmers !!!Great smell ,very gentle and clean very well .My kids are love it!!!I am very recommended !!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this is still on the market! When I first started using this exact product, it was green colored, but now it&#x27;s clear. This is awesome. My eyes don&#x27;t burn when I get soap in it, smells like awesome watermelon, and gets all that chlorine out of your hair. AND LOOK AT THE PRICE, c&#x27;mon now!</li>
    <li> This does an OK job of getting chlorine out of my hair after swimming, but my hair is left dry and kind of frizzy. Even though it&#x27;s a 2-in-1, I still have to use a lot of conditioner afterwards. At least it smells nice, a pleasant orange-y scent that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> My seven-year-old swims a lot, and I found that regular clarifying shampoo was taking a toll on her hair. After reading so many positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it, and the results have been great. This shampoo helps to remove the chlorine and chlorine smell out of my daughter&#x27;s hair, and I also use the conditioner of the same brand. This is gentle on children&#x27;s hair, and great for adult use as well. My only complaint is that the products come in such small containers and run out quite fast.</li>
    <li> Since the product is labeled as \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and not as \\&quot;shampoo and conditioner\\&quot;, I assumed that the \\&quot;2 in 1\\&quot; referred to being gentle and removing chlorine (and not to any conditioning properties). These are the two things that this shampoo does well, plus it has a great citric smell. It is so good on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair that I started using it myself, and am buying it again. We both have dark brown straight, thin hair, shoulder length. The shampoo not only leaves our hair soft and with a nice smell, but adds a bit of volume too. To be mentioned is that I also use a conditioner or a detangler after the shampoo. If you buy this a shampoo, you will not be disappointed; but you will if you expect it to have conditioner properties.</li>
    <li> Seems to help with green but makes my daughter hair crisp and unbrushable even with conditioner</li>
    <li> We have a pool in our backyard so my toddler&#x27;s hair constantly gets exposed to the sun and chlorine and gets dried out. This shampoo really helps to remove the chlorine and moisturize his hair. A great value!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use at the beach and pool for my daughter who had medum length hair at the time. Although it smells great, her hair felt like it was stripped after the shower. It was even more tangled and out of control - she has a lot of hair, but it is fine hair. (which i&#x27;ve found with the other kids&#x27; L&#x27;Oreal hair products as well). I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good solution to summer/beach/pool hair problem. I have completed crossed off any L&#x27;Oreal kids products from my shopping list. I&#x27;m still looking for a good kids&#x27; swim/sport shampoo, but for everyday, Suave 2 in 1s are much better.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not wash off chlorine any better than any other shampoo. You&#x27;ll have to wash your kid&#x27;s hair like 3 times before the effects of pool water will be gone. Other than that, it is a nice smelling, playfully packaged, mild shampoo.</li>
    <li> Couple of the bottles got spilled. Should be packed a little better so it won&#x27;t move all over the place</li>
    <li> Works just fine! I should have done my homework though, because I found the same product at a local store for much cheaper. I&#x27;m bummed that I paid too much.</li>
    <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t bad: the smell is much stronger (smells like candy) than I am used to but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair. It washes out all the chlorine from the swimming pool, and my hair is relatively soft and manageable after using it (must use a conditioner though). It is also pretty reasonably priced. But the thing that I hateee is the packaging! This bottle leaks everytimee! I guess it&#x27;s because it is a \\&quot;snap closure\\&quot; so you can&#x27;t really tighten it. I will continue to finish this bottle but I will not be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I don&#x27;t know if the leaking problem is true for all bottles, or I just have a bad bottle. :(</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo after water aerobics, takes the chlorine out of my hair and swimsuit. The plus is it rinses out well and leaves a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo when I started swimming and my hair turned dry and straw-like. I did not know of any adult shampoos that helped with chlorine removal, so I used this and was surprised how well it worked. It is not a miracle product that made me look like I stepped out of a hair commercial, but it did remove chlorine better than other shampoos I had been using (pantene, matrix, john frieda) and made the conditioner I was using work better.    I also like that this is a gentle shampoo. I am past the days of tears when I get a little shampoo in my eyes, but some shampoos tend to bother my contacts. This one did not, so I was able to wash my hair with my contacts in.     I will definitely use this on my kids-when the time comes!</li>
    <li> I use this instead of more expensive chlorine removal shampoos. It&#x27;s great and smells good. After I use it I shampoo and condition like normal.</li>
    <li> We spend the summers on the beach and the kids swim every day. The kid&#x27;s blonde hair turns greenish and stiff from all the chlorine from the pool and salt from the ocean. One wash with this shampoo and it totally brought back their beautiful blonde hair. It worked better than a bottle I paid 3x as much for from one of the big online swimming websites. Can&#x27;t beat the add-on price!</li>
    <li> We had to stop using.  We tried this shampoo on my daughters hair a few times after being in the chlorinated pool, but it left their hair the same or maybe worse.  Their hair still felt like straw and was extremely hard to brush.  Luckily regular shampoo and my L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Conditioner worked wonders and brought their hair from straw to soft and silky.  I bought as an Add-on Item or else I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I have two children who are in pools, and the ocean a lot.  This shampoo gets any trace of that out and smells wonderful.  I even use it for my hair after swimming.</li>
    <li> Nice citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like orange floor cleaner.  My son swims a lot and has blonde hair.  After a week of using this his hair lost its green hue.  We have continued to use this even in the winter because it cleans much better than &amp;#34;baby shampoo.&amp;#34;  After a day of bike riding his head gets sweaty and sandy and this completely pulls all the dirt out.  I do recommend using conditioner along with this product.  My son doesn&#x27;t need a conditioner every day but this isn&#x27;t a 2-in-1 and his hair does get dry.</li>
    <li> I recently returned to swimming after a decade+ hiatus, and am swimming in a salt water pool. Most swim shampoos state that they combat the effects of chlorine, but very few mention salt water. This one did, so I ignored the marketing toward kids and tried it. The end result: it works great against salt water, even on grown-ups. The &amp;#34;2 in 1&amp;#34; note on the label is not meant to imply &amp;#34;shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I believe it is meant to imply that it tackles both chlorine and salt water. If you typically use a conditioner after shampooing, my bet is that you will still need a separate conditioner. I&#x27;m using this in combination with Matrix Biolage conditioning balm, and my hair is nearly as soft as it was before I started swimming. (I spend about 5 hours per week in the salt water, with a swim cap). The scent is not childish. It&#x27;s a mild citrus scent. Nothing but the packaging screams &amp;#34;kids!&amp;#34; about this product. It has worked great for me (a kid of nearly 40).</li>
    <li> This shampoo is gentle enough to use daily  and smells pretty good. I like to use this to keep my hair softer and cleaner.  I work as a swim instructor/lifeguard and tend to use this between really good de-chlorination shampooing with a different product.</li>
    <li> While pleasant in every way this shampoo-conditioner combo does not wash out all the chlorine out if my son&#x27;s hair. He swims only twice a week but his hair, naturally soft, gets very rough after chlorine and this shampoo made only a minor difference. The chlorine smell is still there even after doing 2 washes with this shampoo. I actually found another combo (organic coconut based) that does not make a marketing claim as far as chlorine goes yet leaves hair much softer and better smelling than this. Will not purchase again, sorry</li>
    <li> This price is for ONE bottle.  I thought it would be a pack of three or more.  So disappointed in this seller.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the smell of the shampoo.  It works on her hair, not perfect, but better than the regular shampoo.  She used it with the other after swim conditioner though.</li>
    <li> I have always had great luck with this shampoo. I swim twice a week and after suffering from chlorine buildup, just one wash with this shampoo and my hair felt soft and chlorine free again. I keep it in my gym bag so I can use it after every swim.</li>
    <li> Although it was shrink wrapped, but it was still leaking in the shipping box, almost half of the bottle was out when I receive it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after the pool.  I also use it to dechlorinate my swim suit.&lt;br /&gt;One slight nag is that if the bottle is not upright in my workout bag it appears to leak a little.</li>
    <li> This product works well and smells great. I think I&#x27;d even use it in my own hair if I had blonde hair. My daughter loved using it!</li>
    <li> I could tell first use that it helped my boys hair, it wasn&#x27;t so frazzled :)</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in the pool (triathlete) and I can honestly state that this product is the very best for getting the chlorine out of my hair and I also use it as a shower gel - my skin does not smell like a pool afterward. Could not be more pleased. And believe me when I indicate that I have tried all the products out there!!!!! The fact that it&#x27;s tear-free is a big plus!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I am no kid, but I swim a lot and the chlorine does a number on my hair!  This shampoo with its &amp;#34;Sunny Orange&amp;#34; scent is great, gets the chlorine out, saves my hair!  I highly recommend.  Also, a much cheaper option than most other chlorine removal shampoos!</li>
    <li> I have tried about every brand of swim shampoo there is (I swim laps 6 days a week) and this is as good as any and better then most.  I do use a much stronger conditioner most days as I have extremely dry very curly hair, but no other shampoo I have used is better at removing chlorine then this one, and it is so cheap.</li>
    <li> I have asthma.  The second I&#x27;m done in the pool, I want the chlorine OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fairly meh.  The price is right, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this and using a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal remedy for chlorine is to pour lemon or apple juice over myself in the shower.  Yes, I know that&#x27;s weird.  I don&#x27;t care.  It works:  the acid in lemon or apple juice combines with the chlorine base to form a harmless salt.  If you read the ingredients on any \\&quot;chlorine removal\\&quot; bath product, you&#x27;ll find citric acid in there and a bunch of moisturizers to compensate for what the pool does to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard people purchase pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid?) instead of using lemon juice as a more cost-effective solution, but I haven&#x27;t tried that one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not likely to buy this again.  To me, it&#x27;s just another shampoo.</li>
    <li> My 11 year-old daughter has been having knots in her hair for a long time and we finally found a solution with this shampoo!  She now runs a comb down her hair while using this shampoo and it works like charm!</li>
    <li> I am a diver so I am constantly getting chlorine in my hair. I bought this shampoo to use because I remembered how it worked miracles when I was a kid. It smells great and my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much damage. It may say L&#x27;Oreal Kids but I&#x27;d recommend it for all ages.</li>
    <li> This is the only swimmer&#x27;s shampoo that I have found to get the green tint out of my daughters super blonde hair.  We both like the orange scent, and her hair feels pretty soft if we use this as a 2-in-1 and skip the conditioner.  I wish it came in a larger bottle, as I have yet to find it in stores, but I will have this on hand every summer from now on.</li>
    <li> Works great on adult hair! Use this product for beach and pool and I have no problems with my hair.  Love how soft it comes out, plus it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> It works on my daughter &#x27; s hair. She uses it after swimming, it makes her hair very very shinny and smoothly , no more chlorine scent</li>
    <li> Having tried other swim shampoos this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only it is considerably less expensive than the competition, but it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore it can be used day-to-day even if you are not just finishing a pool set.</li>
    <li> This swim shampoo works better then some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It actually lathers up real well without having to use a whole lot.  I&#x27;ve used other swim shampoos where I had to use a lot more to even get a decent lather.  Works great on kids and adults.</li>
    <li> It removes chlorine and my hair seems getting better, I like it!&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is the 2-in-1 seems not quite right, I do have to use some conditioner if I want my hair to be smooth, but I won&#x27;t complain about this :)</li>
    <li> It did not take the green out of my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came shrink-wrapped to ensure it didn&#x27;t leak in transit.</li>
    <li> works fine but it smells like Dawn dish soap. Not a very good smell for kids shampoo and body wash. My son likes it but that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s blue and it&#x27;s his own.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Product exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! This is a great alternative to UltraSwim [[ASIN:B000052Y0S UltraSwim Chlorine Removal Shampoo, 7 fl oz (207 ml)]] value wise. You get 2 more ounces with the L&#x27;Oreal kids for 3 dollars less. I am adult and use this product for myself after swimming. It is not a 2-in-1 in the shampoo/conditioner sense. I&#x27;ve found that this is the equivalent of a clarifying shampoo, which is great in the sense that it clarifies the chlorine out, but your hair will need a deep conditioning after use. I have found the product is strong enough that I mix it half and half with my favorite shampoo,[[ASIN:B001A4HL6G Redken Body Full Shampoo Shampooing For  Fine/Flat Hair, 33.8-ounce]] . Which has been just as effective, but not quite so drying. The L&#x27;oreal kids shampoo smells great, as others have noted. Its not a syrupy or overly noxious scent that you&#x27;d expect from a kid&#x27;s shampoo. This is a great value, you couldn&#x27;t find a better deal in a brick and mortar store, if you were lucky enough to find this product there at all. Subscription brings an even greater bargain. Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I thought I would try out this out because it was so cheap before trying more expensive swim shampoos and I am SO glad I did! I actually thought it was a 2in1 when I bought it so when I first tried it after a swim I didnt have conditioner on hand and I was worried my hair would be a tangley mess after, but as I lathered up I was surprised at how silky my hair was feeling but I immediately put it up in a ponytail after anyway because I was sure it would look terrible having not been conditioned. A few hours later I took my ponytail out and WOW, my hair was so shiny and silky! I still needed to put some ojon oil in it but I can honestly say that I have never had such impressive results when skipping conditioner, and then after a swim in the pool to have those results is beyond amazing. I would recommend this to anyone, kids, adults, its fabulous! The scent is nice and light too, I find some of the other Loreal-Kids scents too strong but this one is subtle and fresh of citrus, very lovely, And for $2.50 with S&amp;S is just awesome. Very happy and this will always be in my gym/swim bag from now on!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  No more tears plus removes chlorine very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter said it is fine with her.  I tried myself based on several reviewer&#x27;s comments for adult use.  It didn&#x27;t work.  My hair became very sticky after use.  I stick to &amp;#34;UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> We live in Florida and my 3 year old is a fish by heart. I always have this soap handy during the summer for after the pool or the beach. It always gets the chlorine scent out of her hair and it smells so good too. Her hair is left shiny after and is not dried out.</li>
    <li> Purchased online as the local stores stopped carrying.  My daughter has blonde hair, and without this shampoo, her hair would turn green after swimming.  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> It is not good enough for us, but good for every day used</li>
    <li> really good for the kids</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thin liquid so it practically falls out when you tip it over, and I&#x27;m not sure how well it actually cleans and cares for swimmer&#x27;s hair. At least, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with the kids.</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair nice and shiny after a swim and not feeling so dried out.</li>
    <li> Another satisfied swimming customer who swims about 5 miles a week and needed to get rid of chlorine in the hair.</li>
    <li> Had tried another product for post-swim &amp;#34;haystack hair&amp;#34; and we prefer this one.  Nice smell, no stinging eyes, and my son loves the bottle so much he brought it to preschool to show his friends.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for getting the chlorine out of the grandkid&#x27;s hair. It is much less expensive on a couple of other sites which is the reason I do not give it five stars here.</li>
    <li> Honestly, that&#x27;s what I bought it for. I&#x27;m not worried about my hair drying out from the chlorine as I have an insider in the salon business. This is intended to be used in addition with a conditioner..</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my daughter was swimming everyday at her babysitter&#x27;s house this summer and her hair was getting a green tent.  I think it helped get the green out and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is the best chlorine or swimming shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  We got it for the kids but I soon started to get it for my husband and I to use after swimming laps because it made a huge difference in our hair actually getting clean without stripping it beyond belief.</li>
    <li> Great! Leaves my daughters&#x27; hair feeling soft and keeps the green away</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most shampoos, including unfortunately l&#x27;oreal shampoo for adults. This is one of the very few shampoo options that I have found that: works, smells nice (and not overpoweringly sweet), doesnt make my head/ears/neck itch. It is a reasonable price and also works great for swimming as the product states. Whenever i find it, I buy 3-4 just because I worry about it going out of stock.</li>
    <li> I generally prefer organic products for my kids, but we used this to get the chlorine out. It seemed to work, and my sons enjoyed the orange smell. I would purchase it again, if I can&#x27;t find a more natural product next summer.</li>
    <li> This worked great for us, especially since just putting in a pool. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it doesn&#x27;t stink by any means either. It suds up great and best of all is gentle on my childrens eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think it gets the chlorine out</li>
    <li> My three year old granddaughter has the most beautiful curly blond hair. We swim almost daily and her hair turns green quickly from the chlorine. We were using vinegar to get it out but she hated the smell. We used this one time and her hair is soft and golden again. We will be using this from now on. It has a nice orange fragrance to it. Notice though that the pricing is odd. The cost is $3.19 for a single, add on item but $5.63 each bottle if you buy it in the three pack, which is Prime.</li>
    <li> My daughter used it for shower after the swim practice and it leaked badly that the plastic bag for holding the shampoo bottle was soaked with shampoo. It happened to another product I bought from the store. Don&#x27;t know why it is like that!</li>
    <li> I Have not had time to use this but it seems nice are smells GREAT the bottle is a lot smaller than in the pic</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice light orange scent. It leaves my children&#x27;s hair soft and clean after swim class.  But I found it was much better priced at my local grocery store.</li>
    <li> perfect for summer swimmers, good on all hair</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping and a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult that purchased this product for myself.  I have long hair that tends to retain odors very easily. As a swimmer, this makes chlorine a never ending battle.  I&#x27;ve tried Ultraswim and other products and haven&#x27;t had the greatest luck removing the heavy chlorine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was amazing.  Like other reviewers, I found it to be more of a clarifying product but it immediately removed the odor from my hair and left it softer and more manageable than my typical expensive salon brand.  I&#x27;ll also mention that I color my hair and haven&#x27;t noticed any dulling or fading of my color using this.  I&#x27;ve continued to use this after swimming, work outs, exposure to camp fires, etc and it removes odors from my porous hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that said, the price on Amazon is incredibly high.  Do some research and you can find it at other major online stores for under HALF of what Amazon is charging.  No idea why it&#x27;s so over priced here, but I will buy it elsewhere in the future.</li>
    <li> Left hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Gets the chlorine right out of my hair and leaves it feeling soft. Much better than many of the adult products for chlorine removal.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this shampoo, but this product dissappeared from the shelves some years ago (I live in Mexico City). So when I recently traveled to Texas, I decided to buy some bottles and remembered why I love this shampoo. I swim 4-5 times a week and it removes all chlorine smell on my hair unlike conventional shampoos. It also leaves my hair very soft and untangled like no other shampoo, I don&#x27;t even use conditioner after it. I really haven&#x27;t bought other shampoos for swimmers, but the benefit-cost of this one really convinces me.&lt;br /&gt;Probably next time I&#x27;ll buy the double.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and would buy again, but the shipper was awful. Received the package in a plastic bag because the bottle opened in transit and ruined the envelope. The bottle arrived half empty and was a slimy mess. Waste of money since lost so much of the shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a good deal, when you consider all the fancy, expensive chlorine-removing shampoos.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on them.  Buy this one instead.  It works better if you lather it up and leave it on your hair for a minute or so before rinsing it off (the longer the better).</li>
    <li> I bought it for my young daughter to use after her swim lessons. She is blond and it helps maintain her natural hair color and it smells nice, but it stings, I have to treat it as a shampoo for adults and make sure she keeps her eyes closed all the time.</li>
    <li> I normally wash my daughter&#x27;s hair with conditioner only to prevent tangles (suave--it has to be free from dimethicone or other silicone to work, so the cheaper conditioner the better). After a week of daily swim lessons, her hair needed something to strip the chlorine. (It was sticky and brittle). We conditioned well afterward, and didn&#x27;t have a problem with tangles. As a result, we&#x27;ll continue to use it after swim.</li>
