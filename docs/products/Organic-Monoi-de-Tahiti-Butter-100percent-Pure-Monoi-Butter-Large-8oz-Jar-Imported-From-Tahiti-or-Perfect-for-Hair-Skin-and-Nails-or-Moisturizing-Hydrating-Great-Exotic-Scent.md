      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many people ask what fragrance I am wearing.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing - just like fresh flowers, without being cloying!  </li>
      <li>I love the smooth and creamy texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;monoi&amp;#34; products and would have to say this one is the best in body butter form.</li>
      <li>the scent was too strong for me.</li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
      <li>I love this creamy sweet smelling butter.</li>
      <li>Great scent, I further dilute with coconut oil</li>

      <li>The scent takes me back to Hawaii and it makes my dry skin feel so good.</li>
      <li>....I haven&#x27;t used it yet, however quite certain it will be very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected.</li>
      <li>It really smells like a flower.......will definitely be putting this on constant rotation.....Peace :-)</li>
      <li>It also really moisturizer my face really well and made my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I am currently using organic cold pressed coconut oil and sweet almond oil on my hair and body so, this CREME should turn out to be even more of a treat for my skin.!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so soft and I am 62 spent my younger life in the sun, my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>You only need a little because it spreads very well.</li>
