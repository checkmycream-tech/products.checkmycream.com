### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product and great service from vendor.</li>
      <li>It has immediate effect and looks good under makeup.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with using retinol cream which more effective and lower price .</li>
      <li>all these fancy creams sound good, but I find oil of olay items work much better...</li>
      <li>Maybe others have had better results, but after hearing my wife mention that she wanted to try this I bought it for her.</li>
      <li>I love the scent</li>
      <li>I was able to find it cheaper elsewhere</li>
      <li>One of my favorite and most valuable face and neck products.</li>
      <li>Should have known better.</li>
      <li>Guess I would have been better off with a face cream.</li>
      <li>and I sure don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
      <li>This instantly became one of my favorite products and is fits in beautifully between my serum and my moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use somewhat gratifying</li>
      <li>It is not a replacement for moisturizer, but is a nice spot-treatment boost to control fine lines, prevent them from becoming deeper, and improve deep lines already in place.</li>
      <li>If this product were more reasonably priced, I would rate it higher, but for the money and the amount you get for your money, you&#x27;re better off heading to Target to pick something else up.</li>
      <li>product really does smooth fine lines.</li>
      <li>Be sure to get this particular Crease Release cream, the one with GABA &amp; 3-D Lift.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the one star I had to give it.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
      <li>After two weeks I don&#x27;t see much change.</li>
      <li>None of the creams really worked - and I tried dozens of them...</li>
      <li>I bought this for a friend and she loves so much I had to put it in my calender</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant minty smell, but does not make big creases less noticible.</li>
      <li>but I do use it every morning, along with many other products</li>
      <li>I had high expectations for this product but after 2-3 months nothing really changed.</li>
      <li>But this stuff works miracles on my laugh lines, the little crevice between my brows, and some fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Overall, no ongoing lasting improvement and probably not doing anything more than any Olay or Neutrogena off the shelf face product couldn&#x27;t also do.</li>
      <li>I was anxious to receive this as I like several of his products, This looked good when applied, but within the hour the effect was gone.</li>
      <li>The cream is nice and thick.</li>
      <li>I had to keep some heavy cream on me at all times, and apply it every couple hours to smooth those wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Did not have much expectations thinking that being in my mid fifties, the only way to get read of this type of wrinkles is plastic surgery.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s continued to use it twice daily for a few weeks and results appear to be most apparent immediately following use and a short time afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d estimate the effects to last a few hours; even half a day would be nice.</li>
      <li>The spot that was all creased and loose for at least 5-6 years is tight and smooth like it belongs to a very young body!</li>

<li> They get worse when I lose weight, but ultimately they are there always.</li>
<li> and when I run out of it after a week or so, I can see the small lines</li>
<li> and she was pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> This morning, the first look in the mirror stunned me - my ugly wrinkles were gone!</li>
<li> This was an expensive purchase for nothing.</li>
<li> Allergic to this product, sorry.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> I have quite nasty vertical grid of wrinkles under my chin for years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to use somewhat gratifying</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves so much I had to put it in my calender so I don&#x27;t forget to reorder it before she runs out! Great product and great service from vendor.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;m starting to develop a skin regimen.  This instantly became one of my favorite products and is fits in beautifully between my serum and my moisturizer.  It has immediate effect and looks good under makeup.  No pilling!  It is not a replacement for moisturizer, but is a nice spot-treatment boost to control fine lines, prevent them from becoming deeper, and improve deep lines already in place.</li>
    <li> Save your  money...all these fancy creams sound good, but I find oil of olay items work much better...save your money...</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but from the first time I tried it I was sold on the product. I will continue using it forever.</li>
    <li> Maybe others have had better results, but after hearing my wife mention that she wanted to try this I bought it for her. She&#x27;s continued to use it twice daily for a few weeks and results appear to be most apparent immediately following use and a short time afterwards. Overall, no ongoing lasting improvement and probably not doing anything more than any Olay or Neutrogena off the shelf face product couldn&#x27;t also do. If this product were more reasonably priced, I would rate it higher, but for the money and the amount you get for your money, you&#x27;re better off heading to Target to pick something else up.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Should have known better. Save your money.  Doesn&#x27;t make any difference at all.  This was an expensive purchase for nothing.</li>
    <li> Allergic to this product, sorry.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to receive this as I like several of his products, This looked good when applied, but within the hour the effect was gone.I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and when I run out of it after a week or so, I can see the small lines resurfacing.&lt;br /&gt;This product really does smooth fine lines.</li>
    <li> I have quite nasty vertical grid of wrinkles under my chin for years. They get worse when I lose weight, but ultimately they are there always. I had to keep some heavy cream on me at all times, and apply it every couple hours to smooth those wrinkles. None of the creams really worked - and I tried dozens of them...&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Dr.Brandt crease release just because I never used this one before. Did not have much expectations thinking that being in my mid fifties, the only way to get read of this type of wrinkles is plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday. I applied it last night before going to bed. This morning, the first look in the mirror stunned me - my ugly wrinkles were gone! The spot that was all creased and loose for at least 5-6 years is tight and smooth like it belongs to a very young body!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product but after 2-3 months nothing really changed. Guess I would have been better off with a face cream. Not worth the money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the one star I had to give it.&lt;br /&gt;Save you money.  This product just doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> The cream is nice and thick. Has a pleasant minty smell, but does not make big creases less noticible. I think a few smaller wrinkles on my forehead lessened, but I am 62 and I suppose I was asking for a miracle!</li>
    <li> Have slight lines along side chin and hoped this crease release creme would be the solution but it&#x27;s not as advertised. So disappointe4d!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite and most valuable face and neck products. I was able to find it cheaper elsewhere but I do use it every morning, along with many other products and I sure don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t show any visible results for me.</li>
    <li> I love the scent but i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;ve noticed any difference since using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! My two complaints: the effects don&#x27;t last long enough, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on really deep wrinkles. I&#x27;d estimate the effects to last a few hours; even half a day would be nice. So I usually only use this for going out at night or meeting up with friends rather than daily, going to work, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the cream for my mom, and it had zero effect on her and she was pretty disappointed. For extremely deep wrinkles, I think it requires a needle and an office visit instead of any brand of cream. But this stuff works miracles on my laugh lines, the little crevice between my brows, and some fine lines around my eyes. Be sure to get this particular Crease Release cream, the one with GABA &amp; 3-D Lift. (There&#x27;s another Crease Release that doesn&#x27;t have those features.) Another plus: it only requires a little bit to use, so a jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and there wasn&#x27;t any improvement . I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money . I&#x27;ll stick with using retinol cream which more effective and lower price .</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to get a total review.  After two weeks I don&#x27;t see much change.</li>
