      <li>I am excited to see the improvements as time goes on.</li>
      <li>This product is affordable in comparison to products purchased in local stores and a portion of the cost of &amp;#34;the most effective products&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love it for the large blackheads I get on my nose.</li>
      <li>My only word to the wise is if you plan on applying before bed, know that it might leave bleach-like stains on your sheets.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for two full months now.  </li>
      <li>and that is true.</li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had mild acne ever since I turned 15 up to now</li>
      <li>I use the charcoal soap to clean my face first</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>My skin is getting so clear, better than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
      <li>After beginning to use this product I am having MUCH clearer skin and feel more confident overall because of it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve finally found a product that honestly works.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment....</li>
      <li>I have struggled with adult acne for many years.</li>
      <li>the best of all is that I don&#x27;t  feel my skin too dry like with other acne products...</li>
      <li>The Acne Control Solution has worked its magic on the few pimples I get throughout the month (mostly hormonal).</li>

      <li>Nothing has consistently worked for me, and I have kind of just accepted rough looking skin.  </li>
      <li>do I have to lose.&amp;#34; I ordered my first bottle in Jan of 2014.</li>
      <li>top infomercial brands, medical spa lines, home remedies...even laser treatments (at hundreds of dollars per treatment).  </li>
      <li>skincare routine is much more simple now.</li>
      <li>For sure I&#x27;m going to continue using this product; finally found something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this before bed and first thing in the morning, its doing the job without drying out the rest of my skin too...</li>
      <li>I will tell you that I noticed a difference in the first week.</li>
      <li>At first it did overdry my skin a bit</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this product, please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
      <li>, the drying associated with using benzoyl peroxide is less prominent in this product, which is a HUGE plus</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money for yet another product to clutter my bathroom shelf, but after reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to chance it.</li>
      <li>When I do get a blemish it doesn&#x27;t last near as long and my skin honestly gets better with each passing week.</li>
      <li>I found this product after developing stubborn adult acne and have used it everyday since then because I&#x27;ve been consistently thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>and wow it really did the trick!!</li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>This product really does treat your skin, not just your acne.  </li>
      <li>I worried that my skin would be oily and my makeup would smear, but have not had any problems with that, much to my surprise.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent tons of money trying to find a magic cream or cure for my skin break outs.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much either.</li>
      <li>I really am truly grateful to have found this product, and recommend it to my friends.</li>
      <li>After using for about a month or has really helped my skin.</li>
      <li>Love it so far and have only been using it a couple of months.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have many acne issues as a teen but now as a 19 and 20 year old</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin clear without overdrying and I love that they use only 13 ingredients and there are no parabens, sulfates, added fragrances, antibiotics, or phthalates.</li>
      <li>I still have 2 and a half months to go as the instructions state, but am very satisfied thus far.</li>
      <li>I am also very pleased with how long a bottle lasts (something other reviewers haven&#x27;t really stated...).  </li>
      <li>What they provide is a grown-up solution to what many believe is only a teenage problem.  </li>
      <li>I have struggled with acne since I was in high school and from there it followed me to college.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had a great complexion when I was younger, and I thought I was one of the lucky ones.  Not so much.  After I turned 30, I started to get acne.  I tried everything to combat it, but most products ended up drying out my skin and causing more breakouts.  When I say I tried everything, I did:  top infomercial brands, medical spa lines, home remedies...even laser treatments (at hundreds of dollars per treatment).  Nothing worked.  I stumbled across Arithmetic, and was impressed - not only with the product pricing, but - with the sensibility of it all.  They didn&#x27;t promise miracles.  They didn&#x27;t promise instant satisfaction.  They promised to give you the tools to break the cycle.  Not just the acne cycle, but the bogus product/remedy cycle, as well.  What they offer is a process with a product to support it.  What they provide is a grown-up solution to what many believe is only a teenage problem.  What they deliver is the confidence to look in the mirror each morning without fearing what you will see.  No smoke.  No mirrors.  Hallelujah for common sense in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with adult acne for many years. I have tried every acne treatment on the market; Proactiv, Murad, Acne Free, Peter Thomas Roth, Dermadoctor, etc. The list goes on and on! Frustrated, I conceded to the fact that this was just the way my face would be for the rest of my life. By accident, I stumbled upon the Arithmetic and figured, &amp;#34;what do I have to lose.&amp;#34; I ordered my first bottle in Jan of 2014. Within a matter of weeks, I saw an incredible improvement in my skin, especially my jaw line. Within a months time, my acne was gone! The best part about it is that I&#x27;ve had clear skin since then. It&#x27;s all to the credit of the acne control complex. I am constantly getting compliments on my skin...something that took a while to get used to. I will forever tell others about this amazing product and I will forever be a user/fan of your line! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I never had a acne problem until I was in my early 20&#x27;s. I tried proactive, Clinique, and a ton of other name brand acne brands. They worked temporarily and stopped. After reading many reviews I gave arithmetic a chance. I have been using the acne control complex with cetaphil face wash for well over a year. Let&#x27;s just say I love it.  I still get the occasional breakout but the clear up right away. I use it twice a day and if I break out I use a little extra as a spot treatment. Arithmetic and a healthy diet has made my face look better then ever. This product rocks, give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have battled acne for over 15 years.  I have tried pretty much all brands of over the counter topical and face wash/scrub treatments, along with visiting multiple dermatologists for antibiotics and prescription strength medications.  Nothing has consistently worked for me, and I have kind of just accepted rough looking skin.  I came across Arithmetic late last year, and it has been a big difference maker.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face, and I have avoided any significant breakouts since using it.  I am also very pleased with how long a bottle lasts (something other reviewers haven&#x27;t really stated...).  If you have tried all other products to no avail, don&#x27;t give up but rather give this one a go.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now and and just purchased a second bottle even though I am not out of the first bottle yet! I didn&#x27;t have many acne issues as a teen but now as a 19 and 20 year old I started getting breakouts. After beginning to use this product I am having MUCH clearer skin and feel more confident overall because of it. I recommend this product to anyone with acne issues!</li>
    <li> Using it for a little over 2 months and I love it. Nothing has worked better on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago directly from Arithmetic because I started to break out like crazy and nothing was working. I waslooking for a product that could work and while I was reading a review for  another product, Arithmetic was mentioned so I went to their website and decided to try it.  My face feels awesome, its soft, and it does not get as oily as it used to get, andis clearing up. a little goes a long way. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s by far he best topical acne product I&#x27;ve used to date. It keeps my skin clear without overdrying and I love that they use only 13 ingredients and there are no parabens, sulfates, added fragrances, antibiotics, or phthalates. It&#x27;s a high quality acne product that works great and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Last year I was suffering from acne pretty bad (for me) and I was struggling to control it.  I&#x27;m in my 30s and it was driving me crazy!  A friend suggested this and I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  IT WORKS!  I love it!  It&#x27;s kind of expensive and a small bottle but it really goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and have only had to buy two bottles.  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had mild acne ever since I turned 15 up to now (I&#x27;m 23 now) and have tried a wide variety of products for 2-3 months (proactive, acne free, various salicylic acid face washes, etc) before changing my regime. I happened to stumble upon this and charcoal soaps online...and wow it really did the trick!! I went from a few zits per week to practically none. Keep in mind that I use this in combination with Bamboo Charcoal Soap (also sold here on amazon). I use the charcoal soap to clean my face first and then I apply the arithmetic acne control complex...so I&#x27;m not sure which product is doing the trick but I sure as hell know my acne is gone! For sure I&#x27;m going to continue using this product; finally found something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*been using this product for 2 months now&lt;br /&gt;*Also, the drying associated with using benzoyl peroxide is less prominent in this product, which is a HUGE plus</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent tons of money trying to find a magic cream or cure for my skin break outs. And since I&#x27;m now in my early 40&#x27;s, that is a lot of years and a lot of money spent on stuff that really hasn&#x27;t worked! BUT, enter Arithmetic Acne Control Complex and I&#x27;ve finally found a product that honestly works. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for two months now and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or monthly flareups like I normally do. I go to yoga without any cover up and feel like my skin is glowing from the inside out. You don&#x27;t have to use much either. I take just a small couple of drops a day to add on top of my normal cleansing, serum, and moisturizer. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and would recommend for anyone looking to control breakouts in their skin. A little bit goes a long way - and for me, that means no more being too embarrassed to go out because of a pimple. And if you are a little bit older and having trouble finding a product that isn&#x27;t designed for a teenager dealing with acne, this product is gentle enough not to irritate sensitive skin to be used daily.</li>
    <li> In my teen years, acne was not an issue. But now in my 30s it has become a frustrating problem. I have tried multiple products and this is the first product where ive seen results! Love it so far and have only been using it a couple of months. It is also great for my sensitive skin. I have had no reactions. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Satisfied 1st time customer: I didn&#x27;t have acne as a teenager or in my early-mid 20&#x27;s. However, in the last few years I have struggle with acne and persistent breakouts; possibly due to Celiac&#x27;s Disease. None, the less antibiotics made me sick and nowadays are not an option due to possible pregnancy. The creams doctors prescribe are so harsh on your skin and cause burning and major flaky dry skin. I was at the end of my rope and found this product. I have used it for 3 weeks now and a lot of the breakouts have calmed down and the redness is beginning to fade. I still have 2 and a half months to go as the instructions state, but am very satisfied thus far. The product is very gentle and hasn&#x27;t caused any dryness or rashes. I am excited to see the improvements as time goes on. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s gentile yet very effective! I love it for the large blackheads I get on my nose. Totally gets rid of them. I&#x27;ll never be without this product again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Arithmetic for about a year now and it has made a huge difference in my complexion! I didn&#x27;t really have much acne until a few years ago (besides as a teen) and when you&#x27;re in your 30s it&#x27;s not fun! Arithmetic is really the only thing I have found that makes my skin calm down. I do still get a little bit of acne occasionally but it&#x27;s mostly when I forget to use it (or run out!). I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is having difficulty controlling their acne. The best part I think besides controlling acne is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. Most other products really dry out your skin but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Arithmetic.</li>
    <li> I found this product after developing stubborn adult acne and have used it everyday since then because I&#x27;ve been consistently thrilled with the results! My only word to the wise is if you plan on applying before bed, know that it might leave bleach-like stains on your sheets.</li>
    <li> After using for about a month or has really helped my skin. I am 25 and was still getting breakouts regularly. This product has helped reduce that greatly as well as soothe my skin. At first it did overdry my skin a bit so I reduced the frequency of use and wore a moisturizer over the lotion.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t worry about acne at all until age 30 and then my face went crazy. I have litterly tried everything but had not found anything that I was truly happy with so I kept looking. When I came across this little gem, I figured why not try this too. I will tell you that I noticed a difference in the first week. It wasn&#x27;t drastic, but it was something. I have been using this product now for about 2 months and am half way through the bottle. It does say, noticeable results the longer you use and that is true. My face is not 100% better but it is about 75%. The breakouts I do get now, are small compared to before. It also says that this product may dry out your skin. I use it twice a day (morning and night, after I tone and before I moisturize) and I have noticed any dryness what so ever. A little goes a long way. I plan on reordering this product soon, since I do not want to run out. I look forward to continuing to use this product to see in another couple of months where I am then. I recommend anyone who is tired of trying products that don&#x27;t work to try this.</li>
    <li> I was at the end of my rope with my skin when I stumbled upon an Forbes.com article on the Arithmetic skincare line. I was excited to try it for the amazing price point &amp; that it&#x27;s from my beloved city, SF.&lt;br /&gt;I use it religiously 2x a day and have seen dramatic results 1 month in. I love this product. My skin is remarkably clearer! I will recommend to all my family and friends who also suffer from skin issues. (Thank goodness I read that article!)</li>
    <li> This acne product is a total game changer in combating adult acne.  I&#x27;ve taken Arithmetic for a little over a year now, and my skin has transformed from completely unhealthy and unbalanced to cleared and controlled.  This product really does treat your skin, not just your acne.  It&#x27;s completely balanced out my oil production, my redness and irritation is at bay, and when I do occasionally break out due to hormones it&#x27;s very minimal compared to the years I struggled with constant long-lived break outs.  Another perk...your skin doesn&#x27;t get worse before it gets better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two full months now.  I am VERY happy with the results so far and can not wait to get to the three month recommended mark to see what my skin will look like then.  I have dealt with acne my entire life and now as a 39 year old it seems to be worse than when I was a teenager.  I have also spent a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work or make my acne worse.  This product show immediate results.  It also has a nice clean smell to it!</li>
    <li> After giving up hope that I&#x27;d find an over the counter product to tame my skin (which was perfect as a teen but went crazy in my 20&#x27;s), I came across Arithmetic randomly online and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it almost a month and the difference is amazing! My skin is getting so clear, better than it&#x27;s been in years. When I do get a blemish it doesn&#x27;t last near as long and my skin honestly gets better with each passing week. I also love that it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. Some products burn and turn my skin red and dry, but this hasn&#x27;t had any negative side effects. Thank you so much for this product, please don&#x27;t stop making it! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.  I am on my 4th bottle!  I have struggled with acne since I was in high school and from there it followed me to college.  I am now 25 years old and still struggle with it daily.  I have been looking for an adult acne solution for the past few years and struck gold with Arithmetic!  It also smells wonderful, my boyfriend loves it.  I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year... Before, I would use everything I could find from all the big name brand products that you&#x27;ll find at Walgreens or Target. Even then I would constantly get pimples in my usual hot spots. Once I started using Arithmetic daily, that all stopped. I&#x27;ll still have an occasional pimple, but it&#x27;s usually because I worked out and didn&#x27;t clean up right away or from lack of sleep, stress etc.  My skin has never felt better, honestly. It just feels healthier with this product. Never get that dried out feeling because of the tea tree oil used in this product. Never any excessive redness.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to several people and I highly recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I suffer from PCOS and NOTHING has worked to keep the acne/post acne marks at bay. Do I still have acne? Yes. However, this cream makes the breakouts not as red and helps to make them go away quicker. If you aren&#x27;t like me and don&#x27;t suffer from this condition then your acne may go away completely. Definitely worth the investment....already on my second bottle! Oh and just use a little bit every day or every other and this tiny bottle will last a loonngg time. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin:]</li>
    <li> For everyone searching for the acne control product that actually work, LOOK NO FURTHER! This product is affordable in comparison to products purchased in local stores and a portion of the cost of &amp;#34;the most effective products&amp;#34;. I have tried MULTIPLE products. I have only been using Arithmetic for a few short weeks and the results thus far are phenomenal! Not only are my blemishes disappearing but old acne scars are too! I use this before bed and first thing in the morning, its doing the job without drying out the rest of my skin too...you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal Product: The Acne Control Solution has worked its magic on the few pimples I get throughout the month (mostly hormonal). It reduces and eradicates pimples with in a day or overnight. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or dry it out. It also soothes redness around the pimple and reduces scarring. A little goes a long way so there&#x27;s no need to over apply the product. I&#x27;m definitely going to repurchase!</li>
    <li> Arithmetic is the best acne product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to take all sorts of oral and topical medicines. Most of the ingredients in those prescriptions were chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;With the Acne Control Complex cream you kill bacteria naturally, improving your skins health. It feels very soothing similar&lt;br /&gt;to lotion when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne for about 15 years and this is the first time that my skin has a healthy clean look!! This product works wonders and it&#x27;s so gentle with my sensitive skin, I have been using it for 3 weeks and see that my skin has improved a lot  and the best of all is that I don&#x27;t  feel my skin too dry like with other acne products... I highly  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Arithmetic for almost three months now, and I am so, so grateful to have discovered this product. I am in my early 30s and have struggled with adult acne for at least the past five years. I have tried so many different skincare regimens, both prescription and not, and seemed to be constantly bouncing between breaking out, versus no breakout, but with extremely dry, red and irritated skin. Sometimes both at once! It was so frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this product by accident, while searching the web in semi-desperation for some new ideas. At first I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money for yet another product to clutter my bathroom shelf, but after reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to chance it. I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare routine is much more simple now. I use a very gentle cleanser (usually Cetaphil) with lukewarm water. For daytime I apply a thin layer of Arithmetic all over (a little goes a long way), and then a sunscreen with argan oil. I would definitely use a sunscreen made by Arithmetic if they came out with one! I have no problems applying makeup over the product (it even blends nicely with tinted BB/CC creams, if applied together). I worried that my skin would be oily and my makeup would smear, but have not had any problems with that, much to my surprise. I keep a bottle at work, and usually apply a small amount to my most acne-prone areas once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I use a tiny amount of low-potency prescription retinoid cream, and the Arithmetic over it. In the past I had terrible redness and flaking from the retinoid, but no more! Although it is more spendy than other products I have used, I believe that overall I am saving money, as I have stopped buying all of the other creams/washes/potions/etc etc etc I was trying out before. I really am truly grateful to have found this product, and recommend it to my friends.</li>
