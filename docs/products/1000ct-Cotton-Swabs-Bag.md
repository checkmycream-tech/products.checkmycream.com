      <li>Great, strong swabs.</li>
      <li>better than generics maybe as good as Q Tips brand.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with these and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>They are just as good as any swab that would be used to clean your ears.</li>
      <li>Many of the sticks are bent and if you straighten them, they just break.</li>
      <li>They are not at all uniform, but for the most part they are functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase of these.</li>
      <li>Cotton swabs on paper sticks, better for the environment than plastic sticks.</li>
      <li>The swab tip has fallen off  of so many</li>
      <li>I also was really excited to see on the bag that they are &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>I also was really excited to see on the bag that they are &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say 15% or so are defected... but overall great value</li>
      <li>I was excited about the &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; I thought I was getting with this bag of cotton swabs.  </li>
      <li>These are not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>Extreme price difference, great quality though.</li>
      <li>These are very inexpensive swabs, and as a result the paper shaft breaks easily and the swabs are prone to deteriorate easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Bulky packaging for the quantity, but worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>These swabs in particular, though, tend to shed their cotton easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are twice as good as q-tip brand or any other brand I have bought.</li>
      <li>They seem to be as good of a quality as other brands besides the official Q-tip.  </li>
      <li>But I guess the ratio of broken to good are okay for the price.</li>
      <li>They are wound good and the sticks are firm.</li>
      <li>Being a mother of 3 children we go through cotton swabs quickly, I decided to purchase this bulk pack and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>Pure guestimate on the dud percentage</li>
      <li>Overall these are fine since you just use &#x27;em and chuck &#x27;em.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>These are a very n</li>
      <li>Actually the swaps turned out to be a lot better than the generic swaps I have been buying.</li>
      <li>Finally, with a large bag such as this, it would be nice if it had a built-in zip closure, but upon opening, it&#x27;s just an open bag.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone to buy these.</li>

      <li>(I live</li>
      <li>I love a compostable, disposable item, but I do not love cotton on ointment-bottle lids.</li>
      <li>being said, they are not bad swabs overall, especially if you can get them for under $5.  </li>
      <li>I did not have any problems with have missing cotton on the ends; all look fine to me.  </li>

<li> Nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed by just grabbing another one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only come across one so far that was missing the cotton on one end, and the cotton is thick enough, but tightly spun on so they don&#x27;t come apart too easily.  </li>
<li> I like coming home from a long trip to find supplies already waiting for me.</li>
<li> Maybe the bag has just been sitting around too long, and the swabs have started decomposing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d consider these to be the same quality as generic store brand swabs (i.e. &#x27;Equate&#x27; at Walmart) which I still had a few of on hand to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Poorly made, very linty, I expected paper stems but they were various colors of plastic instead.</li>
<li> Busted bag and plenty of loose ended swab tips.</li>
<li> This is a bag of q tips, not cotton balls, and they&#x27;re all loose, so some are ruined and poofy.</li>
<li> Too much loose cotton.</li>
<li> Also the bag has the swabs just loose, no organization to the swabs, so</li>
<li> The cotton is looser but also fluffier than typical american swabs.</li>
<li> Not as I expected at all</li>
<li> My last bulk pack was a waste of money</li>
<li> Q-Tip has seriously reduced the amount of cotton on their Q-tip to the point of generic proportions.</li>
<li> Its very big and finishing is no good.</li>
<li> some of the cotton not secure on the sticks.</li>
<li> A few are incomplete, with no cotton, some are half-swabs, etc.  </li>
<li> Inexpensive but not cheap.</li>
<li> Some of the swabs are missing a head on one end, but just a few.</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s dangerous for anyone using it near the ear!</li>
<li> Yes, but the percentage of duds is small...</li>
<li> They are not as thick as the Q-tip brand</li>
<li> The cotton was so poorly attached to the stick that when I went to put it into my nose, the cotton came off and got lodged into my nasal cavity.</li>
<li> All jumbled up like a cluster and found them at the store for half the price!!!!</li>
<li> As fas as having bad ones in the bunch I am going to say that my bag has a very minimal amount.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just what we needed!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying q-tip brand for years, those have gotten really expensive so I thought I would give these a try based on the reviews here. I thank those reviewers and the people who answered my question about the sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are twice as good as q-tip brand or any other brand I have bought. They are wound good and the sticks are firm. I use these as cosmetic tips and also for an aid in oil painting. I am very happy with these and highly recommend them. Taking a visual of the package I have not seen any unwound sticks.</li>
    <li> Cotton swabs on paper sticks, better for the environment than plastic sticks. Some of the swabs are missing a head on one end, but just a few. The cotton is looser but also fluffier than typical american swabs. Overall these are fine since you just use &#x27;em and chuck &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> These are the &amp;#34;cast offs&amp;#34; of some company producing cotton swabs.  Mine even had lint and what looked like sawdust inside, giving me the impression that they may have literally been swept up off the floor.  A few are incomplete, with no cotton, some are half-swabs, etc.  They are not at all uniform, but for the most part they are functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they are not bad swabs overall, especially if you can get them for under $5.  This thing should last me a year!</li>
    <li> Q-Tip has seriously reduced the amount of cotton on their Q-tip to the point of generic proportions. My last bulk pack was a waste of money so I&#x27;m not doing it anymore. These are just as good as Q-tips and the price is great.</li>
    <li> cheepo&#x27;s but they do the job. some of the cotton not secure on the sticks.</li>
    <li> Good for the price but a lot of them the cotton is barley there and it comes off.</li>
    <li> Poorly made, very linty, I expected paper stems but they were various colors of plastic instead. Not as I expected at all</li>
    <li> 1000 cotton swabs seems to have lasted us forever. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This was a great value. Inexpensive but not cheap. Actually the swaps turned out to be a lot better than the generic swaps I have been buying.</li>
    <li> At under $5 for a 1000 swabs this deal can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;d consider these to be the same quality as generic store brand swabs (i.e. &#x27;Equate&#x27; at Walmart) which I still had a few of on hand to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there duds in the bag? Yes, but the percentage of duds is small...maybe 2% or 3% with cotton on only one tip.  Maybe another 1% total duds with no cotton on either tip...just a stick.  Pure guestimate on the dud percentage but it isn&#x27;t high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag isn&#x27;t a storage bag so once you open I suggest using a gallon zip lock bag for storage (don&#x27;t want spiders or bugs nesting in the bag).  I expect this bag to last me a couple years (I live alone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did lower review to 4 stars for the dud factor.</li>
    <li> Being a mother of 3 children we go through cotton swabs quickly, I decided to purchase this bulk pack and was pleasantly surprised!  These are a very n</li>
    <li> Good quality. Bulky packaging for the quantity, but worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Lots of swabs. Cheap. I&#x27;ve only come across one so far that was missing the cotton on one end, and the cotton is thick enough, but tightly spun on so they don&#x27;t come apart too easily.  The sticks don&#x27;t bend on me either.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. Many of the sticks are bent and if you straighten them, they just break. Many were missing cotton on the ends. But I guess the ratio of broken to good are okay for the price.</li>
    <li> They are great for a DIYer around the house or hobby. They hold to good use and great value for the money. I would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Busted bag and plenty of loose ended swab tips.</li>
    <li> These are very inexpensive swabs, and as a result the paper shaft breaks easily and the swabs are prone to deteriorate easily.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased for cleaning firearms and they work great for that use.</li>
    <li> These swabs were a great price and for the amount you get. They are just as good as any swab that would be used to clean your ears. They are not as thick as the Q-tip brand but it&#x27;s enough.</li>
    <li> Its very big and finishing is no good. cotton come out from swabs.</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars I would. The cotton was so poorly attached to the stick that when I went to put it into my nose, the cotton came off and got lodged into my nasal cavity. I had to go to the ER to get this removed. Am now contacting them to issue compensation for my medical bills. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I would purchase these again.  I did not have any problems with have missing cotton on the ends; all look fine to me.  They seem to be as good of a quality as other brands besides the official Q-tip.  I don&#x27;t care that they are in a bag because I just put them into a glass vanity container anyway, so for the price I would but them again.</li>
    <li> good value. plenty of cotton on each one. better than generics maybe as good as Q Tips brand.</li>
    <li> I like coming home from a long trip to find supplies already waiting for me. This mega-pack is one such supply. The swabs do their job. In fact, cotton swabs are the only beauty supply I can&#x27;t seem to replace with a reusable sort. These swabs in particular, though, tend to shed their cotton easily. Maybe the bag has just been sitting around too long, and the swabs have started decomposing. I love a compostable, disposable item, but I do not love cotton on ointment-bottle lids.</li>
    <li> These are not a bad deal. And at a great price too. A thousand cotton swabs for under $4 bucks, sold. Yeah some are inconsistent but they do the job. Nothing&#x27;s perfect. No complaints here. Work with what you got. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase of these. Definitely will buy these again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Compare to Q-Tip brand. Extreme price difference, great quality though. We used to buy Q-Tip brand but will but this brand from now on</li>
    <li> All jumbled up like a cluster and found them at the store for half the price!!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;d say 15% or so are defected... but overall great value</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased these! You can&#x27;t beat the deal of a 1000 cotton swabs for under $5.00! As fas as having bad ones in the bunch I am going to say that my bag has a very minimal amount. Nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed by just grabbing another one. Hey, you&#x27;ve got a 1000 of them!! I highly recommend to anyone to buy these. I use them everyday, mostly to apply my eyeshadow. I also was really excited to see on the bag that they are &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34;!</li>

    <li> Bad product.  The swab tip has fallen off  of so many I think it&#x27;s dangerous for anyone using it near the ear!</li>
    <li> I was excited about the &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; I thought I was getting with this bag of cotton swabs.  The first 4 small hand-fulls that I pulled from the bag yielded 5 sticks with cotton only on one side, and 1 stick with no cotton on either side.  Also the bag has the swabs just loose, no organization to the swabs, so if your dispenser requires them to be lined up, you have to take the extra time to line them up.  Finally, with a large bag such as this, it would be nice if it had a built-in zip closure, but upon opening, it&#x27;s just an open bag. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> were reading some reviews on defective ones and i have not found any yet this works and is s great price.</li>
    <li> Great, strong swabs. Not the junky kind that are so flimsy and delicate that they snap.</li>
    <li> This is a bag of q tips, not cotton balls, and they&#x27;re all loose, so some are ruined and poofy.</li>
    <li> The swabs are like the rejects that fall off the assembly line. Just throw them away instead of trying to resell them!</li>
    <li> Do not like these.  Too much loose cotton.</li>
