      <li>It&#x27;s silky and beautiful looking on the body, but it leaves your hands looking silver.</li>
      <li>Love this is beautiful on your skin as well as moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>I was wearing a mini-dress and wanted my legs to look good, this was the answer.  </li>
      <li>Not as glossy as I would of liked but a very nice lotion.</li>
      <li>Gave nice glow and moisturized my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very nice and product was</li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best!!!!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great - smells great - but you need to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes and you have to wash your hands really well after applying.  </li>
      <li>smells nice and feels nice on the skin :)</li>
      <li>However, I purchased the Palmers Cb Moisture Gel Oil SPF#15 7 oz and liked that one  better.</li>
      <li>i love this body cream its just the right amount of sheen with great moisturising quality.</li>
      <li>I works much better if you combine it with a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Love the look of this product after it is applied.  </li>
      <li>The product is OK.</li>
      <li>This is fabulous!</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad Amazon carries it online...</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty good too.</li>
      <li>Though I though it would have a higher gloss, it was more of a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>Product is good but did not give as much glow as I&#x27;d anticipated</li>
      <li>I will definitely keep using it for when I go out - great for summer nights.</li>
      <li>It feels so silky smooth</li>
      <li>It has a white film on your hands after applying, but gorgeous on your legs and arms.  </li>
      <li>Very nice scent with just a little shimmer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really only appropriate for going out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>This butter is so pretty on.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better than the regular Palmers cocoa butter...</li>
      <li>I only rated this 3 stars because, although I love all Palmers products, the body gloss seems to be somewhat &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; moisturizing?</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really make my legs look as shiny as I wanted but the added sparkle was pretty with a tan.  </li>
      <li>Apparently they have improved their formulas as I really enjoy applying this lotion.</li>
      <li>This little gem Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Body Gloss will give your skin a nice glow while it softens it.</li>
      <li>Using this product will give you a glow,but if you use too much you will get a silvery unnatural finish on your skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like using a glittery powder that sparkles so much</li>
      <li>The scent is light enough to not compete with your perfumes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I combine a small amount in my hand with regular Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion and it gives my skin a beautiful glistening glow.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, so pretty with a slight tan.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s less glittery than most.  </li>
      <li>I bought a second one right away to have a spare.</li>
      <li>Very soft shimmer that is not in your face</li>
      <li>Feels slick at first, but, quickly absorbs.</li>
      <li>sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the same yummy cocoa smell that palmers usually has...  </li>
      <li>If you are very tanned I would not recommend using large amounts of it because it has a slightly white color that looks odd on tanned skin.</li>
      <li>Some reviews were negative...just be careful not to use too much.</li>
      <li>I use self tanner for a few days and then put this on top for a little extra WOW.  </li>
      <li>I have some pics that I posted on social media...</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely but a little thin.</li>

<li> So difficult to find in stores.</li>
<li> There is a faint sparkle you might notice in the sunlight, but no overkill.</li>
<li> but it has a very, very weird, offputting odor.  </li>

    <li> Using this product will give you a glow,but if you use too much you will get a silvery unnatural finish on your skin.</li>
    <li> I tried using it alone on my legs after showering.  It is thick and leaves somewhat&lt;br /&gt;of a white streak.  I works much better if you combine it with a moisturizer.  You only&lt;br /&gt;need a little bit.  The product is OK.</li>
    <li> during the summer months, when a tan is an option...  this cream gives a shimmer to the skin that makes it appear to glow.  sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the same yummy cocoa smell that palmers usually has...  but i use the two creams together to get the sheen plus the fragrance.  it is a shame that they&#x27;ve stopped making it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my skin feeling so silky and it glistens, it&#x27;s so awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Needed something to make my legs give a subtle sheen because my legs tend to look dull to me.  I was wearing a mini-dress and wanted my legs to look good, this was the answer.  I have some pics that I posted on social media...everyone is complicating me on my legs, I know its because of this..thanks!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent with just a little shimmer. Not as glossy as I would of liked but a very nice lotion.I bought a second one right away to have a spare.</li>
    <li> Love the look of this product after it is applied.  Very soft shimmer that is not in your face but it has a very, very weird, offputting odor.  Can&#x27;t really describe the smell except to say it is NOT nice.  Seems to wear off after a half hour or so but it is almost intolerable while applying.  I love how the product works but would not recommend based on the horrible odor.</li>
    <li> Product is good but did not give as much glow as I&#x27;d anticipated</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky and beautiful looking on the body, but it leaves your hands looking silver. It&#x27;s hard to get off your palms, so I would recommend gloves when using on the body.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, so pretty with a slight tan. Feels slick at first, but, quickly absorbs. Nice!</li>
    <li> hard to find this product in the store...I am so glad Amazon carries it online...it&#x27;s much better than the regular Palmers cocoa butter...has like a glimmer to it..guess that&#x27;s why they call it &#x27;body gloss&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous! So difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Yes this product is very good. My wife loved it and was impressed with it. She will buy it again. Though I though it would have a higher gloss, it was more of a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> Love this is beautiful on your skin as well as moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have used Palmers Cocoa Butter Body Gloss for about 5 years now. My skin is brown so I don&#x27;t use it alone or it gives me an unnatural looking white sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I combine a small amount in my hand with regular Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion and it gives my skin a beautiful glistening glow. It&#x27;s subtle so I can use it anytime, day or night. It&#x27;s not like using a glittery powder that sparkles so much it&#x27;s really only appropriate for going out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on my skin whenever I wear it. I use it on my shoulders/arms, chest and legs to give my exposed skin that extra OOMPH when wearing a sundress or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because used alone, it doesn&#x27;t work for my skin tone - it has to be combined with lotion to dilute it.</li>
    <li> Afterhearing the rave about this product, I decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed and really don&#x27;t understand what the rave is all about. However, I purchased the Palmers Cb Moisture Gel Oil SPF#15 7 oz and liked that one  better. But as for this one, it did not do anything it was suppose to do and as for me a waste of 8 bucks. : (</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great - smells great - but you need to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes and you have to wash your hands really well after applying.  It has a white film on your hands after applying, but gorgeous on your legs and arms.  I will definitely keep using it for when I go out - great for summer nights.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!!!!!  It will be a staple in my daily routine</li>
    <li> i love this body cream its just the right amount of sheen with great moisturising quality. love it. smells nice and feels nice on the skin :)</li>
    <li> I only rated this 3 stars because, although I love all Palmers products, the body gloss seems to be somewhat &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; moisturizing?</li>
    <li> This little gem Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Body Gloss will give your skin a nice glow while it softens it. Ladies and Gents this is the body cream to wear out on the town when you want to get noticed!</li>
    <li> Gave nice glow and moisturized my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very nice and product was non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> This butter is so pretty on. Some reviews were negative...just be careful not to use too much. It feels so silky smooth I love it</li>
    <li> The amount of shimmer it puts on your skin is minimal which, is what I wanted.  I use self tanner for a few days and then put this on top for a little extra WOW.  The smell is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> Took this on my recent vacation and used it combined with another lotion and it added just enough sparkle.  It didn&#x27;t really make my legs look as shiny as I wanted but the added sparkle was pretty with a tan.  If you are very tanned I would not recommend using large amounts of it because it has a slightly white color that looks odd on tanned skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the illuminator is glittery.  I wanted gloss/shine, not glitter.  Granted it&#x27;s less glittery than most.  It goes on nicely but a little thin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Palmers products in the past and they either made me itch or they didn&#x27;t absorb well. Apparently they have improved their formulas as I really enjoy applying this lotion. It absorbs well, no sticky residue. There is a faint sparkle you might notice in the sunlight, but no overkill. The scent is light enough to not compete with your perfumes. I will buy this product again.</li>
