<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I blow out anf straighten my hair constantly, &amp; I&#x27;ve recently bleached the ends. I put this in right before i blew dry it,and waited until the next day to straighten it. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I&#x27;ve gotten it professionally done, and I&#x27;m beyond happy.</li>
    <li> This conditioning cream makes my hair wonderfully soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair for a while now, and this is the longest it&#x27;s been since I was in high school. (down to the middle of my back) This stuff not only smells amazing, but makes me hair so soft and shiny!  I recently got the matching shampoo and conditioner (it was on sale!) to use the whole system!  I dye my hair all kinds of crazy colors, so this works great in preventing my hair from drying out!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of Pantene. The Pantene Pro-V Repair and Protect Overnight Miracle left my hair very oily. Couldn&#x27;t tell that this product did anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and suffers from all sorts of over-processing. I don&#x27;t want to go short, but I have been regularly snipping off ends to improve the appearence of my hair. I heard about this product on line, and decided to give it a try. Who couldn&#x27;t use a miracle now and then? I was not disappointed. What I did was put my hair up in a pony tail, condition the ends and wait for the outcome. In the morning, I washed my hair as usual, and the results on the damaged ends was a notable improvement. I scrunched it and let it naturally dry, and I was thrilled! If your hair has some serious damage and you&#x27;d like to avoid getting a pixie, Pantene Miracle Repair could save you from spending the season looking like Tinkerbelle!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soooo soft!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my little girl&#x27;s long, dried, and damaged hair.  I was taken by surprise the first time I use it on her hair.  Her hair turned shiny and darker healthier color almost immediately.  The best thing is, it smells good, it&#x27;s not greasy, and the hair absorbs it and look naturally smooth and shiny.  I am definitely using this on her in a long run.</li>
    <li> I think there is too much water in it and I really can&#x27;t see that it has done anything. Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I applied the serum as soon as it arrived. I waited to wash my hair the next day. My hair had more volume. So, I have applied a little everyday, especially to the ends. To my surprise, when I washed my hair yesterday, there was very little hair in the drain catcher. I guess, for me, it is helping with hair loss. My husband was concerned with the amount of hair I have been loosing. I stopped using any shampoo with zinc pyrthione. I used cantu leave in conditioner. My scalp was not as broken out, as before. I stopped washing my hair everyday. I started taking multivitamins. Now, with the help of this serum, I don&#x27;t see the amount of hair in my brushes or the drain. I even see little sprouts of new hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I even have my husband putting it in his hair at night sometimes. I could not expect anything but the best from Pantene.</li>
    <li> I have dry frizzy hair and this product left it feeling silky and smooth, without weighing it down.  I use just a small amount at the ends of my hair overnight and it works wonders!  I would recommend this product to anyone with the dry frizzies! I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> easy to use ar night seems to repair and give moisture- lose less hair in brush in am</li>
    <li> Nice quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic.  I was very skeptical, but my hair is slightly curly, long, and very thick.  I always have my eyes open for products that will work better.  I use a light detangler after a shower and then put this in overnight.  It takes about double the recommended amount on the back, but help keeps the shine and softness between washings, products, and the damage that hair elastics can do.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! Just makes my hair feel so soft and doesn&#x27;t cause it to frizz which is a small miracle for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice. Nothing happened, it did seem to leave my ends a bit drier than normal. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but I will use it since it doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm. Just like it says, it leaves no residue on your pillow. It smells alright, like a typical hairspray. It does leave your hair smelling nicer so it is a good product to use if you want your hair smelling like hairspray.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t love this more! I have incredibly thick and curly hair and use it two to three times a week. The difference in my hair is incredible! So soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> I got this to use for when my hair occasionally becomes dry and brittle.  I gave it a go after I had gone to an indoor pool with my kids for the day - the chlorine always makes my hair feel dry.  My daughter and I both used it on our hair that night after we got home.  It was nice that it didn&#x27;t make our hair overly greasy, and it could definitely be used even if you were just going to style-and-go the next morning.  However, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the results as I thought I&#x27;d be.  I thought my hair would be noticeably softer in the morning, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I am going to continue to try to use it now that I know it won&#x27;t turn my head into a grease ball.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair which is bleach blonde. For hair that is dry and needs extra attention this product helps. Overnight the ends of my hair usually get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. Used this on my ends and drier areas of hair before bed. In morning hair feels soft and conditioned, like normal healthy hair should feel. Leaves no greasy residue on pillow. On occasion some hair products can irritate skin, cause breakouts, but this product does not irritate my skin. Great product for over processed hair, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $1 only. I am so happy that I get this promotion. This product is not oil at all. so far so good. not seeing any amazing change now, but I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives my hair the right amount of bounce. Makes my hair shine and manageable.</li>
    <li> it turned the dry and fizzy hair to healthy and smooth hair!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I was worried it would make my hair feel greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t.  My hair is coarse and dry so it seems to absorb the oil just fine.  My hair is soft and feels nice the next day.  I have not used regularly so I don&#x27;t know if you would see an improvement in your hair if used over a period of time.  I just use it when I remember that I have it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy at all, and goes on light and smells nice. I use a few squirts when my hair is damp from the shower, and it helps my hair stay soft all day &#x3D;) Great product!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how soft this makes my hair feel. I have pretty damaged hair and I alternate protein and moisture treatments . I have been amazed at the quality and value of this product.</li>
    <li> Agreed that it does not need to be a nighttime product.  I use it after I dry my hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> I like using this product with a hair oil. I use this to seal in a hair oil and for that it works so perfectly and helps keep my hair smooth and moisturized without being greasy or heavy. First I apply a dime size of oil to my ends to midshaft let it sit for about 5 minutes and then I add about a quarter size of this product comb through and im done. smells sooo good! You also cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> Worked just ok for me.</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything for me. I&#x27;m not sure what the hype or the reviews are about. I originally purchased it based on the raving reviews as well as the low price of the product. But if it doesn&#x27;t work, what&#x27;s the point? Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> Seems to help my very dry hair. I put it on after  I get out of the shower at night. In the morning my hair is not so frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle!  Love the smell and it really works!  I had some damage on the sides of my hair from heat-styling (iron or hairdryer), and I would wash my hair at night, and then blow dry and put this on the damaged spots, and sleep on it.  Then style as normal the next day, and I could definitely see an improvement in healing the damage that had been done.  I will keep using this product!  And it smells great!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve given a review for a product on Amazon, but I felt that I should let others know my opinion on this stuff. I usually get my hair colored and trimmed every 3-4 months at an upscale salon. My last visit left my hair in total chaos! The colorist failed to remove my color when she she should have, and as a result my hair was  left over processed, brittle and horribly dry! I was devastated at the condition of my hair! I went as far as get a few inched cut off after this happened. I desperately reached for anything and everything that could possibly bring some hope to my sickly-looking strands. I purchased multiple overpriced products from the salon which had little to no impact on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;I saw Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Overnight Treatment, and decided to give it a shot. After all, it was just a few bucks, and at this point-what was it going to hurt to at least try.&lt;br /&gt;I woke up the first night after sleeping with this product in my hair, and was absolutely AMAZED at how much softer, calmer and healthier my hair appeared. I did not rinse it out (per instructions on the bottle), I simply styled my hair and went on about my day.&lt;br /&gt;I now use this product once a week, and I can promise you that it truly worked wonders on my thick, thirsty, naturally curly locks!! It is a miracle in a bottle, no doubt! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a huge thumbs up!! Thank you, Pantene!! :)[[ASIN:B00AZYF90C Pantene Pro-V Overnight Miracle Repair Serum 4.9 Fl Oz]]</li>
    <li> the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it made my hair oily</li>
    <li> Conditions well, light scent, use during the day also.</li>
    <li> I have wavy frizzy hair, so I am always blow drying, curling or straightening. Between the heat damage and the years of coloring, bleaching, highlights and all that good stuff, my hair was pretty fried. When I came across this product on Amazon, I knew I had to give it a try. I have always been a fan of Pantene and love all their products, including this.&lt;br /&gt; After just one use, my hair looked and felt noticeably different. It had more shine and was soft and silky. Plus it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy as it normally is.  I love that you can use it on wet or dry hair. I use one pump and cover the ends of my hair. It quickly dries and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or weighed down at all. I also love the way my hair smells after using this.  I have had nothing but amazing results with this product. As long as I have hair, I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and repaired.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. my hair felt and looked a bit damaged and after a few applications a few times a week, my hair felt it a bit more ALIVE and healthier!!!</li>
    <li> Oh I am in love! It makes my hair silky smooth without all the greasy residues. Also my hair has a shine like never before. I usually have dull lifeless hair. Well not now. And it smells awesome!  I have gotten so many comments on my hair. Lastly it came a day early! Thanks for the great products!</li>
    <li> Great product i love pro-v products</li>
    <li> Great to use anytime not just for over night. Easy application and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This was okay… I used it at night as directed and didn&#x27;t really notice that much difference in my hair, maybe left my hair a little more frizzy.  It has a nice sent and was a good price.</li>
    <li> Only use once so far, works greatly on my hair, smooth and silky</li>
    <li> Can anyone tell that they used this product 0n mature locks.My ends are dry and BRITTLE..... will this product help my locks....tHANKS FOR A  RESPONSE</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and really hoped it would work. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my hair. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt it, so that why I gave it 3 starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes my hair very soft</li>
    <li> I used it for couple weeks and it doesn&#x27;t do any miracles at all and it s o harsh and it made my hair even harder!dont like it and don&#x27;t recommend it ,waste of money!</li>
    <li> Very helpful for the hair repair</li>
    <li> Amazingly good product. I have lots of colored extra fine curly hair. This stuff make my hair silky, soft, and a lot less frizzy. Thanks Pantene.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I find it especially useful during the winter, when my hair tends to dry out a bit more. I have really thick hair, and this really helps keep it in shape. And as an added bonus, I love the way it smells! I just put some in my hair and pull it back at night, then when I wake up and let it down, my hair smells amazing and is much easier to comb through. The only thing I would caution: don&#x27;t over-do the amount you put in your hair; otherwise, your hair could end up feeling heavy. But other than that, I think this product is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product more than three times. always good</li>
    <li> My daughter love this . Uses it every night after her shower . She asked for a second bottle so she never runs out .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Pantene do I really need to explain it further?  This company used to have some great products but over the past few years they have come out with products I am constantly throwing out! It doesn&#x27;t matter what I try if Pantene makes it, it always ends up in the trash. I am not buying any more of their junky products they are too far gone from healthy hair. I (personally), believe they sold out to an under market and I seriously doubt they will ever make a comeback...</li>
    <li> I like the smell , I think my hair looks better of the morning &amp;#60;Discount for being honest</li>
    <li> I have the curly hair that isn&#x27;t completely curly, but is too curly to be considered wavy; every hairdresser loves it, but for me, it is generally unmanageable. It&#x27;s usually super-frizzy and out of sorts except for once on a blue moon. I have tried NUMEROUS hair products to help manage it and the frizz--anything from leave-in conditioners, sprays, gels, shampoos that all claim to help and have had little success even with the top of the line products. I hate that some weigh my hair down, make it super stiff and flaky, or are too greasy. This stuff is light-weight and does not make my hair stiff. When I wake up, I can run my fingers through my hair as easily as if I had just brushed it which says a lot for someone like myself who moves around in bed a lot! I love, love, love, LOVE this product. I bought another just so I would have it when I run out of my first.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and seems to help with skin texture and dryness. Not sticky. Recommend for daily care, I received at a discounted price for my honest, unbiased review and opinion. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works wonderfully on my daughters hair, especially when I use it with the Pantene Pro-V Shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> cheap and smells great</li>
    <li> Great for overnight treatment.  My hair is extremely dry... It moisturized my hair and it looked great the next day!</li>
    <li> I felt like I got a miracle when I applied this stuff to my hair.  I was outside and the humidity had my hair limp, frizzy, and impossible to style.  I bought it at Walmart and put it on my hair during the afternoon.  After about 5 minutes, I could not believe my hair.  Soft, supple, shiny, and I was able to create a beautiful style without hot curlers or an iron.  I have never really seen anything like it.  Of course, it is hard to beat Pantene.  Great product and great prices, but this has got to be the coup da grace to my bad hair days.  It was a miracle for me.  This stuff was made for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Works so well in my hair. I use it the night before and then let air dry. Soft and bouncy in the morning. Smells amazing! I can curl my hair with a wand and need no additional products. This has saved me so much time with doing my hair in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out after a pixie cut so I thought this product might help protect my hair as it grows. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my color treated, damaged hair while using it semi-nightly for about a month. I think my least favorite part about it is the very strong perfume; the smell itself isn&#x27;t so bad, but it comes on extremely strong and I think it&#x27;s just unnecessary to go to bed wearing such a potent scent. Unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as it was ineffective for me.</li>
    <li> Works like a miracle indeed. I will continur to buy, I love all Pantene products, they are great. Try it.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t impress me. My hair has been through a lot. It is half curly and half wavy to begin with, but on top of that, I have bleached and dyed it ever color of the rainbow. A year or so ago, I stopped bleaching and only used one color on it every two months, but I&#x27;ve also been growing it out, so the ends were still a little rough. I was hoping this product would keep the ends in good enough repair to put off a haircut for a few more months. I used it at least a dozen times with various methods of application. I tried it on wet hair, towel-dried hair, dry hair (both \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; and clean), and I used it before bed and in the morning. I never saw any real improvement. It might have helped tame a little frizz, but nothing to rant and rave about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Christmas, I received a Suave kit that is supposed to include Moroccan Oil and Argan Oil. [[ASIN:B00ESYBV66 Suave Professionals Piece Moroccan Infusion]] I was skeptical considering the fact that I&#x27;ve always associated Suave with bottom shelf products. HOWEVER, it has done what no other product has done in the matter of days. Actually, as soon as I used it, I noticed a dramatic different. I am ready to throw out the [retail] $25 shampoo in favor of this product. Do yourself a favor. Skip the \\&quot;Miracle Repair Serum\\&quot; and go for the Suave instead.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. I GOT IT FOR MY SON WHO HAS FIZZY HAIR. WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Most people are writing reviews who have very thin or fine hair, but I have very thick hair. I would say the only difference is that I really have to pump a ton of stuff for it to even have an effect but let me tell you, I have A LOT of hair. My hair has been colored and I use heat almost daily on it so it has been through it&#x27;s fair share of damage and this stuff really really works! I love just basically dousing my ends in it before I go to be and waking up with my hair already looking wayyyyy healthier. I actually use it to sort of scrunch my hair after I shower and it makes my natural hair have a better looking curl to it. Basically this thing works wonders and although I have to use a lot of it, fortunately it is not expensive :D</li>
    <li> love it! I use it every night and in the morning my hair looks much better and with more life</li>
    <li> I had read abotu this product before and only bought it in-store because it happened to be on sale at the time. Firstly, I have wavy hair, sometimes frizzy, especially when it&#x27;s damaged (like right now), and I have not seen this much improvement to my ends without having to cut them off outright. In the few days that I&#x27;ve been using it my hair has taken a heavy and much-needed moisturizing. I would go as far as to say that it&#x27;s on the level with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A Ten&amp;#34; spray that I&#x27;ve used and gave me really fantastic results also, but this product doesn&#x27;t have that disgusting price tag that &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A Ten&amp;#34; has. Plus, it smells like a field of wildflowers in Provence. If Provence was in Heaven. And people would argue that it is.</li>
    <li> You win some, you lose some. I don&#x27;t really feel like this deep conditions my hair. I put it on at night and it feels the same as if I were to go to bed with plain conditioner in my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s doing more than I feel, but my stylist didn&#x27;t notice a big improvement either.</li>
    <li> I got this for a steal -- around $3. Sadly, I had to throw it away as it does nothing, aside from making my hair smell delish. It did not moisturize my hair or reduce frizz or anything. No miracles, sadly. I threw it out and am going back to my trusty MoroccanOil Light. Glad I didn&#x27;t waste more money testing it out. Look at the ingredients - aside from a bit of silicone, there&#x27;s nothing in there that has a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; like effect on your hair! You&#x27;re better of spending money on a product that works - plenty of serums (Biolage, Moroccan Oil, John Frieda) will give you better results.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! My hair feels and looks great</li>
    <li> Works excellent, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy. Hair is super soft and shiny after use.</li>
    <li> I love all things pantene! After using this a couple times I did notice a difference in my hair...It made my hair feels smoother and less frizzy as well as feeling much less dry. If you have dry or damaged hair I would absolutely recommend trying this! Most hair repair products can be very expensive and not make much of a difference in your hair...this was worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try on my hair.. I never really lean towards the cheaper products just because they honestly never work as well as the more expensive ones but I saw this and thought why not.. its not too expensive and if it doesn&#x27;t work I didn&#x27;t spend too much, and the name &amp;#34;Overnight Miracle&amp;#34; immediately attracted me.. So I got my shower and smoothed onto my ends and about halfway up my hair and in the morning my ends were extremely smooth and silky!! Definitely worth its money!! Will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just bad luck, but many of the things I order have been coming with the pump broken. It said to twist to pop up but it just came off so I have to open it to use. Other than that, I&#x27;ve owned this before and it works well on my hair. Of course nothing will reverse damage, it keeps my super straight, butt length hair looking healthy and feeling soft the next morning.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the price is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I misunderstood of the size of it, anyway when I checked it I realized that I put my money in the trash can. If you have time, just go to CVS. You will save your money.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t make any improvement to my hair!</li>
    <li> First of all, I never liked Pantene.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but it never agreed with my hair.  I end up with stiff hair, heavy or residue, dry, tangled...nothing positive.  I used other brands for years but when I saw this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, I thought maybe i should give it a try. So, I did...3 times and not much happened.  It did shine but it felt...I don&#x27;t know...like I glued my hair sort of.  I read somewhere that Pantene put wax and/or silicone in their products?  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true but it sure feels that way.  There really isn&#x27;t any repair in my opinion...just camouflage. I should have listened to my gut feeling and not buy it.  I give it 2 stars because it&#x27;s not horrible but it isn&#x27;t good either.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the hair product I have been waiting for. I have lots of curly/wavy hair, but it is thin not course. I use this after my shower and my hair is glorious instead of frizzy. I refer to it as &amp;#34;my Precious&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I basically used 4 box dyes in a 24-hour period and understandably was very concerned for the damage done to my hair. I heard about this product from a Youtube video of a DIY-er who swore by it.  She was right!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my colored hair at night. I used about 4 pumps because my hair is long. I only applied it to the parts of my hair that was dyed and saturated the ends pretty well. At first my hair felt crunchy and not very soft but as it dried, my hair felt softer and softer. The next morning, my hair looked and felt fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I really love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this every night without fail.</li>
    <li> Pantene was always my no 1 hair care product, and now I&#x27;m happy with this new serum that I use 2-3 times a week before I go to bed and my hair looks so much better after couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I was browsing through the hair product asile when i came across this. It was about 6 dollars and it looked intresting so i decided to give it a try. I dont have extremely damaged hair but its also not its healthiest. My hairs are vert very fine but i have ALOT of hair. making it very thick. When i first tried to use the product it was a struggle. i think it was just a messed up pump. to unlock the pump you are supposed to twist it in the direction of the arrow. i twisted and fought with the pump for a good 10 minutes before it finally unlocked. Nevetheless the product inside is amazing. Its a consistency hard  to describe. not oily at all. like  a creamy/watery texture. I applied it to the ends of my (dry) hair and it was absorbed in nearly 5 minutes. my hair already looked and felt healthier. when i woke up the following morning, my hair looked amazing. shiny , but not oily at all. Ive also used it on wet hair before bed and i wake up with an amazing sleek toustled look. for 6 dollars its worth a try and i will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at my local cvs.  It&#x27;s a good leave in conditioner but it didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the quality of my hair.  Not worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in treatment for dry, damaged or healthy hair. I use this product day time and night time. I use this product every time I was my hair and before I blow dry. So worth the money!</li>
    <li> i normally dont like pantene stuff but this one is amazinggggg:-) ill buy again for sure..hair looks like great!hair is super shinny !</li>
    <li> I purchased this to get more moisture in my hair overnight and hoped for the best.  My curly hair has always been naturally dry, so moisture is what I always need.  In fact, I found that moisture reduces appearance of gray hair to my natural dark brown color (very soon celebrating 64 years), and requires little of anything else to maintain manageability through the next day.  After two uses I can say that the BEST is just what I got.  Moisture remained in my hair overnight and had not dried up by morning or soaked into my pillow case.  In fact, my hair was radiant and refreshed when I awoke.  I will keep this first in my hair products.  Buy two at a time so you won&#x27;t run out.  I found Pantene Pro-V is better than the competing product from Loreal, Though their product is thicker, it does not refresh and moisturize to the same degree as Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V.  Truly great product!</li>
    <li> Has helped my hair tremendously.  Make my hair very soft and controls the frizzing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I have been using it over night for the past couple of weeks and I have noticed that my hair has not been as dry as it used to be. I have very thick hair and it sometimes gets frustrating because nothing seems to work but I finally found something that works well with my hair. it doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy residue like other products do. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> my hair used to be just fine, but when i started coloring, styling etc my hair gets dull , frizzy and all that. Saw this product at a local grocery and gave it a try. I followed the instruction to put it at night (although i think this is also great in the morning), and in less than 2-3 minutes i can feel my hair so soft and silky, plus it smells so good! When i get up in the morning i checked my hair immediately, and boy i am so surprise! i was expecting a usual lion-hair, messy like or that tangled hair that we usually have early in the morning, but mine was of course still a little bit messy but heres the thing i just use my fingers to comb it an wallla!!!it is still soft and silky and easy to manage..this is the first day i used this product but i am loving it!!!i recommend this to everyone who has hair problem like mine, just give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product has definitely exceeded my expectations. I have fine, shoulder length hair that has really been feeling the effects of daily flat ironing, highlighting, and dry winter air. I purchased this after reading the reviews on here, and boy am I glad I did! It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, and has that classic intoxicating Pantene smell. Best of all, it actually works! As per the instructions, I apply one pump to my hair at night, let it soak in for a bit, then comb for good measure. Not only does my hair look and feel better, but the static mess I often have to battle because of the cold has been tamed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this product would work for thick-haired women, but if you have hair like mine, I would recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> Very good for Pantene, this product works wonders in your hair.I had bought a L&#x27;Oreal similar and did not work as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Even bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly as described</li>
    <li> Love this item. This and the Nexxus Pro-Mend overnight treatment for split ends are the only products I will use for my hair. It works like a miracle. My hair feels awesome, and after using it for a few months my hair is noticeably healthier and feels smoother. I have very thin Asian hair that used to be a lot thicker and fuller. It&#x27;s getting there. I like the scent of this product and it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t lave marks, stains, or smells on my pillow.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it made my hair greasy and made my scalp itchy.</li>
    <li> I used it for two weeks then I really felt the difference. My hair became more healthy. I really love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of Pantene products. Used to love their Sheer Volume shampoo, conditioner, and aerosol spray (until they changed the formula years ago) and except for their Aqua Light shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t care for too many other of their products. I saw this advertised on a commercial and being a sucker for ads and new products, I decided to pick some up. It was around $7 at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine \\&quot;see through\\&quot; blonde hair that has been abused by years of coloring, bleached highlights, and using some sort of heat appliance EVERYDAY (I have strange hair that is somewhere between straight and wavy and is frizzy and looks like garbage if I don&#x27;t use something on it; air drying is rarely an option). Because my hair is so thin, it breaks and splits if you look at it wrong. Now, there is NOTHING you can do to repair damage. Once it&#x27;s broken and frayed, you&#x27;re stuck with it unless/until you chop it off. But, you can disguise the damage and help make it look better at least. That&#x27;s what this stuff does. Despite it being called a serum, it&#x27;s not some nasty, oily stuff. It&#x27;s a gel-like cream that disappears. Once again, because my hair is thin, it gets weighed down by pretty much everything but this stuff doesn&#x27;t AT ALL. It helps my hair not be a frizzy mess when it dries and makes it smooth and less damaged LOOKING in the morning. I use it as a leave in conditioner even if i&#x27;m not going to bed. It doesn&#x27;t say whether to use it on damp or dry hair, but i&#x27;ve found you can use it on both and still get good results. I also love the smell, but those sensitive to scent may think it&#x27;s a little strong. The smell of Pantene&#x27;s products has always been one thing I have liked. I say give it a try. Not sure how this would work on thicker hair but if you have overprocessed, thin, frizzy hair like mine, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This works super great.  However don&#x27;t think you can use if for 3 nights in a row without your hair looking like it just had an oil bath.  Use if for two nights max or else your hair will look to oily.  Love it.  It does has a way of refreshing your hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes based on the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t appear to do much of anything. This is after my first use, I&#x27;ll try it for a few weekss and update accordingly. I have the perfect storm of bad hair - thin, frizzy, looks dry but gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it. I try to wash it with conditioner every other day but I haven&#x27;t found one I really love - L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme cleansing conditioner is the best so far. I liked  Avalon Organics lavender conditioner, but I found it a bit too heavy to be used as a co-wash. Also if you have hair like mine you might like Organix coconut oil anti-breakage serum - I find that works best when you apply just a bit to the ends of wet hair and let it air dry (and that stuff DOES make my hair shiny - I think it&#x27;s the only thing these days!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else... I&#x27;m not usually picky about the smell but this is overwhelmingly cloying to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to write a review unless the product was really really good, or really really bad, in this case it almost seemed too good to be true. After seeing this serum on the &#x27;Top Products&#x27; list in 2 different magazines and the great reviews on Amazon I decided that I had to try it. I went to 4 different CVS&#x27;s looking for it but apprently they don&#x27;t carry it yet (even though they have signs for it in the hair product isle?!) but I was able to find it at Walgreens &amp; it was on sale! I have extremelyyy baby fine, thin hair and could definitely use a hair cut. I put the recommended 1-2 pumps on the ends of my hair and worked it up towards the roots. When I woke up my hair was silky smooth and not at all greasy as I would usually expect from a serum. Obviously there&#x27;s no miracle product that will magically cure split ends, you have to cut them off, but this product leaves your hair looking great in the meantime. I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff at Target. The ends of my hair were so dry and rough. I used the serum and after the first night I saw and felt a noticeable difference!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and my hair is now silky smooth and shiny. The ends of my hair feel and look smooth and healthy whereas before they looked dry and brittle. This serum truly is an overnight miracle repair. I would totally recommended this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this once and it seemed to work just like everyone is saying, I&#x27;m probably going to keep using it a few more times (don&#x27;t want to do it every night) before I put up a final review, but it&#x27;s definitely doing something.</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products. This has made my waist length hair more managable in the morning. Can just comb right through it.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It&#x27;s not greasy nor does it leave a residue on my pillow when I wear it at night.  But I was hoping for a bit smoother and softer hair after its use.</li>
    <li> Smells great, except I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything to my hair. I think i&#x27;ll stick with Sally&#x27;s generic Paul Mitchell super skinny serum.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair shines and it is not costy. I use it every time after shower.</li>
    <li> This couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a better time. I have just had my hair processed with foils for the first time .... I washed my hair for the first time since it was done yesterday and it felt dry and frizzed badly with my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; routine and products. Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out so I put it straight on my hair as soon as I got it out of the box and it immediately felt somewhat better and this morning my hair looks and feels great! I often have trouble with this kind of &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; product ( I can never get it in evenly and parts of my hair often look greasy afterwards) ... but this definitely spread well and you can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve put it on...except that my hair looks a LOT better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as part of a review process ... funnily enough when I placed the order I didn&#x27;t need this more than to improve my relatively healthy hair ... so I am doubly happy to give this &amp;#34;Two Thumbs Up&amp;#34; because I was really upset after I washed my hair and found that my normal products weren&#x27;t working to get my hair to look like it did when I left the salon. :)</li>
    <li> Absolutly love love this. I have only used it for one week and can already see a difference... Amazing product.</li>
    <li> It works and I love it.</li>
    <li> This makes my coarse curly hair feel very soft..however, it also turns to pure frizz..save your money!! Have tried it every way possible only to get the same results.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product! I have had a very hard time finding a product that doesnt leave my hair too greasy but still repairs it. This product has been the answer!</li>
    <li> this is a leave in conditioner you can put in right after hair wash which is weightless and softening even the worst hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair feel great and smells wonderful. Does what it says it should do. Will buy again. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is as close to a perfect leave in as a product can get. I bought this at walmart for about 6 dollars and was happy I did. As soon as I put this in my hair after washing it my hair was transformed from frizzy to soft and silky. I pulled my hair up into a pony and went to bed. Next morning my hair was still soft and silky. I could run my fingers through it. Normally when my hair dry it&#x27;s rough and frizzy. Now it&#x27;s soft. I recommend this to anyone with thick, frizzy, and dry hair. It literally is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I am a picky hair product connoisseur, and have tried other overnight products that just made my hair stiff and brittle, but this stuff WORKS. It smells great, a little goes a long way, it soaks in quickly, and most importantly MY HAIR LOOKS AMAZING! It has gotten noticeably shinier, smoother, and healthier. Even when I air dry my hair now, it&#x27;s not immediately a giant ball of frizz (think Merida from \\&quot;Brave\\&quot; - that&#x27;s my hair without this product!) The more I use it, the more I love it. It only costs about $8 at the drugstore, which seems like a steal for how long it lasts. I rarely rave about anything, but I just ran out of this stuff and put it at the top of my shopping list!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it .. Pantene has never let me down</li>
    <li> Works great, even my son&#x27;s course hair feels softer and easier to care for</li>
    <li> Just got this to help with split ends. I have tried several leave-ins with mixed results. Either they build up or hardly do anything. This one is typical pantene. Smells nice, good texture. It&#x27;s not a heavy creme nor a light mist. I would use it for day or night because seriously, my hair doesn&#x27;t know the difference. Pros: it softens hair, smells good, spreads easily. Cons: may build up over time, might be too light if your hair is so thick and coarse you can&#x27;t get a comb through. Give it a try. :)</li>
    <li> At first I was not sure if you were supposed to use this product with wet or dry hair.  I found out that using it at night on dry hair before bed and washing out the next morning with shampoo is the best way.  It really made my hair clean and strong and very shiney!.</li>
    <li> I have dry, damaged hair so I was looking for something to fix the ends.  These works well and doesn&#x27;t leave me a greasy pillow when I wake up.  Works good.</li>
    <li> I cannot say i have seen a drastic different in the quality of my hair using this product nightly.  And as much as I do like Pantene, I would probably would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I used half of the bottle and did not find any improvement on my hair. kind of disappointed. will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!! I put it on before I go to bed. My hair isn&#x27;t sticky or messy on my pillow.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so smooth in the morning and I have less frizz.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> As someone who dyes my long hair blonde and has started going prematurely white, I&#x27;m always looking for a product that smooths and prevents damage. However, I&#x27;ve always run into the problem that most repairing products are way too oily and make my hair look and feel super greasy, particularly on my blonde hair, since they turn the greasier parts a darker color. I do not have that problem at all with this product. I can slather it all over my hair at night, even on those wiry white hairs along my part line and wake up the next day with smoother, not greasy hair. I feel like it&#x27;s really working on repairing my hair too, because at my last haircut my hair stylist commented on how good my ends looked, which hasn&#x27;t been cut or trimmed in over 3 months. Even after 3 months I thought my ends looked great, my roots and high lights were the real reason I went in for my appointment. I use this most nights of the week, after I get out of the shower on either totally dry or slightly damp hair. I don&#x27;t comb it through, since I lose a lot of hairs when I do that, just kind of smooth it on like I&#x27;m putting on conditioner in the shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Miracle...not quite, but I have been using it nightly as per instructions and it really has made my hair softer and more manageable. Plus it smells like salon products without the cost.&lt;br /&gt;VERY highly reccommend</li>
    <li> Nice overnight treatment for hair! I use a lot of home made hair masks, son this was a nice addition for when i don&#x27;t want to mess with mixing up some concoction!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I still haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. Granted, I don&#x27;t use it every day, just a few times a week. Maybe my hair isn&#x27;t in as bad of condition as I think it is, I don&#x27;t know. I will definitely update this if I notice a difference. I know my sister swears by it so maybe it only works on some times of hair. I&#x27;ve got thick, frizzy, wavy hair that I straighten the life out of every day. I also shower at night and put this in my hair when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim and it has made a significant difference. The serum is lightly scented and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair nor does it leave it feeling greasy, oily, or gummy. It&#x27;s been a great protector for my ends and provides daily moisture; I put on a couple of pumps each night and wake to smooth hair in the morning. Great for all hair types, I think--Mine is relaxed and fine.</li>
    <li> You might as well go to Lowe&#x27;s or Home Depot and get a tube of silicone and put it on your hair. Not healthy, not natural. It may make it look and feel good but it might be actually damaging your hair even more.</li>
    <li> I actually use this as a leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair that tends to get dry and frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and it&#x27;s really made a difference.  My hair is much smoother and more hydrated.  I was surprised by the mixed reviews, but like any product, everyone will react differently to it.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Keeps my hair strong and healthy! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Sorry I do  NOT recommend  Pantene Overnight Miracle,  this product is waste of  money, I feel very disappointed&lt;br /&gt; Thak you.&lt;br /&gt;  Mary</li>
    <li> I use this every night on my hair&lt;br /&gt;since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair looks less&lt;br /&gt;dry and coarse.. as you age you hair&lt;br /&gt;tends to be more dry&lt;br /&gt;this gives life back into my hair..</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and naturally wavy. I have never been satisfied with air drying because of the frizz. Not anymore. I use this nightly, before bed. It has completely eliminated the frizz, leaving my hair incredibly soft and manageable. I no longer feel the need to blow dry with a round brush. After 56 years, I am finally enjoying the waves in my hair. Being able to air dry also stops the hassle and damage of heat styling. I do not use the recommended shampoo or conditioner and, for me, it does not seem necessary. I paid less than $6 for the product at Walmart. It has done more for my hair than the pricey Alterna CC leave-in conditioner I bought at Sephora, although I like that product as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached platinum blonde so my ends are frizzy, and this leave-in conditioner makes them feel pretty soft again.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, slightly wavy, waist length hair. Lately I have been lightening it and dying so it has gotten a bit damaged, especially at the ends. I purchased this product in hopes that it would somehow make my hair healthier and it didn&#x27;t really do anything as promised. It&#x27;s basically a watered down conditioner-- there seems to be nothing special about it at all.. It made my hair slightly softer but nothing miraculous.. I can just use my normal conditioner as a leave in and get the same, if not better results.&lt;br /&gt;This product also had a slightly chemical/ammonia smell that I really didn’t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend; will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it would work at night and not in the day but it does leave my hair soft and shiny!! Don&#x27;t think it matter what time you use it lol.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for your hair and doesn&#x27;t even supply ample directions for proper use!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Usually I don&#x27;t buy drugstore products, because I&#x27;ve been told over and over how bad they are for your hair. Well, my fiance and I were going on a trip and I had just recently bleached and toned my hair, so it was really dry and felt like straw. I had forgotten to bring a hair serum along with me so I decided to pick this up as well as some other serums because they were cheap and I wanted to see which one would work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so I tried the others and they were okay, but this is what really helped my super dry hair, and it helped my hair way more than any of the other expensive hair lotions/oils/creams/serums that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before I bleached and toned my hair, my hair has always been very unruly. My hair is poofy, frizzy, and always feels dry despite anything I do to it, but now it&#x27;s so much better. (Still not perfect, but so much better than it was.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I love this stuff and I really hope they don&#x27;t stop making it, it&#x27;s been a long hair journey and I finally found something that really helps and isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Thank you Pantene. It gives hair a beautiful pearly shine. I apply it in layers to wet, towel dried hair and let it get air dry (it&#x27;s the best if you leave it overnight) and then continue with usual treatment which includes TRESemme Split Remedy and John Frieda Frizz Ease Hair Spray.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo, conditioner and overnight miracle repair serum for two nights and can&#x27;t believe I can actually see a difference in my long, color treated, dryed out hair! Love, Love, Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Product working well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and made my hair so shiny.</li>
    <li> High quality. Smells great. Works well. Good deal.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as the name says: a miracle. I have been desperate for a long time for something to breathe life back into my thin, burnt hair. I am a hair straightener addict and my hair, though naturally very greasy (I HAVE to wash every day), has been dry due to styling and recent weather. I found this bottle on the shelf at my grocery store and picked it up, thinking for the price it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as the directions said and used a single pump to cover the ends of my hair. It dried almost immediately, so my thoughts were that it had already failed, but at least I wouldn&#x27;t have a greasy pillow. Washed my hair the next morning, blow dried it, and was in shock. The dry ends that had looked frayed and dead just hours before, were shiny and smooth. My hair straightened much faster, and looked much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now a lifetime product for me. Thanks, Pantene.</li>
    <li> Ok, my hair was dry and frizzy mainly due to straightening so much and I didn&#x27;t really know what to do. And so one day, I saw this advertised on a little sign in the hair products isle in my local Fred&#x27;s store, so I thought &#x27;hey, I&#x27;m gonna have to give that a try sometime&#x27;, cause it looked promising. So finally I went to Walmart and was excited to purchase it. When I got home, that night I followed the directions and tried it. When I applied it, I started to feel like I was wasting my time and that there&#x27;s no way this product would work cause of the way it dried on my hair. So afterwards, I just went on to bed. The next morning, it wasn&#x27;t my wash day (I wash my hair about every other day) so I got ready to style my hair. And when I looked at my hair, I was amazed! My hair wasn&#x27;t dry or frizzy. It felt so silky smooth! I couldn&#x27;t believe it and I was so happy that I just had to get my mom so she could see and feel my hair. And I&#x27;ve been using it every night ever since. So now it&#x27;s been about a week and my hair is lovely! It&#x27;s super silky and looks and feels really healthy. My hair has never been this smooth.... ever! I&#x27;m so happy my eyes ran across that advertisement sign! I love this and once this runs out, I will definitely buy another one in a heart beat, but that won&#x27;t be any time soon because a little goes a long way! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way. It is moisturizing and helps keep my hair untangled but I feel like it gets absorbed too quickly and needs to reapplied nightly even if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day. Otherwise, I love how it makes my hair smell and how soft it makes my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have very brittle hair that gets split ends so easily, and for years I have been dreaming about being able to grow my hair out. I would give it a couple month and then be forced to cut it because the ends would be a mess. I found this product and decided to give it a shot, boy was I amazed! I put it on my hair (when it is damp after the shower) every night and then french braid it for bed. When I wash my hair the next morning it feels like it is a new head of hair! No more dry, breaking ends!:) I have not had to cut my hair in 3 months now, and have about 2 inches of extra length! Plus you couldn&#x27;t find a split end if you tried... I am in love :)</li>
    <li> Really is a miracle worker</li>
    <li> I needed a product to help with my damaged hair &amp; this one is great! All it takes is a little dot in the palm of your hand &amp; rub it in your hair before bed. The product didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily &amp; it had an amazing smell!</li>
    <li> This product works and smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> No dramatic difference, but it was not greasy and smells good.  I will continue to use it, and see if it helps!</li>
    <li> Makes my face sooooo soft! Love it</li>
    <li> A pretty big waste of money, though it was only $7 at Walmart. Bought it because I damaged my hair with baking soda - don&#x27;t ever use baking soda unless you want fried hair, again. I bleached my hair a few months ago and it was finally getting better, so when it got damaged again I was looking for a &#x27;miracle&#x27;. This is definitely not a miracle... I used a smooth therapy masque by Pantene before I let my hair air dry and put a ton of the Overnight Miracle in my hair because I noticed my hair still looked dry, untouched. And the product just absorbed in my hair. I felt no difference in my hair texture whatsoever, if there was the slightest difference ever.. it&#x27;s probably even more drier than it was. Yuck. Nice try but, not worth it. Glad some people had success with this. I&#x27;ll continue with my Loreal Damage Erasing Balm.</li>
    <li> After reading a ton of reviews on this product here on Amazon, I finally decided to purchase it in hopes of it working the wonders with my hair that I had read it had done for others. This winter, along with hormonal changes, has really pulled a number on my hair and the breakage/frayed ends have been simply unbelievable. That said, I generally only use salon products on my hair but had not been having any luck with anything I had tried so decided to go over the counter. The price on Amazon is the best that I have seen and this treatment definitely left my hair softer than it had been prior to use. I feel as though with a few more weeks of usage it should do about what I was looking for. It has a lot of work to do so for now it is getting 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I love pro-v repair. Unlike other products it does not leave my hair greasy and gross. Can&#x27;t wait to get more</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel salon perfect</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Not only does it repair and protect my hair, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Remarkable product! Noticeably different texture and shine after using one time overnight. I was shocked at how soft and silky my hair was. I recommend this product to anyone with hair that is frizzy, damaged, or just needing a little boost.</li>
    <li> So formally liking it especially since I have a lot of hair overall I feel like it does help prevent a little bit of the damage or repair it</li>
    <li> This product cost half the price in the store. Why are ya&#x27;ll selling this product at double the price? This product cost $6.99. It works good, but you should be ashamed to sell this product for that much.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions with great care, applying the conditioner only halfway up the hair shaft, but had an immediate reaction of elevated blood pressure and severe discomfort. It required two washings to get the product out of my hair and off the skin where it touched on my neck and face. I believe the chemicals in this conditioner are dangerous to many if not all and this product should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> Wow. I have waist length, very fine, blonde hair and am completely sick of people telling me that this conditioner or that condtioner is The Answer, and will leave my hair tangle free, full and shiny without leaving it greasy. In case you didn&#x27;t figure it out, I always have a greasy mess from my shoulders down, since that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m supposed to apply the recommended goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is different. You don&#x27;t apply it in handfuls, but in a few drops on cool, dry hair. It is supposed to sit overnight, then you can shampoo or style your hair in whatever way you want it style it.  For me, that means a good brushing, then a french braid. Last night I applied a whole three drops of this stuff on the ends my hands, then went to bed. This morning, my hair was tangle free, had no visible or touchable grease, and braiding it was a pleasure. I also applied a bit of this stuff to my daughter&#x27;s hip length hair, which is the same texture as mine. Her hair is lovely and tangle free. Instead of taking a half hour to comb her hair, she can comb it out in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very few products should be labeled as a &amp;#34;Miracle.&amp;#34; this is one of those few.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Called an overnight treatment, but I use it to refresh curls in the morning. Really the best curl refresher I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair.  No difference whatsoever.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It has done exactly what I was hoping for. My dry hair is now so much softer and shinier....after the first try! I no longer feel I absolutely have to straighten it before leaving the house to smooth it out. Great product for a great price, tried many expensive products without seeing a difference, bravo Pantene!</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love this product; even from the first application!  After moving to a humid climate for almost two years now, my long, fine, natural wavy/curly hair has been frizzy and just horrible to manage.  I used this the first night it arrived and really couldn&#x27;t believe the Instant results.  It only takes two pumps for my unruly hair, rubbing hands together and applying it from the ends up.  I distribute until it is all off my hands.  This absorbs into the hair instantly, staying on all night.  There is no greasy feel or stain on pillows.  It leaves my hair immediately feeling silky soft and smooth.  Will definitely buy more and definitely recommend!</li>
