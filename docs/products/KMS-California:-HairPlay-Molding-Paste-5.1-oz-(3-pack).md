      <li>Love this hair product!  </li>
      <li>Easy on your hair and great for styling it.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
      <li>hair handle nice mate finish&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
      <li>It has a nice hold that doesn&#x27;t shine.</li>
      <li>Very easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, ages throughout the day well, gives my hair nice shape and texture, and goes on easy.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a short haircut.</li>
      <li>I love the matte finish</li>
      <li>If you like a bit more bounce, HairPlay is where it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I love this KMS molding paste.</li>
      <li>But for me, this is a much better consistency than gel or pomade.</li>
      <li>Best use is when hair is completely dry.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery good price.</li>
      <li>Fast and free shipping and good price for 3.  </li>
      <li>Easy fix,</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, and this seller offered a good price on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great pomade-type product for keeping short cuts in place.</li>
      <li>If you liked the old KMS paste before the changes, try Sexy Hair Molding Paste--</li>
      <li>One tube is an easy 3-4 months worth.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;got2b is a cheaper, drugstore product, with great hold, but a bit too much shine for my current tastes.</li>
      <li>it leaves a dry look that is flexible with a better hold than most waxes.</li>
      <li>Not messy, easy to use.</li>
      <li>It gives body and texture to my hair that I could not achieve without this product (my hair wants to be very straight!)</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable too.</li>
      <li>FOR REAL!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS FOR MY SHORT HAIR.</li>
      <li>It is a great, thick hair paste in a convenient pump.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly return to this vendor for re-orders.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted for a decent price.</li>
      <li>Does not smell and holds really well.</li>
      <li>It is really pliable while adding texture and maintaining an all day hold.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy (regardless of how much you use), and it holds very well (hairspray recommended for a locked-in hold, though).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly like the old KMS paste.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another good thing is that I got the new packaging (light green tube with black cap, as shown in the picture).</li>
      <li>But once I get my hair trimmed up, I go right back to the HairPlay.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it .</li>
      <li>/&gt;HairPlay is pretty similar to Redken Rewind 06, though I find it has a softer hold.</li>
      <li>it look natural</li>
      <li>and I cannot find anything better at least for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product; I have frizzy thick hair</li>
      <li>This is good because a previous purchase of KMS Hairplay of product in the old packaging from a different seller was a little hit-or-miss, as sometimes you can get a tube with product that feels a bit gritty.</li>
      <li>One of the only products that I have ever found that actually holds my hair for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;If applied wet</li>
      <li>The bottles I received are the vomit green colored ones with the black cap, which is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> It&#x27;s the only thing I have found for my thick, straight hair that provides hold without feeling gross.</li>
<li> cheap places to expensive places.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dry by default, but versatile because you can get the wet look by simply adding water.</li>
<li> applied dry</li>
<li> still keep a can of American Crew&#x27;s Pomade for when my hair gets a bit long and KMS can&#x27;t quite tame it.</li>
<li> I have short, choppy hair.</li>
<li> After decades of using various/random products that I would pick off the shelf for no real reason I had a hair stylist that put this in after a haircut</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually rocking a  faux hawk or short updo look, and over the past decade have used Redken Rewind 06, got2b glued, American Crew Pomade, and currently using KMS</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, and I keep coming back.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> If you are older or have drier hair, this is not a good product at all!    </li>
<li> It goes on without any mess and holds my hair without it looking like I&#x27;m using any product.</li>
<li> All I can share is that I ended p getting three containers of product for not more than 50% off.</li>
<li> You squirt a small amount in your hands - rub hands together and run fingers through hair - piecing it up and defining the hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this past for over a decade.  </li>
<li> This product has changed over time and has become very thick, matte and has an odd smell.  </li>
<li> IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE AN ICKY FEEL TO IT.</li>
<li> This product is thick like toothpaste.</li>
<li> Not sure if they have just been on the shelf too long from these online vendors, or if it is a tragic flaw in the product packaging.</li>
<li> Hard to find!</li>

    <li> i been using this product for years&lt;br /&gt;exellent hair handle nice mate finish&lt;br /&gt;makes it look natural&lt;br /&gt;nice price  and exellent size</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOR MY SHORT HAIR. IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE AN ICKY FEEL TO IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this past for over a decade.  It is really pliable while adding texture and maintaining an all day hold.  I love the matte finish so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Been using KMS for some time now. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> One of the only products that I have ever found that actually holds my hair for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;If applied wet it gives a good slicked gelled effect.&lt;br /&gt;If applied dry it leaves a dry look that is flexible with a better hold than most waxes.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years and love it. Replaces my Guido hair gel.</li>
    <li> Great product and great execution of delivery</li>
    <li> I always buy this product. Fast delivery good price. Easy on your hair and great for styling it. I have been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair in place, non-greasy. Arrived quickly. THe bottles have different labeling than the picture. Picture should be updated on the website. Great product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great price and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> KMS packaging for this product changed a couple years ago, but this product image didn&#x27;t.  Rest assured, it comes in the newer packaging, and isn&#x27;t just a stockpile of &amp;#62; 2 year-old goo.  So yeah, it really is a good price compared to others on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, Husband loves this product. Hold and molds his style great. Very easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> I have short, choppy hair. I LOVVVVE this product. I hope they never stop making it! You squirt a small amount in your hands - rub hands together and run fingers through hair - piecing it up and defining the hair. NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS PRODUCT. NOTHING! When I go to salons and they don&#x27;t have it - then they say such and such product is similar to this.....NOOOO..... This product is thick like toothpaste. You can make your hair do anything and it keeps its hold. I get my hair cut all over...cheap places to expensive places. I get compliments ALL THE TIME on my hair and people ask if I&#x27;m a hair stylist. I put this product in and my hair is done in 30 SECONDS! FOR REAL! THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. Two thumbs up! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I recieved my order in a timely manner and everything arrived in perfect condition. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now.  Always reliable and of excellent quality.  This price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only thing I have found for my thick, straight hair that provides hold without feeling gross.</li>
    <li> This product has changed over time and has become very thick, matte and has an odd smell.  I also have scalp issues which causes bumps like zits.  This product no longer comes with different levels of shine or matte finish--it&#x27;s only one choice now, all matte. If you are older or have drier hair, this is not a good product at all!    If you liked the old KMS paste before the changes, try Sexy Hair Molding Paste--it&#x27;s exactly like the old KMS paste.  It has a bit of shine, lots of hold and great smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my hair type I&#x27;ve ever found . Can&#x27;t live without it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, and I keep coming back. It&#x27;s non-greasy (regardless of how much you use), and it holds very well (hairspray recommended for a locked-in hold, though). It&#x27;s dry by default, but versatile because you can get the wet look by simply adding water. The price is very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> ... who cares! Still a great product. The bottles I received are the vomit green colored ones with the black cap, which is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually rocking a  faux hawk or short updo look, and over the past decade have used Redken Rewind 06, got2b glued, American Crew Pomade, and currently using KMS HairPlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HairPlay is pretty similar to Redken Rewind 06, though I find it has a softer hold. If you like a stiffer product, Rewind is great. If you like a bit more bounce, HairPlay is where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got2b is a cheaper, drugstore product, with great hold, but a bit too much shine for my current tastes. KMS has zero greasiness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still keep a can of American Crew&#x27;s Pomade for when my hair gets a bit long and KMS can&#x27;t quite tame it. But once I get my hair trimmed up, I go right back to the HairPlay.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts forever, doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, ages throughout the day well, gives my hair nice shape and texture, and goes on easy.</li>
    <li> I use this product to style my short hair. It gives body and texture to my hair that I could not achieve without this product (my hair wants to be very straight!) Highly recommended, and this seller offered a good price on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is that I got the new packaging (light green tube with black cap, as shown in the picture). This is good because a previous purchase of KMS Hairplay of product in the old packaging from a different seller was a little hit-or-miss, as sometimes you can get a tube with product that feels a bit gritty. It must be an ingredient crystallizing out of the gel. I think getting the freshest product possible minimizes this possibility.</li>
    <li> Love this hair product!  Hard to find!</li>
    <li> Perfect for me.  Best use is when hair is completely dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product; I have frizzy thick hair and this tames the hair.  Fast and free shipping and good price for 3.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost three years and I cannot find anything better at least for my hair. Does not smell and holds really well.</li>
    <li> I love this KMS molding paste. After decades of using various/random products that I would pick off the shelf for no real reason I had a hair stylist that put this in after a haircut and I&#x27;ve been using ever since (a couple of years). I think whether something works or not is totally dependent on the type of hair you have and how you style it so opinions are subjective. But for me, this is a much better consistency than gel or pomade. It goes on without any mess and holds my hair without it looking like I&#x27;m using any product.</li>
    <li> I by this all the time.  It is a great, thick hair paste in a convenient pump.  But almost every time I get it, the pump is clogged with dried gel and I have to open the whole mechanism, force out the clog and re-prime the pump to get it to work.  Not sure if they have just been on the shelf too long from these online vendors, or if it is a tragic flaw in the product packaging. Easy fix, but on my 6th bottle with the same problem from different online vendors.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for a decent price. I&#x27;ve used a lot of prducts but this is my go-to. It has a nice hold that doesn&#x27;t shine. Perfect for a short haircut. One tube is an easy 3-4 months worth.</li>
    <li> Biggest issue with hair products? ..... Price. All I can share is that I ended p getting three containers of product for not more than 50% off. This is a great pomade-type product for keeping short cuts in place. Delivery was as promised. I&#x27;ll certainly return to this vendor for re-orders.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... never had an issue. Will continue to buy. Not messy, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great price and product</li>
