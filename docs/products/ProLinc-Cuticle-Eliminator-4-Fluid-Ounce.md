      <li>If it does, wipe it off quickly.</li>
      <li>It will sting mildly if there are any cuts on your fingers.</li>
      <li>I like the product, it really softens my cuticle, making it easy to do my manicure.</li>
      <li>It really softens your cuticles and u can just scrape it away so easily</li>
      <li>I found this product here on amazon at such an amazing price, I could resist.</li>
      <li>Worth a try</li>
      <li>I have gotten enough chemical burns from this product and Callus Eliminator to know that both are damn effective.</li>
      <li>My right thumb ALWAYS has a build up of excess skin</li>
      <li>When you put it on your cuticles just soften and lift right up.</li>
      <li>Makes cuticles soft and easy to remove excess.</li>

      <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Now I have to start over just when I was starting to get my nails healthy again.</li>
      <li>My first application and it tingled a bit, and then I used an orange stick to remove and excess cuticle.</li>
      <li>A lot better than using it from the big bottle.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t leave on too long, it&#x27;s strong stuff!</li>
      <li>Easy to squeeze on, doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate open skin, and turns cuticles into gooey mush within a minute or so.</li>
      <li>Who would make such a strong product.  </li>
      <li>For many years I have used an empty mechanical pencil to dig in there to remove the unwanted tissue around the cuticle.</li>
      <li>This really helps get rid of the cuticle on your nails.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;eliminate&amp;#34; cuticle as the name suggests.  </li>
      <li>Thanks item as described</li>
      <li>This works well but also damages the nails (but not as much as the Dremel).</li>
      <li>recently I started doing my own gel nails and found the polish lifting at the cuticle, especially on my toe nails.</li>
      <li>I have used other products in the past that seem more effective</li>
      <li>Only thing I&#x27;d like would be a smaller opening at the tip for more precise placement, because this is a big bottle</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like to do my own nails but have a hard time trimming back the cuticle. This stuff works great. Follow the instructions and do not leave it on your nails longer than the 45 seconds. I do one hand at a time. I tend to pick at my cuticles so they are almost always ragged looking. A nervous habit, I guess. So this product helps to give them a clean look before I polish.</li>
    <li> Works great! My nails look beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love it ,that&#x27;s save my time.</li>
    <li> Best cuticle remover on the market.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really works as expected</li>
    <li> It removed the cuticles fine but dries out my nail beds badly.</li>
    <li> Cuticle Eliminator is awesome I received it yesterday and used it immediately. I had thick dry cuticles and this removed it all. Now my feet and hands look great.</li>
    <li> I will not be using any other cuticle eliminator again. I tried a few over the years. This one does the job right and easy. It works great and price is right. Very economical. You have to be careful for the liquid not to get on the skin. If it does, wipe it off quickly. I have a small container with a very narrow  opening and I put this liquid into it. A lot better than using it from the big bottle.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and the results look professional.  Good way do your own nails at home at  a low cost.</li>
    <li> My hands take a lot of abuse as a nurse. I wash or use alcohol based hand sanitizer at least 50-75 times a day. My cuticles are dry and I get bad hangnails. I use this for about 45-60 seconds them push back the cuticle. Them wash it off with soap and a nail brush followed but trimming the cuticle with a trimmer. No more terrible hangnails!! Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use on broken skin, hang nails. Don&#x27;t leave on too long, it&#x27;s strong stuff! It does a great job!</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully, and quickly too!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Makes cuticles soft and easy to remove excess. Not too liquidy, so it doesn&#x27;t make a huge mess when you use it</li>
    <li> I like the product, it really softens my cuticle, making it easy to do my manicure.</li>
    <li> I still notice that my cuticles are a bit torn looking which I had hoped it would get rid of... not sure if my nails are worse for it or not but the dead skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be affected much even if I had used a nail stick as well to push back.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for me. I&#x27;ve tried it twice in 2 days and nothing. Ive let it stay on for 45 seconds and even for a minute and my cuticles are still there. The shipping however was great right on time and was neatly packed thats why I&#x27;m giving one star.</li>
    <li> Works well enough that a simple orange stick will take off the residue - metal pushers are overkill!  Only thing I&#x27;d like would be a smaller opening at the tip for more precise placement, because this is a big bottle and it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out more than you want - but practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> I have very fast growing cuticles and I am always looking for a product that will help. unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for years and I love it. I do want to warn people that if you let it sit on your nails for too long, it will turn yellow and slightly stain your nails. If that happens, big the nails like you normally would and then wash your hands and it should come off.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave this on your nail beds too long, I think it will eat away at your actual nails it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
    <li> It works as expected.  It is a great product and  I LOVE it.  I would buy it again. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s extremely thick so it doesn&#x27;t run down your fingers.  It softens the cuticle very quickly. It didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive fingers.  A little hoes a long way. I think this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of cuticles, and my nails look beautiful. Must be used weekly in order to achieve full results. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> works exactly as in salon, did not even soak the feet, left for 4 min, worked like magic amazing results, loved it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;eliminate&amp;#34; cuticle as the name suggests.  However, it  keep it softer and easier to trim.</li>
    <li> I have always done my own manicures at home and thought my cuticles were under control. recently I started doing my own gel nails and found the polish lifting at the cuticle, especially on my toe nails. I found this product here on amazon at such an amazing price, I could resist. Let me tell you, this stuff is worth its weight in gold! My first application and it tingled a bit, and then I used an orange stick to remove and excess cuticle. It appears, my nails were not as clean as I had previously thought. Sof ar, my manicure and pedicure have lasted already days longer then before. I will never go without this again!</li>
    <li> This is a watery product that did not eliminate cuticles and it stained my nails. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Very strong so don&#x27;t leave it on too long until you see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
    <li> Save money on manicures/ pedicures and buy this. It&#x27;s easy to use and makes your nails look great and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> REALLY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, TYVM!</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. Worth a try</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but has too many chemicals in it for my liking</li>
    <li> Thanks item as described</li>
    <li> Easy to squeeze on, doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate open skin, and turns cuticles into gooey mush within a minute or so. This is the first thing I reach for before starting any manicure, and I&#x27;ll never go back to cutting my cuticles again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It really softens your cuticles and u can just scrape it away so easily and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  This is the first I&#x27;ve tried so I have nothing to compare it to.  I was afraid it would burn or something but it&#x27;s great.  Works for fingers and toes.. also you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Holy s***, this stuff is amazing! Use it and you will have cuticles of the gods!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions EXACTLY and it did nothing what-so-ever ! It didn&#x27;t even soften up my cuticles so that I could push them back with an orange stick ! I just don&#x27;t get the great reviews on this stuff ! I am light complected so it is not like my skin is extra tough or anything. IT IS VERY RUNNY AND HARD TO NOT GET IT BEYOND CUTICLE AREA !!! Such a big let down because I have about 1/8&#x27; or so growth on several nails and if anyone needed this stuff to work, I do :-(</li>
    <li> In a few minutes this formula did soften the cuticles in order for me to work on my toe nails!</li>
    <li> BEST cuticle remover ever.</li>
    <li> I have used many cuticle removers, and this product is the best one I have found. It works great in removing excess skin on your nails.  Just put a very small amount on each nail and seconds later you are ready to use a tool to push back and remove the excess skin.  Bottle is 4 oz, and it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.  Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> First of all, they stuck the barcode on top of a portion of the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; making it difficult to know exactly what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you put the stuff on the cuticle you wish to remove and wait at least 45sec.  Then you push the cuticle back with an orange stick or something to loosen it from the nail.  It appears the cuticle is gone, but in fact, the product has just made it transparent.  Once you wash your hands and dry them good, you&#x27;ll see the dead skin is still there.  You are not supposed to need cuticle clippers with this stuff, but I DID have to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the applicator tip is flat and stubby so it&#x27;s hard to precisely apply the product.  It should be narrow and pointed (like hair color applicators) so that you can easily trace the cuticle and not get the stuff where you don&#x27;t want it.  I&#x27;m not impressed and won&#x27;t buy this again.  I&#x27;ll try some cuticle oil to hydrate instead.</li>
    <li> Works outstanding. No burning my skin like some reviews state.</li>
    <li> absolute best cuticle remover made. just apply, leave on for a few seconds and removal is so easy. sometimes i even just use a nail scrubber afterwards and my cuticles come off almost perfectly.</li>
    <li> Is this stuff even supposed to be available to the general public? The label says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;For professionals only.&amp;#34; The instructions say to leave it on for only about 45 seconds, don&#x27;t get it on normal skin, and if it gets into your eye, deluge the eye for several minutes. This sounds like a don&#x27;t-try-this-at-home product that should be used only by trained professionals who know what they&#x27;re doing. I really wonder if it&#x27;s on the gray market, similarly to products that are supposed to be available only from salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed it without attempting to use it.</li>
    <li> This really helps get rid of the cuticle on your nails. I let it sit for about 45-50 seconds and use the end of a metal nail file to remove the cuticle. It works really well and helps my hands looking great. Also, this bottle is a good size so this stuff will last you a while! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> All of the Be Natural products are awesome, including this one.  I use their products for heels, and they are the best I have found for dry cracking heels.  Be careful, though, and follow the directions for the cuticle remover.  This stuff is pretty strong.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It worked great. All I did was dab on my cuticles and wait. It was that easy. It really is great when I do a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed nail technician for more than 18 years and worked for a beauty distributor that sold salon exclusive products. Part of my job was to test new nail products and this product is excellent. Just apply a small amount to the cuticle area and leave on for 45 seconds for well maintained nails. If your cuticles have been neglected or you have thicker cuticles then leave on for two minutes. Your cuticles will be soft and ready to be pushed back. Keep in mind, your cuticle will not always be removed as the overgrowth may still be attached to the nailplate that sits just under the cuticle and it will be necessary to take a cuticle nipper and nip that ways - do not cut your cuticle! Just remove the excess overgrowth still attached to the nailplate. In addition,  if you have callus on your feet their other product is Callus Eliminator and it removes the dry dead skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe - insane how well it works with little effort.</li>
    <li> Works awesome! Thanks so much for a great product!! Takes off all the dead cuticle. It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle!</li>
    <li> it does just what it says it will. it takes me only a few minutes to have my nails and pedicure done. i love it.</li>
    <li> Good for any manicure kit!</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this product and I love it. Thought I could save some money by doing my own nails, just needed the right tools. When you put it on your cuticles just soften and lift right up.</li>
    <li> this product is ok, i give 3/5 only because i expected that i won&#x27;t need any further manipulation to have a clean nail without cuticle ( i steel use scissores to  remove cuticle).</li>
    <li> It worked better on my toes because there I do not clip or cut, not so much on my hands because those cuticles grow like crazy as I am used to cutting, but I will use this every other week in the hopes of re-training my cuticles and never cutting again. It&#x27;s a big bottle and a great price!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a medical nail specialist. For clients with excessive, abnormal growth of the cuticle this product works wonders. I definitely do not recommend purchasing and using this product at home though since it can (and will) burn through layers of the skin if used improperly. I have used this product (and Callus Eliminator) for a long time. For those reviewers that have stated that the product \\&quot;didn&#x27;t work,\\&quot; they MUST have gotten a bad bottle. I have gotten enough chemical burns from this product and Callus Eliminator to know that both are damn effective.</li>
    <li> This is my first liquid cuticle eliminator and I have to say that I am very impressed with ProLinc Cuticle Eliminator. It does do what it claims and anybody saying anything else about this product doesn&#x27;t use it properly. It will sting mildly if there are any cuts on your fingers. The cuticle does not just disappear magically, ProLinc Cuticle Eliminator is best used with a cuticle pusher and a cuticle curette to actually remove the excess tissue around the cuticle. I use all kinds of tools to get rid of the dry skin around my nails. My right thumb ALWAYS has a build up of excess skin and I am CONSTANLY removing it. I have a Dremel especially for nails but if you touch the actual nail it will damage it and when my nails grow out they will chip and break. For many years I have used an empty mechanical pencil to dig in there to remove the unwanted tissue around the cuticle. This works well but also damages the nails (but not as much as the Dremel). Where ProLinc Cuticle Eliminator is most useful to me is it eliminates the step of me having to use the mechanical pencil to get rid of the excess skin and now my nails are healthier. I do recommend this product but you will have to get the proper tools to use with it.</li>
    <li> This product  deserves a minus negative star.  Who would make such a strong product.  It removed my cuticle and ate away my nails too. They became thin and took on a different shape after using the  product one time.&lt;br /&gt;***Worse it appears to keep working after it has been removed days even weeks later my cuticles were still continuing  to shrink. And my nails kept changing from their normal shape to what I see now.  Ugly, unrecognizable nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hope this helps someone before they buy it.  Now I have to start over just when I was starting to get my nails healthy again.</li>
    <li> This worked okay but I was hoping for a better result. Perhaps you need thicker cuticles to start with?? I have used other products in the past that seem more effective</li>
