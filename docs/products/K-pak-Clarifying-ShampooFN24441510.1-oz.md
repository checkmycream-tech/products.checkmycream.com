      <li>Full, shiny, weightless, and just beautiful.</li>
      <li>But I honestly could not imagine being anymore impressed with any product I&#x27;ve used in recent years.</li>
      <li>Feels soft and amazing and smells SO GOOD!</li>
      <li>and it does a better job.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>top of that</li>

      <li>Fast Shipping and a great product.</li>
      <li>Love this removes product build up, .and</li>
      <li>I love the reconstructor though.</li>
      <li>and I woke up this morning with silky smooth hair!</li>
      <li>I will be checking out more Joico products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo regularly for a year or two now, and am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I literally can&#x27;t stop touching it and telling all my friends about it.</li>
      <li>but I had an allergic reaction to it, so this one is much better for my scalp.</li>
      <li>Joico gets your hair clean and after I put in my staple hair products, they worked EVEN better than before!</li>
      <li>it sure gets your hair clean!</li>
      <li>This shampoo has been pretty good.</li>
      <li>Come clean better...</li>
      <li>With the treatment, my hair is super soft and beautiful afterwards.</li>
      <li>thats fine</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my hair</li>
      <li>Great to use before a deep conditioning</li>
      <li>Realistically being natural I need the good stuff.</li>
      <li>The products scent is nice and light and I&#x27;ve noticed that, even though it doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather, it really works.</li>
      <li>Most people stop washing frequently but, it is more important that your scalp is clean.</li>
      <li>So I bought this clarifying shampoo because I&#x27;m getting ready to run an Olaplex treatment in my hair and wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t have significant amounts of build up to stop the treatment from working.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful weekly shampoo to use if you have hard water.</li>
      <li>and now it feels like hair again, shiny and full of life.</li>
      <li>this shampoo is very stripping, so if you have relaxed hair, I recommend use at most twice a month.</li>
      <li>so this is a good middle ground for me to use once a week or so.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and isn&#x27;t too harsh for a clarifying product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel much &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; or anything special.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says it does: removes the surface and mineral build-up from my hair leaving it soft and easy to detangle.</li>
      <li>I have super straight hair that requires a lot of products</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for hard water.</li>
      <li>I have real hair again!</li>
      <li>Also drone fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It worked the first time.</li>
      <li>After some research, I discovered that a chelating clarifier would do the trick-not so, if anything it made my hair feel more coarse and sticky than ever.  </li>
      <li>This chelating shampoo helps to combat the products from staying on my hair and leaves it feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing a new bottle right away and use it as soon as it comes in.</li>
      <li>When I put the shampoo in the first time it was decent</li>
      <li>I try not to use it too much - maybe once a week.</li>
      <li>This really does work.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It really cleans and detoxifiies my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a similar one that is sulfate free</li>
      <li>and it really does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was nervous about buying online, but this is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Warning, this kind of treatment is to remove build-up only, not for daily use.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice anything special after several days</li>
      <li>how much is because of the new conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing shampoo if you have hard water buildup.</li>
      <li>I had a serious issue with my hair not feeling very clean and my usual products not working as good as they used to.  </li>
      <li>The static has calmed down slightly, but I also switched to a better conditioner at the same time I started using this shampoo, so I don&#x27;t know how much I can contribute to this shampoo and</li>
      <li>Remember to do a deep conditioning treatment right after.</li>
      <li>My hair feels brand new.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair dry, not squeaky clean and soft like Giovanni.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft and silky without stripping the color.</li>
      <li>I saw a big difference in my hair after I used it the first time.</li>
      <li>For those unfamiliar with the product, the name has changed from chelating shampoo to clarifying, but it is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>so I bought this shampoo and tried it out last night for the first time</li>
      <li>After rinsing, the only thing left is clean hair.</li>
      <li>For the record, my hair is baby fine, wavy, dry and low density</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair that gets really dry, so I end up using a lot of conditioning products and don&#x27;t shampoo my hair very often.</li>
      <li>We have hard well water, and I use this 2 to 3 times per week, it keeps my hair free of build up!</li>
      <li>It is lifting from the least amount of dyed area to the most.</li>
      <li>Hair done and soft as butter, even after putting my hask</li>
      <li>, I have incredibly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>soft hair is like showing you guys what pain looks like in a knee, I CANT</li>
      <li>leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I am jumping the gun being that today is the first day, IDC, I will come back and update,maybe with a pic to show my results following using this shampoo, but I must say, showing you guys</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair seemed to have a lot of mineral build-up in it, and one shampoo with Joico got rid of a lot of the build-up.   Instead of feeling like straw, my hair felt like hair again.  :)</li>
    <li> I live in hard water area, in MI, so i needed a chelating shampoo. this shampoo is very stripping, so if you have relaxed hair, I recommend use at most twice a month. But it is great, it works well, and I love it.</li>
    <li> We have hard well water, and I use this 2 to 3 times per week, it keeps my hair free of build up!</li>
    <li> LIve in Tempe, AZ and the hard water in my complex is tough on my hair. I read online that this helps to strip the mineral build up. It worked great.. I try not to use it too much - maybe once a week. I saw a big difference in my hair after I used it the first time. I now interchange this shampoo with my usual and it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and a great product. This shampoo smells great and isn&#x27;t too harsh for a clarifying product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful weekly shampoo to use if you have hard water. My hair was starting to feel like gross plastic dried out doll hair before I found this and now it feels like hair again, shiny and full of life. I had purchased this based on the reveiws and so very glad I did! For the record, my hair is baby fine, wavy, dry and low density and I use cleansing conditioner for my daily wash and this once a week.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for hard water. Leaves my hair very soft and silky without stripping the color.</li>
    <li> This is a necessity for anyone with blond highlights who does not want her hair to turn orange.  My municipal water has  high iron content and this shampoo keeps the highlights white and yellow.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i have hard water, and my hair sucks because of it.  After some research, I discovered that a chelating clarifier would do the trick-not so, if anything it made my hair feel more coarse and sticky than ever.  Perhaps it works fine to remove product build up, but for my purposes, it is just useless</li>
    <li> Awesome Will be buying more of this!!!! Works great on pool hair with no dye. DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR COLORED HAIR. I use it for my kids when they get out of the pool.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shampoo if you have hard water buildup. I&#x27;ve used it for four years, and it&#x27;s wonderful. Gets rid of the mineral buildup from even the hardest water.</li>
    <li> I have used it 3/4 times. It appears to be lifting the black dye rinse I have been using for years. It is lifting from the least amount of dyed area to the most. i will definitely continue with another bottle. This product is also good for people who are going through menopause of with thinning hair. Most people stop washing frequently but, it is more important that your scalp is clean.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, cleans well, didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling awful or stripped. Feels soft and amazing and smells SO GOOD! I&#x27;m trying to get away from sulfites and silicones but have seriously hard water so this is a good middle ground for me to use once a week or so.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything special after several days</li>
    <li> love this Shampoo! it sure gets your hair clean!</li>
    <li> So I bought this clarifying shampoo because I&#x27;m getting ready to run an Olaplex treatment in my hair and wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t have significant amounts of build up to stop the treatment from working. I was a little worried it would dry out my already damaged, over-prossessed hair. But I honestly could not imagine being anymore impressed with any product I&#x27;ve used in recent years. My hair feels brand new. Full, shiny, weightless, and just beautiful. I literally can&#x27;t stop touching it and telling all my friends about it. Do yourself a favor and cycle this into your hair care routine once a week. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It worked the first time. I have real hair again! I am impressed with this product. I live in a place with hard water and my hair was constantly greasy, now its static-crazy but thats normal.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of product in my hair so that it keeps its shape and this shampoo works great - without stripping your hair or dulling hair color/highlights,</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great! I recently moved to an area with really hard water and my hair was looking and feeling gross. Straw-like and greasy and dry at the same time. Eck! I saw all the good reviews so I bought this shampoo and tried it out last night for the first time and I woke up this morning with silky smooth hair! Thankkk goooodness I found something that works!</li>
    <li> I had a serious issue with my hair not feeling very clean and my usual products not working as good as they used to.  A hair website recommended this shampoo and my hair felt  SOOOOOO clean!!! A little warning though: if you have African American hair, you do not want to use this for EVERY wash; maybe once every 3 months or every other month if your hair is prone to building up product in your hair (another idea is to change to products that don&#x27;t leave residue, but that&#x27;s another subject). Joico gets your hair clean and after I put in my staple hair products, they worked EVEN better than before!</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t totally hate it, not the same as the other Joico products.  I don&#x27;t feel much &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; or anything special.  Bought a bottle of Suave&#x27;s clarifying for $1.09 and it does a better job.  I love the reconstructor though.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It cleans well. It is not stripping as some other reviews suggested. The only problem is that the benefits don&#x27;t last long - I have to use it at least once a week. As soon as I start using my regular shampoo the buildup on my hair returns.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 3 months, and each time I use it my hair feels stronger and healthier.</li>
    <li> Good product if you&#x27;ve got a lot of stuff to get out of your hair. I would definitely buy it again. Packaging was quite poor, however. The bottle leaked all over by the time it reached me. I lost probably an ounce or two.</li>
    <li> Use this once a week!</li>
    <li> Joico #1 I have been using Joico&#x27;s products for many years!......Also drone fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I research everything I put in my hair! I researched this because I live in NY, Hard water is as hard as it can get. But, its given me 25 yrs of good health. Realistically being natural I need the good stuff. I am african american and I have thick hair that tends to knot when I wear it in an afro and thats fine but I need it to be cleansed not breaking off before I even put my conditioner in my hair. So anyway, I reasearched this for 3 weeks, i needed the ins and the outs of this product before I committed. I purchased from ebay, I purchased 5 four ounce bottles of this stuff for twenty, just in case I hated it and wanted to give it away, I&#x27;d have bottles to give for travel use! So I tried it today and followed with a moisturizing conditioner, mane n tail deep moisturizing conditioner. When I put the shampoo in the first time it was decent, I pre-poo&#x27;d the night before so I was on the money to start a shampoo, however the second shampoo got me! I scrubed my scalp really good with my finger tips then I combed my hair with the shampoo in it and left on for 3 minute. Whew, what a nice feeling!!!! When I rinsed I wasn&#x27;t sure it was all out, I kept rinsing and rinsing thinking omg my hair cant be this soft after only shampooing and got dang, it was! So once I stopped the madness with rinsing and did my deep conditioning for about 2 hrs w/just a shower cap on, no heating pad. Voila! Hair done and soft as butter, even after putting my hask placenta leave in, curls unleashed leave in and kinky curly knot today leave in then sealed with argan oil, my hair is still soft!&lt;br /&gt;Yes I am jumping the gun being that today is the first day, IDC, I will come back and update,maybe with a pic to show my results following using this shampoo, but I must say, showing you guys soft hair is like showing you guys what pain looks like in a knee, I CANT but I can show you the health and shine!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TTYS, with an update!!!</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from sulfate shampoos but this is the one exception. We have well water which is very hard and can leave a lot of residue on our hair. We use this every once in a while and it cleans all of the mineral deposits and styling product build up from our hair and scalp. Great to use before a deep conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I ran out of this shampoo a few months ago and didn&#x27;t reorder quickly.  What a mistake!  I can definitely see and feel the difference in my hair. I will be purchasing a new bottle right away and use it as soon as it comes in. This really does work.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using a similar one that is sulfate free but I had an allergic reaction to it, so this one is much better for my scalp. It does what it says it does: removes the surface and mineral build-up from my hair leaving it soft and easy to detangle. Warning, this kind of treatment is to remove build-up only, not for daily use. If you use it daily expect to have very dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Good product but I like Kinky Curly Come clean better...This will leave hair feeling striped to dealth but it do what as advertized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo regularly for a year or two now, and am very happy with it.  We are on well water.  This water is so hard that we have to use vinegar in every single load of dishes or it leaves a chalky build-up.  I use this shampoo once or twice a week and it really does wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I have incredibly sensitive skin.  I usually have to use natural hair-care products from the health-food store, because the typical brands you can buy at the drug store make my skin very unhappy.  This shampoo does not give me any reactions, nothing short of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, somehow it does NOT seem like a very harsh shampoo either.  It cuts through the mineral build-up and excess oils, but does not strip my hair, make it dry or brittle etc.  My hair actually grew down to my tail-bone while I was using this shampoo, a first for me.  (I&#x27;ve since cut it back to bra-strap length because I hurt my back last winter and the long hair was too much for me to handle)</li>
    <li> This is a good clarifying shampoo. It does the job. Cleans the scalp. I only use this once a month or after a chemical process.</li>
    <li> This is chelating shampoo at its best.  It really cleans and detoxifiies my hair.  I use it 1-3 times per month.</li>
    <li> Love this removes product build up, .and leaves hair soft and manageable. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have super straight hair that requires a lot of products so it doesn&#x27;t look super flat and limp. Of course, after time, the product build up takes a toll as well as the hard water we have in our home. I use this shampoo once of every two weeks and it does it&#x27;s job well. Remember to do a deep conditioning treatment right after. It works so well that my hair feels extremely dry as soon as I rinse it, being stripped of everything. With the treatment, my hair is super soft and beautiful afterwards. The products scent is nice and light and I&#x27;ve noticed that, even though it doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather, it really works. For those unfamiliar with the product, the name has changed from chelating shampoo to clarifying, but it is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, buy Giovanni. They are great clarifying products. Leaves hair dry, not squeaky clean and soft like Giovanni.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clarifying shampoo that thoroughly cleans hair, lathers nicely, and smells great. I use this once a week since I use a lot of styling product, and it stops any build-up.  A little of this product goes a long way. I follow the directions on the bottle with a wash, rinse, and repeat, leaving the product on my hair for 2 minutes during the second wash. After rinsing, the only thing left is clean hair.</li>
    <li> I definitely will buy this again, my hair has once again regained it&#x27;s volume and lustre. I will be checking out more Joico products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been pretty good. I bought it for its chelating properties (it says it chelates hard water minerals if you leave it in for several minutes). I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my hair (I use it once a week) but it does seem to make my hair look and feel slightly healthier. I have a huge problem with staticy hair because I live in a very dry climate with hard water. The static has calmed down slightly, but I also switched to a better conditioner at the same time I started using this shampoo, so I don&#x27;t know how much I can contribute to this shampoo and how much is because of the new conditioner. But my hair does seem a bit nicer the day or so after I use this!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the product shown in the picture. The product I received mentions nothing about chelating at all, unlike the product image and description of the Amazon page.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo 2-4 times a month for the past year and a half. It&#x27;s great. I have very curly hair that gets really dry, so I end up using a lot of conditioning products and don&#x27;t shampoo my hair very often. This chelating shampoo helps to combat the products from staying on my hair and leaves it feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Definitely added a shine to my hair, without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from my hairstylist before.  I was nervous about buying online, but this is the real deal.  Works great.</li>
