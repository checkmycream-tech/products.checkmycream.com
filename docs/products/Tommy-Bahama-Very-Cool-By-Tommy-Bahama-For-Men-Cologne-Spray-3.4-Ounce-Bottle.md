      <li>Nice clean/fresh smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>I was given this cologne as gift 2 years ago and really liked it.</li>
      <li>The bottle was also nothing like the one pictured or one I own, though it bore the name.  </li>
      <li>but it is a much heavier scent &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell very good at all!</li>
      <li>Nice bottle too.</li>

      <li>Came in perfect condition no regrets!!</li>
      <li>Tommy Bahama&#x27;s Very Cool is a nice smelling fragrance to wear here in south Florida or in any tropical climate.</li>

      <li>Love cologne for hubby.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite Cologne that my husband has.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE COLOGNES FOR TOMMY BAHAMA</li>
      <li>My dad loved his gift,it smelled fresh and modern,light notes.</li>
      <li>my favorite cologne</li>
      <li>There are many &amp;#34;less expensive&amp;#34; knock-offs of well known name brand fragrances, which have found their way into the Amazon marketplace.</li>
      <li>and I have to love it to buy it again, but</li>
      <li>will probably not buy colognes on line again, but resort to purchasing them in person to make sure the scent is what I want.</li>
      <li>I ran out a couple weeks ago and decided to order more, so I ordered from FragranceNet, which guarantees authenticity.</li>
      <li>I have used this cologne for years and to date is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments from people about the way I smell.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cologne for my husband and we both love</li>
      <li>Therefore, I will not be able to apply this cologne at all.</li>
      <li>Perfect for any occasion, although I would choose something else for evening wear personally.</li>
      <li>I love this colony on my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>when i bout my bottle i recieved 3 free gifts also!</li>
      <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction (as most fragrances do).</li>
      <li>Very Cool is my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, clean, crisp, with a hint of citrus.</li>
      <li>I easily get headaches from fragances, especially strong, loud and overpowering ones.</li>
      <li>you go to the Tommy Bahama site you will find they no longer sell Very Cool.</li>
      <li>After years of my husband wearing Very Cool by Tommy Bahama</li>
      <li>Very Cool.  </li>
      <li>And that is Very Cool by Tommy Bahama.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Very Cool for years now and this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>Very Cool...</li>
      <li>Very Cool By Tommy Bahama For Men, Cologne Spray,</li>
      <li>product being sold here does not even closely resemble the smell of what very cool used to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>you are all welcome to it.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service and politely told them to refund me the cost plus shipping or send me the old one.</li>
      <li>This is a light refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed the smell and how it came with a free bag.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance and it is no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>And shame on Amazon for displaying the deceptive pictures of the bottle with the cork cap, on the product description page, which is misleading to those who might be &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34;, and expecting to get the authentic versus the less impressive</li>
      <li>And shame on Amazon for displaying the deceptive pictures of the bottle with the cork cap, on the product description page, which is misleading to those who might be &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34;, and expecting to get the authentic versus the less impressive</li>
      <li>The original (with the wood cap) is my favorite Tommy scent.  </li>
      <li>I have been wearing this for 4 to 5 years and get endless comments from ladies on how wonderful it smells.</li>
      <li>great to wear just lounging around, but you do have to give it more than one hit to make it last throughout the day.</li>
      <li>And the risk that Amazon customers run, is that if you discover that your fragrance differs from the authentic, which you might buy at full price at Dillard&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s, etc, you can not return it for credit.</li>
      <li>Nice crisp fragrant with a tropical hint.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, light, refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>shipping time was quick and it was delivered as advertised!</li>
      <li>Do not purchase this product if you are looking for the original Tommy Bahama very cool.</li>
      <li>This cologne does not smell like the original Tommy Bahama Very Cool cologne I used for years.</li>
      <li>They smell nothing like the original very cool scent.</li>
      <li>It still smells more pleasant than the entire Britney Spear&#x27;s collection, but is misses the spice and snap of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste.</li>
      <li>It is the biggest bottle available at a steal of a price.</li>
      <li>Overall, great purchase and value.</li>
      <li>And in checking with Von Maur, Dillard&#x27;s, and Macy&#x27;s, they also confirmed it is no longer available, thus they do not carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If your looking for a cheap cologne</li>
      <li>I loved the old one</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite products and I like it very much as well.</li>
      <li>It is very fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>When I learned Amazon.com sells it, my fiance and I were excited.  </li>
      <li>The product being sold now is not like the original...</li>
      <li>Again, the scent is just way off and smells nothing like the original in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells NOTHING like the original.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend anyone purchase this product if you are looking for the original sent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to be getting the original product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance and it is no longer available in stores. We are both happy that it is available online. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction (as most fragrances do).</li>
    <li> Tommy Bahama quit making this fragrance, this is definitely a knockoff, it was cheaper and the bottle is slightly different.  So, it&#x27;s not the real thing... but not terribly off either.</li>
    <li> Been wearing it for years. Women ask me what I&#x27;m wearing ALL the time. They love it! Not overpowering---just fresh, awesome !!!! More positive comments than any fragrance I have ever worn. I&#x27;m shocked that most guys don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne for summer on my man.  herbal zest and fruits, while focusing on water pepper and nutmeg. Yum!</li>
    <li> I opened the boxes today only to find out that this is not the same fragrance of Very Cool that I&#x27;ve used in the past...I don&#x27;t like it at all...I opened everyone and they are all the same...I&#x27;m going to throw them away and chalk this up to a very bad experience...</li>
    <li> it starts not bad but finsh bad smell like stikey feet and grapfurit smell</li>
    <li> got this for my husband for christmas. it shipped very fast. amazon had the best price for this cologne by far!</li>
    <li> After years of my husband wearing Very Cool by Tommy Bahama I still say almost before thinking, &amp;#34;You smell so good!&amp;#34; Great cologne!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t buy Tommy Bahama at any retail stores anywhere anymore.  When I learned Amazon.com sells it, my fiance and I were excited.  He had ran out about 6 months earlier and was unable to purchase it.  It is his favorite cologne and mine also.  He has been complimented numerous times when he wears it.  It is a great summer cologne.  It is very fresh and clean smelling.  We love it! So, glad that amazon.com offers this product.  I would highly recommend it as a gift to give your boyfriend or husband.  Thanks! Ann</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, you are ordering one product and receiving something entirely different.  There&#x27;s even the included bonus of not being able to return the item because it&#x27;s considered a hazardous  material.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the wife is all over me, and under me, yikes this stuff will drive your lady wild!</li>
    <li> Love itttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will always get my tommy bahama from this website from now on and have told all my friends!!!</li>
    <li> love it...not too heavy...just right</li>
    <li> For the price I knew something wasn&#x27;t going to be completely right. After opening the package you can clearly see its not real by The texture on the bottle. The colonge is pretty much on point but doesn&#x27;t last as long. I figured I&#x27;m paying less than half of the real stuff I&#x27;m going to have to spray it twice a day rather than once. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Amazon once again saved me from having to get out and go find this cologne</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas.  He has worn this for years.  Loves it.  When he opened it at Christmas we discovered it is not the same scent at all.  He still had an older bottle to compare.  Very disappointed in the purchase and disappointed in Amazon that there was nothing posted to warn me.  Apparently, he is not made by a different company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture on the Amazon Website is not the same as what I received.  The cap is different.  We could live with that but do not want the cologne at all.</li>
    <li> Not the scent. I have purchased kn the past under same name and bottle.  Ok scent but a big disappointment</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it say it is. It is the biggest bottle available at a steal of a price. Came in perfect condition no regrets!!</li>
    <li> My dad loved his gift,it smelled fresh and modern,light notes.Recommended for who like Aqua di gio,True religion,Lacoste essential.Fast shipping,cheaper than the mall.</li>
    <li> This is a light refreshing scent.  It does not overpower, The price was right and fragrance is the best. Highly regarded.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got me this cologne a few years ago and I loved it and used it sparingly, so it lasted a long time. I ran out a couple weeks ago and decided to order more, so I ordered from FragranceNet, which guarantees authenticity. I think most reviewers are not getting a knock-off cologne, but are simply getting the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Very Cool which is now produced by Five Star Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new version does not smell like the old/original one at all. It is more \\&quot;formal\\&quot; and \\&quot;heavier,\\&quot; whereas the original Very Cool is a light, clean, casual, citrus-y scent. The new one also is not nearly as noticeable. You would need to spray twice as much. Again, the scent is just way off and smells nothing like the original in my opinion. It still has a cologne smell, of course, but personally I don&#x27;t like the new scent at all. This is very unfortunate, because the original Tommy Bahama Very Cool was a great cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original bottle had a wooden cap; the new one has a silver plastic cap. See the picture I uploaded to look at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this cologne to FragranceNet and opting for Tommy Bahama Set Sail St. Barts instead. I would not recommend the new Very Cool, especially if you are expecting to get the same scent as the original.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s cologne smells great. This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite products and I like it very much as well.</li>
    <li> this is not tommy bahama vary cool. the sent of the cologne is not bad, just giving a heads up before ordering.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy it was.  The product arrived at my house so much quicker then was announced.    Thank you so very much for the painless order.  I have already suggested it to other people.  Keep up the professional work.</li>
    <li> Fragrance bore NO resemblance to the product I have purchased for years.  The bottle was also nothing like the one pictured or one I own, though it bore the name.  product returned</li>
    <li> The original (with the wood cap) is my favorite Tommy scent.  While I do use the others, this one just reminds me of those summer days and it always puts a smile on my face.  Others often comment on it as well, so it is in heavy rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is... not the same scent.  It still smells more pleasant than the entire Britney Spear&#x27;s collection, but is misses the spice and snap of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as how the Tommy Bahama Site ([...]) doesn&#x27;t have this listed, I&#x27;m thinking this is an imposter product.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about the scents I like and use and was very pleasantly surprised to find a scent that I could add to my rotation that my wife loves!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the smell and how it came with a free bag. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again because I&#x27;m always trying new stuff and I have to love it to buy it again, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still a good cologne and a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and I&#x27;ve gone through a few bottles. This one I bought it did not smell like the others.</li>
    <li> I completely could not find this cologne (my favorite)...  Finally have it back!!!!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my son who&#x27;s been wearing this cologne for some time.  He ran out of it and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore because it was obsolete.  i buy two bottles and as soon as he smelled the cologne he told me that this was not real thing. that it was not Tommy Bahama Very Cool.  i ended up giving them away.</li>
    <li> I love this colony on my boyfriend. It smells great.</li>
    <li> Thought this was a great price for this product. It used to retail for around $80 in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;The product being sold here does not even closely resemble the smell of what very cool used to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the Tommy Bahama site you will find they no longer sell Very Cool. Don&#x27;t know what they put in the bottle but it is a much heavier scent &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell very good at all!</li>
    <li> It was a good buy! I really think my money was well spent! I&#x27;m really happy for the item I bought!</li>
    <li> The cologne shown in picture was not the cologne i received. Amazon now says it cant be returned as it is  &amp;#34;hazardous shipment&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a horrible fragrance - nothing like the Tommy Bahama Very Cool that I have had in the past (which looks like the picture)</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years and to date is my favorite scent. Tommy Bahama no longer makes this product thus I wanted to purchase as much as I could being as it is no longer made. When I received this product it was placed and sealed in a Tommy Bahama box but was not the cologne it was advertised to be and apparently is a Tommy HILFIGER cologne which is terrible. Additionally, when I tried to return it I found out that it colognes cannot be returned. A complete ripoff and fraudulent transaction.</li>
    <li> I do not know what this horrendous cologne is,but I DO know what it is NOT. And that is Very Cool by Tommy Bahama. I have been wearing Very Cool for years now and this ain&#x27;t it. This seller is pushing a knock off,and not a good one at that! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,or ANY from this fraud for that matter.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed ordering products from Amazon, but what a disappointment when I received my Tommy Bahama Very Cool cologne for men! Led me to believe it was the real deal with picture and description. When I opened it ,it was a complete fake!!! A knock off!! I paid over $50.00 for an imposter fragrance. Amazon, I enjoy shopping at your site , but I would seriously re-evaluate this companies deception with the customer. Will NEVER purchase cologne online again!!&lt;br /&gt;Deceived and disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VOLOPK Tommy Bahama Very Cool By Tommy Bahama For Men, Cologne Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle]]cheaper than in department stores/same quality/quick delivery</li>
    <li> This cologne does not smell like the original Tommy Bahama Very Cool cologne I used for years. Therefore, I will not be able to apply this cologne at all. Since I am not allowed to return it, I am doubly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably not buy colognes on line again, but resort to purchasing them in person to make sure the scent is what I want.</li>
    <li> delicious.... love this perfume.</li>
    <li> it was in the fragrance that I was looking for</li>
    <li> You can not beat their products and the price on this one is 1/2 the market price. The ladies will compliment you</li>
    <li> Product is not available in their stores anymore so happy to find here. Love cologne for hubby.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband because it has been discontinued in the Tommy Bahama&#x27;s stores.  He has been wearing it for a couple of years and I LOVE IT!  When the order came I could tell right away that it wasn&#x27;t genuine.  The cap wasn&#x27;t wood and the sprayer was plastic.  As soon as we sprayed it we knew immediately that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;Very Cool\\&quot; as it was advertised.  I think that they are marking the \\&quot;Very Cool\\&quot; product and filling the bottle with one of the other scents.  It stinks!  I wouldn&#x27;t even give it to my teenage son to wear.  I would not recommend for anyone to purchase this if they are expecting genuine Tommy Bahama&#x27;s \\&quot;Very Cool\\&quot;.......  Not Cool !!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this cologne strickly because of the reviews here. I am very pleased. It is a clean scent -even my granddaughter loves it. Nice bottle too.</li>
    <li> Tommy Bahamma Very Cool is my favorite cologne. I was given this cologne as gift 2 years ago and really liked it. I easily get headaches from fragances, especially strong, loud and overpowering ones. This one is just the opposite! It is a clean, light, refreshing smell. It is relaxing. It lives up to its name. It is great for formal or casual events. Everyone loves to smell it on me, epescially women! People like to lean in and sniff me when I wear it. I finished it and bought another bottle from macy&#x27;s and ran out  of that one too. I was shocked that macy&#x27;s stopped selling it. I could not find it there or at any stores so I searched online and found it here on amazon for half the price. Amazing Amazon! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Nice crisp fragrant with a tropical hint.</li>
    <li> Wow its amazing what the original users are stating. Sadly another great fragrance has joined the graveyard. I used it for the last five years and never told anyone what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Now you are all welcome to it.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service and politely told them to refund me the cost plus shipping or send me the old one. You will be surprised how much this has upset people. This is as good as a left handed screwdriver. It sucks I actually use it as a freshner for the carpet. The CEO screwed this up in spades. Should have declared it as reinvented. Keep away</li>
    <li> Like other comments it was my favorite as well.  I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing. No recourse to return, just lost money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband and we both love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to certain smells and have a hard time handling strong perfume/cologne smells... This cologne is light and fresh and crisp, like being at the beach. It smells very good and does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge and should last a long time! Overall, great purchase and value.</li>
    <li> Nice clean/fresh smelling cologne. Perfect for any occasion, although I would choose something else for evening wear personally. I wear this one daily at work or play. Definitely one for my rotation. I currently have Ed Hardy, Lacoste Essential, Tommy Bahama(Signature and Set Sail South Seas), Burberry, Weekend by Burberry, and Burberry Brit. I also have Armani Code and Aqua Di Gio but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to clear something up. The original Very Cool had a wooden cap and this version does not. It has the exact same type of cap as the other Tommy Bahama fragrances such as Set Sail St. Bart&#x27;s &amp; St. Martinique!!! Anybody complaining about the wood cap version of Very Cool being better than the version you can currently get isn&#x27;t mentioning that the current bottle is much less expensive at just $20! The wood cap version used to cost over sixty dollars!! For twenty dollars this fragrance is just fine for casual wear if you want a tropical vibe.    Tommy Bahama&#x27;s Very Cool is a nice smelling fragrance to wear here in south Florida or in any tropical climate. It&#x27;s impossible to over spray this one. It doesn&#x27;t last long either. You&#x27;re getting what you pay for at around twenty dollars. I&#x27;d recommend this one for those on a budget who want something inexpensive to wear in warm weather on all occasions. It&#x27;s nothing extraordinary but it&#x27;s also nowhere near as bad as other reviews on Amazon indicate</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, clean, crisp, with a hint of citrus. I have received numerous complements when wear Very Cool. This is the third time I have purchased this fragrance and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite Cologne that my husband has. He has worn it since we were dating and he recently left a bottle in a hotel we were staying at up North so I had to order him more! :)</li>
    <li> For something to be named &amp;#34;Very Cool&amp;#34; it is very uncool. Was sooooooooo disappointed after hyping myself on the reviews of this product. Oh well, as the saying goes &amp;#34;you live and you learn&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very good cologne dry down is great.</li>
    <li> this cologne is probably one of the best ive had. this is my 3rd bottle of tommy and i highly recommend it to anyone. when i bout my bottle i recieved 3 free gifts also! a travel bag some shampoo and hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this T.B. fragrence before and this certainly is not the same.  It has a sickening perfumey smell like a womens perfume.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear it anywhere.  Very disapointed.  Don&#x27;t but this crap thinking it&#x27;s the original T.B. very cool !!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! shipping time was quick and it was delivered as advertised! very happy with it!</li>
    <li> SO SAD, that Amazon (who is generally the gold standard for honest retailing and fantastic customer service), does not more thoroughly screen the fragrances category of their offerings. There are many &amp;#34;less expensive&amp;#34; knock-offs of well known name brand fragrances, which have found their way into the Amazon marketplace. And the risk that Amazon customers run, is that if you discover that your fragrance differs from the authentic, which you might buy at full price at Dillard&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s, etc, you can not return it for credit. You are stuck in the Amazon prohibition for fragrance returns. Just be aware, when the description at the top of the page for any fragrance says, &amp;#34;In stock but may require and extra 1-2 days to ship&amp;#34;. This means that the fragrance is being provided by someone other than the original manufacturer or the original manufacturer&#x27;s stocking distributor. It is taking the extra days because Amazon is relying on an outside source to fulfill the order, or getting it to Amazon for them to ship it. And Amazon obviously does not care to qualify their supplier&#x27;s resources or the authenticity of the product that they are representing on their website. Extremely disappointing since I have relied on Amazon to be my &amp;#34;protector&amp;#34; over 15 loyal years of frequent purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Tommy Bahama Very Cool... I have been wearing this for 4 to 5 years and get endless comments from ladies on how wonderful it smells. I always receive comments, out of the blue... even from strangers in public. However, I recently ran low, almost exhausting a 2 year supply I had at home, only to find out that Tommy Bahama discontinued the fragrance. It is nowhere to be found on their website, as my first clue that it was no longer available. And in checking with Von Maur, Dillard&#x27;s, and Macy&#x27;s, they also confirmed it is no longer available, thus they do not carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was momentarily delighted to find it on Amazon, only to be disappointed upon receipt. When it was in authentic production, it was being formulated by &amp;#34;Viewpoint International&amp;#34;, who is clearly identified on the bottle and on the box, and it also had the distinctive oval cork cap. What is now being sold as TB Very Cool, is made by an alternate manufacturer &amp;#34;5 Star Fragrances&amp;#34;, sporting a new cap which is a vertical plastic cylinder. IT IS NOT THE SAME FRAGRANCE . Obviously Tommy Bahama has farmed out its license to this alternate manufacturer, allowing them to use the TB name and fragrance name, so shame on them for tarnishing their brand. And shame on Amazon for displaying the deceptive pictures of the bottle with the cork cap, on the product description page, which is misleading to those who might be &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34;, and expecting to get the authentic versus the less impressive knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knock off fragrance is just ok, but does not have the subtle floral/citrus oil punch and longevity of the original. I sprayed the original on one wrist, in the morning and the knock off on the other, and then took a sniff at mid day and at days end. The original was still very much noticeable and  potent at days end, however the knock off had faded considerably by mid day. And the knock off, although somewhat similar in smell at first sniff, is definitely lacking what the original offered. And I have 5 daughters who have always raved about how great it smells (over the past several years), so I recently quizzed them as well, wearing the knock off, without explaining the background, and they offered that I did not smell the same as what I normally wear.inted upon receipt.

    <li> Tommy bahama&lt;br /&gt;I like it&lt;br /&gt;Is a good cologne&lt;br /&gt;I want some more but for her&lt;br /&gt;I lovit so much</li>
    <li> You do NOT get the bottle as pictured which was made by Tommy Bahama, instead you get a new looking bottle made by a new company, that has a totally different scent.  Being someone who is really sensitive to smells I loved the old one but the new one makes me sick to my stomach</li>
    <li> Tony Bahama men&#x27;s Very Cool cologne has changed and is now produced by new licensee Five Star Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells NOTHING like the original.  The bottle shape has also changed slightly (silver cape).  \\&quot;Very Cool\\&quot; know longer has a soft sweet tropical smell...as a matter of fact it hardly smells like anything at all and you have to spray 4-5x as much just to smell the new fragrance.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this product if you are looking for the original sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I had a defective bottle until I researched and found out that it is produced by a new company.</li>
    <li> I purchased several bottles of the Very Cool cologne due to Tommy Bahama&#x27;s discontinuation of the product. They smell nothing like the original very cool scent. Not only was the original very cool my favorite cologne, I also had more comments on it than any other colonge I have ever worn. I thought I was going to be getting the original product. It was dissapointed not to. Do not purchase this product if you are looking for the original Tommy Bahama very cool.</li>
    <li> breezy beachy scent. great to wear just lounging around, but you do have to give it more than one hit to make it last throughout the day. But then again it depends on how it reacts to your chemistry and that&#x27;s with all frags</li>
    <li> Definitely not the original. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Very Cool is a cologne brand name for a fragrance developed and sold by Tommy Bahama.  The product being sold now is not like the original...it lacks the subtle scent of the original and doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I have some of the original left in a bottle and the new version stands up poorly to the original.  When the new version was first released fans of the original complained and rated it poorly.  Those reviews seem to have vanished.  If your looking for a cheap cologne the new very cool may be for you.  But if your looking for the Very Cool scent available a few years ago, pass on the new version...you&#x27;ll only be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not true Tommy Bahama Cologne</li>
    <li> Product was dis continued an I was able TO PURCHASE NEW IN BOX FRESH HERE. THANKS! I LOVE THE COLOGNES FOR TOMMY BAHAMA</li>
    <li> I keep buying this cologne over and over. I get more compliments from people about the way I smell. Including strangers!</li>
