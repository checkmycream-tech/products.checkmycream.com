      <li>The Plus is much better.</li>
      <li>You will love it go for it</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try Pureology since I love their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The hairspray itself is OK.  </li>
      <li>I love a hairspray that holds my style/curl without feeling sticky and smelling strong.  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair spray they ever made the new one flakes off and smells funny</li>
      <li>Great product for a light hair spray; I would highly recommend this product to others who use a rinse or color their hair</li>
      <li>This hairspray is incredibly light, which allows you to use more for stronger hold and it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for giving you a finished look but does not weigh your hair down or leave a lot of build up.</li>
      <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair and it never looks helmet-like, even when doing an updo.</li>
      <li>I will be getting it from Amazon until it is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>Therefore wondering if this is a knock off as I have the original from a salon.</li>
      <li>Awesome second day hair that you can actually comb through without breaking your hair off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;SO (NOT STIFF OR STICKY )  LOVE IT  </li>
      <li>but they are worth it for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Nice for daily use!</li>
      <li>Nice spray, would hold in category 4 hurricane, but you can re-fluff it the next day and go, so</li>
      <li>This is the only hair spray I use and love it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for it because it doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair well through whole day.  </li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>Lightweight and yet holds really well.  </li>
      <li>I am a devoted Pureology user and I use many other products but didn&#x27;t like this one.</li>
      <li>surprisingly this was not a good one for Pureology.</li>
      <li>and I live in Florida</li>
      <li>I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE FRAGANCE, VERY MASCULINE AND DOESN&#x27;T HOLD.</li>
      <li>I have long blonde fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It really protects my red hair from fading, and it is not sticky or tacky.  </li>
      <li>I expect the pressure will not last much longer</li>
      <li>Product looks like the same packaging but not exactly like the original.</li>
      <li>I recomment this for anyone who wants those pretty curls to hold all day without the stiff feeling.</li>
      <li>Not worth the money, the cheap hairspray I use works just as well and as long as you are using Pureology shampoo, you don&#x27;t need the protection from hair spray</li>
      <li>My hair is fine but stick straight so holding any style is usually difficult.  </li>

<li> I have been buying this product from this seller for a long time.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchell&#x27;s Freeze &amp; Shine as long as it&#x27;s been around, but it dries out my hair.</li>

<li> really gives you the flexible hold while keeping the volume you want with thin hair.</li>
<li> and if you use a heavy spray your hair hair just goes flat and sticky.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
<li> The only problem with this product is that it is hard to find.</li>
<li> I ordered it in both 9 oz and travel sizes, items were shipped in a timely manner and received in less than 1 week.</li>
<li> I used a firmer spray (Pureology) previously but this one does the job without being too stiff.</li>
<li> I have thin blonde hair medium length and the two work wonders together.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and untouchable.</li>
<li> It holds without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
<li> This spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, hard or greasy.</li>
<li> Not happy.</li>
<li> Ordered the wrong one.  </li>
<li> I just wish they were not as expensive...</li>

    <li> Great hair spray!  It really protects my red hair from fading, and it is not sticky or tacky.  I can use it without having to shampoo daily as it is easily brushed out and restyled.  I have fine, shoulder length hair and it never looks helmet-like, even when doing an updo.</li>
    <li> Nice spray, would hold in category 4 hurricane, but you can re-fluff it the next day and go, so it a two-fer.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for it because it doesn&#x27;t hold well. The Plus is much better.</li>
    <li> Product looks like the same packaging but not exactly like the original. Therefore wondering if this is a knock off as I have the original from a salon. The hairspray seems close but I still have my doubts.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It holds without being stiff or sticky.  I have long blonde fine hair.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the purple (hydrate) shampoo. I have thin blonde hair medium length and the two work wonders together. I will never use a different product again.  I just wish they were not as expensive... but they are worth it for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really gives you the flexible hold while keeping the volume you want with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product from this seller for a long time.  I am always very pleased.  This is the only hair spray I use and love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray they ever made the new one flakes off and smells funny so i like only use this one</li>
    <li> The hairspray itself is OK.  But the spray nozzle keeps clogging and the pressure in the can is almost gone.  I expect the pressure will not last much longer and I will end up tossing about 1/3 of the hairspray.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is a must! It never clumps or is sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other. Your hair stays in place without looking like it was sprayed.</li>
    <li> Ordered the wrong one.  Needed the In Charge PLUS.</li>
    <li> Great product for a light hair spray; I would highly recommend this product to others who use a rinse or color their hair</li>
    <li> Lightweight and yet holds really well.  My hair is fine but stick straight so holding any style is usually difficult.  This spray doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, hard or greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t build up but holds hair styles nicely in all kinds of weather</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, the cheap hairspray I use works just as well and as long as you are using Pureology shampoo, you don&#x27;t need the protection from hair spray</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT I WANTED WAS INCHARGE PLUS WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I GOT. I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE FRAGANCE, VERY MASCULINE AND DOESN&#x27;T HOLD.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I live in Florida and if you use a heavy spray your hair hair just goes flat and sticky.  This is perfect for giving you a finished look but does not weigh your hair down or leave a lot of build up. I have been using this hair spray for close to 10 years and will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff... love it, love it, love it.  I have been using this product for 5+ years and when my local store discontinued selling this product I needed to find it elsewhere.  I was told that I could get from Amazon and found they not only had the product, but it was 1/2 the price than at my local store.  I will be getting it from Amazon until it is no longer available.  I ordered it in both 9 oz and travel sizes, items were shipped in a timely manner and received in less than 1 week.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ive ever owned! It doesnt make your hair hard and stiff like most hairsprays do. I recomment this for anyone who wants those pretty curls to hold all day without the stiff feeling.</li>
    <li> surprisingly this was not a good one for Pureology. I am a devoted Pureology user and I use many other products but didn&#x27;t like this one. It was sticky and did not give good hold.</li>
    <li> I love a hairspray that holds my style/curl without feeling sticky and smelling strong.  This flexible hold hairspray is perfect!  Holds the style and does not have an over powering fragrance.  Awesome second day hair that you can actually comb through without breaking your hair off.  The only problem with this product is that it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchell&#x27;s Freeze &amp; Shine as long as it&#x27;s been around, but it dries out my hair. I decided to try Pureology since I love their shampoo and conditioner. This holds my hair almost as well as the Mitchell does, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS HAIR SPRAY FOR YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER FOUND A SPRAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO (NOT STIFF OR STICKY )  LOVE IT  THANKS</li>
    <li> This hairspray is incredibly light, which allows you to use more for stronger hold and it&#x27;s not sticky. You&#x27;re hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and untouchable. I love all of their products. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this hairspray to me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier she did. I order all my pureology products from amazon, the price is always cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great service and love it!! I use this every day and makes my hair dazzle!! You will love it go for it</li>
    <li> I used a firmer spray (Pureology) previously but this one does the job without being too stiff. Nice for daily use!</li>
    <li> Nice product, love it.  Have used Pureology for  a while.  It holds my hair well through whole day.  I do recommend it others.</li>
