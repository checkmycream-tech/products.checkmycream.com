    <li> I bought these for my niece for Christmas. She had a lot of fun decorating her nails. My only complaint is some of the colors look cheap on your nails. I would only buy this for teenagers to have fun. As a grown women I would not wear these colors for every day.</li>

    <li> I bought nail kit for 12 year old granddaughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;She loves to paint her nails and I think she will love to draw&lt;br /&gt;designs on her nails.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product. I tried it as soon as I received the package. I ordered the white, black, and silver collections. My only downside I think would be that I received it a couple days later than the latest expected day. Otherwise, service was great. it came in great condition, no dents or anything.

    <li> granddaughter very happy with them</li>

    <li> Bought as a gift, and my daughter loves it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I regret buying these and not trying them sooner so I could return them. The nail polish is very poor quality and very thin. When you draw patterns, they barely show because of the watery texture. Plus the tips leak terribly. You don&#x27;t need to put any pressure whatsoever and the polish leaks out so drawing with any control is very difficult. Complete garbage. And the person who ordered before me thought so too because the set I received already had 3 open pens.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised. Smooth application and cleaning supply included. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Came new in about a week.</li>
    <li> This I bought for my granddaughter, she is 12 going on 18.  She says they are easy to apply cool colors plus she can design her nails. Great for her and me...</li>
