      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Effenfine Tweezer Set in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;These tweezers are made of good quality stainless steel, so they can be boiled, cleaned with either alcohol or just soap and water and they won&#x27;t rust.</li>
      <li>easy they are to hold with my fingers&lt;</li>
      <li>The carrying case is made of a faux leather, and fits easily into a pocket, purse or cosmetic bag.  </li>
      <li>and I would strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>While I received this item in exchange for my honest review, I would consider buying it to give as a gift if available at the right price.</li>
      <li>Although these come in a nice case, you could split the set up and keep one pair in a purse and one in the bathroom or a first aid kit (for splinters) if you wanted to do something like that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck using pointed tip tweezers for removing hairs or splinters, but I sure do like the slanted tip ones!</li>
      <li>No slippage, no pinching, and incredibly precise.</li>
      <li>The tweezers are metal with a coating (red) that adds an attractive touch to the package.</li>
      <li>/&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
      <li>There is a world of difference between these and cheap tweezers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall a great products</li>
      <li>well I thought I found a great pair of tweezer sending back would not tweeze hair.</li>
      <li>Since I own multiple tweezers already I just kind of put them aside.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love the nice tight case they are housed in.</li>
      <li>This is how much I&#x27;ve paid for one good tweezer, so getting three in a great little case as a sample is really fabulous.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice, high quality set of tweezers which gets hair</li>
      <li>I received the Effenfine Tweezer Set, I was excited to see if it works well.</li>
      <li>I hope you&#x27;ll love these tweezers as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I have never had such a pleasant experience before, I had no idea plucking your eyebrows could be this effortless.</li>
      <li>They do an excellent job plucking even those very tiny, fine blonde hairs that must be in just the right light to be seen.</li>
      <li>The bright red handles keep them visible in a drawer full of girly stuff.</li>
      <li>Love these tweezers so much.</li>
      <li>You may read my full review on my blog, which is listed on my profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues finding a good tweezer set to pluck my eyebrows with and the search is finally over!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows have never looked better and the fine tip tweezer is extra precise.  </li>
      <li>set includes two pairs with slant tips that are handy for general use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they look so pretty!</li>
      <li>pair has fine needle point tips that work very well for digging out splinters, ingrown hairs, and ticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had an awesome experience with using these to pluck my eyebrows, you know how sometimes it’s tough to grab that one hair</li>
      <li>Not only have they been useful for my eyebrows, but the fine point tweezers have also really come in handy for my art projects.</li>
      <li>ones with angled tips, especially, are very good at grasping short hairs</li>
      <li>The tips are sharp and the tweezers effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well worth it to get both types of tweezers</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary effenfine tweezer kit for testing and review purposes.</li>
      <li>thinking that I&#x27;ll make these my main tweezers and relegate my old ones (which are more rounded and not as good at getting to short hairs) to the craft supply box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
      <li>The fact that I got 3 tweezers...made me think the quality may not be as good as the other 2..</li>
      <li>And with Revlon and some other brands offering &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; metal tweezers for $7 each, this Effenfine set of three high quality tweezers is sold at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shortly after getting them, my best friend ordered a pair for herself as well after using one of the three for just a few seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never had such great tweezers and know that these will be used in our household daily!</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>the first time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the red color, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it possible to fall in love with tweezers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handles are a nice size for firm gripping, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effenfine offers a 10-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee if your tweezers ever stop working, which is something drug store tweezers can&#x27;t say.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.</li>
      <li>I have yet to use the straight tips.</li>

    <li> The Effenfine Tweezer Set is defiantly an ultimate tweezer set &amp; even an awesome gift! Even though I&#x27;d love to keep these all to myself, I had the girls give this to their dad for fathers day. Now even though I absolutely love these. He still has a love hate relationship with these because of the whole pain is beauty saying! Never the less his eyebrows &amp; ears look so much better with these in his life ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Effenfine Tweezer Set in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO&lt;br /&gt;Chelsie Fletcher&lt;br /&gt;Product Review Blogger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of this product. It&#x27;s chic, stylish, functional, compact, durable, and easy to use. I like the fact that it comes with a leather case. I have to say that these tweezers grabbed all the little and stubborn hairs I usually struggle with. The effenfine Tweezer Set make plucking so much less painful. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> ROCKIN&#x27; set of tweezers! I love the case that they come in and the precision is incomparable. So glad I have a set of these with me wherever I go!</li>
    <li> Not only are they sleek looking but they are light weight and easy to use! I was use to using tweezers with a little more resistance so I was skeptical at first of how I would like the effenfine tweezers, but I think the less resistance makes it easier to grab and fine hairs. I never find myself reaching for my old tweezers now that I have these! Overall a great products and I would strongly recommend. Well worth it to get both types of tweezers</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers as a gift. Since I own multiple tweezers already I just kind of put them aside. After a few days, I decided to open them and see what the big deal was. WOW! Not any of the tweezers I have did what these did and my tweezers were not low-end quality. All it took was one pull, everytime. Not once did I have to yank the same hair as I was having to do with my other tweezers at times. It&#x27;s painful enough to do it once. The grip on these tweezers is amazing and they fit comfortably in your hand. I have been using them for over a month now and have actually gotten rid of all my other tweezers. I am also going to order sets to give as gifts. I know they will love them just as I did. I hope you find my review helpful.</li>
    <li> This set works really well.  I love that they come in a case; I usually lose all of my tweezers.</li>
    <li> This set of tweezers offers three tips to aid in the removal of unwanted hair. The tweezers are metal with a coating (red) that adds an attractive touch to the package. The carrying case is made of a faux leather, and fits easily into a pocket, purse or cosmetic bag.  While I received this item in exchange for my honest review, I would consider buying it to give as a gift if available at the right price. The tips are sharp and the tweezers effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezer set is backed by a Lifetime guarantee, however I&#x27;m not sure how that will work as if you do a search for the name brand website - there&#x27;s just a placeholder - no real site as of yet. I found &#x27;Made in Pakastan&#x27; - spelled this way - on the packaging. Since the usual spelling is &#x27;Pakistan&#x27;... I&#x27;m not really sure where these are made.  Not that this is a huge issue for me as the product works as expected.</li>
    <li> Effenfine&#x27;s tweezer kit is just what any household needs - three pairs of tweezers (two slant tip, one pointed tip) in a nice vinyl carrying/storage case. We have two college age daughters, so someone is always &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my tweezers and not bringing them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are made of good quality stainless steel, so they can be boiled, cleaned with either alcohol or just soap and water and they won&#x27;t rust. The bright red handles keep them visible in a drawer full of girly stuff. I&#x27;ve never had much luck using pointed tip tweezers for removing hairs or splinters, but I sure do like the slanted tip ones! Plucking is a breeze with tweezers that meet perfectly and hold securely! The handles are a nice size for firm gripping, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effenfine offers a 10-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee if your tweezers ever stop working, which is something drug store tweezers can&#x27;t say. And with Revlon and some other brands offering &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; metal tweezers for $7 each, this Effenfine set of three high quality tweezers is sold at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary effenfine tweezer kit for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item. Look at the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;ve written over ten years and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.</li>
    <li> LOVE this tweezer kit.  My eyebrows have never looked better and the fine tip tweezer is extra precise.  Best kit out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got several other pairs of tweezers but these are quickly becoming my favorites. There are two styles in this set -- one pair with a very fine tip and two pairs with wider, angled tips. Although these come in a nice case, you could split the set up and keep one pair in a purse and one in the bathroom or a first aid kit (for splinters) if you wanted to do something like that. Or you could designate two pairs for two separate users in your household for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones with angled tips, especially, are very good at grasping short hairs (I pluck my eyebrows a lot to keep them under control). The holes in the handles (?) make it easier to grip these without having your fingers slip. I love the red color, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;ll make these my main tweezers and relegate my old ones (which are more rounded and not as good at getting to short hairs) to the craft supply box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> I groom my eyebrows at home so I love a nice and efficient pair of tweezers. I hate it when my eyebrow hair slips from the tweezers the first time I pull it out because honestly, it hurts the first time so why would I want to pull it again the second time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Effenfine Tweezer Set, I was excited to see if it works well. The set came with 2 slanted tweezers and a pointed tip tweezer. These tweezers are in a pouch which keeps the tweezers safe and easy to bring on the go. The tweezers have a glossy red color and a stainless steel tip. The tweezers are aligned properly so I don&#x27;t have to deal with re-plucking a missed eyebrow hair. The slanted tip tweezers have holes on the handle which help me grip the tweezers more firmly. The length of the handle of the tweezers are comfortable enough for me to hold it properly while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, high quality set of tweezers which gets hair the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! The quality is excellent, price is right, and the 3-set tweezers work well. I am always losing my tweezers - my husband steals them for slivers, my daughter takes them to her bathroom, or I drop them some obscure place! I love, love, love the nice tight case they are housed in. I think I will be able to hold onto these now! Effin-fine for real. ;-)</li>
    <li> Good tweezers the slanted tips work well for shaping the brow line. The pointy tips can grasp splinters or stray hairs. I have yet to use the straight tips. The case keeps them all together so you don&#x27;t misplace them.</li>
    <li> Ever since I stopped getting my eyebrows waxed (because I&#x27;m a broke college kid), I have been searching for a less expensive alternative to keeping my eyebrows groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVED this product because of the sleek packaging, the durable product, and great the results that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;I especially appreciated these tweezers because of the two different shapes in the set. The slanted tweezer allowed for shaping, while the pointed tweezer was great for getting the finer details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality set of tweezers!</li>
    <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to fall in love with tweezers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES IT IS MY FRIENDS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going to lie, before I tried these tweezers I didn’t know tweezers could be so awesome! As soon as I got these I learned generic dollar store tweezers and quality tweezers are very very different! Shortly after getting them, my best friend ordered a pair for herself as well after using one of the three for just a few seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both our husbands have gotten into our tweezers and we guard them like little treasures. The fine tip ones have been used on my husband to pull out splinters on multiple occasions since he works with a bunch of lumber at work on a daily basis. I have had an awesome experience with using these to pluck my eyebrows, you know how sometimes it’s tough to grab that one hair… well with these, it’s EASY! The set of three tweezers has two slanted tip tweezers and one pointed tip tweezers. They’re silver and candy apple red and come in a convenient leather case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough how much you need to get quality tweezers, I&#x27;d seriously suggest these! There is a world of difference between these and cheap tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but I usually buy a few tweezers a year because I keep losing them. I need tweezers in my bag, in my room, in the restroom and also in the living room in case I need to use them because you never know... I loved everything about the Effenfine Tweezer Set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a list of things I love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the name Effenfine!&lt;br /&gt;the case it comes in&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a set of three (even though my sister already grabbed one to keep)&lt;br /&gt;the red color&lt;br /&gt;how easy they are to hold with my fingers&lt;br /&gt;they work great on even the smallest thinnest hairs&lt;br /&gt;they look so pretty!</li>
    <li> The Effenfine Tweezer Set is a complete and perfect set for grooming eyebrows. This set includes two slant tip eyebrow tweezers and a pointed tip tweezer perfect for removing those pesky ingrown hairs. This is a high quality set, that is much more durable and sharp than ones I’ve purchased at local drug stores. Each of the tweezers are very sharp and I was easily able to groom my brows. These tweezers are also great for removing splinters. They allow for a good grip and come with a storage pouch. I definitely recommend these. I did receive this product discounted or free of charge in exchange for a review, however all opinions are 100% honest based on my own experience.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing! I have never had such a pleasant experience before, I had no idea plucking your eyebrows could be this effortless. I have lots of baby hairs around my eyebrows, and these tweezers were even able to pull them in one try. No slippage, no pinching, and incredibly precise. My favorite go-to pair is definitely the middle, but I have found uses for the other two in the short month I&#x27;ve had them. This set could easily be the last set I ever purchase, extremely happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues finding a good tweezer set to pluck my eyebrows with and the search is finally over! Love these tweezers so much. I would highly recommend them. I hope you&#x27;ll love these tweezers as much as I do!</li>
    <li> These tweezers have a glossy translucent red finish over stainless steel and are full-size at about 3 3/4 in. long. The sharp, tips are precisely ground and align perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set includes two pairs with slant tips that are handy for general use. They do an excellent job plucking even those very tiny, fine blonde hairs that must be in just the right light to be seen. It&#x27;s nice to have a spare pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pair has fine needle point tips that work very well for digging out splinters, ingrown hairs, and ticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is presented in a handy synthetic leather storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effenfine provided tweezers for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. My brows have never looked better! The slant tip really grasped the hairs without slipping around like the old pair of tweezers I used before trying this product. With the small packaging, I&#x27;m easily able to toss them into my purse, backpack, or any bag I have on me. Not only have they been useful for my eyebrows, but the fine point tweezers have also really come in handy for my art projects. They&#x27;ve helped me peel up masking tape without damaging my paint. Although I received this item for evaluation, I would buy these again and again. I hope you find my review helpful!</li>
    <li> As someone who is always on the go, I have loved having three efficient pairs of tweezers that I can throw in my purse or gym bag together in their small carrier! Great quality, great look, LOVE.</li>
    <li> I received this free for my personal review and for a post on my blog.  However, all thoughts are 100% my own.  You may read my full review on my blog, which is listed on my profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have been on the search for a GOOD set of tweezers forever.  You think that any tweezer will do the job, but that so isn&#x27;t the case.  Quite often the tweezers just won&#x27;t grab the hair or even if it does it won&#x27;t pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this set this worry can be left behind.  They grab the hair or splinter with ease and out it comes.  I have never had such great tweezers and know that these will be used in our household daily!</li>
    <li> Looking at this strictly from a personal viewpoint, there is nothing worse for me when I am getting ready in the morning to discover one of those magical hairs that seems to be like a little piece of sharp wire poking out of my chin! (I&#x27;m revealing too much, I&#x27;m sure.) You know that cutting/shaving does not work, because you can&#x27;t really get close enough to the skin to make them disappear. Obsessive as I am, all day long I&#x27;ll be checking it, certain that it must be getting the length of a jump rope. The one tweezer left that I can find at the moment only occasionally seems to grab a hair but not enough to remove it. All I can say is that these tweezers are wonderful, and packed in a great case that will keep them sharp (no banging around or dropping on the floor.) This is how much I&#x27;ve paid for one good tweezer, so getting three in a great little case as a sample is really fabulous. These are definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> well I thought I found a great pair of tweezer sending back would not tweeze hair.</li>
    <li> I compared these tweezers..to the famous rubis swiss tweezers..and the bella eleganze that got great reviews...I had a difficult hair to pull...I am sure you have all been in that &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34;..lol lol lol....The effenfine tweezer was the ONLY one, that did the job..the other two almost had it, but not quite....therefore I give this product a 10 and the other two a 9 out of 10...not that they are bad..just that THIS ONE IS GREAT!!! The fact that I got 3 tweezers...made me think the quality may not be as good as the other 2..NOTHING could be further from the TRUTH...these definitely need to be in your &amp;#34;tweezer arsenal&amp;#34; Hope thisreview helps!!!</li>
