### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>product, perfect price.</li>
      <li>but as so happy that I found it online!</li>
      <li>I loved!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so good!!</li>
      <li>I think this smells so good and is a perfect body splash (or perfume if you decide to get that which is probably stronger and the scent probably lasts longer).</li>
      <li>My Favorite and I am very happy with Great Seller!</li>
      <li>I placed this bottle of joy into my &amp;#34;&amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; bathroom, the one</li>
      <li>All around great product</li>
      <li>It is absolutely refreshing and a wonderful scent!!  </li>
      <li>Not as good as the body splash..</li>
      <li>smells good</li>
      <li>and I LOVED the scent.</li>
      <li>I have the lotion and love it!</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance!</li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Product was amazing.</li>
      <li>it smells really nice....</li>
      <li>I definitely love the scent</li>
      <li>My wife bought this for her grand daughter for a graduation gift.</li>
      <li>it love love love love love love love love love</li>
      <li>So glad I found it here.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments</li>
      <li>Yet Still Satisfied</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very unique and quite heavenly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a light flowery slightly sweet musk.</li>
      <li>I love the ease in which I can choose a product, pay a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I got this scent in a couple lotions and a body mist spray for christmas a few years ago and LOVED it!</li>
      <li>This reminds me of a fruity version of Clinique&#x27;s Happy, and upon dry down it&#x27;s lovely and girly.</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last like a perfume but is refreshing like a body spray.</li>
      <li>and it ends up on my doorstep in a reasonable amount of time!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sweet and soft scent.</li>
      <li>Unless mine is watered down, cause it really doesn&#x27;t smell much, and I loved the normal body spray</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because these full size bottles could last me over a year.</li>
      <li>I really like this scent.</li>
      <li>Buy this mist, in fact buy the whole regime;  </li>
      <li>Forever sunshine is probably the best fragrances  Bath &amp; Body works ever made, unfortunately its been a discontinued item for awhile and rarely is brought back.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy the body spray, and although I love the smell, it is really weak and fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell exactly how I excepted it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, cocoa butter, and vanilla mixed together.</li>
      <li>really the only negative thing I can even say is that I had to make sure my daughter didn&#x27;t see the package as it arrived because it had the company name all over the box.</li>
      <li>but sadly not long lasting</li>

<li> shower gel, lotion as well to make even this long lasting fragrance, truly last all day long.</li>
<li> I like this particular mist too because it seems to last the longest and require the least sprays.</li>
<li> Buy it, its a long lasting fragrance that captures the late summer/before autumn essence.</li>
<li> With ingredients like apricot for a delicate sweetness,  pink peonies for a slight floral and pralines for a sensual oak like musk...</li>
<li> but expected to stay at least for 2 hours.</li>
<li> Once Again Im Still Waiting On Small Items</li>
<li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the way the product was packaged was careless and left something to be desired.</li>
<li> ,I was heart broken when I heard they stopped making it.</li>
<li> I was sad that I never found it in stores</li>
<li> Too bad it was discontinued</li>

    <li> really the only negative thing I can even say is that I had to make sure my daughter didn&#x27;t see the package as it arrived because it had the company name all over the box. I get it though.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect product, perfect price.</li>
    <li> Forever sunshine is probably the best fragrances  Bath &amp; Body works ever made, unfortunately its been a discontinued item for awhile and rarely is brought back. Buy it, its a long lasting fragrance that captures the late summer/before autumn essence. It&#x27;s got a light flowery slightly sweet musk. With ingredients like apricot for a delicate sweetness,  pink peonies for a slight floral and pralines for a sensual oak like musk...it&#x27;s very unique and quite heavenly.

    <li> I think this smells so good and is a perfect body splash (or perfume if you decide to get that which is probably stronger and the scent probably lasts longer). I can&#x27;t believe they stopped making it! It&#x27;s worth the price because these full size bottles could last me over a year.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Too bad it was discontinued</li>
    <li> I have the lotion and love it! I decided to buy the body spray, and although I love the smell, it is really weak and fades quickly. I think I will stick with the lotion from now on.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s a sweet and soft scent. Definitely not over powering like some scents are. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Product was amazing. My girlfriend was upset when they stopped selling it in stores. But when I bought her two she lit up! All around great product</li>
    <li> it smells really nice.... but sadly not long lasting... understood as its a body mist... but expected to stay at least for 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Bath and Body Works no longer sales it so I buy it where ever i can!</li>
    <li> Love this body spray! wearing it even on a cold day reminds of a warm day with lots of sun. Smells kinda like some tanning lotion, I always get compliments on it</li>
    <li> Not as good as the body splash.. Unless mine is watered down, cause it really doesn&#x27;t smell much, and I loved the normal body spray</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her grand daughter for a graduation gift. She will be starting College in the fall and loves this Fragrance.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of a fruity version of Clinique&#x27;s Happy, and upon dry down it&#x27;s lovely and girly. I definitely love the scent and I layer to keep it going through the day. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the way the product was packaged was careless and left something to be desired. In my opinion, just shoving it in a padded enevelope and taping the lid shut didn&#x27;t show enough care or professionalism on the sellers part, it should have been bubble wrapped then placed in the padded envelope.</li>
    <li> This Is The Only Fragrance That I Received A Complamemt On Out Of All The Perfumes Ive Had But When I Went To B&amp;B Works They Told Me They Dont Sell It Anymore So I Just Came Here I Wish It Would Have Came Faster Because Once Again Im Still Waiting On Small Items That I Ordered TWO WEEKS AGO But Im Yet Still Satisfied</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I get so many compliments,I was heart broken when I heard they stopped making it. Now I&#x27;m buying all I can find, stocking up!</li>
    <li> Someone gave me this body spray years ago and I LOVED the scent. I was sad that I never found it in stores but as so happy that I found it online! The smell doesn&#x27;t last like a perfume but is refreshing like a body spray.</li>
    <li> smells good and i would by this product again .love it love love love love love love love love love</li>
    <li> I placed this bottle of joy into my &amp;#34;&amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; bathroom, the one my children all go into when they come home.  They all want to take this for themselves!!!  I&#x27;ll have to re-order to give them all a bottle.  It is absolutely refreshing and a wonderful scent!!  :)</li>
    <li> My Favorite and I am very happy with Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I got this scent in a couple lotions and a body mist spray for christmas a few years ago and LOVED it! But then couldn&#x27;t find it any of the stores! So glad I found it here. I like this particular mist too because it seems to last the longest and require the least sprays.</li>
    <li> I loved!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so good!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell exactly how I excepted it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, cocoa butter, and vanilla mixed together.</li>
    <li> I love the ease in which I can choose a product, pay a reasonable price and it ends up on my doorstep in a reasonable amount of time!</li>
