<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells nice and it takes polish right off! Does feel a little oily, but that&#x27;s good for the cuticles :)</li>
    <li> I had previously been using Priti NYC&#x27;s soy nail polish remover but I wanted to find something that I could get quicker through Amazon and that cost a little less. This stuff is FANTASTIC. The price is better, for one. Secondly, the smell is SO subtle, not bothersome at all. Lastly - I had expected this to take some time in getting all my old polish off. My experience with soy remover is that you need lots of patience when using it. I was amazed that this remover took my old polish right off, no vigorous rubbing or waiting necessary. Love it!</li>
    <li> hard to get polish off.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has a pleasant smell, works great and I think it also moistures my nails and makes them stronger. As the previous reviews stated - might not work for glitter nail polish, but for regular one (even the salon application) it&#x27;s fine. I am happy I found a safer alternative to a nail polish remover</li>
    <li> This remover is fantastic! I have very sensitive skin and hate acetone, but am very pleased to have found this. I took the advice of other reviewers and wiped each nail with the remover then waited about ten seconds before attempting to remove it entirely. Works very well and lightly smells like lavender.&lt;br /&gt;*Tip: I accidentally got some of the remover on my (sort of cheap) coffee table and it removed some of the &#x27;faux wood grain&#x27;. Whoops!</li>
    <li> Big fan of this.  Glad I took the risk and listened to other reviewers and invested in this rather than the cheap stuff.  Smells so good, works really well, and leave your cuticles and nails feeling moisturized. I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a long time since it does&#x27;t take much to do the job. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly, but it really works to remove everything. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Works well and not harsh on nails.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to with very little effort.</li>
    <li> It is cruelty-free, it is kind to your fingernails, I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this remover! It&#x27;s true that you do need to let the cotton swab rest on the nail before you start removing the polish. I highly recommend and won&#x27;t be going back to acetone and non-acetone removers.</li>
    <li> I like that this remover does not smell up the whole room like polish remover often does, but unfortunately, it does a poor job with sparkle nail polish. I had to scrub forever.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe it is a nail polish remover that works! Yes, even on thick sparkly hard-to-remove polishes! And, it does not have a single wisp of chemical smell..... it smells really good, just like regular Lavendar oil. The nails are not dry or streaked after using it and hands feel soft. I will buy a couple more just in case. You never know if you can get them when it runs out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent! Easily removes nail polish, not like other products that I&#x27;ve bought that they say are naturals too. It works really well!, and the best: it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The oil nourishes the nails and it feels so good. I recommend it very highly because if you are sensitive like me you will benefit from not poisoning your body with acetone.</li>
    <li> So much better than the toxic stuff and it smells like lavender.</li>
    <li> This works great, not as strong of an odor as regular polish. This smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works great and both water and non water based polishes.</li>
    <li> Best organic nail polish remover I have ever used!  It removed the polish and did not leave my hands or nails feeling dried out.  This will be my go to polish remover from now on.</li>
    <li> The product works well and smells great.  A little goes a long way though, so keep that in mind when you use it. :)</li>
    <li> It not only takes nail polish off of your fingers with ease, but also off of clothes! Because of this stuff, i was able to save my mom&#x27;s favorite blouse from nail polish stains. it actually smells nice(unlike most polish removers I&#x27;ve tried in the past) I will only be buying this from now on!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described- no issues! Don&#x27;t know of any other organic brands similar to this.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to chemical smells and this nail polish remover, while still having an odor, smells pleasantly like lavender and oil. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Potential buyers should keep in mind that this is not your usual nail polish remover so it will not work the same way! It is slower to remove polishes--especially dark colors, but I used it on regular (Opi brand I think) nail polish that had been on my toes for weeks and it worked find (just required some soaking and a little elbow grease.) Now I use it to remove Sei Bella nail polishes and Scotch natural polishes and it works like a charm! Very very pleased with this nail polish remover. So happy to have found something I can use without it aggravating my chemical sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! Works better than acetone remover and it moisturizes and smells nice. Will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Have used a ton of other Natural nail polish removers and this is one of the best plus the price is way lower then any of the other natural nail polish removers I&#x27;ve come across. Would order again for sure and the smell isn&#x27;t something i would like a candle of but its very pleasant and way better then any acetone product.</li>
    <li> A little dab of this goes a LONG way, I only used one cotton ball and one splash of this and it took off my polish on both hands! The smell is divine and totally non toxic. I really think it has helped my nails grow longer and stronger too because they aren&#x27;t being exposed to chemicals like they would be with a regular nail polish remover. I&#x27;m really glad I paid extra for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Work great!</li>
    <li> Love this. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This smells divine! Feels very nurtuting on the finger cuticles as well as nails! I only give this 4 stars instead of 5 because i was expecting a bit more product but to my surprise, a little goes a long way! I used one cotton ball of this for my finger nails and toe nail polish removal! Very happy with this product! Its pricier then other removers but well worth fitting it into your budget! No more dry cracked fingers!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and really does remove nail polish. It does take some effort to remove the nail polish but it smells great!</li>
    <li> I just love being able to remove my polish without the harsh smell and possible adverse health effects of acetone. This remover is now my go to product of choice. As a nail polish addict that means several times a week use, fortunately the volume of this remover lasts longer than acetone options so double win.</li>
    <li> This is great! does not dry my nails . From now on, I will only use this, no more drug store nail polish remover. So happy to have found this - great product. highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant, so I decided to cut out unnecessary chemicals out of my beauty routine. As former gel nails junkie, I am used to some heavy duty nail treatments, and didn&#x27;t expect much from this remover. I was pleasantly surprised to see this remover worked! It takes a few seconds longer than acetone, but that&#x27;s a tradeoff I&#x27;m willing to take, and I think this remover will become a permanent staple in my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works very well!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feel much healthier using this product over conventional removers. Like other reviewers stated, Polish comes off amazingly easy. I was skeptical but now I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Awesome remover, a little definitely goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the first nail polish remover I bought that is gentle and does not stink! It smells really good actually and the added oils helps the skin stay moisturized instead of dry, even after it dries out. You do have to use a little bit of pressure to get the nail polish off, but is far better than quick removers that are too toxic and smelly.</li>
    <li> i am so happy I found this. After reading all the 1 star reviews they made it sound like the bottle would be half full. It is not full to the very top but there was actually very little missing. It may have to be that way because of the formula used to make it. Either way, you don&#x27;t need a lot of this stuff. I over soaked one cotton ball and was able to remove all polish from all 10 of my long nails. This includes 2 base coats, 3 coats of polish and a top coat. Next time I know I will even be able to use less remover to get the job done. I think people are just used to needing excess of so many things so maybe expected a bigger bottle. The bottle is smaller than standard remover at the store, but you don&#x27;t need nearly as much of it so it balances out. It smells amazing and my nails feel so conditioned after using it. I have used another natural remover before and it worked too but this works way better and a better price. I haven&#x27;t tried removing glitter yet but I have always always had a hard time removing glitter polish even with my other natural remover or the standard acetone kind. This stuff is literally the best I&#x27;ve used and I love that it is so natural. I would say it is worth the $12 for sure. But of course I would rather pay less, who wouldn&#x27;t. I feel you get your money&#x27;s worth and it is a fair price. Especially after seeing how little of it I needed to use to remove all my polish! Plus you need less money on cotton balls so saving money there helps balance out the price even more.</li>
    <li> I was dubious when I read other reviews, but I can attest that this nail polish works almost as well as acetone. It was completely effective, but required two applications to get the polish off.  But it smells like lavender, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and irritated. I also used it to remove nail wraps (jamberry), and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> The best organic nail polish remover on the market :)  It smells great and is great at removing natural nail polish.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! It works so well, and without any horrible chemical smell like regular nail polish. Plus it doesn&#x27;t dry your nails out like regular chemical nail polish. It&#x27;s so amazing to be able to remove nail polish in the living room with other people around without horrible chemical fumes that require good ventilation. I honestly don&#x27;t understand why all nail polish remover isn&#x27;t soy based now that they have this technology. The lavender fragrance is really nice too.</li>
    <li> Love the no chemical smell and it removes polish of all kinds.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a nail polish remover that is non-toxic! I didn&#x27;t really believe that a natural nail polish remover would work that well, but it does!</li>
    <li> Best remover for your nails! No more harsh chemicals that just weaken your nails and fumes that linger around the room. All organic and the lavender sent is heavenly. For a few dollars more it&#x27;s very much worth it to purchase this remover. I will never use anything else but this product on my nails again. 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> Smells like lavender essential oil, works better on reds than regular nail polish remover, and you use less of it (1 cotton ball for all fingers and toes). Downside is that it also took some of the finish off of my coffee table from a couple of drops slipping down the side.</li>
    <li> This works better than the harmful regular polish remover and it smells so much nicer too.</li>
    <li> buy it if you want to avoid harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> I like the remover.  Very little scent. And lifts regular nail polish easily.  It was well wrapped in bubble wrap, but did leak a little into the box with other items.  Didn&#x27;t hurt what it was with, but could be a concern.</li>
    <li> (Updated at the end  )This actually works! I was shocked... It does take a little more pressure than regular acetone but I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to the same effort that goes with taking off glitter polish.  Sometimes I found if I soaked the cotton ball alot it was alot faster at removing nail polish just left the hands with leftover polish around fingers (little messy) but that quickly comes off after washing hands with soap and water. Overall pretty happy and no nasty smell and no nasty chemicals being inhaled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October update :&lt;br /&gt;I noticed ever since I started using this my nail were weak and broke frequently.  Perhaps too strong for my natural long nails.  I have gone back to generic strengthening nail polish remover and much better...I&#x27;ll experiment with nail polish removers at another time.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work but it did not, at all. After much, much effort on one nail, with no results, I gave up. I really want to find something all-natural, but this is NOT it. I don&#x27;t know why it worked for some people?</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.  It didn&#x27;t remove my nail polish.  It does however smell better than regular acetone.  I was removing regular nail polish not  gel.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover. My nails break so easily. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to make them stronger, hard as nails and other products like that. Wearing polish is the only thing that keeps them a decent size. I figured I could at least give them a break from the acetone in regular remover. This polish does take a little more effort than normal to remove the polish, but I know it&#x27;s not as harsh on my nails. I change up my nails a lot, it took me 6 months to use an entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Smell is so gross but it gets the job done. Is oil based so its really oily and didn&#x27;t realize that until using it so I have to wash my hands afterwards. Will re-purchase but instead for the other scent and or unscented.</li>
    <li> Superb!  No stinky smell and really removed my 4 layers of polish only using one round cotton pad!  Unheard of at my house!  My nails were nicely smooth and not over dried after either. This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this polish remover!!! Best natural remover I&#x27;ve found!! I use non toxic nail polishes as well so that is possibly a reason why this works so well for me. I find that it&#x27;s best to use a cotton round, soak it with the remover and place it on the nail for few seconds before rubbing it off. It feels very moisturizing and I love that there&#x27;s no strong chemical scent that I found in other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; removers.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very pleased with this nail polish remover. Traditional polish removers really dried out my cuticles and smelled terrible so I wanted to find something organic. Although this polish remover takes a little bit longer to take the polish off, my cuticles do not dry out at all and it smells great!!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover it works great even on my acrylic nails at removing nail polish and it smells wonderful has a very soft natural feel to it.</li>
    <li> It removed my nail polishes that are chemical and organic very well. It&#x27;s smells really good as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m spoiled with my regular and efficient polish remover. Thought I would try something more natural, but the truth is, takes too long for me to get my polish off with this, and it&#x27;s greasy. I will use it up, but don&#x27;t love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely does its job well.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover.  It smells very nice and works just as good as the harsh chemically kind.  I&#x27;m very happy with the money I spent on this all natural product.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells great and best of all it takes the polish off with no nasty after smell. Ill be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> Removes my nail polisher incredibly well! Never had a problem with this product. Make sure you use a cotton ball to take it off and don&#x27;t be one of those fools that take the bottle and pour it over your nails thinking that&#x27;s a brilliant idea...... my friend did that....</li>
    <li> I was pleasently surprised by this product. Not only does it smell wonderful, it actually took off old nail polish (one coat anyway) without any problem. In fact, my nails felt nourished and not dried out and ready to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off like they would feel after using regular nail polish remover. I will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff really gets your polish off without the nasty chemical smell and it leaves nails moisturized, unlike the other nail polish removers that dry out your nail plate.</li>
    <li> One cotton ball cleaned nail polish from all fingernails easily. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than acetone or non-acetone polish remover. But use a small cotton ball because it&#x27;s so easy to use more than is needed, you don&#x27;t need to saturate the cotton ball either, only about half saturation will work, so as not to waste it since it is expensive in relation to others. Just coat nail completely first then go back and do a little rubbing on each nail and viola! Up to 6 coats of polish gone. It actually works faster and easier for me than traditional removers. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I always found drugstore non-acetone remover ineffective and acetone remover too harsh. I just used this for the first time and can&#x27;t believe how easily it took off my polish without drying out my cuticles and splitting my nails. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you don&#x27;t need much. Magic!</li>
    <li> No harsh smell..works perfectly! I can not believe that this is non toxic AND actually works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that this got my nail polish off! I really like it and like that it&#x27;s natural. Smells good. Definitely need to wash nails after use/before putting new polish on. Only problem was that the bottle was only filled up to the purple label. And the bottle is pretty small for the price.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. It works just as well as the old acetone ones but instead with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, couldn&#x27;t remove anything. Tried using a generic remover and it took it right off. Not sure why this product has great reviews.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not a fan of painting my nails due to the smell and idea of letting chemicals enter my body just for the sake of vanity. I originally saw a blog post about this item on The Local Rose, and thought no way is this going to work and if it does work, it&#x27;s going to require a lot of scrubbing and time. I was wrong. I had about 4 layers of OPI on and Karma Naturals took it off with ease and the best part was that it smelt amazing! It smells like lavender and tee-tree oil. How is it an ALL natural nontoxic affordable remover exists yet its not available in any stores. I went to Whole Foods in Venice Beach (the biggest most popular WF in the world) and all they had was chemical removers. I&#x27;m so impressed and will recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well!</li>
    <li> Works great - a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Would have never guessed that there was a polish remover that didn&#x27;t have chemicals like the other stuff out there.  Received very quickly</li>
    <li> It smells great, and it&#x27;s great to know that it is made from natural oils but is not as effective as the regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Yes, this deserves 10 stars at least. It is a bit pricier than your average polish remover but think of what you save: your health, your daughters health, your unhappiness about having to smell disgusting chemicals to remove your nail color.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best. Don&#x27;t bother with other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; removers- they either don&#x27;t work or they smell horrible</li>
    <li> Had no idea this oil based product would be this effective!  The scent is quite lavender but there is an unscented version available.  I bought this as I am working to improve the condition of my dry, ridged nails. If like me your hands are in water or hand sanitizer frequently, this product puts moisture back instead of further drying the nailbed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I got this in the mail. The bottle is TINY compared to the tall bottle of cheap stuff you buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when I first used it because it looked like my black nail polish wasn&#x27;t budging but after rubbing it a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;it all came off with ease. You don&#x27;t need much for all of your toes or fingers!  I am satisfied with it and would buy it again! It is&lt;br /&gt;kind of oily which is good because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your cuticles at all..and it also doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of color on them which&lt;br /&gt;is really good.</li>
    <li> works and I don&#x27;t feel bad using</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product and I definitely don&#x27;t hate it.... but, I tried it alongside the LA Fresh Eco Beauty Nail Polish Remover Pads, and there really was no comparison.  If this is all you know, it would work.  Having said that, you had better be a patient person.  Also, I can&#x27;t say how this would work on a non-organic polish.  I will say the smell is pleasant, though very faint.  I salute this company for offering other healthy options, though!  :)</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish remover, a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t dry my nails!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Easily removes polish. So glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> Takes time and effort to remove polish, but it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s non-toxic.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product, it really does take off nail polish easily, I no longer get a headache from nail polish remover! Lasts a really long time because you do not use much each time.</li>
    <li> Product was for my wife and these are her thoughts and words.  This may be the best polish remover that I have ever used.  It made my nails actually feel good - very moisturizing.  Totally different from traditional nail polish remover - in a good way.  The smell is actually pleasant also.</li>
    <li> Not stinky. Works just as well as regular polish remover. I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Wow,  It is better then conventional nail polish remover without the smell.  I will keep this as my permanent nail polish removal.  I was able to put a little on a cotton ball and clean 10 finger nails with just one cotton ball.  It smells good.  Now if I can persuade the nail salon to use this on me only instead of the acetone.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover smells like lavender and is oily. It was effective in removing my orange nail polish. I soaked a cotton balls and rubbed it couple times and voila! My nails look shiny and feel soft instead of dry and brittle. It is pricier compare to what I am used to pay for a bigger bottle for the harsh nail polish remover but I am fine with that since I like to wear nail polish and not regret it every time I remove the nail polish.</li>
    <li> Have to rub a bit more than with other products but the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> .Works OK .I use it to remove instant glue from my fingers  (  I build model boats.)</li>
    <li> Definitely agree with the reviews that this works better than regular acetone polish removers, specifically for the usage of nail polish removal; the formula is like an oil that rapidly removes the polish in just a few seconds, and then leaves nails hydrated. It smells so much better than acetone, too. My only problem with it is that it cannot be utilized as a prep tool for applying nail polish afterwards. Your only option really is to wash your hands to remove the oil from this polish remover, versus putting acetone on a cotton ball and prepping your nail base with it so that it&#x27;s clean for new nail polish. However, I think this is really a very small price to pay for the quality and effectiveness that you get from this product. Also, when it came in the mail, the bottle looked a little bit small to me, but honestly, you use 1 dab of this product (putting cotton ball to top of bottle and turning it upside down/backside up very quickly) and for me, it&#x27;s enough to remove 4 layers of nail polish on 5 fingers. So just 2 dabs (without the destroyed/dried-out cuticles) and you&#x27;re all set. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Not amazing--took alot of the product to remove red polish.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER go back to smelly removers again!!! Even took this to the manicurist with me so I could be pampered in style!</li>
    <li> Love this! Slightly slower than acetone but much gentler and leaves my nails feeling moisturized.  It also has a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> it did a fairly good job of removing the the polish.  it left an oily residue on my nails which i expected.  i didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  i&#x27;m not sure whether or not i would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> This is comparable to other natural nail polishes that I&#x27;ve used.  One coat comes off easily and two coats require some elbow work.  If you like the smell of lavender you&#x27;&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of replacing my previous standard non-acetone nail polish remover. Here is my review broken down in parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: When it arrived I was excited. Seeing as I paid $13.00 for this small bottle, I had expected a full bottle of the solution. This was not the case (and is the reason for my less than perfect review). As I show in the uploaded image, the bottle is missing approximately 2cm from the top of the bottle (or for better reference- up to the purple label, rather than what is seen in the image). Based on the amount I would normally use, that would be anywhere from 2-3 full nail removal. I am very unhappy about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: Once I received it, I decided to test it out right away. I recently switched to Butter nail polish (free from formaldehyde, and all carcinogens), and in order to have a lasting manicure it requires a base coat+2 color coats+top coat. I applied this to one nail, and a standard 2 coats of Essi nail polish + top coat (don&#x27;t use base coat here, I have a home made nail strengthener that I use before application) on another. I allowed them to dry for 15 min and then proceeded to use the Lavender remover. There was no noxious smell whatsoever, with just a whiff of lavender being the only thing I sensed. The nail polish came off very quickly, didn&#x27;t require more than 5 seconds of rubbing per nail. I have not tested a full ten nails, but based on the results I have seen I believe dabbing quickly, waiting 10 sec and then rubbing in circles to remove will work well and require only one partially saturated cotton ball. It is a bit oily, but I just washed my hands well after use, to remove excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: As I am very careful about what I permit to touch my body or skin, I have decided to break down the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- Propylene Carbonate- low hazard, no carcinogen proof, strong irritant on skin in base form (diluted cosmetic version is safe), no toxic effects discovered in research. It is a synthetic compound, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is bad.&lt;br /&gt;- soybean oil methyl exter- used in cosmetics or for car and asphalt cleaning; meets clean air standards (meaning non-toxic if inhaled); non-toxic, bio-based. There has been a possibility of a connection between soybeans and breast cancer in research, but seeing as this is a diluted amount and used on nails (low absorbency into out system), I do not believe this is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;- tocopheryl acetate- good old Vitamin E, great for softening skin and cuticles and when penetrates the skin (which it easily can) 5% is converted to free tocopherol and provides beneficial antioxidant effects ([...]); helps protect against ultraviolet rays when absorbed. On to (slight) concerns: it is a human skin toxicant or allergen (but with low impact as a whole); animal studies have shown tumor formation at high doses; uncertain environmental toxin (known as env. toxin, but with unknown effects). Basically, this is a modified form of Vitamin E, done so to improve shelf life, but which therefore sacrifices some quality and possibly takes on toxic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final rating is 4/5- ingredients are sound (there is no way you can be 100% super natural/organic/non-toxic when it comes to something like nail polish); effect is good; packaging needs to be more strictly regulated.research.

    <li> After being so sick of acetone nail polish, I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff! It smells great and my nails are so much healthier now. No yellow nail anymore woo! And you smell like an angel after :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product when I ordered it and I was amazed at how well it worked.  It actually removes nail polish faster and cleaner than the removers with acetone AND you use less of it, so it lasts longer.  It smells really good as well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You have to rub a little more than with a conventional one but it&#x27;s totally worth it because the smell is not toxic and it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> This is the only polish remover I have used since I found it about a year ago. It does exactly what its supposed to, but smells nice, and is moisturizing. It feels like it is helping your nails instead of hurting them. It works just as well as the chemical ones.</li>
    <li> It takes a little longer to get polish off but it leaves my nails in good shape.  When I used the regular polish it dried my nails out immediately and would take an all day putting conditioner on them to get them healthy looking.  BUT with this it has an oil base that does not strip the nail and leave it in great condition.  I love that it&#x27;s natural.  I love it and will order again!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish remover I have ever used. Well worth ordering it online rather than just popping into Walmart for some cheaper stuff. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and nails like normal remover and it smells so much better, whether its the lavender or tea tree oil scent. It is especially great if you have brittle nails like me.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and will definitely spare your nails the damage of standard acetone removers. However, I had to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; significantly harder and longer to remove a textured glitter polish--eventually having to finish the job using normal remover. That said, this lavender stuff might work better on normal, solid polishes. Overall a good buy though, and I&#x27;ll surely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It removes polish without drying out my nails. I have been using this polish remover for over a year, and wouldn&#x27;t go back to acetone.</li>
    <li> Love this, such an improvement over acetone or non-acetone polish remover. Smells wonderful and works great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but after using it one time I was convinced! So nice to be able to remove nail polish NATURALLY instead of breathing in those awful fumes from regular remover. I highly recommend this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is great! I saw a write up on it in Prevention and it was as good as it said.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover. I am one of those people who globs on layers upon layers of nail polish. This remover got all of the layers of polish off and I only used a single cotton swab!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay (I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of lavender) and it leaves a greasy film on my nails, but that&#x27;s better than the alternative of dry nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is beyond awesome ! It removes  all of the different polishes I have easily. It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my  nails or cuticles .&lt;br /&gt;All other removers will be forever forgotten ,</li>
    <li> favorite nail polish remover mild not harsh and smells great</li>
    <li> Have to scrub a bit but smells so nice I can use it in the car!</li>
    <li> I agree with all the positive remarks of other reviewers.  It&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
    <li> It takes long to remove nail polish, it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, yes, I should not be bragging about it;). This nail remover blew me away. It kept my nails moist while removing the polish and has a beautiful fragrance too. I will never go back to using drugstore removers.</li>
    <li> My nails were getting dry and cracked, so I thought I&#x27;d try to use a more natural polish remover product than the usual acetone removers.  This seemed awfully expensive for polish remover, but the reviews were good, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m sold.  I love this stuff.  Will never go back to Cutex-type polish removers.  And it takes just a tiny dab on a cotton pad to remove all the polish on all my fingers.  Not at all drying.  Much better for my nails, and smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> I agree with others who said it works better than chemical removers. It blasted through four layers of polish for me in about half the time. Some people have said it takes longer for them, but even if that&#x27;s the case for you, it&#x27;s still well worth the time and effort to not be putting toxic chemicals on your skin or breathing the fumes. Even though it&#x27;s pricier than chemical removers, I definitely won&#x27;t be using anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Cruelty free and it works better than the average nail polish remover. Because it works so well you only need to use a small amount. Definitely worth the price! Oh and it leave you smelling great and the oils really make me feel like it&#x27;s not bad for my nails either. :()</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. No more noxious chemical polish removers for me! I&#x27;m so happy to find this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a non-toxic safe nail polish remover for some time and have tried a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; removers, but none have worked as well as this one. It may not &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; like traditional polish removers, but it does take the polish off pretty cleanly with very, very minimal work. AND, my husband doesn&#x27;t gag while I&#x27;m using it! Plus plus!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and will certainly order it again.</li>
    <li> This product works great &amp; I feel good using it knowing there are not harmful chemicals in it. Seller was great!</li>
    <li> This is great polish remover.  Makes your nails feel and look much healthier than those products containing the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> The product itself was good but when I received the item it had been leaking and half the bottle was empty!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It smells really good, it removes polish extremely well and no HARSH Smell!! woo hoo.... It actually smells great works well and it&#x27;s not full of chemicals.. It&#x27;s fabulous and I would recommend product... I will buy it again. Recommend. Item arrived timely and well packaged would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Lavender, one of my favorite scents, used in the nail polish remover, has a great smell, not so much of overbearing chemical smell like other brands. I like how effectively this removes nail polishes. It does leave my nails oily which I actually don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another nail polish remover!</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is awesome.  It works as well as or better than any regular or non-acetone polish remover I have ever tried.  I use it with my acrylic nails and have absolutely no problem.  I like to remove and change my nail polish frequently and this not only makes it easy to do so, but it is easy on my nails, cuticles, and skin.  It has a very pleasing scent in the lavender and since it is oil-based it is very easy on the fingers and add some nice moisture to the cuticles as well.  I use the one cotton ball remover trick with this and quickly remove all of my polish in five minutes or less.  It does an amazing job.  I will definitely be ordering more and making this the nail polish remover of choice.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how well this remover would work but took a chance anyway based on other reviews and ended up really impressed with it. It seems to take off my polish faster than the traditional remover but without the harsh smell or bitter chemical taste on my fingers like the old one did.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been looking for an organic Nail Polish remover for a while and am glad I found this one.  It smells pleasantly and takes off the nail polish.  You may have to work on it a little bit longer but that&#x27;s totally worth the fact that it is natural.</li>
    <li> This smells great and doesn&#x27;t seem as harsh as the cheap drug store stuff.  it does take a little longer to get the nail polish off.  but i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this product! The polish came off easily and there was no harsh chemical smell or feeling. My daughter has very sensitive dry skin and she had no irritation.</li>
    <li> I am just logging in to order a new bottle in case they stop making it... that&#x27;s how much I like it. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover!  It doesn&#x27;t have any of the harsh chemicals that regular nail polish remover has.  I use some on a cotton ball and it immediately removes my nail polish without leaving my nails feeling weak.  It has a pleasant lavender smell.  Scents and chemicals bother me and give me headaches but this product doesn&#x27;t.  Wish I had found this years ago as I love wearing nail polish and always used the acetone based removers that smell so bad and are full of chemicals!</li>
    <li> Non-toxic and works well. It takes an extra second or two to remove nail polish when compared to acetone, but it still works well and doesn&#x27;t require a ridiculous amount of scrubbing or liquid. I haven&#x27;t had any success in using it to remove glitter nail polish, but then again I always struggled to do so with acetone anyways. The smell isn&#x27;t obnoxious at all, and is quite pleasant actually due to the lavender. The bottle is very, very small. Was expecting something larger and comparable to the size of a regular bottle of acetone. However, it&#x27;s my fault for not knowing what 4oz looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to be made from organic soybean oil although the ingredients listed on the bottle do not specify this. I emailed the company via their website and a representative confirmed that it was indeed organic soybean oil. Still, I find it odd that this information is not explicitly stated on the bottle, and I&#x27;m not satisfied with just taking their word. I would prefer to see some sort of physical indication on the bottle that the soy is indeed organic. After all, most soy tends to be genetically modified.</li>
    <li> I love the simple&lt;br /&gt; Fact that it is&lt;br /&gt; All natural......</li>
    <li> This remover works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! This removed my polish from all ten fingers using only two cotton balls. I didn&#x27;t need to rub the nails hard, nor completely soak them. The scent of the product is pleasant too! I will never go back to using the chemical-filled polish removers that you find at most stores. I highly recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how well this took off my nail polish since I&#x27;ve always used the harsh drugstore brands.  I honestly prefer to use this at night time simply so I can leave the oil on my cuticles overnight.  Obviously you can still use it during the day, but I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it if I have to wash my hands since I&#x27;m not absorbing all of the benefits of the product.  I really enjoy the smell as well; I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering and it&#x27;s WAY better than the usual drugstore removers.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it, I feel more comfortable recommending it to my friends and family.  I recently bought some hardcore glitter polish and this didn&#x27;t begin to touch it; to be fair, though, I bought single pads of a drugstore brand and it still took about 20 minutes to get all of the polish off.  Just throwing that warning out there, but it&#x27;s rare that I use the glitter polish anyways.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I am into organic and natural products and this nail polish remover worked great and smelled good too. I definitely plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like it, much better than the CVS / safeway / bigstore brands. The nail polish seems to melt away.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering this stuff again! Love Love Love. No fumes and leaves your nails feeling healthy. Slightly oily wouldn&#x27;t put nail polish on right away, but this stuff is super effective in removing some of the hardest to take off nail polish. Definitely reordering!  I would feel comfortable using this to remove little girls&#x27; nail polish for sure!</li>
    <li> This appeared well packaged, but when I unwrapped it, 1/5 of the tiny expensive bottle had leaked out.  This does smell and feel good, but it takes quite a while, and I ended up with red nail polish infused oil dripping down my hands.  If you have the time to rub away at the polish while making a big mess, then you might like this. Just make sure you check your bottle immediately, so you can decide if it&#x27;s worth contacting the seller and asking for a refund/exchange.</li>
    <li> Product works well (enough) and smells nice but — like another reviewer stated, see below — when I received it the bottle was less than 3/4 full of remover. You see in the photo online that the liquid is above the purple label? With the bottle I received — it was unopened and unbroken when it arrived — the liquid did not even REACH the purple label. I paid for 4 ounces (and this stuff is not cheap) and I got much less than that. I probably won&#x27;t order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, bad distributor&lt;br /&gt;By ASVY on May 21, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in hopes of replacing my previous standard non-acetone nail polish remover. Here is my review broken down in parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: When it arrived I was excited. Seeing as I paid $13.00 for this small bottle, I had expected a full bottle of the solution. This was not the case (and is the reason for my less than perfect review). As I show in the uploaded image, the bottle is missing approximately 2cm from the top of the bottle (or for better reference- up to the purple label, rather than what is seen in the image). Based on the amount I would normally use, that would be anywhere from 2-3 full nail removal. I am very unhappy about this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works well, chemical free.</li>
    <li> It took 45 minutes to remove from my finger nails. Sooooo long!!! But I wanted something healthier to remove my polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through almost an entire bottle of this and I have to say I&#x27;m surprised by how well it preforms. I&#x27;ve had 0 luck with non-acetone polish removers in the past but was blown away by this one! I&#x27;d say it works better than my regular remover. It doesn&#x27;t the greatest- but it doesn&#x27;t smell BAD.. A hint of lavender. The only downside is that it leaves an oily residue on my nails and I need to wash them thoroughly before painting them. I think I may enjoy the tea tree oil one better if only for the smell. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best nail polish remover ever! It doesn&#x27;t smell and it removes nail polish very efficiently. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Amazing, moisturizing polish remover! No more acetone for me!</li>
    <li> Super surprised at how well this works.  I got for my daughter, i didn&#x27;t want to use harsh acetone on her baby feet.  I thought, as with most natural products, that I would be doing a lot of rubbing and it would be just &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;.  I was wrong!  Got off all the polish easily with no harsh smell or damage to her skin.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish remover. Love the scent, no obnoxious lingering smell. And I don&#x27;t have to wrap the cotton rounds in plastic shopping bags to eliminate the obnoxious fumes that, especially, bother men friends. My nails are weak, peel and crack. It&#x27;s great knowing this polish remover won&#x27;t further damage the nails I&#x27;m trying to strengthen.</li>
    <li> easily removes polish, and leaves my hands smooth and smelling lovely.</li>
    <li> Organic, smells great, didn&#x27;t dry out my nails/cuticles/skin like all other polish.  I left it on for ~5 min on a cottonball, polish came right off, at least 3 coats of polish, the third being glitter tips, with a sparse glitter top coat...it would&#x27;ve taken the same soak time with reg. polish, yet would&#x27;ve stunk, and dryed the heck out of my skin, nails, and cuticles.  It was actually refreshing for my skin and nails.  They looked hydrated.  Worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent nice smell very gentle remover</li>
    <li> Definitely takes a lot more scrubbing than your usual paint thinner nail polish remover (to be expected), but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m chemically sensitive and can tolerate this product once in a while. This is the most effective non toxic nail polish removers I&#x27;ve found.  Now, if I could only find a good non toxic nail polish that looks good and doesn&#x27;t immediately chip.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have very weak, thin, splitting nails and wanted to stay away from using the acetone polish removers. I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff! It&#x27;s AMAZING!!! First off, it&#x27;s smells really nice. Depending on the type of polish, it can take a little effort to really get off all the polish, you just have to be patient, and I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. It feels much more moisturizing than the horrible drying out affects of acetone removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome miracle remover! Removing nail polish is something i hate to do, due to smell and harsh feeling on my nails. This remover cleans all the nails on feet and hand with just one cotton ball and two if you have glitter, without any nuance. The trick is after soaking the cotton ball with the remover, dab it on all nails wait for 10 secs and start the removing process by massaging the nail in circular motions. Tadaa!Job Done! Now have a quick wash before you paint your nails.(Cannot use for correction and nail stamping because of oils)</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: I am in love with this nail polish remover. I used it for the first time to remove a very dark/brownish red nail polish &amp; it worked. The oil base is perfection to keep the nails nice &amp; moist, not like regular nail polish remover or acetone that leave the nails dry. The smell is divine &amp; a little goes a long way. I normally use about 3 cotton balls per hand &amp; feet sometimes more depending on nail color I am removing, with this product I literally used 1 cotton per limb. I will never us another nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Before finding this nail polish remover, my nails were weak and brittle and always peeling with how often I did my nails and with how much crappy nail polish remover I was swiping and rubbing over them.&lt;br /&gt;With this, it nourishes my nail and smells A MILLION TIMES BETTER! My sister complained like crazy when I did my nails before and with the way my old nail polish remover smelt, would give her a headache. Which was at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;It may be a little oily but you get used to it and it takes a few more rubs to get all of your nail polish off.&lt;br /&gt;You do not need near as much of this remover as a regular remover to take off any nail polish, whatever color it may be.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will never buy another remover, this is it! Plus, this little bottle has lasted my sister and I for a few months now!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any chemical smell and removes nail polish very fast.</li>
    <li> Easily takes off the nail polish and makes your nails smell so good! Knowing that it&#x27;s healthier than the regular nail polish also makes this product twice as great!</li>
    <li> i like it .. its work</li>
    <li> Polish comes off without the bad smell.</li>
    <li> Remove your polish soon after you apply on nails, oily but gives good feel to your nails...</li>
    <li> It takes a little more scrubbing than the acetone stuff but has a lovely scent and leaves your hands soft from the oils. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and actually works! You have to rub a bit harder than with a regular nail polish remover, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
    <li> It works just as good as regular nail polish remover, except it feels like oil!  No more bad small or harsh chemicals.  I am so glad I found this, it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> At my age I don&#x27;t need to be using regular nail polish remover that dries out my nails.  This is an excellent product.  Seems a bit pricey but a little goes a long way.  One cotton ball with remover applied worked for both hands.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic polish remover for ages, and this does the trick. a bit slow to start but then gets the polish off in large swipes. does leave an oily residue, but it smells amazing and feels hydrating. Lavender scent is not too overwhelming and so much better than the usual chemical smell. And the price is right. Switch to organic remover already!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE the smell of this remover. I first bought this because the ordinary store bought removers bother my husband. He can&#x27;t stand the smell. This smells just like an essential oil and no chemical smell. I plan to use it for years to come!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works well, smells good, gentler on my dry nails. I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I am an Essie and OPI kind of girl. However, there&#x27;s nothing like spending $9 on a new nail polish, only to have your home manicure ruined the next day because your nails are brittle and peeling apart. I can honestly say that since the day I got this in the mail, my nails have not peeled ONCE. It&#x27;s magic. It smells wholesome, you don&#x27;t have to worry about breathing it in, and once your cotton round gets all oily it took the polish off my fingers AND toes with the use of just one cotton ball. The savings in cotton balls is well worth the extra cost for this stuff. Not to mention it will last forever. A little goes a long ways, my friends. Because of the oil, you do have to wash your nails before you paint them (heaven forbid). I can now safely change my nail color three times a week if I wish with no consequences. If anything, my nails are in better shape than if I just left them alone. This is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> If you want something that takes off any color nail polish in a literal flash and doesn&#x27;t leave your nails brittle, broken, or peeling this is your stuff. it smells great, feels amazing, and I can use 1 cotton round and remove polish from 10 fingernails no matter how dark the polish was.</li>
    <li> As others mentioned, the bottle was leaking upon arrival and not completely full as shown on the pic.  Also, the label says lavender scent but it definitely smelled tea tree - no lavender scent at all (manufacturing issue?)  It removed nail polish well so that&#x27;s why giving a 3 star.  Amazon was great to resolve the issue. If they redesign the packaging and resolve the scent issue, I will try it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that a gentle, natural product will remove nail polish but it will. It doesn&#x27;t damage my nails like acetone and even non-acetone removers. In fact, this natural remover is the only reason I can polish my nails at all! Other products left my nails yellow, weak, and splitting. Karma Organics smell good too!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells like lavender!!!! I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a natural nail polish remover that works without tons of elbow grease. Yay! Keeper.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She changes her nail polish often and thought she would love this healthier alternative to acetone. The amount of product in the bottle is not the same as in the photo, just a tad higher than the purple label. It is on the pricey side but it should last a while before your next purchase since according to my wife, she can wipe off 4 layers of nail polish from all 10 fingernails using just a single cotton ball dabbed with the solution. It also hasn&#x27;t dried out her nails like acetone does. Overall my wife&#x27;s very happy with this new find and we&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is an excellent alternative to all the chemical laden removers on the market. It safely and effectively removes nail polish and the major added bonus is the nice lavender smell versus the horrible smell of the typical nail polish removers. This is definitely my new go-to for nail polish remover!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good organic nail polish remover for a long time. After doing a bit of research, I stumbled apon this beauty! I was a little hesitant to try it at first; almost 12 bucks for such a small amount?! That&#x27;s nuts! But now that I bought it, I feel the price is a small price to pay for a healthy alternative to conventional, chemical filled polish remover. First, and best thing about this product, is smells WONDERFUL! No strong chemical oders in this baby! Just the sweet, relaxing smell of Lavender. Another interesting thing about this polish remover is that is slightly oily, and moisturizes the nail quite nicely while its being used. You do need to soak your nail(s) with some of the polish remover for a few minutes before you start trying to take off any polish you are wearing, especially on toenails. It takes a little while, but when used correctly it works like a charm! My only word of warning is to be very careful not to drop the bottle, as it is made if glass.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product and I&#x27;ll definitely be using it for many years to come! I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  takes polish off easily.  very pleased.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. It has the effectiveness of trying to get your nail polish with olive oil. I was very disappointed. I decided to mix it in with my regular nail polish, so hopefully I will get the moisturizing effect, and my nail polish off.</li>
    <li> takes way too long to remove polish.  Other than that, nice product and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover. With regular nail polish remover, I was using a cotton ball per 2 nails. With this stuff I use a cotton ball per 5 nails. Not only am I using the whole cotton ball but I am not continuously re-wetting it like I do with nail polish remover. I find that with this Organic nail polish remover, I simply need to do one dipping motion with a cotton ball applied to the mouth of the bottle and start rubbing a nail. Even though I can&#x27;t feel the remover right away because it isn&#x27;t cold like regular remover, after a moment it starts sliding easily and the polish begins to dissolve. Also I love the smell (no longer does it stink up the whole house when I do my nails, which is a couple times per week) and I feel like I am moisturizing my nails while I strip away the polish, instead of damaging them with regular remover. I can not confirm if this stuff is actually healthy for your nails, but the oily texture certainly makes it feel that way. I will never go back to regular nail polish remover!</li>
    <li> I like this polish because it is better for your nails.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works great smells lovely and I feel like it&#x27;s not stripping all of the moisture out of my nails.</li>
    <li> Hands down, I love this polish remover! It doesn&#x27;t smell awful like most other brands and I don&#x27;t want to put toxic chemicals on my nails either. I also have a pet bird so need to be extremely careful with fumes that can travel to other rooms and so I feel much better using this product than the drug store special. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Takes regular nail polish off just as fast as acetone remover, perhaps just a little bit longer for glitter polish. Leaves my nails feeling nice not looking all beat up. Lavender has a very strong smell, unscented is pretty much unscented. Overall I&#x27;d recommend it. Oh a little goes a LONG way so it&#x27;s worth the $$</li>
    <li> calming lavender smell, fingers and nails remain moisturised after used.</li>
    <li> So much better than the other natural polish removers I&#x27;ve tried that are kind of greasy and you have to scrub hard to get to work. This dissolves polish right away. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> First off I love that this products is natural. That is why I bought it. But I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the bottle and the smell was delightful. Especially compared to standard nail polish removers. I didn&#x27;t expect a products that smelled so good to actually work but it does! Not only that but a tiny bit goes a longggg way. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Amazed at how great this stuff works! I am never using harsh chemicals again. This stuff works better than the pharmacy bought remover I was previously using. Even removes stubborn glittery polish without any extra strain. Just put some on a cottonball (you don&#x27;t even need a lot) and hold it on your nail for 10 seconds then rub. My bf even used it to remove glue off his hands. It&#x27;s oily/greasy but that&#x27;s no biggie, just wash your hands after, if anything, it&#x27;s moisturizing your cuticles. Pleasant smell. LOVE IT - will be using again and again!</li>
    <li> The bottle of remover was pack very well, not a drop was lost in shipping.  Organic Lavender Remover works well, better than the non-acetate remover by far.  Sure am more comfortable using this for its non-toxic attributes.  Smell nicer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Granny, from the Inland NW mountains</li>
    <li> This lavender scented remover worked like a charm!  I used to get headaches after using conventional nail polish remover, but this product has solved that problem: No headaches!  It also did it&#x27;s job by removing all of my nail polish quickly.  I love Karma Organics, and will be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> I just used this product on my finger nails - removed a single clear top coat and a single very light colour. So far, I&#x27;m thrilled.  Many years ago, I wore extremely long nails with numerous coats of dark polish.  I&#x27;ve no idea how this might work on that.  Either way, you must be a bit patient.  If you think this will remove polish as the normal, super nasty chemical concoction most of us use, think again.  There&#x27;s no way this natural product can compete for shear quickness of removal. However, if you don&#x27;t want to dip your fingers into carcinogens or continue to trash our environment, then this is the remover for you. I used a cotton ball, held for perhaps 5 seconds, then wiped.  Did have to repeat.  Positives: 1/  Did not leave my nails and cuticles as though they&#x27;d been dipped in acid.  2/  There is no &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t breathe around this stuff&amp;#34; thoughts.  3/  Did not have to remove polish outside, which I often do.  4/  Did not throw used cotton ball in the toilet so as to not smell up the trash.  I hate to consider all the years I used that mean stuff, taking it in through my skin.  Give it a shot - for me, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe I used the caustic and horrid-smelling chemical nain polish remover for years! And I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was for our bodies until I went on the internet and saw what goes into those cheap, ubiquitous nail polish removers. Yes, this product isn&#x27;t inexpensive, but what a difference it makes to have the smell of lavender in your nostrils instead of harsh chemicals....not to speak of the fact that only natural ingredients are ingested into the nail and skin (yes, everything you put on your skin goes right into your system!).  Furthermore, it does an excellent job of removing the nail polish....just as good, to be sure, as the chemical stuff. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but it works so well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails and skin. I&#x27;m definitely buying this again, I&#x27;m not ever going back to using that toxic trash I had before!</li>
    <li> absolutley love it, it&#x27;s gentle and it smells of lavender</li>
    <li> Works better than any drugstore nail polish remover I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product. I wish I found it sooner! no more dry cuticle.</li>
    <li> Unlike all the other nail polish removers I&#x27;ve tried, this one is not only effective but it doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell and I feel a lot better about the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This remover works absolutely great.  The only problem was when I received it, because of the extreme heat here in AZ, the bottled was leaking from heat combustion, and leaked all over the bottle, otherwise the product itself is awesome.  Will order again when it gets a little cooler so the bottle won&#x27;t get so hot.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  One small soaked cotten ball was all I needed per hand to remove polish.  I have OPI polishes mostly and it all came off FASTER than Cutex which is what I&#x27;ve always used.  Loved that there was no chemical odor!  Highly recommend even at the price.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  But it does take longer to remove several layers of polish than it takes with acetone; but not a lot more time.  I find that if I put the remover on the cotton ball and leave the ball on my nails for a few seconds and then wipe it off, it works faster.  This is a very small inconvenience to avoid having to use strong chemicals.  But there&#x27;s one other issue that&#x27;s important.  Since this is quite oily, you MUST make sure that you clean your nails well after removing the polish.  I just use a nail brush and some liquid soap, brush the nails, rinse them and let them air dry like I&#x27;ve done before but now this is very important because if you leave any of this on your nails, the polish won&#x27;t adhere well.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish remover, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails and it keeps them strong.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish remover ever. Super gentle on your nails yet does a great job removing nail polish. Smells amazing</li>
    <li> I really like this product but can only give three stars. I like the packaging. Its simple and packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to help alleviate my allergies. Regular nail polish and removers have two many  chemicals and toxins and smells horrible so I switched to a more organic brand. The remover smells great, the lavender isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t offset allergies.&lt;br /&gt;The remover works but I have to do a scrub, and it takes a while longer, on my nails to actually remove my Scotch nail polish.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the kind I&#x27;ve traditiionally used, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and I have the added pleasure of knowing I&#x27;m not putting toxins on my skin, which absorbs more into the body than the gastro intestinal system does.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used. Good smell, not irritating, does not dry out my nails. On the contrary, the oil components actually moisturizes nails. And it does a good job in removing nail polishes which is amazing.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural but sometimes it takes a while to remove nail Polish.  Update: It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work anymore 🙄</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> It works well with at least Opi and glitter nail polish. My nails didnt get dried out so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and it smells so much better than the acetone/non acetone removers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This worked ok for water based kids nail polish but not that well. It smells nice and seems very natural and non toxic which can be a plus, but it didnt work on my regular polish.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, removes polish well, &amp; has a great smell!</li>
    <li> Works really well for removing both traditional and non-toxic nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Removed one star because my bottle leaked in transit although it was well wrapped in bubble wrap. I lost about 1/8 of the bottle. I see that I am not the only customer who has had that issue. I am keeping it because it took a while to arrive and I am out of my other nail polish remover. However, they do need to consider a different lid!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time today and it works just as well as traditional (toxic) nail polish removers and a thousand times better than any non-toxic remover I have used. I had cute flower stickers over my polish which are always hard to remove, and these were just as difficult as with normal remover. But not more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love the scent. It just smells like lavender. No other scent at all. I don&#x27;t understand how it works so well and smells so natural and fresh. But I am impressed! Best natural nail polish remover I have ever used and I have used quite a few.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I used this for months after not wearing polish for several years and had no issues.  Then I tried another &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; brand and my nails started to peel and split far back into the nail bed.  This is all that I will use now.  I find it helpful to brush a layer onto all of my nails with my thumb, and then let that sit while I apply it to a cotton ball to rub the polish off my nails.  Even glitter polishes come off with minimal rubbing when it has time to sit on the polish for a minute or two.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails fairly regularly and this is a great polish remover.  I love this product because it is non-toxic, takes of dark and glitter nail polishes well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles and the smell is fantastic.  This is the only polish remover that I am allowed to use when my husband is home because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the traditional polish remover.  No matter what I have polished my nails with, (I don&#x27;t think it will remove gel polish) all traces can be removed with one cotton pad.  Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This has no disturbing chemical scent.  It removes nail polish relatively quickly and the oily texture feels nourishing to my nails and cuticles.  I am very pleased!  (Used for the first time in April 2014.)</li>
    <li> Smells good. Works fine but slower than regular nail polish remover. You need to soak your nails a bit. I really like it, it doesn&#x27;t dry my cuticles out like regular remover.</li>
    <li> This is amazing nail polish remover! Not only is it non-toxic (just check the ewg.org website), but it WORKS!! To remove an excellent salon-applied nail polish, I simply applied to all fingers, then began removing. It only took one pad, the polish came off with just a hint of persistence and without any &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; effort. :) And no acetone fumes, no chemical smell - just an oily-lavender-ish scent that washes off easily when done. I wish I had found this product way sooner!</li>
    <li> This is so gentle yet removes every nail polish I&#x27;ve tried, even some of those really difficult &amp;#34;5-free&amp;#34; polishes.&lt;br /&gt;As other customers noted, it&#x27;s very concentrated &amp; oily. I like that because it&#x27;s easier to control , &amp;#34;neater&amp;#34; to use &amp; not so drying on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight lavender scent but not enough so you really notice.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle will last a long time but I would  definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t leak. It works well but does need a bit more rubbing. Nice that it doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s organic :)</li>
    <li> Update: I am just about to order this product again, although I still have some left. For anyone concerned about the price, the little bottle has lasted more than 16 months!! It&#x27;s really the best remover available anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I LOVE this remover. It leaves my nails undamaged and removes every bit of polish. Non-acetone and even acetone removers always leave a residue, not this one. You only need one cotton ball for all 10 nails. This stuff is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great polish remover. Can&#x27;t understand other reviewers who remark on having to wash your hands after using this product, because it&#x27;s a remover and cuticle softener at the same time. My manicurist often uses oil after she removes the polish, and I always have to wash my hands before she applies new polish, With this remover you need only a small amount to remove all your polish, and when you wash it off, everything is softer. Lovely scent, too. It&#x27;s great, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Karma Naturals organic nail polish remover moisturizes my nails &amp; cuticles, and it has a much more pleasant scent than ordinary, non-organic polish removers that dry out my nails and stink of chemicals. Additionally, I noticed that I do not need to use as much Karma Naturals polish remover as ordinary remover when removing a full manicure. One cotton ball will remove bright or dark polish from an entire hand using Karma Naturals whereas I need 3-4 cotton balls soaked in the typical drug store brand remover. Although I&#x27;ve only used Karma Naturals for a few weeks, I was a convert after my first use! I love this stuff and I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works great and is also natural!  Old products now in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve found so far.  Other organic removers just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> this is just fantastic..  It smells great (who can say that about a polish remover?) is non-toxic, (who can say THAT about a polish remover!), got a GREAT score on EWG.org., takes polish off quickly, and leaves your fingers soft and a little oily, but that beats dryness anytime.  Love this and will purchase as long as its available to buy.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this.  I am slowly switching everything in my household to natural/organic chemical free.  This works great..you may just need to be a bit more patient than normal nail polish remover.  Let it sit on your nail with a cotton ball, then rub in small circles, works perfect.  You can smell and feel the difference form the chemical ridden stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good, non-toxic! It&#x27;s not great for glitter polish, but neither is regular polish remover! Sometimes it just requires a little more patience if the polish has glitter, but it&#x27;s fast and easy for regular polish</li>
    <li> Takes lots of remover and strength to get nail polish off.  True, does not have chemicals and no bad odor but wow, the time it takes to remove nail polish is a down side.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Great odor. When you get the bottle it looks like it is missing fluid but it&#x27;s not. It measures exactly 4 oz. In a 5 oz. Bottle.  It took me one cotton round with this product to remove all nail polish from all 10 fingers and toes. Works amazing! Will be doing a YouTube review of this because I love it so much!</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well!  I was nervous about how well it could possibly work being so natural, but I am never going back to chemical removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast, gentle, effective and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about a natural nail polish remover but this stuff works! If you have several layers of polish, it will take some patience but it removes polish better than the stuff that gives me a headache. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before applying new polish.</li>
    <li> Worked with some nail polish, but badly with others</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  After getting tired of my damaged and peeling nails I started looking into all kinds of products that I hoped would help.  One of the things I wanted to try was quitting acetone remover.  Since then I&#x27;ve actually learned some things that would make me consider using acetone again, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the most effective non-acetone remover I have ever used, and the smell is actually pretty pleasant.  The smell is the main reason I am sticking with it.  I don&#x27;t get bothered by smells too much, but I usually do my nails while watching TV with my boyfriend and I can tell he hates the smell of acetone.  So thanks for giving me this alternative!  Now he doesn&#x27;t even notice when I break out the nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was amazed how great this worked. You have to apply a little more pressure and you might have to do it twice, but your nails look like they  were moisturized when you are done. And, no yucky chemical smell! So happy that this will help my nails to be healthier and look better! Fast shipping too! Can&#x27;t wait to try the No Miss Vegan nail polish I bought!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable........ not only does it take off the polish easily but seems nice.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. High quality product. A great non-toxic nail polish remover with a pleasant lavender scent. Doesn&#x27;t dry out nails.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful smell, does the job on removing polish and really conditions your nails and cuticles at the same time.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work quite well and the lavender fragrance is soooo much better than generic polish removers. I&#x27;m happy that I bought it, even though it&#x27;s more expensive than the usual national brands.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant about this product. It works! You just need to rub a little harder than other nail polish removers to get rid of the excess unwanted nail polish.</li>
    <li> The nail polish remover smells really nice and has a nice slightly oily consistency to it which moisturizes your nails and helps the polish to come off.</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t smell awful</li>
    <li> It can remove the nail clearly. I like it.</li>
    <li> Glad to find a less toxic product for removing nail polish.  Works well with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Scent is wonderful - not like the chemical store bought removers out there.  Was surprised at how well it worked.  I usually would need a few cotton balls with the chemical nail polish remover...with this I just needed one!  It&#x27;s thicker, a little like oil, but that is what made it last on the cotton ball.  Just a few seconds of rubbing on each nail and I was done.  Won&#x27;t be going back to the old stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been looking around for a non-toxic polish remover that works and happened to find a recommendation of this product online. I gave it a try and it is amazing! No hard rub and few drops, I can clean my ten finger nails without drying them out!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Not as oily as expected from reading some other reviews.  Will definately purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The Acetone Polish removers have really been taking their toll on me and my family,my husband cant stand the strong smell gives him headaches when I use it so I did some searching on Amazon and found this after reading all the good reviews I placed my order this stuff works excellent .Removes polish with no problems even glitter this is soybean oil based and NON TOXIC! I never want to go back to the old acetone removers again just wish I knew about this long ago now I wont feel guilty using this this organic remover around my family also the seller is excellent packaged perfect and arrived fast I plan on ordering their nail polishes also.</li>
    <li> This fingernail polish remover is gentle, smells good, and most importantly, really removes the polish!  I have tried other removers which didn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals and they didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  This is one of the best I have ever used, harsh chemicals or no. I am very pleased with this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This review is based on only one use but on that basis I am a fan.  I used one cotton ball, refreshed once, to clean all ten nails.  There were four coats: base, 2 of &amp;#34;this color&#x27;s making waves&amp;#34;, and a top coat.  All OPI; the color is a shimmer.  This product took care of it all. Because I had the time I am letting my nails breathe- removed the polish mid afternoon and won&#x27;t polish until maybe tomorrow. To me the smell is not overly lavender but then I am not a lavender fan.  The smell was neutral and the consistency slightly oily.  Both good things for me and the condition of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to compliment the seller, Etailz, on the packaging.  The 4oz bottle was wrapped in bubble wrap and attached to a cardboard backing and wrapped in plastic.  Then it was boxed.  Secure and very nicely done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural/ non-toxic polish remover that actually works and this does!  It does have propylene carbonate as the first ingredient but from what I could find online seems much less toxic than using acetone by far. Has a really pleasant lavender scent and took of the nail polish quite easily.  I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website, it&#x27;s categorized as a low overall hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705314/PROPYLENE_CARBONATE/</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works with a little extra rubbing and it smells great. But best of all, it doesn&#x27;t damage my nails!</li>
    <li> Works great, but it&#x27;s difficult to remove glitter nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only reason for the 4 star rating is removal of polish takes a bit of elbow grease, making removal difficult when your child is actively resisting your efforts haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, great piece of mind, great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish remover! It&#x27;s very gentle on my nails and has a pleasant smell to it. It even removes glitter polish,which is a huge plus. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I read the reviews, but after using it, oh my goodness.  It works great, smells good and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make my nails feel stripped and dry.  Really, really love this product!</li>
    <li> Works really well to remove polish. Just as well as regular nail polish remover but without all of the nasty chemicals. Has a nice fragrance. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but still needs some pressure. The best organic/natural nail polish remover out there.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than the regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product sooner. Works and smells great. I finally feel comfortbale painting my niece&#x27;s nails when she asks. Will be buying as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just blown away. How did they do this without using acetone. It removes everything effortlessly, even big glittery nail polish and it leaves an oily moisturizing coat on the nails. Just awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and works well!</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well. Maybe takes a little more rubbing to get my polish off, but it&#x27;s so much easier on my nails. They are healthy again!</li>
    <li> This product really, really works!  I had given up on \\&quot;organic\\&quot; polish removers---trying at least 3 different brands, and just throwing the last one away.  They just didn&#x27;t work~  So I resorted to finally buying good ole acetone and have been using that for a few months.  Meanwhile, I saw this on Amazon and decided (based on the reviews) to give it a try.  I had had a professional manicure (base coat, 2 layers polish, top coat) done.  The remover took it all off very nicely.  But the color was a very neutral color, so I wanted to see how it would remove a very dark, bright color (again with a base coat and top coat as well) that I did at home.  It worked just as well---completely removing the polish.  I don&#x27;t feel that I have to rub any more or longer than for the acetone I was using.  I&#x27;m really thrilled and amazed at how well it works.  Others commented on the \\&quot;smell\\&quot;---but it&#x27;s totally fine---very faint (and I have a sensitive nose).  FINALLY---SOMETHING THAT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked a natural polish remover works so well since I have had poor luck with both natural remover and polish. This stuff works really well! It is oil so if you are planning to polish immediately, you will have to wash thoroughly. However, I don&#x27;t feel like my nails or skin are being stripped of moisture or being poisoned chemicals.</li>
    <li> Worked great and smells much better than regular nail polish.  It removed my polish pretty quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it works but it does......</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t remove all the polish.  I will continue to search for a non-toxic product that does.  Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Works great and has no obnoxious odor. Actually smells nice!</li>
    <li> Great scent, not harsh on skin or nails. It takes a little more elbow grease to take off thick or glittery polish, but it makes the overall polish-removal process so much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I change my polish at least once a week if not more, and even after switching to the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; nail polish brands, was still getting a lot of peeling and breakage. I switched to Karma Organics nail polish remover a couple years ago and my nails have improved drastically! It does take a little more rubbing than pure acetone, but is definitely worth it. I am able to do all 10 nails with one cotton round folded in half! It seems the dirtier the cotton round gets the better it is at removing the polish. And the smell is fantastic, it only smells like lavender! I am slowly switching my family, friends, and coworkers one-by-one to this nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one bottle lasts me a FULL YEAR even though I change my polish at least once a week, this is my 3rd bottle, well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is it isn&#x27;t sold in stores, but I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s now offered as part of Prime with free fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell and my nails felt wonderful after first use.</li>
    <li> Overall, it works well and I feel good about using it because it&#x27;s non-toxic and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails and skin. But it takes a lot longer than acetone and doesn&#x27;t do the best job of removing my base coat.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, non toxic.  Works well removing old nail polish.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but it goes a long way. You only need to soak 1 pad to remove the nail polish off your both hands. The oil nourishes my nails and they feel healthier.</li>
    <li> The product does remove nail polish -it does require a bit more than your regular nail polish remover though.  It smells good but I was disappointed that the bottle does not come filled to the top as illustrated in the picture which is false advertisement.  The bottle is only filled up to the purple line and being that it&#x27;s a bit pricy it was very disappointing and so because of the false advertisement and price I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again or recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well, but does require a little elbow grease. Well worth the trade off to avoid those harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Works well if held onto the polish for a few seconds before wiping, smells lovely, nice to find a non-toxic product.</li>
    <li> Smells great but leaves your nails kind of oily, to be expected though. Takes some pretty hard running to remove polish. Will continue to use it though since I use all natural products.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my toddler wants her nails painted a few times a week and I hate using the chemicals in traditional polish removers on her tiny toes.  Smells good and most importantly (and honestly to my surprise) it removes my dark red Opi nail polish faster and easier than my regular chemical laden remover.  It also removes all the Opi hot pink glitter polishes my toddler loves,  I was shocked but it works really well!</li>
    <li> Product smells great! Not strong, just a faint and pleasant scent. There is absolutely no chemical smell and my nails did not have that uncomfortable dry feeling after I&#x27;d removed the polish. I had on one coat of base polish and two coats of Mineral Fusion color polish. This product removed all three layers of polish quickly. I am very impressed and will continue to purchase this in the future. I wish the price was more reasonable, but I will see how long this bottle lasts.</li>
    <li> I love organic products. This product works very well! The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> Great product. What an improvement over traditional nail polish. It works and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is my second and last try and using non-acetone polish remover.  As was the case in the past attempt, yes I expect I could get all the polish off -- sooner or later.  But after sweating over one toe for several minutes with little in the way of results and I was rubbbing hard, I tossed the dang bottle and went out and got myself some acetone.</li>
    <li> It works very well. It has a nice lavender scent which is definitely better than the smell of your standard nail polish remover. It does leave an oily residue which is expected for an oil based product. It does not dry out nails. The bottle is small for the price but hopefuly my nails will &#x27;appreciate&#x27; this natural product :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  It smells so much better than the harsher removers and left my nails looking nourished, not dried out!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this works, but it does. You will need to give your nails a good washing with soap before painting them to remove the oily residue, but that is a small price to pay for not soaking your hands in chemicals. :)</li>
    <li> Love this. Works wonderfully and feels good on your nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Smells great!!! A little goes a long way, and does not leave nails brittle, like traditional remover. Cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> The greatest nail polish remover ever!  This does not have the harmful smell of most nailpolish removers but it does the job just as well.  And afterwards, your nail won&#x27;t feel dry and exposed as they tend to with regular nail polish remover.  This has ingredients that act as moisturizers.  It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, about two years ago, when my car was left in an unfortunate location for a few hours and ended up with spray paint on it, this removed all of the spray paint but did not do a bit of harm to my paint job.  The police were not too happy with me because almost all the spray paint was gone by the time they showed up.  But really, am I going to risk having to repaint my car by leaving spray paint on til it sets?  Especially since the chances of anyone actually getting caught are slim to none?  Nope.  Anyway this left my car clean and clear.  You couldn&#x27;t even tell there was any spray paint if not for the pictures I took of the before.  I would post them but they contain profanity.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I have always thought nail polish remover was a toxic commodity &amp; bought Cutex or the private label drug store brands. Then I tried acetone which worked like magic but dried my nails out. I read about Karma on a blog somewhere &amp; found it at a local health foods store. I now own three bottles--and have gifted it...this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really odd to use an oil based remover, but like oil based skin cleaners, it works! I&#x27;ve found it is most effective if you place the cotton ball on the top of the jar, flip it over for a full second--not too long--and then gently rub the remover over each of your nails. Wait about 30 seconds for the remover to soften your polish, then rub with the remover cotton to remove the polish. For bright colors, I might need to add more remover to another section of cotton or a new cotton ball, but this works beautifully for me in removing all standard polishes (I wear base coat, 2 coats of polish--Essie, Opi, L&#x27;oreal, Sally Hansen--and top coat). I just wore my first glitter polish for the holidays and braced myself that I might need to get the acetone out. It took a few minutes of letting the Karma polish remover sit on the glitter polish &amp; a small bit of scrubbing, but the glitter polish was gone. Voila! I love that my nail are shiny after use--not dry. I do have to wash my hands before polishing, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this polish remover--super effective &amp; not so damaging to my body. Yay!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got more of an &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; feel to it rather than paint thinner like the typical nail polish remover. It works well and I love that my nails feel stronger and healthier after using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing! I was skeptical but bought it in my quest to be completely chemical free. It works just as well as acetone. No unpleasant odor, no weird residue. Will recommend and use from now on</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! Works BETTER than regular acetone. Smells great! Glass bottle...oh well, better for the environment tho.</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly well and smells great.  This is also a random side note, but I got nail glue on my fingers once and I dabbed a Qtip into the bottle and gently swabbed it back and forth and it came right off.</li>
    <li> It works better than regular nail polish remover and it&#x27;s better for you!</li>
    <li> Works really well and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> The only reason it gets two stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent. But that is the only positive. Ouch!! It made my cuticles hurt and turn bright red! It takes forever to remove dark or especially glitter nail polishes. I will be throwing this away.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past month or so and I will never buy acetone again. Is this expensive? Yes, but the payoff is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Highly effective even on textured or glitter polish&lt;br /&gt;- Lavender scent smells very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;- You can use less product&lt;br /&gt;- VERY gentle on nails, no stripping or brittleness over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- More expensive than acetone&lt;br /&gt;- Depending on how many layers of nailpolish you have applied, you will want to let the product soak into the surface for 4-5 seconds before rubbing off</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a non-toxic nail polish remover to take off my Scotch nail polish. I decided to give this one a try based on the reviews I saw about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;s non-toxic and has no terrible odors.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It takes about 3x as long to remove nail polish. Maybe, this is because it&#x27;s a different type of nail polish from the standard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish up this bottle, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something different moving forward.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best ever nail polish remover for all types of nail polish including the stubborn glittery and stony and grainy ones.</li>
    <li> I like to use all natural products whenever I can. So I was excited to find an all natural polish remover. However this stuff didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. I scrubbed and scrubbed and it made no difference whatsoever. Also it was pretty oily. I would pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works fantastic. Only fault is the price.</li>
    <li> I recently removed my acrylic nails and was searching for non-Acetone-based nail removers. I got this oil-based nail polish remover and really like it!! Unlike traditional Acetone-based removers that tend to dry out your nails, this one does not! You can even use it to massage your nails and cuticles (though it does not function as cuticle oil). The lavender smell is also very nice too! Though it might be a little bit pricey, I realized that each time I did not have to use a lot in order to remove all nail polish on my nail. It is an oil-based remover, so using two drops each time on a cotton ball is enough.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but when I do, they&#x27;re either amazing or horrendous. In this case, it&#x27;s the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all you can hope for in a nail polish remover -- organic, minimal scent, removes quick and easy with just a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the bottle is small and there&#x27;s not that much liquid contained within, but it barely takes any for all ten of my fingers. It&#x27;s also kind of oily, but it leaves my nails and cuticles feel moisturized. I have been using this on OPI polish, it works amazing on four or even five layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that the metal cap is kind of hard to remove, but it&#x27;s easy once you flip it upside down and knock it on the floor a few times.</li>
    <li> This is an edited review:  This product evaporates just sitting in the bottle.  The brown bottle and metal lid are good looking but the lid is totally not functional and it does not seal well enough to keep product from disappearing!  I didn&#x27;t use this many times (maybe 8) and it&#x27;s just about all gone. I cannot buy it again until the company finds a better sealing lid.</li>
</ol>
