      <li>(I had to practice on a bunch of people until I got it right!)</li>
      <li>This are ok, but they don&#x27;t stay too much, just two days.</li>
      <li>Definitely a quick and cheaper alternative to Nordstrom&#x27;s brand.</li>
      <li>With seventy tattoos there are more than enough to pick from and you&#x27;ll surely find something</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look good if you put them on an area that bends such as right on your wrist joint.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Fun item.  </li>
      <li>The girls all liked them as they are a very current</li>
      <li>These tattoos are a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>He said she (my mother, at 65+) was showing off and being coquettish, but it just gave her a laugh.  </li>
      <li>These were really fun to put on but some of them lasted longer then others.</li>
      <li>some of the tattoos do not apply right and have to be thrown away.</li>
      <li>They tend to last about 2 days but r easy to put on!</li>
      <li>Only 4stars because they come off super easy.</li>
      <li>Once while chatting with the resort manager, mom crossed her legs and it \\&quot;flashed\\&quot; him, hahaha!  </li>
      <li>fast and fun for the kids</li>
      <li>The designs were pretty basic but they were pretty easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It would certainly make someone want to get closer to see what the sparkly thing is.</li>
      <li>Seller was great but the tattoos were not good or high quality</li>
      <li>The tattoos are very easy to apply and, while they won&#x27;t look like real tattoos under close scrutiny, I did fool a few people who thought they were real.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if that was just the kind we were using.</li>
      <li>It also came with a cute little sponge for applying the tattoo.</li>
      <li>It definitely takes some practice to get it right</li>
      <li>but it was nice to have a little extra sponge just in case.</li>
      <li>As promised, I put another one of these tattoos on my mother while we were in the Caribbean celebrating the New Year 2014-2015; a gold one around her ankle.  </li>
      <li>From afar it&#x27;s pretty shimmery and definitely eye-catching.</li>
      <li>Barely went on, and when it did.</li>
      <li>It attracted so much attention, none of her friends had ever seen anything like it but a few of the young girls told us that Beyonce wears them.</li>
      <li>One friend got a rash where the tattoos were placed so I would recommend doing a small one to test it out first if you have sensitive skin.</li>

<li> How long they last depends on where you wear them</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love them. Easy to Use. Does not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There is a weird package smell but it goes away with air. My be the plastic layer over the tattoos.</li>
    <li> prefect, feels and looks great on the skin</li>
    <li> These were really fun to put on but some of them lasted longer then others. I think that depends on the placement. They don&#x27;t look good if you put them on an area that bends such as right on your wrist joint. The sunscreen we were using made them feel sticky but I&#x27;m not sure if that was just the kind we were using. One friend got a rash where the tattoos were placed so I would recommend doing a small one to test it out first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The design shown on the cover is not included.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Pleased with purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos for kids and adults. Super cute!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! I love these. They tend to last about 2 days but r easy to put on! I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> fast and fun for the kids</li>
    <li> Barely went on, and when it did. It stayed on for a few hours. I ended up throwing the other 4 sheets in the garbage</li>
    <li> Seller was great but the tattoos were not good or high quality but there were very cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Definitely a quick and cheaper alternative to Nordstrom&#x27;s brand. Loved it for Coachella!</li>
    <li> I had bought a lot of gold temporary tattoos because my youth group and I were running a booth for the carnival. I liked the packaging it was really pretty and it was great for storing the tattoos. It also came with a cute little sponge for applying the tattoo. I usually like putting them on with a wash cloth but it was nice to have a little extra sponge just in case. The designs were pretty basic but they were pretty easy to apply. It definitely takes some practice to get it right (I had to practice on a bunch of people until I got it right!) But the do look beautiful. They will stay on relatively well depending on where they&#x27;re placed. The ones I put on my fingers to look like jewelry came off really quickly (obviously because I was my hands a lot) but others like on the upper arm or wrist will stay a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s looking to try out gold tattoos for the first time because the designs are basic but beautiful and they are easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Bought these for teen age girls.  Ended up with one on my ankle as well.  Fun item.  The girls all liked them as they are a very current trend.&lt;br /&gt;Last longer on areas of your body without alot of a use.  The one on the ankle lasted longer than the one on the wrist.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Grand daughter and she loves it...so if she loves it, I love it.</li>
    <li> I gave these as a gift for a teen. She loved it.</li>
    <li> These Shimmer Metallic Jewelry Tattoos are easy to apply.  Simply pick the design you want, peel off the covering of the tattoo, place the tattoo on the spot you want to wear it, wet a sponge or paper towel and hold it on the tattoo for thirty seconds, remove the sponge or paper towel, peel off the paper from the tattoo and you have a tattoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these tattoos!  Somebody gave them to me as a bit of a joke but I (and everyone in my office) fell in love with them.  There were two sheets of silver tattoos and two sheets of gold tattoos so you have plenty to pick from.  My favorites are the ones that I can wear like bracelets.  The tattoos are very easy to apply and, while they won&#x27;t look like real tattoos under close scrutiny, I did fool a few people who thought they were real.  How long they last depends on where you wear them - I find they last at least a week before starting to fade away.  With seventy tattoos there are more than enough to pick from and you&#x27;ll surely find something you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these Shimmer Metallic Jewelry Tattoos!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love them!! I bought them because we have a mega ticket for country concerts this summer and I thought that this would be perfect for jewelry for it - and boy was it!!! The reactions we have gotten have been amazing!!! We love it!!</li>
    <li> I love these.. simple to apply and they look great on.  Only 4stars because they come off super easy.</li>
    <li> These were so much fun! I brought them on a weekend trip to the beach and to my surprise they lasted through all of the sunscreen, ocean water, and showers. The selection is really good too.</li>
    <li> some of the tattoos do not apply right and have to be thrown away. the bigger tattoos go on and stay on for several days</li>
    <li> Very pretty ,easy to apply ,stayed on for days😊</li>
    <li> Looks great the 1st day but starts to wear off by day 2</li>
    <li> These are great. I wore them for the concert and they didn&#x27;t come off for days after..easy to put on and not that expensive .</li>
    <li> This are ok, but they don&#x27;t stay too much, just two days.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as advertised. Look great though!</li>
    <li> Cute. Doesn&#x27;t last long. About 2 days.</li>
    <li> Came in super quick, really great tattoo choices</li>
    <li> These tattoos are a lot of fun. My mom fell asleep on the couch and I managed to put one of the gold tattoos on the back of her neck before her Christmas party. She took a shower before the party and I thought it might come off but it didn&#x27;t. I knew the jig was up when guests were coming in and I heard her say WHAT TATTOO?? But everyone complimented her and asked me where I got it from! My mom and her friends are the 65+ set, but it really looked good. From afar it&#x27;s pretty shimmery and definitely eye-catching. It would certainly make someone want to get closer to see what the sparkly thing is. We&#x27;re going to the beach in a couple days so I&#x27;ll update and review if it stayed on through swimming, sweat and sand.    UPDATE:  As promised, I put another one of these tattoos on my mother while we were in the Caribbean celebrating the New Year 2014-2015; a gold one around her ankle.  I put it on her on December 31 in the afternoon and when I last saw her on January 6, she was still wearing it!  It attracted so much attention, none of her friends had ever seen anything like it but a few of the young girls told us that Beyonce wears them. I seem to remember that six sheets come in the box, 3 silver and 3 gold, and on each sheet there are about 10 tattoos on each. I only kept one gold one for myself and gave away the other sheets to the girls and they were over the moon.  Once while chatting with the resort manager, mom crossed her legs and it \\&quot;flashed\\&quot; him, hahaha!  He said she (my mother, at 65+) was showing off and being coquettish, but it just gave her a laugh.  It lasted beautifully but she did not go in the water (neither the sea nor the pool).  It lasted through bathing, but she was careful not to scrub it while showering.  It lasted wonderfully in the hot, Caribbean sun for a week!      Oh -- they are applied to the skin very quickly and they still stayed on.  It says to press hard and then use the enclosed sponge to wet it down and then you&#x27;re supposed to press for 30 seconds, but as soon as it got wet the paper slipped away from the skin and the tattoo was left.  I thought the tattoo would slip off too but it did not.</li>
