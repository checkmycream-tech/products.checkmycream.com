### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
      <li>Quality - value wise is great!</li>
      <li>Used it once, great product.</li>
      <li>it would work great for blondes.</li>
      <li>over powering chemical smell kind of lingers in your hair!</li>
      <li>It smells good though.</li>
      <li>I found this product not to be that good.</li>
      <li>This spray does a good job.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>It smells great and is so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It adds great volume at the roots, better than most volumizing products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I like that this shampoo takes away the Day 2 musty smell and that it eliminates most of my oil ... almost as good as Day 1.</li>
      <li>Tried it one more time and the spray wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Worked OK.  </li>
      <li>I made sure to rinse the nozzle off with water after using it.</li>
      <li>The smell and results are better than Suave (don&#x27;t like the smell or the way my hair felt) and better than Tressemme which is better than Suave in smell and feel but can&#x27;t compare to this Pantene.</li>
      <li>Then I make sure that the nozzle still has drops of water on it</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 bottles of this dry shampoo during a really good sale and was very pleased with it...</li>
      <li>Two days ago, it sprayed absolutely fine.  </li>
      <li>The next can worked great - for 3 uses.  </li>
      <li>A FULL bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a handful of dry shampoos and this is by far the best!  </li>
      <li>This the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tested so far.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was clearly an issue with the nozzle getting clogged, when I started using the second bottle (which sprayed perfectly the first use)</li>
      <li>The smell was pretty strong but the product worked great at drying up my roots and didn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue or gray/white film as others have mentioned (I have dark brown hair).</li>
      <li>This is a real bummer because this product works great and smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s no good if I can only use it 3 or 4 times per can!    </li>
      <li>After reading all the others, I can&#x27;t believe Pantene still sells a product like this without fixing the nozzle issue first!</li>
      <li>I have fine and very greasy hair, before this one I washed my hair every day,</li>
      <li>The only thing is that at the end the spray was kind of liquid</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos over the year and this is (by far) my favorite.</li>
      <li>-- The first time I used this I just kept spraying and spraying until I almost passed out from the fumes.</li>
      <li>I replaced the cap after the first use and shook it vigorously but never got it to work again.</li>
      <li>the FIRST time I used it.</li>
      <li>Smells better and gives the same results.</li>
      <li>now amazingly I wash every other day!</li>
      <li>The smell is plesant in very small doeses but as youre spraying more and more into your hair you get a very chemical/strong hairspray</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo option I have found.</li>
      <li>I love this dry spray.</li>
      <li>I like this better than Batiste Dry Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I tried to use it a second time and instead of spraying a fine mist it just sputtered liquid.</li>
      <li>The SECOND time I tried to use it, instead of spraying a fine mist, the nozzle *sputtered* and dripped some liquid.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference when I used it.</li>
      <li>It works for me because my hair gets really oily.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit much for a confined area, but the product works well.</li>
      <li>but I have fine hair that tends to get really flat</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and loved how it allowed me to sneak an extra day between washes.</li>
      <li>The nozzle is easily clogged and even trying soaking it in hot water, soaking in rubbing alcohol, running hot water through it, using a pin to push through the hole, shaking the can vigorously, and I still get nothing but frustration and maybe a few drops of dry shampoo (if I&#x27;m lucky) out of this product every time I try to use it.</li>
      <li>sometime I&#x27;ll go 3 days) and by day 2, it looks a little greasy on top.</li>
      <li>Love this product but the spray won&#x27;t work after a few times....</li>
      <li>have long, fine hair that usually requires a good washing about every other day.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll just buy a new bottle!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>My new go-to</li>
      <li>second time this has happened, first time I thought it was a faulty spray</li>
      <li>After just a few uses, my first can quit spraying a fine mist and only sputters out droplets.  </li>
      <li>It works and smells better than some of the other dry shampoos out there.</li>
      <li>So you dont really need to spend extra time brushing through to even the color of your hair out again..</li>
      <li>My blowout/beach waves are still moving naturally and they feel soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTE FAV, NO WHITE RESIDUE!</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo itself, but the container is defective after only a few uses*.  </li>
      <li>Half the bottle is still full but spray will not work...</li>
      <li>Hair feels clean but still looks a little oily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos and this actually the only one that actually works AND doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I dumped ashes on my head.</li>
      <li>IDK HOW THEY DO IT, but it works better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used without all the white stuff!</li>
      <li>When I take the cap off to use it the next time, there is still several large drops of water on the nozzle.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not extreme..</li>
      <li>If someone reviewed this as positive they&#x27;ve never used any other quality brand.</li>
      <li>and this gives it a nice boost without stickiness or weird texture.  </li>
      <li>This is literally THE MOST FRUSTRATING beauty product I have ever used--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things.</li>
      <li>This can was at least 3/4 full and I couldn&#x27;t use</li>
      <li>A few days later when I used the bottle again, it sprayed pretty well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this dry spray. It works for me because my hair gets really oily. This spray does a good job.</li>
    <li> This the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tested so far. Quality - value wise is great! The smell and results are better than Suave (don&#x27;t like the smell or the way my hair felt) and better than Tressemme which is better than Suave in smell and feel but can&#x27;t compare to this Pantene. The only thing is that at the end the spray was kind of liquid but I&#x27;ll just buy a new bottle!&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for dry shampoo definitely try this one! I have fine and very greasy hair, before this one I washed my hair every day, now amazingly I wash every other day!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this dry shampoo during a really good sale and was very pleased with it... the FIRST time I used it. The smell was pretty strong but the product worked great at drying up my roots and didn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue or gray/white film as others have mentioned (I have dark brown hair). The SECOND time I tried to use it, instead of spraying a fine mist, the nozzle *sputtered* and dripped some liquid. The THIRD time, it wouldn&#x27;t spray at all. This can was at least 3/4 full and I couldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was clearly an issue with the nozzle getting clogged, when I started using the second bottle (which sprayed perfectly the first use) I made sure to rinse the nozzle off with water after using it. A few days later when I used the bottle again, it sprayed pretty well but I could tell it was slightly plugged. I rinsed it carefully after use again, and about a week later when I went to use this second bottle for only the second time, it barely sputtered and then stopped working altogether. A FULL bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I almost wrote a review then, but it wasn&#x27;t until a small travel-size bottle came along with a new bottle of shampoo and the same thing happened within three uses of THAT bottle that I was finally annoyed enough to write a review. After reading all the others, I can&#x27;t believe Pantene still sells a product like this without fixing the nozzle issue first! Would NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE FAV, NO WHITE RESIDUE! I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos and this actually the only one that actually works AND doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I dumped ashes on my head.</li>
    <li> This is literally THE MOST FRUSTRATING beauty product I have ever used--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things. I think the product is great...when it comes out. The nozzle is easily clogged and even trying soaking it in hot water, soaking in rubbing alcohol, running hot water through it, using a pin to push through the hole, shaking the can vigorously, and I still get nothing but frustration and maybe a few drops of dry shampoo (if I&#x27;m lucky) out of this product every time I try to use it. It is impossible to use. I will not buy this again until Pantene changes the dispersion method!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos over the year and this is (by far) my favorite. I follow a tip from a friend who said to spray this on your roots, rub it in and then leave it alone for 15-20 minutes. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with the nozzle clogging, but here again I used a tip from another reviewer and rinse the nozzle and replace the cap while the nozzle is still wet.  I like that this shampoo takes away the Day 2 musty smell and that it eliminates most of my oil ... almost as good as Day 1.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying use this in a WELL VENTILATED area!!!! The smell is plesant in very small doeses but as youre spraying more and more into your hair you get a very chemical/strong hairspray smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine hair that usually requires a good washing about every other day. Sometimes I will style it and it feels like it needs to be washed that same day .. So dry shampoo is basically my BFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-NO WHITE STUFF!! -- The first time I used this I just kept spraying and spraying until I almost passed out from the fumes. ( I have very dark brown hair) I thought it wasnt working because I didnt see all the white powder that I have come to expect from dry shampoos. IDK HOW THEY DO IT, but it works better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used without all the white stuff! So you dont really need to spend extra time brushing through to even the color of your hair out again..&lt;br /&gt;-Product works well. Adds volume and removes oil.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff-- My blowout/beach waves are still moving naturally and they feel soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-It does leave a LITTLE bit of a residue - You can tell that there is some product in your hair but it&#x27;s not extreme.. It actually makes my hair easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;-That over powering chemical smell kind of lingers in your hair! I&#x27;m still smelling it. Woof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d definitely buy again! My new go-to</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit much for a confined area, but the product works well. It definitely requires a thorough scalp massage after spraying it in to get rid of the gray film. Others have mentioned that it leaves a film, but because I have very slick, shiny hair I really like the texture it leaves behind. The biggest problem is that the spray nozzle clogs or breaks after 5 or so uses and begins coming out in thick, concentrated droplets that spray everywhere. This is my 3rd bottle and the same thing happens every time. After the current bottle failed me this morning I planned to switch to another brand, this one has proved to be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff just does NOTHING! I&#x27;ve used other brands and loved how it allowed me to sneak an extra day between washes. This stuff is terrible, waste of money. If someone reviewed this as positive they&#x27;ve never used any other quality brand.</li>
    <li> Used it once, great product. Tried to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t even spray. Took off the cap and cleaned it up, still no luck.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. It smells great and is so easy to apply. And it hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged up yet. That has happened a lot for me with spray dry shampoo. Not this one though. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of dry shampoos and this is by far the best!  It adds great volume at the roots, better than most volumizing products I&#x27;ve tried.  I don&#x27;t use it to skip shampoos but I have fine hair that tends to get really flat and this gives it a nice boost without stickiness or weird texture.  I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because I really does work, but it&#x27;s not great for brunetts. I wash my hair every other day, (sometime I&#x27;ll go 3 days) and by day 2, it looks a little greasy on top. after spraying the product on, I rub it into my hair with my finger tips. then I brush my hair and use a blow dryer to get off some of the excess powder while rubbing my hair again with my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have dark brown hair, the spray does dull my color and give it a slightly chalky look. It does add volume though and it refreshes my hair. it would work great for blondes.</li>
    <li> Used it once and I was pleasantly surprised.  It works and smells better than some of the other dry shampoos out there. I tried to use it a second time and instead of spraying a fine mist it just sputtered liquid. I may have left the cap off but still, it&#x27;s useless now.</li>
    <li> Hair feels clean but still looks a little oily.  This is my favorite dry shampoo option I have found.</li>
    <li> I used it once and the second time I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t work. I replaced the cap after the first use and shook it vigorously but never got it to work again. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo itself, but the container is defective after only a few uses*.  After just a few uses, my first can quit spraying a fine mist and only sputters out droplets.  I tried spraying it upside down and washing off the nozzle - nothing worked.  It seemed like there was about half of a can left, but I thought maybe I misunderstood and it was actually empty.  The next can worked great - for 3 uses.  Two days ago, it sprayed absolutely fine.  Today, just little spurts.  I looked on the Pantene site to find a cure for this problem and there is review after review of this same thing happening repeatedly to other people.  This is a real bummer because this product works great and smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s no good if I can only use it 3 or 4 times per can!    *UPDATE:  Since posting this review, I found a way to keep the product working.  EACH TIME I&#x27;m done using it, I rinse off the nozzle for about 4-5 seconds.  Then I make sure that the nozzle still has drops of water on it and I put the cap firmly back on.  When I take the cap off to use it the next time, there is still several large drops of water on the nozzle.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3-4 months with my third can, and it has worked every time (knock on wood).  I only had a slight issue once, so I rinsed it off and it started working again.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. Everytime i used it, what comes out is not a mist or bubbles. It spritz liquid. After using once or two times, nothing was coming out at all. The nozzle was clogged. ... I wonder if i can return this product. I don&#x27;t need a refund but a replacement.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves white film in your hair.  You definitely need to brush throughly after using- which releases scalp oils, which is what you&#x27;re trying to soak up with a dry shampoo so…. I do&#x27;nt see the point in this product.  I&#x27;d recommend using Psssst or another dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look gray/white.</li>
    <li> I found this product not to be that good. It didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference when I used it. It smells good though. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> I like this better than Batiste Dry Shampoo. Smells better and gives the same results.</li>
    <li> Used it once.  Worked OK.  Tried it one more time and the spray wouldn&#x27;t work.  As a result, will refrain from ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this product but the spray won&#x27;t work after a few times....any suggestions??? Half the bottle is still full but spray will not work...second time this has happened, first time I thought it was a faulty spray but it seems to be a poor design.</li>
