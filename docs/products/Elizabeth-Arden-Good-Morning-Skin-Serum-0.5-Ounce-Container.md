      <li>Price was excellent and shipped in half the advertised time.  </li>

      <li>I am 64 years old and have been using Elizabeth Arden Good Morning Serum for 10 years.  </li>
      <li>I have been using E. Arden products for a while, and love them, but just tried this, and it has pushed my skin up a whole nother notch!  </li>
      <li>Love this product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of wasting money or using something that costs a significant amount when I can find something else that is cheaper to do what this claims to do.  </li>
      <li>so be quick with the application of your base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wrinkles less noticeable, sun spots totally fading, just beautiful, healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years, and I like the smooth finish and softness it gives my skin,which is quite dry.</li>
      <li>Starting using several months ago and have seen great results.  </li>
      <li>but I dont think it does anything more than a standard silicon primer does.</li>
      <li>But I found that this doesn&#x27;t spread well on my face unless I&#x27;ve moisturized first.  </li>
      <li>Love it and would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>If you have ever used a primer before putting on makeup, that is exactly what this is.</li>
      <li>and I was worried when I first put this product on my face, because it seemed greasy at first touch.</li>
      <li>I was worried that it might not be the real thing</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t like to use too much moisture.</li>
      <li>However, it clogs my pores and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much else.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like this to put on before my foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it is great to use as a base before you put your make-up on.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend  this product  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>and they normally show through her make up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is, just the tester packaging, not the normal retail packaging.</li>
      <li>although I use it as such, it doesn&#x27;t act as good as a primer should act and on the other hand I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s a treatment because it hasn&#x27;t done anything to my skin that I can personally  notice.  </li>
      <li>I live in a town that is 60 miles from anywhere like a mall.  </li>
      <li>Box]]This product as in a sealed box NEW.</li>
      <li>My new \\&quot;must not be without\\&quot; product.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>I am a 56 yr old grandmother, but my skin is backing up in years with this serum!  </li>
      <li>What this product claims to do is help you use less of your face makeup and smooth it on easier.  </li>
      <li>It makes it so soft &amp; my makeup looks smoother &amp; lasts longer throughout the day</li>
      <li>When all is dried I smooth just a minute drop on my face.  </li>
      <li>I thought, as a serum, it would help keep my face hydrated during the day, and keep my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>However, it dries silky and light and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy or greasy feeling at all.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this gives me no problems.</li>
      <li>Especially for older women</li>
      <li>No other product performs as well.</li>
      <li>EA products are a little pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted about a year or maybe a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand what this product does because it&#x27;s not a full on primer</li>
      <li>I like this product but was a little dissappointed as it doesn&#x27;t really serve the purpose I bought it for.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this everyday mixing it with the Smashbox Blemish control makeup primer.  1/2 pump of this and a small dot of the smashbox.  Works great - no breakouts and I think I even see some lightening of some past acne scarring.  I hope this is not discontinued!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great but I dont think it does anything more than a standard silicon primer does. It does not last long either and is pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I&#x27;ve been using it for some time already</li>
    <li> I was worried that it might not be the real thing but it turn out it is, just the tester packaging, not the normal retail packaging.</li>
    <li> I  have used Elizabeth Arden for years and always received compliments on my makeup</li>
    <li> This stuff is freaking amazing!  I have been using E. Arden products for a while, and love them, but just tried this, and it has pushed my skin up a whole nother notch!  I am a 56 yr old grandmother, but my skin is backing up in years with this serum!  Wrinkles less noticeable, sun spots totally fading, just beautiful, healthy skin.  My new \\&quot;must not be without\\&quot; product.  I LOVE!</li>
    <li> the product was excellent for me and i think that it will be for everyone.the product  did everything that was refered as information.</li>
    <li> I love how beautiful my skin stays ALL day long. I feel as though I have much younger looking skin and it gives a dewy appearance and feel</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this gives me no problems. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, and I like the smooth finish and softness it gives my skin,which is quite dry. I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A favorite of my mother-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen to fulfill required number of words.</li>
    <li> a gift for my mom I love him</li>
    <li> I have use L&#x27;Oreal serum in the past but since all my other beauty products are EA, why not give it a try. I agree with all the other reviews however I found that it has a musty smell. Not pleasant. I still rate the product with 4 stars but would have given it 5 if it had a more pleasant smell. Maybe EA could work on this for their customers.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat oily skin and I was worried when I first put this product on my face, because it seemed greasy at first touch. However, it dries silky and light and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy or greasy feeling at all. I really like it. I am 29 and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I am using this as a preventative in the mornings before I put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> Starting using several months ago and have seen great results.  Skin feels smoother and looks it.  Good luck using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum, use it every day. EA products are a little pricey, but well worth the money. Your skin deserves the best, and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is great to use as a base before you put your make-up on. Whether you use mineral powder or liquid foundation makes your skin feel lovely and smooth. If using it with a mineral powder or any face powder let you skin have a few minutes to let it absorb just a bit then apply powder. If using under liquid foundation then put it straight on and you will find that you don&#x27;t need as much foundation and your skin looks great.I have tried other products but always come back to this one. I hope E.Arden doesn&#x27;t discontinue this one like they did with bye lines.</li>
    <li> I like this product but was a little dissappointed as it doesn&#x27;t really serve the purpose I bought it for.  What I wanted was a product that I could put on my face in the AM without having to use a heavy moisturizer.  My skin is very sensitive so I don&#x27;t like to use too much moisture. But I found that this doesn&#x27;t spread well on my face unless I&#x27;ve moisturized first.  But it does work as a great primer, however, it&#x27;s a little overpriced for just a primer.</li>
    <li> Like it!  Sorry they discontinued the product but at least for now the product is very cost effective.  Recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this to put on before my foundation.  I&#x27;m glad I can still get it on the internet.</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old and have been using Elizabeth Arden Good Morning Serum for 10 years.  I have no cross feet or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my new best friend!! I love the feel of this product on my skin. It makes it so soft &amp; my makeup looks smoother &amp; lasts longer throughout the day</li>
    <li> Price was excellent and shipped in half the advertised time.  Very happy with the service and the product as (my wife) has used it for years.</li>
    <li> Great morning creme for the eyes.</li>
    <li> This product extends the life of your makeup by giving a base for it to glide on so you use the least foundation necessary to achieve even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00375L8QK Elizabeth Arden Good Morning Skin Serum, 0.5-Ounce Box]]This product as in a sealed box NEW.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of wasting money or using something that costs a significant amount when I can find something else that is cheaper to do what this claims to do.  But....I love this product.  I am a fan of Elizabeth Arden and when my daughter gave me my first one of these I was thrilled.  What this product claims to do is help you use less of your face makeup and smooth it on easier.  It works..wonderfully.  This is a serum and it goes in almost immediately so be quick with the application of your base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wash my face as normal on any given day and put some meds on like usual.  When all is dried I smooth just a minute drop on my face.  All over my face..eyelids, eyebrows, forehead underneath my bangs, cheeks, nose, lip area and even if a have a little left on my neck.  Then I put on my base.  Although I have one of those bases that says it goes on easily, I never found that to be the case until I used this Elizabeth Arden product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my previous container I had my husband twist off the squirt lid with pliers so that I could use the last little bit.  I priced this product at my Bealls department store where I found they sell EA products but it was 34.oo. I just happen to think about Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of it before as they have everything else I can&#x27;t find.  I live in a town that is 60 miles from anywhere like a mall.  This price is half price at 17.00 and I bought two.  The first one lasted about a year or maybe a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product.  Try other EA items too.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I got it for myself at the beginning, and then my mom uses it, now even my husband start using it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
    <li> I love how easily my makeup blends and lasts when I use this skin serum under it.  I have never found it&#x27;s equal anywhere.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what this product does because it&#x27;s not a full on primer although I use it as such, it doesn&#x27;t act as good as a primer should act and on the other hand I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s a treatment because it hasn&#x27;t done anything to my skin that I can personally  notice.  I think it&#x27;s a weird in between product.  I still like how it feels on my skin, but it&#x27;s a momentary thing, nothing for the long run I think.</li>
    <li> I use Elizabeth Arden &amp;#34;Overnight success&amp;#34; serum, which I love, so I decided to try this. If you have ever used a primer before putting on makeup, that is exactly what this is. I thought, as a serum, it would help keep my face hydrated during the day, and keep my skin feeling soft. However, it clogs my pores and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much else. Not a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff !  Been using this product for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt; I would highly recommend  this product  Especially for older women</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for years and then it was discontinued.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find and I was elated to find it at your site.  Usually this small 0.5oz container lasts me a year.  I ordered it a little over a month ago and it&#x27;s almost down to half a bottle.  It only takes a mere drop but the serum is extremely thick.  So I love the product but hate that I have to start looking for another supplier.</li>
    <li> Nice package. Product was not up to standard I&#x27;m afraid. Felt gluey on my skin. Disappointed as I like EA. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I HAVE been searching for quite awhile to get product and I&#x27;m delighted with it</li>
    <li> The good morning skin serum is a great addition....to the face!  Make up goes on smoothly.  Without make-up, your face looks refreshed.</li>
    <li> She has almost what is dark birthmarks on her face and they normally show through her make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She applies this and it creates a coat, slightly covering it and allowing her to put on makeup as&lt;br /&gt;so to cover up the darker areas on her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it it and has been using it for years!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product daily and loves it. No other product performs as well. Makes applying makeup so easy and smooth.</li>
    <li> This bottle lasted me merely a month. Quite silky as a primer, felt good on skin, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling smooth and not oily.</li>
    <li> Love this product.It worked as it&#x27;s promised:)  I bought 5 of it at once,because in stores it&#x27;s hard too find.this is discontinued product.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!  This serum is the greatest thing you will ever put on your face.  It makes your face feel absolutely wonderful and silky and you will find that you don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer when you use it.  Love it and would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product and glad to find some &amp;#34;leftover.&amp;#34;</li>
