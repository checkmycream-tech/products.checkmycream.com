      <li>you can see the application better and you won&#x27;t cause your mascara to clump.).</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products, but this one just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>So glad that Amazon had them.</li>
      <li>I keep them on hand always as I never want to run out or go without these - that is how important these are to me!</li>
      <li>I love the case for this eye make-up remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon and love the right to my house delivery!</li>
      <li>Unlike similar products it&#x27;s not greasy and it works incredibly well.</li>
      <li>It is great for sensitive eyes and takes ALL your eye make off.</li>
      <li>The makeup comes off so easily too.</li>
      <li>So gentle, yet effective.</li>
      <li>Gentle and effective.  </li>
      <li>And since these aren&#x27;t oily, you don&#x27;t have to rinse the area off or clean it before you put foundation right on top of whatever you&#x27;ve cleaned</li>
      <li>Not only is this the best product I have found for removing my eye makeup quickly and easily - it is gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>These work great , not really for waterproof mascara</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>The pads are oh so soft, and effective in cleaning eye makeup off.</li>
      <li>only compliment is: it was a good idea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no oily residue either, and it has a light, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I wear waterproof makeup and these do not bother my eyes and have no bad smell.</li>
      <li>Good concept and pads are large and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, these pads are very gentle on the eyes, but they do work!</li>
      <li>First remover I&#x27;ve ever used that irritate my eyes!</li>
      <li>the price is better than at the store and super convenient to have them sent directly home.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re nice and big</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t moist enough to remove mascara very easily.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most gentle one that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The pads are very soft and do not dry out in the nice containor.</li>
      <li>I have used these for several years and love how they take off all the eye makeup, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner, without stinging my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty runny, it&#x27;s not moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It gets all the mascara off, and is so gentle on your eyes!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft and smooth and take my eye make up off with ease.</li>
      <li>The reason I don&#x27;t give a 5-star rating is I want the pads just a TINY bit more moist(saturated).</li>
      <li>The best part is, the pads don&#x27;t dry out when I put the same ones back in because the case fully preserves the moisture of the pads!</li>
      <li>No oily residue and my eyes feel better at the end of a long day when using these.  </li>
      <li>so you can really get a lot of makeup off of one eye with one side, then flip it over and have that nice big surface to clean the makeup off of the other eye.</li>
      <li>haha.  </li>
      <li>(Even bleach didn&#x27;t work, and they were looking really nasty!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These pads are so gentle that even after removing my makeup I still keep rubbing my face to get additional softness.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is because it doesn&#x27;t have as much liquid in it -</li>
      <li>I really like these remover wipes.  </li>
      <li>They feel like a light facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t require rinsing.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is much better than expected.</li>
      <li>but I really have to scrub to get my mascara and liner of using these.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Large Plush Eye Makeup Remover Pads are my absolute favorite both for removing all of my eye makeup at the end of the day (or the next morning if I was lazy) and for touching up stray mascara and liner or even shadow when applying makeup in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>always clean up my upper lid after mascara and liner application with my morning Pad</li>
      <li>I got them because I thought they&#x27;d be more gentle than using a cosmetic round with liquid eye makeup remover</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I wish they were a little more moist though.</li>
      <li>Easy to use--unlike other eye-makeup remover in liquid form,which can cause over-dose.</li>
      <li>It really works without stinging sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>only positive I can give is they are gentle and do not sting eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to have eye color fall down to your under eye area.</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time and is very gentle to skin!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>it has only 30 uits and fot each time I use two units to clear my face, I fell my skin fresh after cleaning with this makeup remover.</li>
      <li>My very young step daughters often come home looking like MiMi from Drew Carey.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes and these pad</li>
      <li>But I have VERY sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and although this says extra gentle, it made my eye area burn (not severely) and didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>(and I NEVER usually break out there).</li>
      <li>These pads are small, but I can still use them more than once.</li>
      <li>chose Neutrogena Extra Gentle because I have sensitive skin, and I was pleasantly surprised that these remover pads really work and don&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
      <li>pads are very big, I cut mine in half and fourths and get 4x as many out of a package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes and always used Visine wipes which were discontinued by the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Maybe because this is the extra gentle style...</li>
      <li>These are definitely extra gentle like they claim.</li>
      <li>Since I put very little make-up on, I like to use the same pad more than once.</li>
      <li>Also, the provider sent it to me before I expected to receive it - what a treat!  ;- )</li>
      <li>only warning is that they can dry out so don&#x27;t open the seal on the product until you&#x27;re ready to use it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping these would be great, but I was really disappointed.</li>

<li> They&#x27;re not more gentle, they do a terrible job of removing eye makeup, and the ones on the top and bottom dry out very quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used these for several years and love how they take off all the eye makeup, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner, without stinging my eyes.  One side of the pad is rougher than the other and I use that side initially to get the majority of the makeup off and then the other side to wipe off the rest.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and although this says extra gentle, it made my eye area burn (not severely) and didn&#x27;t work very well. I had to keep wiping and wiping and it still didn&#x27;t seem to want to get everything off.</li>
    <li> I wear regular non-water proof mascara (ie. Lancolm Definicil, Bobby Brown, sometimes Great Lash) so there is no reason why I should have had a problem with removal of my mascara! However, there is NOT enough moisture on these pads to remove mascara.  Additionally, the pads end up hurting and stinging my eye lids and skin under my eyes! I am not sure if it is because the fragrance synthetic fibers that seem to be in the not-so-soft or \\&quot;plush\\&quot; pads, or the combination the two undesirable elements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very disappointing on all levels:&lt;br /&gt;(1) not enough moisture&lt;br /&gt;(2) pads are not soft&lt;br /&gt;(3) fragrance/ingredient is irritating (why is there fragrance in something labeled \\&quot;Extra Gentle\\&quot;!?)&lt;br /&gt;(4) does not remove mascara/ only smears it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only compliment is: it was a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to 100% cotton balls and the regular bottle of eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> I should have returned these. They were all dried and I add Maybeline eye makeup remover to them. what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are great and convenient and remove waterproof makeup well.  I wish they were a little more moist though.</li>
    <li> These work great, even on my waterproof mascara.  No issues with making my eyes burn, either.  I will purchase these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of eye make up, so sometimes I have to use two pads....but they work well.  They don&#x27;t make my eyes sting, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that if it doesn&#x27;t get ALL the eye make up off initially, when I wash the rest of my make up off the water removes any remainder of eye make up.</li>
    <li> These are definitely extra gentle like they claim. I use these every night to remove my eye makeup and they are amazing! Other makeup removers have aggravated or burned my eyes, but these have never! The makeup comes off so easily too. I usually use one side per eye so that&#x27;s one a day, therefore one pack can last a month! I can&#x27;t go a day without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them on Amazon with subscribe and save for an extra discount!</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would be great, but I was really disappointed. They aren&#x27;t moist enough to remove mascara very easily. I had to rub and rub, which irritated my eyes terribly, in order to remove all the mascara. The liquid Neutrogena eye makeup remover is much better, and I&#x27;ll stick with that!</li>
    <li> Easy to use--unlike other eye-makeup remover in liquid form,which can cause over-dose. This one is in pad form, non-greasy, wipes off heavy eye-makeup well. The reason I don&#x27;t give a 5-star rating is I want the pads just a TINY bit more moist(saturated). But I don&#x27;t mean that I want it drip on my face either.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because at least it does take SOME of my makeup off, but I really have to scrub at my eyes to get mascara off, leaving my eyes oily and stinging! It caused me to break out around my eyes as well, which is no fun (and I NEVER usually break out there).</li>
    <li> I really like these remover wipes.  After trying another store brand (which felt like sand paper) I was VERY happy to go back to using these.  I will never stray again.  haha.  They&#x27;re soft and smooth and take my eye make up off with ease.</li>
    <li> These work great , not really for waterproof mascara though.&lt;br /&gt;The pads are very big, I cut mine in half and fourths and get 4x as many out of a package.&lt;br /&gt;I love these!</li>
    <li> So gentle, yet effective. I couldn&#x27;t find them in my hometown anywhere. So glad that Amazon had them. They keep moist in that little jar. Those packs always are drying out.</li>
    <li> arrived on time as promised and fulfilled it&#x27;s description.</li>
    <li> These are the best, most gentle makeup pads that I have found. I wear waterproof makeup and these do not bother my eyes and have no bad smell. The pads are very soft and do not dry out in the nice containor.</li>
    <li> I decided I should try some type of eye makeup remover pads when I realized there was no way to get the mascara and eyeliner stains out of my white washcloths. (Even bleach didn&#x27;t work, and they were looking really nasty!)&lt;br /&gt;I chose Neutrogena Extra Gentle because I have sensitive skin, and I was pleasantly surprised that these remover pads really work and don&#x27;t burn my eyes. There&#x27;s no oily residue either, and it has a light, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt; It may take two pads for one eye when I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup or something waterproof, and you still need to wash your face with regular face wash after using them just to get the last bit of makeup off. But I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. Since it&#x27;s  two containers of remover pads with 30 in each, I think this will last for quite a while. Good buy for the money, and a really good product.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Lasts a long time and is very gentle to skin! I was glad to find it on Amazon and love the right to my house delivery!</li>
    <li> Good concept and pads are large and soft. However, I found that there simply was not enough eye makeup remover on the pads to remove just one layer of mascara (regular--not waterproof). I ended up adding additional eye make-up remover to make the pads moist enough to work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I didn&#x27;t love it. I thought that by purcahsing this, I could skip that extra step of applying the makeup remover on the cotton round.. It&#x27;s not that good. It&#x27;s pretty runny, it&#x27;s not moisturizing. I had to purchase makeup remover in a bottle and apply more.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, these pads are very gentle on the eyes, but they do work! My mascara is gone.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE VERY DRY, SO I ACTUALLY HAD TO ADD NEUTROGENA MAKEUP REMOVER TO THE JAR!!!  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN :(</li>
    <li> The best eye make up remover ever and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> Not only is this the best product I have found for removing my eye makeup quickly and easily - it is gentle on the skin.  Also, the provider sent it to me before I expected to receive it - what a treat!  ;- )</li>
    <li> I love the case for this eye make-up remover. Since I put very little make-up on, I like to use the same pad more than once. These pads are small, but I can still use them more than once. The best part is, the pads don&#x27;t dry out when I put the same ones back in because the case fully preserves the moisture of the pads!</li>
    <li> These are the best remover pads/remover product I have found. I hate it when my eyes are greasy and these do the trick in non-irritative manner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It gets all the mascara off, and is so gentle on your eyes!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. Unlike similar products it&#x27;s not greasy and it works incredibly well.</li>
    <li> Maybe because this is the extra gentle style... but I really have to scrub to get my mascara and liner of using these.  It makes my eyelids a bit tender due to all the rubbing.  I wonder if going with something other than &amp;#34;Gentle&amp;#34; would be less harsh due to less rubbing...  Gonna keep looking.  I love Neutrogena products, but this one just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I find the product a bit expensive,  it has only 30 uits and fot each time I use two units to clear my face, I fell my skin fresh after cleaning with this makeup remover. And  Neutrogena is a great mark , and for sure it also has something to help my skin to look great! I use also day cream and night cream, and I am very happy with the resoults.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon carries these. For some reason, I cannot find them locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Large Plush Eye Makeup Remover Pads are my absolute favorite both for removing all of my eye makeup at the end of the day (or the next morning if I was lazy) and for touching up stray mascara and liner or even shadow when applying makeup in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not oily like most eye makeup remover pads. They feel like a light facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t require rinsing. They don&#x27;t leave a residue like the oily makeup remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re nice and big so you can really get a lot of makeup off of one eye with one side, then flip it over and have that nice big surface to clean the makeup off of the other eye. Unlike the smaller pads, you only need one to get all of your eye makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for morning touch-ups, nothing could be easier. You just fold one in half, then in half again and you have a pointed corner to go at the smallest of mascara flakes or marks. Sometimes, I just wipe along my entire undereye and then put foundation on, after I&#x27;ve done my eye makeup. It&#x27;s so easy to have eye color fall down to your under eye area. And since these aren&#x27;t oily, you don&#x27;t have to rinse the area off or clean it before you put foundation right on top of whatever you&#x27;ve cleaned up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always clean up my upper lid after mascara and liner application with my morning Pad (tip: apply your liner before your mascara. you can see the application better and you won&#x27;t cause your mascara to clump.). That way, I can really get that liner on, and shape it afterwards, not worrying if I make too thick of a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning is that they can dry out so don&#x27;t open the seal on the product until you&#x27;re ready to use it. And don&#x27;t expect it to last for months and months. There are 30 pads in there and you might get two months out of them before they start to dry out. They aren&#x27;t swimming in liquid like the oily makeup remover pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you peace and happiness, whatever you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you peace and happiness, whatever you decide.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover pads I have come across. Gentle and effective.  I will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> My very young step daughters often come home looking like MiMi from Drew Carey.  This removes even the cheapest water proof makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate their toddler eyes</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and always used Visine wipes which were discontinued by the manufacturer.  I wrote to the company about my disappointment and they said to buy these instead - let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t discontinue these, as these are the only ones I can use when removing eye makeup.  No oily residue and my eyes feel better at the end of a long day when using these.  I keep them on hand always as I never want to run out or go without these - that is how important these are to me!</li>
    <li> Another really great product by Neutrogena.  The pads are oh so soft, and effective in cleaning eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> these are awful. I got them because I thought they&#x27;d be more gentle than using a cosmetic round with liquid eye makeup remover, i was wrong. They&#x27;re not more gentle, they do a terrible job of removing eye makeup, and the ones on the top and bottom dry out very quickly. Do not buy these they are a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye makeup removers over the years. This is by far the most gentle one that I have ever used. It does not irritate my delicate eyelid skin and it does not burn my eyes. It gets every drop of makeup off.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these pad removers would work, but they didn&#x27;t. It states it will take off waterproof mascara, but that is not correct, as even with regular mascara, one has to rub and rub to get it off and it is still not clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive I can give is they are gentle and do not sting eyes.</li>
    <li> Wow. This product is much better than expected. It really works without stinging sensitive eyes. One tip - turn the jar upside down to distribute the cleansing solution.</li>
    <li> First remover I&#x27;ve ever used that irritate my eyes!</li>
    <li> These pads are so gentle that even after removing my makeup I still keep rubbing my face to get additional softness. In addition to that, the makeup comes off very quickly! I plan to buy these as long as they stay on the market!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and worried about this order.  But I have VERY sensitive eyes and it is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t sting.  This one worked!!!  Maybe it is because it doesn&#x27;t have as much liquid in it - that liquid isn&#x27;t running into my eyes and stinging them.  I also thought it was plenty enough liquid to remove my makeup - I personally disagreed with the other reivews about inadequate liquid.  To put this in context though, note that I only wear eyeliner and mascara (both black in modest amounts) no eyeshadow - so maybe that makes the difference.  I also found that I can use the front side of one pad one night and the back side of the pad the next night (save a little).</li>
    <li> These are really great eye makeup remover pads.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and these pad remove my make up and it does not leave a residue.  It is great for sensitive eyes and takes ALL your eye make off.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, gentle and works great and the price is better than at the store and super convenient to have them sent directly home.</li>
