### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance too!</li>
      <li>This is THE BEST shine product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is NOT Aveda Brilliant Spray On Shine!  </li>
      <li>and it was perfect.  </li>
      <li>A really great product is &amp;#34;Crack.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Love Aveda products, but especially love Brilliant Spray On.  </li>
      <li>used this product before  and l love it!!</li>
      <li>The Brilliant Spray works well at taming some fly away hairs and it does leave a nice shine.</li>
      <li>and it looked as good as the day before.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite from Aveda!</li>
      <li>Nice and shiny too.</li>
      <li>With sprays you must watch out in applying too much product on one spot but with Aveda brilliant spray-on shine  </li>
      <li>I love this product because its light, not oily, and does not sit on top of my hair but penetrates into my hair, leaving it with a sheen and good smell.</li>
      <li>Yes, it adds shine, but more than one spritz is overkill.  </li>
      <li>I have used many leave in hair treatments as well as many oils and sprays.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the fragrance in my hair.</li>
      <li>I also highlight my hair so it does not look as healthy as I would like.  </li>
      <li>They must have switched the formula since I bought this many years ago.</li>
      <li>so I love to use it sparingly for the ends of my hair and it lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>There are better shine products out there these days.  </li>
      <li>Got2B Shine Serum is excellent and is only $5!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just me for sure.  </li>
      <li>This Aveda spray just sits on top of hair and it works</li>
      <li>It no longer has the fantastic silky feel or the nice scent.  </li>
      <li>This product works so well taming fly aways and bringing back that healthy shine.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with fine to medium hair.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the most amazing.  </li>
      <li>Also, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil is much better than this spray and is great for those who want natural oils in a shine product that really soak in.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product after my hairstylist used it to help smooth out some of my flyaways.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight</li>
      <li>Use lightly.</li>
      <li>It also has a really strong fragrance, which I happen to like, but which may be too much for more sensitive noses.  </li>
      <li>It does not leave much of a shine, and even with a light touch hair was greasy.</li>
      <li>There is a slight pleasant aroma but it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Adds great shine without weight or oiliness.wors better than other products I&#x27;ve tried on my white hair.</li>
      <li>If you need extra shine, it works great to spray directly onto your hair, but you don&#x27;t need that much to get shine.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I would recommend this product to someone who has lot&#x27;s of fly away hairs and also someone who has thick hair.</li>
      <li>Last year a friend gave me a bottle of this stuff and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this because the bottle I have had for a very long time ran out, and I really love the shine it adds.</li>
      <li>LOVE for dry hair or over washed.</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t work out for me at all.</li>
      <li>The shine is great, but it left my hair limp and almost oily.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of shine in my hair.</li>
      <li>And there really was no holding of the set.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to get greasier during the day if I use too much product</li>
      <li>I love this and it will most likely last me a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shiny, smooth and straight down to my waist...</li>
      <li>GREAT product especially for thick corse hair like mine!</li>
      <li>I use it the exact same way after blow drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is nearly 70 years old and I refuse to dye it, cut it, or go to a hair salon.  </li>
      <li>My only fear is that I will use it up too fast.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, just a few sprays and it turns dry hair into shiny managable hair!  </li>
      <li>If you use a little to much it makes your hair look oily</li>

<li> Lasts a long time</li>
<li> I have very long hair-</li>
<li> If you spray too much, you will end up with seriously oily looking tresses.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, just didn&#x27;t stand out in a crowded field and there are better ones to use...</li>
<li> It was a total waste of cash.  </li>
<li> Be careful when using this spray.  </li>
<li> so you have to be careful.</li>
<li> I have tried maybe five other brands/products?  </li>
<li> It may work well for those with coarse, thick hair or for those with curly hair though.  </li>
<li> It also weighs my hair down.  </li>
<li> All the other products made my hair droop, sag, look filthy dirty, whereas I sprayed on Brilliant one day, slept on my hair, woke up</li>
<li> that cost less.  </li>
<li> I usually like to use Moroccan oil in my hair to help mend some of my split ends</li>
<li> but I have to say I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> It is a horrible, sticky product in a bottle.  </li>

    <li> Adds great shine without weight or oiliness.wors better than other products I&#x27;ve tried on my white hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair- And a lot of it!! I also highlight my hair so it does not look as healthy as I would like.  I have used many leave in hair treatments as well as many oils and sprays.  With sprays you must watch out in applying too much product on one spot but with Aveda brilliant spray-on shine  I did not have greasy hair. This product works so well taming fly aways and bringing back that healthy shine.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is NOT Aveda Brilliant Spray On Shine!  It is a horrible, sticky product in a bottle.  It will cause knots in your hair.  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR!</li>
    <li> I love this product because its light, not oily, and does not sit on top of my hair but penetrates into my hair, leaving it with a sheen and good smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Wonderful fragrance too!</li>
    <li> I usually like to use Moroccan oil in my hair to help mend some of my split ends but I thought I would give something else a try. The Brilliant Spray works well at taming some fly away hairs and it does leave a nice shine. If you use a little to much it makes your hair look oily so you have to be careful. All in all, I would recommend this product to someone who has lot&#x27;s of fly away hairs and also someone who has thick hair.</li>
    <li> Be careful when using this spray.  If you spray too much, you will end up with seriously oily looking tresses.  Yes, it adds shine, but more than one spritz is overkill.  It also has a really strong fragrance, which I happen to like, but which may be too much for more sensitive noses.  I have ended up with greasy looking hair after just one pump of this spray.  It also weighs my hair down.  There are better shine products out there these days.  I prefer a serum because I can control the amount.  Got2B Shine Serum is excellent and is only $5!!  And I never end up with oily hair when I use it.  Also, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil is much better than this spray and is great for those who want natural oils in a shine product that really soak in.  This Aveda spray just sits on top of hair and it works it&#x27;s way underneath to make all of my hair look greasy.  I&#x27;ve relegated it to my hall closet where hair product FAILURES go to die.  Maybe I can give it away.  It was a total waste of cash.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with fine to medium hair.  It may work well for those with coarse, thick hair or for those with curly hair though.  I certainly didn&#x27;t work out for me at all.</li>
    <li> Controls frizz and adds shine.</li>
    <li> My hair is nearly 70 years old and I refuse to dye it, cut it, or go to a hair salon.  Last year a friend gave me a bottle of this stuff and my hair has never looked better.  It&#x27;s shiny, smooth and straight down to my waist...just like I like it.</li>
    <li> used this product before  and l love it!! doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy just gives your hair a naturals shine!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite from Aveda!</li>
    <li> Yes it leaves your hair shiny and it tames fly-aways but I have to say I am very disappointed with this product. They must have switched the formula since I bought this many years ago. It no longer has the fantastic silky feel or the nice scent.  It now feels and smells just like alcohol.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula or something but this smells a lot like alcohol and not a lot like the Aveda smell I remember it smelling like.  I used to love that smell and sadly, this isn&#x27;t it.  I even had my sister smell it and she agreed.  Granted, It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used it so maybe they have changed the formula but If so I wish they&#x27;d change it back.  I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of shine in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my hairstylist used it to help smooth out some of my flyaways.  I have a lot of baby hairs around my face that tend to go all over the place.  she sprayed it a couple times into her fingertips and ran it through my hair and it was perfect.  I use it the exact same way after blow drying my hair.  If you need extra shine, it works great to spray directly onto your hair, but you don&#x27;t need that much to get shine.  My hair tends to get greasier during the day if I use too much product so I love to use it sparingly for the ends of my hair and it lasts all day.  I love this and it will most likely last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love Aveda products, but especially love Brilliant Spray On.  It is light weight&lt;br /&gt;and does not make my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> This was your run of the mill shine spray.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, just didn&#x27;t stand out in a crowded field and there are better ones to use...that cost less.  A really great product is &amp;#34;Crack.&amp;#34;  You can put it on either wet or dry hair and really adds shine and softness to your hair...for as little as $9 a tube.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just me for sure.  The shine is great, but it left my hair limp and almost oily.  And there really was no holding of the set.</li>
    <li> Alcohol! Will never buy this product again- is it the vendor or the product- I do not know but I will never buy!</li>
    <li> It does not leave much of a shine, and even with a light touch hair was greasy. I think the greasy-ness is suppose to be the shine.</li>
    <li> LOVE the fragrance in my hair. Nice and shiny too. Use lightly. Lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST shine product I have ever used.  I have tried maybe five other brands/products?  This is by far the most amazing.  All the other products made my hair droop, sag, look filthy dirty, whereas I sprayed on Brilliant one day, slept on my hair, woke up and it looked as good as the day before.  Amazon provided speedy delivery.  My only fear is that I will use it up too fast.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Love this product, just a few sprays and it turns dry hair into shiny managable hair!  GREAT product especially for thick corse hair like mine!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because the bottle I have had for a very long time ran out, and I really love the shine it adds. There is a slight pleasant aroma but it dissipates quickly. I will likely always have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> LOVE for dry hair or over washed.</li>
