<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a month and I have yet to see any result. I use this daily sometimes twice a day and nothing not even a tiny degree of change. I am very sad because I had very high hopes for this product. I have not rated it simply because I want to hold out on debunking it until I have finished the bottle since it does say on the bottle that the amount of time to see results will vary. In a strange way it smells a bit like tamarind it even has a tamarind colour. I wish I could say that it worked on removing my scars but it hasn&#x27;t. I will finish the bottle and post an update on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review.</li>
    <li> I just start using this gel on my arm scar for a car accident but its real old been over 5 year so will take a little,  time b4 i c any traumatic  different</li>
    <li> this is a small amount of product it didnt fade old marks on face but did see change in a small new cut</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite amazed at how well this product worked. I had a burn mark on my arm from a year back and I started noticing the color starting to fade after just two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Harry Potter made scars trendy for a mili-second. Now it’s back to normal and I would prefer my scars to disappear… completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently began using InstaNatural‘s Scar Gel, Amazon’s #1 Best Seller in Scar Treatment. I haven’t seen a difference in the scar disappearing yet (it’s only been two weeks), but I have noticed that my scar on my arm is less bumpy. I have faith that if I keep using the gel I will see a big difference in no time. I have had great luck with all of InstaNatural’s products and I have learned that within a month, at least, I can see a big difference in my skin. Read more on my blog ABQ Inspired.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free and in exchanged I’m providing my honest opinion. I decided to use this product because I have a scar on the side of my lip. I wanted to see how this product will help my scar. It&#x27;s a good product because it did see some improvements. The scar is now less visible. I hope, with the continual use of this product, it will repair more of the small scar that I have. The only problem with the product is the smell. When it is first applied it has a bad smell but it disappears after a while even with the odor I think it’s worth trying out. I’ve seen a great improvement on my scar.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. I use it on my left cheek. I was bit by a dog when I was two. I have been very self conscience of the scars on my face for years. I am noticing my scars are starting to fade. Very happy with this product and will continue to use. Have used many other products and haven&#x27;t seen results but with this product I can see it is working.</li>
    <li> I was beaten and have a scar near my eye that destroys me sometimes when I see it in the mirror. Gone!&lt;br /&gt;I also have a scar on my belly where I plucked off something that could have been cancer. Shrunk 80%&lt;br /&gt;Whatever is in this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working very well! I do not apply it as often as I need to but I can definitely see the difference</li>
    <li> does not work  i cannot believe people are saying it works.  my scar is not really bad just medium NOw i cannot get a refund.  this a joke right?</li>
    <li> It is a little bottle that contains gold inside it. I have two scars, one in my arm near my hand, from a cut I got when I was little, and another from my two C sections. Both are gruesome. I tend to scar easily. I have been using this little guy for a month now, and the scars borders are smoothing down. I think that if I keep using it twice a day I will soon will see wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Will update as it goes.</li>
    <li> My scars are slowly disappearing.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I recently bought this gel to get rid of the scar I got from a burn on my hand. I have been using this product once in 2-3 days or so, and I am already starting to see my scar getting better! I will increase the frequency of this gel to daily and hope to see my scar disappear one day :)</li>
    <li> I got this to review. It work very well on my hand i have a scar from a burn it is fading away.</li>
    <li> I got this product on discount for my unbiased opinion. I have been using it on a burn scar on my hand for two weeks now. I have noticed some improvement which I am very happy for. I will continue to use it and hopefully see more improvements.</li>
    <li> I haven;t used this long enough to know if it is effective on a small scar on my face but it applies smoothly and has a list of great skin healing ingredients on the label...time will tell and I may be back to re-rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and cannot tell that it did anything.  Won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> It works for me. My scar has been improved. The service is very good too.</li>
    <li> after trying for a while my daughter can feel and see the difference in her scar from her surgery on her wrist...and you only need to use a little it goes a long way...thank you so much for making my daughter feel better about her scar</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve used it for some spots on my face and I&#x27;ve also used it on both of my legs/ankles due to scars and spots that I got due to flea bites. Like most scar / dark spot products, it truly works the best if you use it twice a day, everyday. I would use it after my shower in the morning and then again before I went to sleep. It&#x27;s one of the best scar products I&#x27;ve ever used (along with L&#x27;oreal Youth Code) and I like that it has natural ingredients such as Gotu Kola and Green Tea . I recently received my second bottle last week. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> i have scars on my stomach from having my babies and i couldnt believe when i used this how they faded, the scent was light, so light i couldnt hardly even tell it had a scent, i used to a tiny bit every day on my stomach and slowly they started to fade, remember this is not a miracle that will happen over night, so be patient with it, it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY DOES WORK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually quite shocked this is working.  I&#x27;m one of those people who usually thinks these kinds of products are gimmicks, but it&#x27;s really working.  I have this awful deep scar on my foot I&#x27;ve been testing it on, and it has lessened the appearance within a week.  I love all of InstaNatural&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried, but this one has to be the most shocking.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this free for review purposes, and these opinions (or facts based upon what my scar&#x27;s doing) are all my own.</li>
    <li> Another great product! I&#x27;m a royal InstaNatural product user. Love their products so much! Have to have this scar gel cream for my very sporty daughter. She got minor scratches mostly everyday, and with this glide on scar gel cream, she can easily apply on the scars when she sees one by herself without any excuses. And the formula contains no harmful ingredients which is the best part of InstaNatural products. Love it!</li>
    <li> I will say don&#x27;t let the size of this fool you. This is one of the most high power products to help with my major scaring. It has a pleasant non odor smell. I have yet to try it on acne scars but surgical I can say it worked. I have scars years old I might add. I have not had them lighten up before now with this I am noticing them finally going away. I didn&#x27;t feel a sticky or thick gel with this. It absorbed into my skin easily. One this I like about this company is quality of product. They do not use harmful ingredients in their products.  I am going to try to use it on acne scars and report back. This is and has been awesome for me, but I would say man or woman would be good with this. If you have acne scaring I would try it. What would it hurt.  As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I am very, very fair skinned. My breakouts started getting out of control a few years ago. I&#x27;ve finally gotten them undercontrol, but I have been left with dark spots and scars from popping and picking at them (I know, I know. Should have known better). Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make foundation shades to fit my skin. It&#x27;s either too pink, too orange, or too oily and makes my break outs worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried everything I could: mainstream brands, new skin care routines, yadda-yadda. Nothing worked. I found this product after intense research. It was a bit pricey when I bought it ($35), but I took the risk because about 99% of the products I used before were drug store products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a week, and I&#x27;m seeing results! Granted my scars are small and discolorated more than a crevice in my skin or a raised sliver. However, with time, I believe this product could solve any scar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scars haven&#x27;t completed vanished, but they&#x27;ve faded and are less noticeable. I have to wear less makeup to cover them up. It definitely brings back confidence to me. This product is worth the try.</li>
    <li> Loved this thick, creamy, cream!! I used a small amount at a time and massaged into the area of the scar (I tried it out on one on my arm.) and it greatly diminished the small but thick scar I had from a bug bite that I use to itch til it bled!! But now, you can hardly see it!! I would definitely use this again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an average person who happens to be extremely passionate about Tom, My Kids, and life in general.

    <li> This product really works.  It healed my cut and left no scar.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazeballs! It has flattened my keloid and stops the itching. All you need is a very small amount , spread and massage into the skin!!</li>
    <li> using it to try to get rid of acne scars and I am breaking out horribly with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really working! I appreciate the success I am gradually experiencing as a result of using this product.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product on a scar I received from a surgery.  I have notice no change at this time.  I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> all reviews on here are fake. you guys can check their profile and you will see these people write review on other products everyday which is weird</li>
    <li> Just started using the scar cream (2 days) and it takes a few minutes to dry. The formula is thin and has a minimal smell to it. I had my procedure done June 2, 2015 and saw the many good reviews so hopefully this works. I will update my review in a month. I ordered the the cream on Friday and received the package Sunday through USPS.</li>
    <li> My reason for using this was because I have some dog bites and a scar from a car accident that I am trying to lessen the appearance of. The gel is lightweight, non-greasy, and applies to the skin smoothly and evenly. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell its not really a bad one its just smells herbal, once absorbed into the skin the smell does fade. I apply a very thin layer on the scars twice a day its not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake and dries quickly. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement on my old scars but they are somewhat lighter and the raised tissue feels a little flatter. I think this product works best on  newer scars. My son applied it on a acne scar he has and I can see a visible difference. The only negative that I&#x27;ve found is the gel slightly discolors my skin,  I &#x27;m fair skinned so i&#x27;m not sure if it will do the same to darker skin tones. I&#x27;m going to be getting Gallbladder surgery soon and I will definitely be using this to help prevent scarring. This gel won&#x27;t work overnight,you need to be consistent, but if you make the commitment to use it,  I think it will work pretty good.</li>
    <li> Best scar gel I have ever purchased, of course it doesn&#x27;t just remove the scar tomorrow, but I used the entire bottle as instructed and have seen noticeably lighter scars and smoother skin. Great product just ordered more and ordered other items from them, can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
    <li> The scar Gel cream does exactly what it is suppose to .fade scars.it doesn&#x27;t work over night. I saw amazing results within 7 days.I don&#x27;t want to be without this scar gel.ordering my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I had surgery to correct a bunion December of 2014.  I was using Mederma gel without any difference from January to mid April.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.  Not only is the full price of this product is about what I paid for much less of the Mederma from CVS.  It absorbs quickly - it isn&#x27;t really a Gel or cream- its hard to describe, like a thicker serum.  I&#x27;ve attached before an after pictures - this is using twice a day (after am shower and pm before bed) for approx. 3 weeks.  I will buy this again!  I took pictures in the same artificial light to show how much the scar has already smoothed in just a few weeks - amazing!  Considering I went through a tube and a half of Mederma with no real results.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, amazing result</li>
    <li> I love this  Scar cream Been  using this in  my arm. and  hand for three  weeks, definitely see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I like their products because  it  has the  natural ingredients.  Feel  good , and also odorless, just to me liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to  try this with  a discount.  But my opinion is  all mid, honest and unbiased</li>
    <li> It takes time.. I saw a bit of improvement after 3months. If you have old scar like mine, just be patient and will surely worth it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
    <li> It is a great product and does not have any funny smells. It smells pretty good to me. I like the fact that they put in a pump bottle. It great to sore away and does not take a lot of room. I have been using the Stretch Mark Cream on my hand where I have scratches. This lotion in a miracle lotion it started to fade away the deep red marks I have on left hand.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is unscented. I usually put it on twice a day, when I am getting dressed in the morning and again after I shower and dry of really well. I put it in my stomach and thighs and hand. I just rub it in really well. It absorbs quickly into your skin and leave your skin feeling soft and smooth. I love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy. It didn&#x27;t make my feel greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got the product for free for  exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> While this product didn&#x27;t work well on my old scars, it did really help to fade my daughter&#x27;s newer scars.  I highly recommend for fresh scars.  I did really see a difference in fading time. I&#x27;m sure if I used this for an extended period of time on my stretch marks, that I might see a difference, but since they are 6 years old, it didn&#x27;t do much. They do offer a Stretch Mark cream, so I may try that in the future to see if it does a better job.  The ingredients in this are very expensive and the price is reasonably low considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research on the ingredients and a lot of these ingredients are in pharmaceutical grade creams that help with everything from psoriasis, eczema, and post skin cancer treatment.  If you are looking for something affordable to help with any of those ailments, this might be a good option for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lighten up my skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Although I have been using less than a week .... The smell of the product is horrible.  I have not seen any results as of yet</li>
    <li> Waste the money. Surprised this can get so much praise</li>
    <li> I recieved this product at a discouted price for the purpose of reviewing. After only 2 application I noticed such a difference! The fading of the scar was undeniable! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Do not see any improvement after one month</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this for my unbiased opinion. This is a good product! I&#x27;ve been using it on an old scar on my leg from a childhood incident. I&#x27;ve noticed the scar reducing a bit in size and fading in color! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day on clean skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is great. You only need a small amount, the formula spreads on pretty well and quickly absorbs. Don&#x27;t worry about the color, it dries clear. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it for maximum results!</li>
    <li> Im not crazy about  the smell, but I am happy with how the product is helping with the appearance of my scars which is what matters most. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> So I have been using this a little over a week now. I have some very pronounced scars and some smaller ones. I do notice that my smaller scars are starting to lighten up. I was very skeptical at first thinking maybe I wanted it to work, so I&#x27;m making it work, but pictures don&#x27;t lie. They darker and thinker scars I haven&#x27;t really noticed much change,  but those I would think would take longer. I&#x27;m hoping that my scars can completely diaapear ,  but only time will tell. I will update my review in a month.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells bad, it&#x27;s gritty, and it smells bad... Oh did I mention it smell bad.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my old scar getting lighter.</li>
    <li> I could see a scar from an insect bite fade away before my eyes (across time, like a month or so) I have a picture of the bite scar which was about 2mm by 1mm, and I will show a contrast after it&#x27;s fully healed, because I do believe this product works miracles.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use and great ingredients i highly recommend. Use was on acne scars on the back and so far im impressed! Also i have to mention the wonderful customer service, i have found the companies night face cream and face mask to be my favorite for face products!!! Thank you for making wonderful products and also caring that your products are working for all!</li>
    <li> I got this product free for a review and I am currently using it now. I have been using it about a month. Although there is not any noticeable color change in my scars, this Insta Natural Scar Cream has made my scars softer. Its a gel, its thin, it goes on the skin very light and it rubs in almost wet. It dries in just a few minutes with no smell or problem at all. If you are looking for a scar gel, then give Insta Natural a try.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working good so far</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome! Not only this product, but many other of InstaNatural&#x27;s products as well! My daily beauty routine only consists of only InstaNatural proucts, the Age Defying Skin Clearing Serum, the Moroccan Rose Water, and the Youth Express Eye Gel. Love! InstaNatural, please offer a makeup line as well ... I&#x27;m sure it would be awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I use it on my stretch marks and on a chin scar with really great improvements, so far!</li>
    <li> Messy, hasn&#x27;t worked as I thought it would. I went back to Bio Oil as this cream is messy and becomes very crusty as it dries.  Didn&#x27;t change anything on my not very old scar.</li>
    <li> The advertised pictures make the bottle look bigger. You&#x27;ll get one smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> So far no improvement noticed</li>
    <li> So far so good! I havent had a negative reaction and that is the best part. I&#x27;m putting it on my light acne scarring and hoping for the best. :)</li>
    <li> LOVE it!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> I got this for free to review and here it is. I had poison ivy scratch scars on my arms that were dark red/purple and this gel made them much more noticeable. I did try to use it on old stretch marks but did not see any improvement. So in my experience, this is good for fresh scars</li>
    <li> So far I am finally seeing reduction in an annoying scar on my hand that I&#x27;ve had for a few months.</li>
    <li> I can feel difference in few days. it is good product.</li>
    <li> Just started using it. So far good.  I will update.  Very soothing.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. But then again, all my scars are rather old so I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, used it for almost two weeks and there was virtually no difference on my tiny little scar on my jaw, and the value is horrible, $30 for literally 6 pumps of solution.  I saw that this product had almost 700 reviews and a high rating but then I realized most of them were reviewers who were sent the product for free.  I actually paid full $30 and found out it wasn&#x27;t effective.  Also the solution itself is extremely light in weight and is the color is orange.  It literally just feels like you&#x27;re smearing water on your face.</li>
    <li> The gel took about a month to start working noticeably since I had a pretty big scar on my face next to my eye.  But the gel is starting to make it fade.  People are noticing, too.  I’ve started spreading the word about it to other people.  I&#x27;m not prepared to give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not done with the whole treatment but this product does have the potential to be 5 stars.  People with scars should be happy with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this product would work, seeing all the other peoples positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for exactly 1 month now,  NO IMPROVEMENT AT ALL . My acne scar is still discolored, exactly the same as before. When I first started using it, it dispensed a diluted gel substance, after 3 weeks, it dispensed fluid.. I tried shaking it, that didn&#x27;t do anything, I kept using the fluid anyways until it was all gone.  I only used it on the acne scar on my face (not all over my face, and the acne scar is from recent), this product only lasted 1 month. Clearly has less gel than it advertised to have.</li>
    <li> Wondering about some of these reviews. I had elbow surgery and have 1 inch scar. This stuff did nothing. I discovered you really need to shake the can first before applying or a clear-ish liquid will just dribble out. Once it is shaken, it is a brown gel that is really dark on your skin when it dries. My wife thought my scar was getting worse when she saw it with the gel on.  Edit: On a positive note, they sent me an email asking if I was satisfied with the product.  After I told them that it wasn&#x27;t really working for me, they promptly refunded my money.</li>
    <li> After my surgery this is working great.  Scar is already minimizing even after 1 month you can see the difference on my hip.</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the appearance of my face</li>
    <li> super effective ! better than many high-end products i&#x27;ve tried ......even for my old acne scars...!!</li>
    <li> scar gel&lt;br /&gt;[Pin on Pinterest]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Naturals Scar Gel contains a potent blends of ingredients to help diminish scars. This formula contains Epidermal Growth Factor (a naturally occurring protein that stimulates healing), Gotu Kola aids in restoring healthy skin, Green Tea, Fucoxanthin, Astaxanthin and Sea Kelp fortify the skin with antioxidants. Scars will be minimized and skin will be moisturized. I used this gel on a scar that I had left over from acne. It definitely helped reduced the appearance of the scar. Originally it was red and after a couple of weeks the scar had faded to a lighter shade of pink and looked much better.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago and started applying it to a couple of dark spots I have due to burns. I scar very, very easily and any imperfection I have on my skin will leave a dark mark that takes months to fade. I am pleased with this scar gel, it faded my burn marks significantly faster than had I not used it. The gel is a tan/dark orange color which was a surprise when I first pumped it out! Also, a little goes a long way, so be careful not to use a whole pump if you have a small mark to treat. The product absorbs completely and is not greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I had a scar on my thumb from where I cut myself about ten years ago, I have been using this product for the past three weeks and have seen a noticeable difference in the color of my scar.</li>
    <li> My scar has lightened up considerably since I started using this.  It hasn&#x27;t gone away but it is not as noticeable, which is great.  I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a nice scar formula.  After recent surgery, I was left with a scar across my abdomen. After two weeks, my scar was much softer and less red in appearance.  I&#x27;m continuing to use this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it every day twice since more then a month and no change at all!!! not happy!</li>
    <li> Ingredients listed Epidermal Growth Factor, Fucoxanthin, Astaxanthin, Green Tea &amp; Gotu Kola. I like that this is produced in the USA, I like products made here helps boost our economy and keeps some of us employed. The formula contains no harmful parabens, sulfates or alcohols I have horrible scars on my legs from traveling overseas to the Philippines where I would get mosquito bites I was under the age of 9 when I would scratch and scratch now Im 24 and im embarrassed to wear dresses or shorts because of my legs and this has been really improving my skin texture. I am so happy I was given the opportunity to test this for review purposes. Will be making another purchase shortly as I am almost out.</li>
    <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it&#x27;s an ugly brownish color when it comes out and not entirely smooth. But don&#x27;t let that make you stop using it. If I wasn&#x27;t so self-conscious I&#x27;d post picture, but I have body image issues... so ya. I used this stuff on my tummy where I have a ton of stretch marks (thanks for that kiddos). It definitely helped to make them less frightening to look at. More like faded them some and possibly thinned them. I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see how it helps out with making them even less visible since nothing works instantly, this is an on-going process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if it&#x27;s working even the slightest bit, it&#x27;s worth it. For me it is working and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. Although since I have sensitive skin, I only use it once in awhile... but that should tell you something if it&#x27;s working for me. My skin tends to have itchy breakouts if I put anything on where I have scar tissue - no clue why, but it does. This stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out, and I love that, but I&#x27;m not risking it so I do it every few days. Good stuff and I recommend.</li>
    <li> This made my acne worse. and I havent seen any improvement to my scars and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now.</li>
    <li> I am giving this scar gel 4 stars. I did see results after one month of using it, my acne scars definitely lessened. The reason why I am giving it 4 stars is this gel makes my face super oily so as I am getting rid of acne scars sometimes I get new acne. However, I still do recommend getting this scar gel cream.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything, and it&#x27;s an ugly brown color.  Might be one of those things that works on a light scar but not on mine, since I just had stitches removed 2.5 weeks ago.  Not thrilled.</li>
    <li> good stuff super fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but I&#x27;ve already seen a significant softening and lightening of my scar.  Plus the InstaNatural team has fantastic customer service -- they are quick with responses and go out of their way to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I can already tell my scar is getting lighter!</li>
    <li> To be on the safe side, instead of my face, I have been using this scar cream on my arm , on one of the  deep old scar for  4 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;Although it will not made the old scar  disappear , it really  did help  80 % - the  color is close to my  original skin color, a lot less noticeable,  and the  depth is so much better as well.  I am sold on this production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for my  face, and will up date with my  acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have honored to review this with discount, my opinion and review is honest  and unbiased.</li>
    <li> After receiving this item for review i was excited for i have scars from years back. Well the gel is not sticky after applying and is easy to rub in. I have been using it for a week now and can gladly say that I have not seen a big difference. I will continue to use it for i like the gel and maybe it will work but after a week im not seeing a change. I do like the idea behind it though and the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have tried many scar removal products, this is the most effetive product I have ever used. I have a surgery scar on my face. The scar seems less prominent in color and texture after using the product for a couple of months. I will continue to use the product. I am gonna buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the company really cares about its users.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with microneedling/dermarolling and I have to say that after 2 weeks, I am seeing some small changes to stretch marks on my stomach.  My less deep stretch marks are shrinking and smoothing out/filling in.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle - they aren&#x27;t gone yet, but I am seeing changes which is making me really hopeful!</li>
    <li> ordered it for my wife, she loves it, this actually works. Great customer service also. We have now ordered more products by InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> I used it for months, but there is no different on my scar.&lt;br /&gt;The gel became darker and darker after purchase.(I don&#x27;t know it,s normal or not)</li>
    <li> I had arm surgery in October and just purchased this cream in June. It truly does work on old or new scars.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This worked the VERY MOMENT i applied it. I have psoriasis and it flared up on my lower jaw last month. It has cleared up but I was terrified of a scar on my face. I took a picture for every day since I have used it and am STUNNED that it was almost invisible by the NEXT day. And i mean, this was a pretty dramatic scar.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a improvement yet but I&#x27;m still trying... Will update</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product it smells great and works fast definitely a good product</li>
    <li> Great product that really works!</li>
    <li> This stuff works thinking about buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> Another awesome product from InstaNatural... I have some new scars recover and disappeared fast with this product. Now I am just hoping in 2 months I will see different on some of my old scars.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal service, even emailed me after receiving the product giving me instructions on how to use it for best results. I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 days now on acne scars that are about 2 months old and mixed with an exfoliator this product has been working wonders. I&#x27;ve been applying it once at night and once in the morning. I&#x27;ve bought 4 items form InstaNatural over the course of the past 2 months and i love  this company. Will continue purchasing from this company.</li>
    <li> The gel helps me to reduce redness and makes skin a bit smoother. But old and deep scars obviously required long time treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this and all their products and their wonderful and personal customer service. Paired with amazing products this is a wonderful experience with this company. I will be a forever customer!</li>
    <li> This is a great scar remover.  I have noticed a decrease in the color of a particular ugly scar I have; and the size is also diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;My scar feels smoother too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very lightweight formula - doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or have a bad odor.  I have very sensitive skin as well and I have had no reactions to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is processed in the USA and contains no harmful parabens, sulfates or alcohols.&lt;br /&gt;Great money back guarantee is an added bonus too!!</li>
    <li> Use everyday, No results.</li>
    <li> I received this scar gel about 3 weeks ago, I used it on a fairly new scar. The gel has a medium consistency not too watery but not too thick. It comes in a pump dispenser and its a brownish color. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Using the gel did seem to flaten the scar and make it smoother, I will continue use and update.</li>
    <li> So far looks like it has improved the appearance of my scars!</li>
    <li> this product was very helpful, so easy to put on leaving no stickiness there is no smell to this or nasty residue  I have used it for 3 days on my stomach and the scar seems to be fading away slowly but surely.  I receive this product on a discount or free for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> I have a scar right above my lip from childhood.  It never use to bother me until I got to my late 30s because it really shows due to collagen loss. So I bought this scar gel and been using it for about 3 weeks now. I did notice that my scar is slowly but surely fading. It is a gel so it takes a few seconds to absorb but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all and is easy to wear under makeup. Need to be patient because nothing works instantly. Most importantly it is natural with no harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Very effective and my scar is slowly gets invisible</li>
    <li> it smells good, because short time use, I have not see significant changes</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have many scars that I have been trying this on. They have all started to fade. It is honestly a miracle product! My son also has a car on his forehead I&#x27;ve been putting it on, I am very impressed with it,. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, or the results I&#x27;m getting from using it!</li>
    <li> Good product. Seeing results with continuous use</li>
    <li> I feel like I have been using this for quite some time now, and while the product does work, I think it was more effective on the new scar I had over the old one. It minimized the appearance of the old one, but I can see some people being disappointed if they wanted an old scar to go away 100% really fast. I think it&#x27;ll just take longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Does what it says it will do. That&#x27;s hard to find now a days a product that works.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed that my uneven scar is evening and lightening up.</li>
    <li> GOT A NEW SCAR, and bought this right away !  SCAR IS GONE AFTER 2 MONTH!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product came too out too liquidy for my liking. I only used it a couple of times and it isn&#x27;t the product for me. Great concept though!</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to review this since I&#x27;ve been testing it on: a new scar, a relatively new scar, and old scar and an extremely old scar.  I like the fact that this has astaxanthin in it, which I&#x27;d been reading about recently for its skin-healing properties.  The product is a light brown color with a slight gel-like consistency, but is easily rubbed into the skin (it reminds me of antibacterial gel that comes out as a gel and then dissolves into your hands).  It sort of turns liquidy as you are rubbing it in.  This means that a tiny dollop of product goes a long long way.  I feel like this 1 oz. bottle is going to last me until the end of time.  I&#x27;ve applied it to a fresh scar and it basically disappeared in less than a week - applying only 1x day but really working it in there because I feel like part of the process is massaging the scar tissue to help regenerate cells.  The older scars are still around though maybe have lightened a bit.  I know it will take time and the directions say 2x day, but I struggle with even 1x day so, who knows.  Maybe it will just take 2x as long to do its magic.  I was hoping I could report a miracle, because my extremely old scar is also extremely noticeable, but I think it has faded since using this product.  I like that this product is easily absorbed, non-irritating, easy to dispense, has relatively no smell and the fact that it has astaxanthin in it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using this on my C-section scar for a little while and so far I am happy with the results. It goes on smoothly.  It has a brown color that surprised me.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Been using the product for over 2 months and don&#x27;t see any difference on any of my scars</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but my scar was about a year old when I started using this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! I&#x27;m 48 years old and had to have a total knee replacement the end of December and started using Scar Gel Cream as soon as I could apply a product to my scar. I am on my second bottle and my scar looks pretty amazing, if I do say so myself. The scar tissue is so much softer and it is fading in certain spots, already. Even my surgeon was impressed at my 5 month checkup. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I started seeing results in about a week.  I use it on my chest, back, and face and have had great results.  Best product I have tried with the best results.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it works though; not seeing any dramatic changes yet.</li>
    <li> I feel like its working in some scarring on my face but I really can&#x27;t tall. This product definitely soothes the scars to make it softer. But I will continue to use till I run out.</li>
    <li> works wonderful.  tried other products that didn&#x27;t work and was totally thrilled to find a product that did work.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is in a small bottle pump which I really like. Easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and brownish in color.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients in this! My scar is starting to fade.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing a difference. For the price. Natural vitamin E oil is better. I have sensitive skin and this does irritate my incision site</li>
    <li> Definitely not my imagination.  Redness of scar is already much lighter and I have only used it for a few days.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using it for her acne scars and it does do the job.</li>
    <li> Did not work. I used it for a month I only saw small difference. I still have my burn mark from&lt;br /&gt;My curling iron.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me, not even a little bit. $30 down the drain.</li>
    <li> This gel is very easy to use.  It leaves a waxy coating which helps my scar stay moist which I understand that helps it to heal faster.  It was a new scar when I started applying the gel and it has healed very nicely.  The injury was about an inch long and I applied this gel even while the stitches were still in.  It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks now and I have received many comments from friends/family about how nicely it is healing.  I can&#x27;t measure how much the gel has to do with it but I believe it has made a difference.  The gel is a brownish color but you can&#x27;t really notice it once it is dry on your skin.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a smell which is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a scar on my chin for a little over a decade. Mederma did absolutely nothing, so I figured I was stuck for life. I gave this product a shot on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Even though it&#x27;s an old scar, I started noticing a difference within a few weeks. It&#x27;s started to level out, and the color is much closer to my actual skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anybody!</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel in the morning and in the evening for a little more than 2 months. I managed to have two small injuries close together and purchased this product in hopes that it would diminish the scarring (one curling iron burn and one long, but not deep, cat scratch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- I like that this product has little fragrance. It is nice to use a lotion/cream that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;- The gel is a dark orange in color and a bit gritty but not unpleasant. It rubs in easily, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;A little amount goes a long way. When I first saw how small this bottle is, I assumed I would need to buy another one within a month. After two months, I still have enough of this gel to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible con&lt;br /&gt;- Both of my marks healed, and I am relieved that I don&#x27;t have huge scars. However, I still have marks from each injury and those do not appear to be getting any fainter. I have no way of knowing if they would have healed to this point on their own or if this product helped this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this twice a day until I empty the bottle. I will update here if I see further progress with these scars.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Does what intended. Texture reminds me of applesauce tho. Feels fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I used it after a breast lift.  I went through 2 tubes, and it did help!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark complexion African American and it didn&#x27;t work for me! I tried using it to get rid of acne scars on my chest. I think it&#x27;s better at preventing bumps instead of clearing up on scars. Didn&#x27;t notice not one change since using this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking longer than expected. It has been 2 1/2 months since using this scar gel, but it looks like it&#x27;s working. I am being patient because the scar is not new. I will buy another bottle hopefully my scar will be erased after that second bottle.</li>
    <li> Good cream, love the feeling.</li>
    <li> Slightly helped with the color. Size and texture pretty much the same as before.</li>
    <li> Its realy work good on my wife&#x27;s skin! But still using... And waiting for results</li>
    <li> Had recent knee replacement-this worked well on the scar site-can hardly see the scar.</li>
    <li> I am facing some surgeries and need something to help me recover and treat my scar which will be big. I received this and started using it on an  older scar. It has actually begun to fade my scar!  I am thrilled and will post another review after I use it on a fresh scar. But for now I would rate this A+ in my book</li>
    <li> Been using it since March 2015. No changes. Not even slightly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Really works.</li>
    <li> Used this on burn scars...it faded them very well! I loved this product highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product has turned out to be very DISAPPOINTING!!!!  I had high hopes that this product would help flatten and soften the redness and white scar tissue that formed as a result of a bad lip waxing experience.  I used this as directed and applied it to my clean skin 2x&#x27;s per day, but did NOT see any improvements at all...  My lip waxing scar looks exactly the same as the day I had first used it.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think this product will work on ANY scar!!!!  Don&#x27;t use it!!!!  Buy another skin product or consult an: aesthetician, doctor or burn repair specialist...</li>
    <li> I love this scar gel! It has definitely shown some signs of improvement on my acne scars. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel gross. I put this on before bed and a little on before my makeup in the morning. I will definitely continue using to see even better results!</li>
    <li> No obvious effect after a month</li>
    <li> Nice and light, not greasy, runny or smelly.</li>
    <li> Instanatural is garbage</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference after using this for 4 weeks for a new scar on my face.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is soft and not overwhelming and the scars are disappearing</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Apply it twice a day. Scar gets lighter and smoother. Works better than other products we have tried.</li>
    <li> This scar cream is amazing! After a short period of time I&#x27;ve noticed great results and lightening of my scar. I&#x27;ve always been told laser treatments, at $100+, was the only way to improve the appearance. This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> love that it is in a pump bottle for easy application. It seems a little goes a long way, so be careful how much you pump out. It is an orange color gel with a subtle fig scent. It is easily rubbed in and absorbs fully after a minute or so without leaving any color, stickiness, or greasiness behind. It leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;(All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest and 100% my own)</li>
    <li> Another winner form InstaNatural! I started trying some of this manufactures products on promotion and have become a huge fan.  I have massive scars from surgeries a year ago.  I was told to wait at least 6 months before applying anything topical that could soften the area and undermine the internal sutures. I have been apply this regularly every day now after my shower and I can say that this has faded the appearance from an angry red to slightly lighter then the surrounding skin color.  I also have noticed the scarring seems to be flattening out as well. The gel is non greasy, spreads lightly and easily with a nice cooling effect which is welcome.  The scent is pleasant too. Good value with lots of product for the price after costing other scar creams to compare ingrediants and cost th is the winner. oh yea and no nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Way to go InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> Received this with a promotional discount and so far have been happy! I have been using this on a few scars of mine for a week now and can already tell a difference! I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results! Great quality and great price</li>
    <li> My husband had back surgery in June and has a pretty big/red scar. We purchased this scar gel to help lessen the appearance of it. The gel is brown and not pretty looking. It goes on smoothly and a little does go a long way so you don&#x27;t feel like you are being ripped off. We&#x27;ve been using it for about a2 weeks now twice a day and it seems to be reducing the redness of the scar. It isn&#x27;t sticky and won&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> I have a few rather embarrassing visible scars.  This gel worked really well to reduce them. They haven&#x27;t disappeared completely (at least not yet) but they are way less noticable. I was impressed wit the performance of Instanaturals Scar Gel. I will continue use to see if it will completely erase the scar. I&#x27;m hopeful! I am happy to recieve this item to review.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. I was disappointed with the size didnt realize it was that much for that little. Didn&#x27;t help me with my scars if anything made them more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Have to wonder about all the great reviews. ..it may have helped one scar very little..I had some spots removed around my neck area that left some scars..after applying this I started to get acne in those areas that I never did before. The last straw was after a shower one morning..When I used body wash it reacted to this stuff with a wicked rash ONLY in the areas where this was applied!!! No thanks!</li>
    <li> UPDATE As of 09/01/2015 (6 months later)  I have used the entire bottle now- once a day, everyday for almost 5 months till I finished the bottle and the results are in- this product does not work on me. I&#x27;ve seen over the counter glycolic creams and serums (alphahy....) work better at almost half the price point and in half the time. This product does not work and it&#x27;s being sold on the premise that it&#x27;s a 100% natural, what&#x27;s the point?   ORIGINAL REVIEW- Given 3 stars on 03/18/2015  Disclaimer: I am one of the few people here that has actually bought this product without any remuneration or discounts from the company- I&#x27;m not saying that those reviewers who received a discount are biased, but I believe one is often psychologically partial to free/ discounted products. The 3 star rating only means &#x27;so far so good&#x27;, as I will update this review as I see fit.  I bought this product based on the many 5 star reviews here, to tackle a few acne scars that I&#x27;ve been dealing with for a while. I purchased it for $35 and found that the price dropped to $24 the next day, when I was back looking for more reviews. I emailed customer care, and got a response immediately and was reimbursed the difference of $10 right away! In my book, good customer care generally speaks of a manufacturer that&#x27;s confident of their product.  On first impressions, the container feels a little cheap as it&#x27;s just a black, plastic bottle with a crookedly stuck on label- the ends don&#x27;t align. For the price and it being US made, I would expect a glass container or a better quality plastic. The pump works well though, dispensing enough at a time.  The muddy- green and watery gel consistency smells herbal, and similar to a mix of fenugreek leaves and coffee, is not strong or offensive and the smell disappears once the product is absorbed. My face feels very smooth right after applying it at night and I wake up with plumped up looking and feeling skin. As the gel discolours the skin ever so slightly (especially if you&#x27;re med- fair skinned), I have been using it only at night time for approximately a week and a half- the manufacturer recommends using it twice a day. I&#x27;m not seeing drastic results right now, only a general brightening of the skin, but I&#x27;ll wait for a month or two to update this review with the progress as my scars are pretty old and I&#x27;m using the gel just once a day. Herbal products in general take longer to show their effectiveness as compared to a bottle full of chemicals in my opinion, but in no way does it mean that they&#x27;re less potent. Based on the many great reviews here, I hope I get results that are as good!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my scar. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on an old eyebrow piercing for awhile and I definitely notice a improvement. Would recommend 100%!</li>
    <li> I really like the brand InstaNatural since their products are natural and made in the USA. I have some scars on my upper arms that I am trying to get faded before summer. This gel goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly, I am noticing a difference in only a couple of weeks. I am pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I use this on an old scar and I amazed at how it feels softer. It is way less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any scars except under my hair so I wasn&#x27;t able to use this on myself. However my son has a little one on his forehead from a gash he got while roller skating. I used this product on him at night only because of his fair skin and the tint of this product - I didn&#x27;t want his teachers to think I was putting makeup on him. He has used it for a few weeks now and the scar is less noticeable but not gone yet. I think it will take a little more time since we are only using it once a day instead of the recommended two times. As far as the product itself, it goes on smooth and leaves no sticky residue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and if my feelings on it change I will update my review. So many people have had WONDERFUL results that I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple weeks now, seems to be doing a good job fading my old scars!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for new or old scar</li>
    <li> it worked perfect for me it made them a lot lighter. honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any change but the people I see everyday would tell me if im doing something to my face because its looking way better. people who didn&#x27;t even know I was using this product would say that my scars are gone. I really love this product!</li>
    <li> My little boy has had several surgeries so I was eager to try this on him and see if it helps minimize the scarring. So far, I think it&#x27;s working and I am really pleased. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Just consistently apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> Really helpfull. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: InstaNatural sent me a complimentary bottle so I could review this product. Now as for my review. I had a double mastectomy so my scars are very visible. For that reason I wanted to use this product and I thought this was just another product that claimed it faded scars. That&#x27;s not the case. I put it on twice a day for two weeks and my scars have actually faded and are not so pronounced. Now if it works on mastectomy scars, imagine what it will do for regular scars. I love this product even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey. If you have the money and have scars, get the scar gel.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this helps. Have a small eczema scar on my body. It took the raised part down? Maybe? No lightening effect. Need more time to figure out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Very light, like colored water product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Too early to see results</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this gel, mainly because this products have the BEST of all of the natural anti-inflamatory and healing ingredients so I thought it might be useful for rosacea-eczema (EGCG, EGF, luteolin, astaxanthin, to name a few). I like that it has no fillers, cheap excipients, irritants, so this is a really high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;The second pictures are from my forehead when I come out of the shower, you can see red eczema bumps and patchy red skin along with some telangiectsea (rosacea runs in my family). The first pictures are from 5 days after using this product twice a day, also coming out from the shower, using this cream twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;I have some very minor scars from eczema/acne, and one scar in my forehead from and accident when I was 3 years old. I havent seen major changes from those scars(besides flatness and whitish appearance) because I have only used this for one week.JHwever, my red inflamed skin has completely changed. Now my skin can stand showers, mild soaps, and I dont look like I have a bad sunburn everytime I shower/ sunbathe, have a stressful day, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
    <li> In less than one month of using this product, I have already seen results! Less redness and less swollen.</li>
    <li> After using the entire bottle there was a noticeable difference. The scar is still present, but only if you try to look for it. It may be a physiological thing though as I&#x27;ve had the scar since I was a kid. At least friends and family members don&#x27;t notice it anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty bad at first, but you&#x27;ll get over it as it quickly absorbs into your skin. Also after frequent applications your nose tend to glace over it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m impressed by the product.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Scar Gel worked for me--it greatly improved my scar&#x27;s appearance and texture (I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for over one month).  Obviously, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it may not work as well for everyone.  However, I am very happy with this product!  Furthermore, I was very impressed with the company InstaNatural.  They contacted me when I initially ordered the product to provide tips on using it.  They also followed up a month later to see if I was satisfied with it--and offered a refund if I was not.  InstaNatural seems to genuinely care about their products and their customers&#x27; satisfaction--which is quite refreshing!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 9./19/2016&lt;br /&gt;There was not enough of a benefit using this product that I can recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL POST&lt;br /&gt;If you look at some of my other reviews you will see I am a fan of InstaNatural products.Out of all of the products I&#x27;ve reviewed for them, this is my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a long time to review this product because I wanted to see if it provided the scar relief it claims it will. So far I can&#x27;t say with super confidence that I am 100% sold on this product. The skin around the scar is soft, but I do not see a significant reduction in the scar itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I am giving it a 3 star rating since the skin is soft. I will continue to use this product and if I see a noticeable difference in the scar I will update this review and change the star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this product for my review and feedback.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  I treated minor scars that I didn&#x27;t bother treating it for a few years.  It took about over a month to really notice that my scars were disappearing but most of them were really gone gone!</li>
    <li> I have tried this for a month and it has not gone away one bit</li>
    <li> I recently had breast implants and my scars were very hard and raised. My doctor said if they didnt improve I need to order this super expensive scar therapy he sells through his office. Well I came online to look at reviews. I don&#x27;t order anything without great reviews. I read a lot of great reviews and its pried very well. So I wanted to try it. I went in for my checkup today and my doctor was so impressed with my scars! He took pictures on his phone of this product and said he will recommend it to his other patients who can&#x27;t afford the expensive scar therapy. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this. It really works miracles!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE EVRY SENSITIVE SKIN AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN ITCHY AND SWEATY BUT I WILL WRITE ANOTHE REVIEW WHEN I SEE IF THERE ARE ANY NOYICEABLE RESULTS….SO FAR NO.</li>
    <li> I really like how this gel feels on my skin. Right  when i received it i applied it to some of my acne, and they healed perfectly with no scars! Which is great because they usually leave scars. I love all the ingredients in this bottle, especially gotukola. It is so hard to find yet contains so many great properties fpr skin renewal. I will be getting a mole removed soon and will be trying this gel on it and will post pics of the results! These are my honest opinions on thi product i got to review.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have many scars and I could see an reduction in visibility of the scars very quickly.  I have tried several products that would reduce the visibility of my scars and this product, by far, is the best!</li>
    <li> Six weeks ago I had spinal surgery on my neck.  The scar is almost gone.  I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
    <li> Helped lighten my scar</li>
    <li> Even before I received the products the founder sent me an email guiding me how to use the product effectively. If this is not perfect customer handling then I don&#x27;t know what is. I really urge every business owner to have such ideal work ethics...amazing honesty and sincerity in making sure their products actially do well. Love it!!! 10 on 10 :)</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from adult acne and the ugly scars it leaves on my high pigmented skin, Im no friend of scars. This product contain a great list of natural brighteners and skin friendly ingredients. The product comes in a pump bottle which allowed me to control the amount I would like to use. A few things caught my interest, the first was that I could smell the green tea before I opened the cap. I love the smell of green tea and the earthiness of the scent. Second, do not be turned off by the color of the product. Because it is made of kelp and green tea, I was not expecting it to me the greenish color but it made sense. Third, I was trying to determine it this was a Gel or a Cream. I would say that it looks and acts like both so I could not determine. It looked like a gel and once applied it would go on the skin as a gel but it absorbed like a creamy lotion would. Most gels leave a sticky residue but this did not. I will continue to use it twice daily on different areas of the body to notice which areas fade the quickest. This item was purchased with a discounted code and this is my experience using the scar gel cream.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the result after using it for almost 2 months. The scar on my face have been with me for more than years, after using the product for 2 months, i am really happy that the scar become clearer and not as dim as before.&lt;br /&gt;And i received the offer for a free top up as well, i am using it twice daily and would recommend it to help clearing up on scar.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get enough of this scar gel. I  addicted to it. I need to buy more!  I wish I could get a larger bottle of it!;)</li>
    <li> I have a few rather embarrassing visible scars. This gel worked really well to reduce them. They haven&#x27;t disappeared completely (at least not yet) but they are way less noticable. I was impressed with the performance of Instanaturals Scar Gel. I will continue use to see if it will completely erase the scar. I&#x27;m hopeful! I am happy to recieve this item to review.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my scar on my arm has changed a little. I have used this product for a week now and the scar seems to have faded a little. Thanks for letting me try out this item!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It didn&#x27;t make my scars completely disappear but it definitely made them less noticeable. I was surprised by the color of the product, I was expecting a clear gel but it&#x27;s a brown color. So of course, I was confused, but it truly is a great product for body scars! I totally forgot to take before pictures or I would show a comparison. I love InstaNatural! *product provided for review*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on an old chicken pox scar that&#x27;s on my face. It tingles slightly when I use it. Nothing alarming. All their ingredients are natural. I do think that their pump could use some work. Too much pumps out. I just open the bottle, and use a q-tip to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Insta Natural products are made in the USA. They are not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> This scar gel works pretty good. I have a scar on my arm that has been there for a few years from a curling iron (imagine that). I have been using this and have noticed a slight difference in the appearance of the scar. This soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue behind. It&#x27;s a strange color so at first I was concerned that it would leave a weird color on my skin but it soaks in so well and doesn&#x27;t leave any evidence of it behind. It has a slight scent but nothing too over-powering and it fades quickly. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll need more time to give a full review, but so far so good. I have a dark scar on the side of my left knee and it looks horrible. I started using the scar gel immediately and within a few days it seemed like the gel was working. My scar felt smoother. It did not seem to be healing or fading, but the smoothness was very noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure if that would have happened anyway, but I&#x27;ll credit the scar gel.</li>
    <li> This scar gel claimed good for old and new scars. I have attached my before and after images. I planned to use this to lighten the acne scar on the left, the picture tells the result. I used this product as directed twice a day only on the spot.(upper left of the photo) I also wear sunscreen everyday to protect the scars from uv light.I did not apply to other part because they are new and just healed. I would not even worry about those scars because the damage to skin is not as bad as the upper left one.  After about a month, the gel seems changed its consistency, the texture looks like squashed apple.  I think this product is over rated. In my case, I honestly think it didn&#x27;t help me alot on scar removing. You decide if this worth a try from my case. The customer service of this company is good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product to be honest. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few scars over the years and I never thought anything would lighten them, much less take them away, but this stuff is WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;A few of my scars I have to actually look carefully to see, and the others have faded and are well on their way to being gone. I have already ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> GOOD TO HELP MY BOYS&#x27;S BACK.  MY BOY GROWTH TOO FAST.  HIS BACK HAS MARK.  I USE THIS INSTANATURAL SCAR GEL CREAM FOR HIS BACK. HELP A LOT.  THANKS. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural Scar Gel is for both old and new scars. I tried it out on a scar my son recently acquired on his wrist from surgery. I decided to put it to the test and try it on some of my stretch marks as well. My youngest is 11 years old, so, the scars are pretty old.&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing I noticed upon receiving my package is the packaging. I really like it. It is a fl oz container that fits neatly into my purse. The lid fits tight and would not come loose easily. It has a pump so you do not take too much, and the pump works well. It also clearly states the ingredients, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;  You use this product twice daily. Be sure only to use one pump at first, because it spreads very nicely. It smells a little different. Earthy. Not good or bad, just different. It comes out in a greenish brown paste and feels a little gritty. It does blend nicely into the skin without any noticeable residue.&lt;br /&gt;  As for results? After just a week of use, I do notice a slight lightening of my stretch marks. This is wonderful. I really did not know if my old scar tissue could be repaired. As for my son&#x27;s scar, it may take more time to notice a difference. His scar is pretty large and fresh, so, I am playing the wait and watch game.&lt;br /&gt;  With my almost instant results, I have high hopes that we will see a difference over time.</li>
    <li> The service is very nice and the product is nice too , soft texture with some herbal flavor.</li>
    <li> My concerns are mainly related to skin sensitivities and the possibility of staining due to the color. This gel smells lightly of something that comes from the sea.  I find it interesting but a little odd at the same time.  I can&#x27;t get used to it.  It also seems to make the scar on my shoulder itchy, particularly with repeated use.  I suspect I am simply sensitive to one of the ingredients.  In addition, I would not put it on under a white shirt as it is dark in color and could stain the shirt.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t improved the appearance of any scars. Disappointed in the product. Not worth the $25 I payed I wouldn&#x27;t even pay $5 for this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the scar gel for about one month now.  It worked wonderfully on a new cut and a popped blister.  I started using the gel after a scab formed and used as instructed twice a day.  There was no scarring at all!  I also tried using on a pimple that had burst and would normally leave a scar.  I used twice daily and there still seems to be some discoloration in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied to a couple of older scars and I have not noticed a noticeable difference in the scars.  The instructions that are sent via email say you may need to use for a couple of months to see a difference.  I will continue to use for another month and see if there is any difference.  I will update on what happens.</li>
    <li> Probably too early to tell(only been using this for about a week) but it goes on nicely so I will give this a four.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon but this product has compelled me to do so.  I had a nasty scar on my lip from a hockey stick to the face and I really hated how it made it look like I had a permanent cold sore so I tried this product.  It&#x27;s only been a week and the scar has almost completely faded.  Now am going to use for the other various scars on my body accumulated over the years.  5/5</li>
    <li> I love using this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that its very runny and does not have much of a gel texture at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a scar I&#x27;ve had since childhood (I&#x27;m 30) for almost 3 weeks. It has lessened the appearance of the scar and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of trying out the InstaNatural Scar Gel Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for reviewing purposes and have used it for two weeks time. In the two weeks time I have used the gel on my 3 keloid scars on my stomach. I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;-The cream is very smooth, I&#x27;d be tempted to apply it to my heals or elbows with how easily it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;- I only use a little dot and it goes over all 3 scars.&lt;br /&gt;- My scars are softer&lt;br /&gt;-One scar has responded very well to the treatment and is not very visible, another one I have noticed minor improvement including slight skin tone change and the third scar I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible change just yet.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the results but I feel it&#x27;s just such a short time that I can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> I decided to put this scar gel to the test!! I&#x27;ve been applying it on a stretch mark for a couple weeks now. And I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s already lightened it some!! I was a little surprised by the color of it (light brown), but it goes on nicely, just don&#x27;t squirt too much out at once because a little does go a long way with this product. Very lightweight and dries fast!</li>
    <li> It took some time to see results. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks now, and although there isn&#x27;t a significant change, I can see it works little at a time. I have a couple of scars on my legs that I tested this on and I can tell that it&#x27;s not as dark as it used to be. The pigmentation of the scar is starting to even out with the color of my skin and gradually dissipate. I like his scar gel because it contains no harmful parabens, sulfates or alcohols. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, residue feeling. Purchasing this at a promotional price has been beneficial and I believe with continues use, I will see a big difference.</li>
    <li> my son had a little accident and really scraped up his knees awhile ago, One especially didn&#x27;t really heal right, so I thought this would be good for him to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been putting this on it for a couple of weeks and he said it really is helping. It does seem to be diminishing the scar(s). He says it doesn&#x27;t have a scent really, and you only need a little at a time. I would recommend this product. I received for review and this is my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Not as big as you might think about the tall as a soda can a lot thinner Better be as good as amazon claims 2nd time this week I received item a lot smaller then it appeares on display pictures</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but it has improved my spots on my legs. I will probably get some more before summer to improve my legs.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any major scar improvement but there have been some small changes. this does have a funky scent.</li>
    <li> Holy moly!! Even with the abundance of five-star reviews, I was a little skeptical using this for my substantial amount and severity of scars, some of which have been there for 4+ years. But only after a few days of using it as instructed, I am ALREADY seeing a huge difference. Some of the scars are noticeably softening, while one on my right upper arm has nearly completely faded from it&#x27;s former fleshy red color of 3 years. This is crazy!! I can hardly believe it. Will definitely be keeping this on stock and recommending it to everyone I know who has scars they&#x27;d rather not have. I will post an update as soon as there is another big milestone with the healing of my scars!!</li>
    <li> not getting rid of my red mark scars from a grease burn.</li>
    <li> Yiraseo still in use around the effects do not know , but the capacity is too small. The wide stretch areas quickly</li>
    <li> I rarely write a negative review, but this product did nothing to  improve the looks of a small, recent scar.  I started using it within a week of it healing enough that it would be okay to use.  I followed the directions carefully, and after 4 weeks, and then 6 weeks, there was no improvement. I was very disappointed.  I can&#x27;t imagine that it would work on an old scar any better. I am now using another product and hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural; Advanced Repair Scar Gel, for Old and New Scars Review&lt;br /&gt;**Note: I was given a sample of this product to try and requested to write a review of the product. **&lt;br /&gt;Instructions:  Wash hands thoroughly first.  Apply thin layer of gel to the target area (scar).  Use twice daily until scar softens in color to appear flat and white without redness.  Amount of time of use will vary depending on age and severity of scar.&lt;br /&gt;Ok first of; “Amount of time of use will vary depending on age and severity of scar.”  This open time frame is typical with medical type treatments but in my opinion, still not acceptable.  I understand everyone is different but you should be able to give some general time frame to start seeing results, such as 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I used this product on two different scars.  The first scar is about 9-10 years old and the other is only about two (2) years old.&lt;br /&gt;I noted when I applied the product that it went on easy and only took a few minutes to dry so no issues there.  The product is a brownish color gel that is not overly fragrant or sticky and dries clear and cleanly.  I applied it in the morning after showering and at night prior to bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed reviews on this product.  I did note a difference in the color and texture in the younger scar after using the product for about three (3) weeks.  The scar color changed from a maroon-red color to a lighter pink color.  In addition, the scar appeared to flatten out slightly going from a sharp raised ridge to a slightly smoother line.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have the same results on the older scar.  I did not notice any change in the older scar at all.  I should note that the older scar is much larger and has already settled over time and vitamin treatment to a lighter, flatter pink color, though it is still obviously discolored compared to the skin around it.&lt;br /&gt;So for newer scars, I would say give it a try.  As for much older scars, I would say to make peacewith them, because I did not see any noticeable results in the time I was given to complete this review.</li>
    <li> The company has wonderful customer service and the product was just as described.  Even though the bottle is small, a little goes a long, long way.  Also, be careful not to apply too much pressure when using because a lot of product comes out very easily.</li>
    <li> We are privileged to experience one of the promising product from Natural Products Inc.  As part of their promotion, they provided us a complimentary product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Scar Gel contains a potent blend of ingredients designed to help diminish the appearance of scars.  This includes Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) – a naturally occurring protein – which stimulates the healing process. According to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, &amp;#34;Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor (EGFR) play an essential role in wound healing through stimulating epidermal and dermal regeneration. The development of new therapies for enhancing wound healing has included the use of EGF. In addition, EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) have become a therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer. Thus, therapies targeting EGF/EGFR are useful for the treatment of both cutaneous wounds and cancer.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also formulated with Gotu Kola which aids in restoring healthy skin, while Green Tea, Fucoxanthin, Astaxanthin and Sea Kelp fortify the skin with antioxidants to minimize external damage. Your skin will be unconditionally moisturized as the visibilities of scars are reduced, resulting a healthier, more uniform appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am applying Scar Gel in the scar cause by burn in my tummy.  I am anticipating that after I used the whole bottle, it will diminish the appearance of scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, the Key Ingredients of Scar Gel are:&lt;br /&gt;+ Epidermal Growth Factor&lt;br /&gt;+ Sea Kelp Bioferment&lt;br /&gt;+ Fucoxanthin&lt;br /&gt;+ Astaxanthin&lt;br /&gt;+ Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;+ Gotu Kola</li>
    <li> First impressions&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t think this gel would work on my most worse scare..&lt;br /&gt;But, I had to give it a try. The bottle it comes in was nice and the label was easy to read and understand. The smell was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✓Key Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;☑  Epidermal Growth Factor&lt;br /&gt;☑ Sea Kelp Bioferment&lt;br /&gt;☑ Fucoxanthin&lt;br /&gt;☑ Astaxanthin&lt;br /&gt;☑ Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;☑ Gotu Kola&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big change..&lt;br /&gt;The scare has faded a bit and it looks less like a cut and more like a burn&lt;br /&gt;(I know that doesn&#x27;t sound any better.. but trust me it is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking to fade away scares.</li>
    <li> This scar cream is great. It has helped to reduce the coloring of the scar on my arm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with every InstaNatural product that I&#x27;ve tried. The Gel Scar Cream is no exception. The consistency of it reminds me of a skin brightening serum that I have: transparent and kind of watery with little beads that disappear quickly. Since it is a gel, it has a sort of cooling effect as it is applied. There is a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;d describe as unpleasant. Plus it soaks into the skin and goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for around two weeks on a decade old scar on my shin... so far it appears to be fading, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s just wishful thinking or if it is actually working wonders.</li>
    <li> Has not darkened a burn scar in the few weeks that I have been using it. Maybe it takes longer?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always excited to try InstaNatural products as I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with everything. I have many scars on my body from when I was growing up and there was a point where I almost paid hundreds of dollars for laser scar removal procedures. I tried this scar gel cream for three weeks on my leg and was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. While the scars are still there, they are a lot less visible. The scars were very thick to begin with so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. I have also been using this on some acne scars I had on my arms and face. Those scars are almost completely gone! This stuff has allowed me to be more confident with parts of my body that I always hid due to so many scars. The gel cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling afterwards. I am very happy with yet another InstaNatural product. *sample provided for review and testing*</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all. I put it on my scars and when I got up the next day, my skin was brown. I contacted the seller and they were wonderful and gave me a refund</li>
    <li> I carefully read a lot of ratings on SCAR GEL and I was impressed with what I read.  I ordered it and I paid full price for this product.  I even expedited  the shipping, believing that I was going to see a terrific improvement on my (then) 5 week old scar.  Well... to no avail.  I have not seen any visible/notable improvement...and I have been using it for over 3 weeks.  I followed the application instructions... the gel was quite &amp;#34;runny and liquidy&amp;#34;.  Maybe it works on others but It definitely did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this on a few small scars (cuts and burns).  I have noticed an improvement in about a week.</li>
    <li> Does not feel sticky and it absorbs quickly. I have a few old scars from a dog bite and since I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long I really haven&#x27;t noticed a change, so I will update in the future. Love that it is a natural product!</li>
