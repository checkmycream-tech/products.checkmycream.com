<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful color. You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s the ELF brand compared to the Ben Nye Banana Powder.</li>
    <li> I bought this after the rave reviews and I was very impressed.  It didn&#x27;t leave this ghostly white look on my face as the first version of this HD powder had.  I like it so much I ordered for my sister too and then stocked up a bit.  It&#x27;s every bit as good as it is described to be.  It offers great natural coverage and no more of that &amp;#34;ghostly white look.&amp;#34;  Yeah!!!</li>
    <li> Only used once however liked the way it went on.  I use it after I put my concealer on.  (put my concealer over my foundation)  Liked the looked as this is finely milled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery good, packaging good!</li>
    <li> This is a basic powder that keeps my liquid foundation in place. I have dark caramel-toned skin and prefer yellow-toned powders over white, this is good but can make me look ghostly if I just apply even a bit too much. If I wear makeup for more than 5 hours I have to reapply on my t-zone, just because I get oily there. One complaint about the packaging - I use a powder brush instead of the included puff, its hard to keep clean and often results in heavier application then I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Better than banana powder and affordable. I personally love Eyes lips and Face. I think this is one of their best products, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. Just remember a little goes a long way. This is one of  those products you could honestly have for 6-12 months depending on use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in this stuff. You have to fight to make sure you put it on lightly or you&#x27;ll look like you have a yellow jaundice.  Then, I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between it or regular powder.  Might as well use the brown powders to reduce shine instead of fighting with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great - just as good as high price brands.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> just as good as higher end powders</li>
    <li> I really like this powder so far and I love the sturdy case the locks closed as I travel a lot.</li>
    <li> I love it! I set my concealer with it ( bye bye concealer) it looks nice &amp; does not settle into the fine lines.. I wish it were a little more fine, but it works</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but is too solid yellow, even when using a light hand. Love the HD translucent powder though :)</li>
    <li> Works great for setting concealer and highlights. As many reviewers said, the packaging isn&#x27;t so great but wonderful product for the price. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am a female dermatologist.  Unlike many of my colleagues, rather than trying to sell expensive products and procedures to my patients I try to help them ferret out what&#x27;s real in the murky world of cosmetics and how best to spend their money.  It is well known that green and yellow cancel out red whereas violet cancels out yellow.  Many of my patients are trying to cover red pimples and generalized redness from rosacea and I prefer yellow over green for this.  My partner sells yellow Glo Minerals powder for covering up generalized redness and I really like it but wondered if a lower cost item might do the same so I tried this one.  The texture is of this powder is not good.  It doesn&#x27;t go on easily and stay in place compared to the Glo Minerals.  I can&#x27;t say that about all the e.l.f. products but I&#x27;ll probably not explore this brand in the future and wouldn&#x27;t have high hopes for the other shades of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pimples, I still recommend the inexpensive Maybelline yellow cover up stick you can buy locally or on Amazon.  In the stores in my area it&#x27;s usually on the lowest shelf among the Maybelline products and is inexpensive, looks like a tube of yellow lipstick.  You dot a bit on red pimples first then put on your regular makeup and blend.  Or you can use it alone and blend.  For generalized redness I recommend a powder over a cream since it&#x27;s easier to put on a large area.  Even men can use this without feeling they are \\&quot;putting on makeup.\\&quot;  I like the Glo Minerals brand and haven&#x27;t yet found a less expensive substitute.</li>
    <li> Very yellow but it give good effect under the eye</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! If you have yellow toned skin this will be perfect for you! amazing!</li>
    <li> I love loose powder because I think it makes a nicer finish than pressed powder.  I&#x27;ve always used flesh-toned products until I bought this, which I purchased in yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try yellow because I have rosacea, which you can see like a ring around my neck in my profile picture.  My cheeks and nose are completely covered with it.  Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have the cystic form, but there&#x27;s not enough concealer in the world to cover it.  I look for foundations and powders that have a yellowish tone to make my complexion appear more even, but never tried a yellow powder before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was awestruck, gobsmacked, and utterly confounded when I first applied this powder.  It did not turn my blush orange as I was afraid it might.  No, it&#x27;s impossible to tell I&#x27;m wearing a yellow-colored powder.  In fact, it&#x27;s hard to tell I&#x27;m wearing powder at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my foundation first, then powder, using a powder brush.  Then I do eyes, cheeks, and lips.  I can see this powder on my skin when I apply it, but by the time I finish the rest of my makeup, I just can&#x27;t see it.  It seems to vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It minimizes the appearance of pores, evens skin tone, and sets foundation better than any powder I&#x27;ve ever used.  The package says the yellow has shimmer, but it absolutely does not.  The finish is matte, but not chalky.  Incredibly, it even makes it look like I&#x27;m wearing less foundation than I am.  Actually, I&#x27;m using a little less foundation because of this powder, because I prefer a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this on my vanity, a flat, level surface.  Before I apply it, I shake the container gently from side to side.  Never up-and-down, because that will fluff the powder and it will float out all over the place when I open the container.  A little side to side shake pushes a bit through the screen, and only a bit is necessary.  I don&#x27;t have problems with loose powder messes because I always do this.  If at first a mess is unavoidable, I simply shake a bit of the powder into the trash can.  It may seem like a waste, but it&#x27;s when the container is full that powder explosions are most likely to happen.  It&#x27;s easier to dump a little bit than struggle with what&#x27;s going to get wasted through spillage, anyway, plus it saves time if you don&#x27;t have to clean up a mess.  I haven&#x27;t had a mess problem with this powder; just thought I&#x27;d throw that out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product amazing, with a price to match.  Therefore, I&#x27;m giving it the HB stamp of Best Buys on Amazon.shake a bit of the powder into the trash can.

    <li> I was hoping that this was a dupe for the Ben Nye banana powder.  No luck.  Ben Nye&#x27;s version is a little peachier in color and helps to add a healthy-looking glow to my skin.  This one went on a bit fluorescent (scared the #$%@ out of me when I first applied it), but blended out like the white e.l.f. HD powder with perhaps a bit more of a yellow base.  Ben Nye is still the best, but if you are still wanting to get e.l.f., the white version seems to disappear into the skin faster &amp; with less effort.  I will use my box of this fluorescent yellow stuff as an additive to my liquid foundation.  I get really lazy sometimes and just mix the 2 together (sometimes even with my moisturizer and sunscreen! gasp!) and apply it all at once so that it sets up a bit like a powder foundation.  It seems to work OK in changing the texture of the liquid foundation without really giving a yellow cast to my skin.</li>
    <li> This powder is great, but for me, it&#x27;s not something that I wear everyday.  I like using it for dressier occasions when I take my time putting my makeup on.  On normal days, I hurry while doing my makeup, and since this powder is a finishing powder, I most always skip it.  Love it, but don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The HD powder I purchased was in &amp;#34;Corrective Yellow&amp;#34; and is a light yellow in appearance. While I was initially off-put by how yellow it was and concerned that it would make my skin look yellow and not &amp;#34;corrected,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s actually quite useful as someone with an olive-toned complexion. I use the powder over any liquid foundation/BB cream that is more cool-toned or pinkish to make it look like I&#x27;m not wearing anything. The powder blends very well and feels soft and velvety on my skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many HD powders but I saw this one used in several makeup tutorials so I decided to take a chance. It looks really great on and helps smooth out your complexion. Sometimes i&#x27;ll just put this over my face instead of any foundation for a natural looking glow.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Ben Nye Luxury Powder Banana alternative. This was not it. It is much more like a highlighter yellow. It blends super well. But, this is more of a finishing and setting powder similar to the Make Up Forever HD Powder. This will give you the ghostly white look with flash photography. For only 6 dollars, I will keep it but go for the ben nye if that is what you are looking for. It is only a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> Works but stars to crack after awhile. Ben nye is better</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little bit more coverage, but its buildable. I feel like this is comparable to the Ben Nye Banana powder. All in all, I like it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I expected more to be in the container because it is so big but they give u a fair amount I guess for the price. Really smooth highly pigmented powder, the silica in it really helps to control oil. Actually silica powder is what makeup forever he finishing powder is so its great. All I have to say is it&#x27;s very yellow and although I have very red skin it does leave a somewhat yellow finish on my skin so a colors powder over it would work well</li>
    <li> love it!! it&#x27;s very yellow but if you like that bright undereye than this is the product for you! plus I got the 2 day Shipping and it shipped very quickly!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> I use it as setting powder not for redness as it would have to build up so much to cover redness and I don&#x27;t like how it feels on when built up.</li>
    <li> The only con is that its a loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, I have oily skin so it keeps my face matte for most of the day. I use it for under my eyes and it does its job. Also gives me more coverage on the concealer I were under the powder</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HERE IS FOR LIGHT PEOPLE LIGHT TO MEDIUM ,IT IS A YELLOW COLOR NOT NOTHING LIKE BEN NYE , BEN NYE I HAVE TO STAY WITH .AND DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE IT&#x27;S AT TARGET</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the appeal of this is. It gave me a jaundice sick look like a cheap, old-timey hooker. The powder sat on top of my skin regardless of the brush or poof that I used. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> VERY FINE yellow powder from China. I used it and liked it, but got very uncomfortable using it because it is such a fine powder that you cannot avoid inhaling when using on the face. I hear about so many recalls from China regarding unsafe things that they make that I decided to throw it in the trash. It is not worth the risk. I have always used Clinique yellow powder that is not as fine as this (made in the USA) and thought that I would cheap out and try this - too creepy! Not worth risking my health/lungs!</li>
    <li> This has the same micro fine texture as the banana powder, but is actually yellow. The color minimally color corrects your skin issues. You will achieve a matte like finish and this doesn&#x27;t cause wrinkles to become more apparent on mature skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this powder provides a gorgeous finish (at least for me it did).  I usually use MUFE finishing powder and love how it smooths everything out.  I can&#x27;t compare it to Ben Nye&#x27;s banana powder as I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but e.l.f.&#x27;s product worked for me.</li>
    <li> Does not blend in with foundation just makes skin look dusty. Very dissapointed as I was told this is a dupe for a high end HD powder. Looks horrible.</li>
    <li> Good dupe for Ben Nye banana powder. I use this for setting my under eye concealer, nose, and my chin. It really helps with highlighting.</li>
    <li> Great powder and great price!</li>
    <li> Evens out skin tone and blends makeup well. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or wipe off on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> Its good for setting concealer but its little Product so I wouldnt used it in all my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yellow gives a good tone to the under eye.</li>
    <li> Received the item within the date I was told I would receive it. Didn&#x27;t really like the way it made my skin look.</li>
    <li> Great product. It makes my undereyes smoother, helps set my undereye concealer and keeps it from smudging and creasing for a good amount of the day. Also doesn&#x27;t take away from the actual brightening of the concealer.</li>
    <li> This powder corrects the tone of my skin and makeup.  Very fine powder, and I love the texture.  Fast delivery, great price.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes. I wanted to use it for setting under-eye makeup, for dark circles. But it does something strange to that area, and that area only. It wants to dry up and make little hard to remove flakes, under my eyes. I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. My under-eye area is by no means dry or needing exfoliation. It even happens if there&#x27;s moisturizer applied there.  Not to mention the &amp;#34;corrective yellow&amp;#34; corrects nothing. As a setting powder everywhere else, it&#x27;s fine...not great but not bad. It&#x27;s alright in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Great powder.&lt;br /&gt;The Corrective Yellow compares to NYX Color Correcting Powder in Banana.&lt;br /&gt;The Translucent one compares to NYX Studio Finishing Powder Translucent Finish as well as NARS Light-Reflecting Loose Setting Powder.  But this one is cheaper than both the NYX and NARS and so far I have found it works just as well, and they have mostly the same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***PROS***&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very finely milled.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Great price.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Not cakey, very soft /silky powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***CONS***&lt;br /&gt;1.  Jar seems to be not very full compared to the size of the jar and the size of the space below the plastic strainer thing, it&#x27;s only about half full, maybe less - see pics.  I tried to give an idea of how much product is in it -- the metal loop I used was touching the bottom in the second picture.&lt;br /&gt;2. It would be nice if there was a plastic disk to separate the open holes of the strainer and the powder puff when you&#x27;re not using it, so the powder doesn&#x27;t leak out on the face puff.  Because I don&#x27;t find it practical to keep the sticky tape covering the holes there permanently but there is no separate compartment for the face puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely purchase this again as I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Corrective Yellow*&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Mica, Silica, Sodium Dehydroacetate May Contain: Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Manganese Violet (CI 77742), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Yellow 5 Lake (CI 19140)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Translucent*&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I recently combined all of the white/translucent powder to the yellow one and after putting the strainer back on - it still was only about 2/3 full below the strainer.  They could definitely add more product to these containers, but for the price I would still recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll likely just purchase two in the future and combine them again so it lasts longer and I don&#x27;t have to purchase as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order dateI don&#x27;t have to purchase as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>
    <li> This was half empty when I received it. used doesn&#x27;t mean use it til its last drop then sell it &amp; that&#x27;s what they did</li>
    <li> This powder is very chalky and it is difficult to blend this powder on certain areas of the face, such as, under the eyes. I could clearly see where I placed the powder on my face because it was just too difficult to blend. I loved the idea of this powder, but it unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well for me. I was hoping I had scored a cheap version of Ben Nye&#x27;s banana powder, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> extremely yellow, cheap container which is fine when your paying very little for. But not a fan of e.l.f</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this. Powder is so loose is gets everywhere and it does not even show up on skin, it is too sheer. Wish I didn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> This works great for me! Covers red and reduces oil. I love it.</li>
    <li> Wayyy too much product always comes out, perhaps this is why I never could get it to work for my face. I have redness and hoped the yellow would even me out, but it did nothing for my redness and made the rest of my face look ashy. I don&#x27;t think this is supposed to help with oil at all, but in case you are wondering, it does nothing to control oil.</li>
    <li> E.l.f. products are generally a good value for the money!</li>
    <li> Great highlight powder to set your concealer. Suppose to be a dupe for Ben Nye Banana Powder (which I don&#x27;t own but seen reviews). If this is not applied correctly (with a moist beauty blender sponge) then it can come off ghostly especially in pictures. Other than that, good job ELF!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK, spend a little more and get Ben Nye Banana Powder. Much better finish and you aren&#x27;t getting ripped off.</li>
    <li> I got this in the shade Corrective Yellow, to hidden my dark under eye circle. I was so excited to see that my package came in a day early! It is so nice under the eyes. Doesn&#x27;t crease, or settle in my fine lines. This is such a nice dupe for the Ben Nye Banana powder (Much cheaper too! 28ish dollars vs 6!) BUT the packaging horrible :( I opened it a second time and the product was all over the top rip. If I turned it on its side product would come out. Since I now found my holy grail under eye powder I decided to put the powder in a small salad dressing container (Found one just laying in my house!). Overall, great seller, amazing product, bad packaging! Hopefully ELF will change it in the future!</li>
    <li> But it is totally comedigenic and suitable only for ocassional wear, i.e. photos, dates or just enjoying the fact its not pink for everyone who is ...not pink. At last a good color, too bad the qualiy sucks.</li>
    <li> I love elf HD loose powder but the yellow one does not blend in!</li>
    <li> This powder rocks! I have been using Makeup For Ever HD powder for years and I finally decided to try this because it&#x27;s less than half the price. I am truly amazed how well the E.L.F. powder works! I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this E.L.F powder and Makeup For Ever. I use the yellow correcting powder and it&#x27;s amazing. Don&#x27;t be fearful of the neon yellow color - it disappears instantly and counteracts redness. The yellow is so much more natural than the translucent shade and you avoid telltale ghostly white powder marks. Try this, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the first yellow powder I&#x27;ve used, and am pleasantly surprised by this product. I normally use more expensive products, but I think for the price of this it&#x27;s pretty good. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest applying to entire face for darker skin tones, but it&#x27;ll still work really well as an under eye concealer/highlighter.</li>
    <li> i love e.l.f. products! i am south-asian, and my skin color is in the m.a.c nc 40-42 range. i previously used e.l.f.&#x27;s white hd powder (only type available at stores like target, walmart), and it would make me look slightly ghost-y. however i have very oily skin so after 30 minutes or so, it DID blend in seamlessly. so you can still use the white HD powder, provided you have very oily skin and can wait 30 minutes to de-ghost. ***on a sidenote: if you have very oily skin, i suggest you go a shade lighter with face powders and foundations, and try to go for yellow-tones. even if you get a perfect match at the store, within an hour the oils in your skin will darken it to something like an odd orange tone.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t find the corrective yellow hd powder in stores anywhere. so i finally decided to order the corrective yellow hd powder online (through amazon, but you can also go to the e.l.f. site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the corrective yellow hd powder IMMEDIATELY blends in seamlessly and invisibly (no oily skin or 30 minute wait time required). i LOVE this product and it is now a permanent item in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly highly recommend this for all black skin tones, brown south-, southwest, southeast asian skin tones, even darker olive mediterranean skin tones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not surprise that I love this powder! Elf comestics are amazing. I just love that this yellow podwer leaves a glow on your face!</li>
    <li> nice product for your t zone especially when contouring (use on lighter contour). product is a little messy tho, as soon as the top opens powder comes out</li>
    <li> This yellow powder is my holy grail! Keeps my t-zone matte and eliminates the mild redness in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s definitely worth triple what you will pay for it. It&#x27;s a steal!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product is sooo little in amount.</li>
    <li> My first time using yellow powder so I can&#x27;t compare it to the other brand.  But I have no complaint with this one.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward using it, but unfortunately it looks so ashy and powdery, but i&#x27;ll try using it different ways .</li>
    <li> IT DIDNT COVER UP TRIED IT UNDER MY EYES AFTER FOUNDATION AND CONCEALER AND SAW NO DIFFERENCE , ITS MESSY NO MATTER HOW TIGHT I CLOSE THIS IT ALWAYS COMES OUT AND GETS MESSY.. AND WHEN YOU OPEN IT ITS EVEN WORST!... IM GLAD I DIDNT PAY MUCH FOR THIS .. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> After peels and retin A I needed something to tone down the red on my face. This works well when mixed with a bit of powder makeup. Bought one for my mom and she likes it too1</li>
    <li> This powder billows through the air like a cloud of smoke every time its lid is opened, cough cough. Can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s good for the lungs.</li>
    <li> Not a substitution for banana powder!</li>
    <li> it gives you a great finish that last all day</li>
    <li> I really like using this, I bought it to use over my bb cream, (skin 79 gold), and it works really well, but between the 2, if you are not pale, (not like a vampire pale, just not tanned), then you will need to also use a bronzer or mabey even a powder (which you could use the powder under, and this on top, which I have done and I loved that, it looked really well), you can use this on bare skin as well, after moisterizering or whatever, and it works pretty good, just to give a little glow, but not to much, and a little matte look, but again not to much, just more of a natural no makeup look, if used over a powder if gives a barely any makeup look, which I like if im not going out or just doing some errands or am just around the house ect, so this is a great product to have... I do recommend this and will get more when I run out, but it only takes a very little bit ( I use a brush and sometimes the poof that comes with, either works well, your choice), but this will last a very long time, since a little goes a very long way, another plus! and its a great value, and compared with the more expensive products, it does the exact same thing, I cant tell the difference at all, so I will stick with this one, it doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin either, yet another plus, as is the price! this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I am NC44 in MAC Foundation. I bought this powder to set my concealer and thought it would be similar to Ben Nye banana powder. The powder is very fine and has a nice texture, however it has an unnatural finish. The color leaves an ashy appearance to the face and I have to put regular face powder on top to conceal it. It does set my concealer nicely with no creases, just wish it was more compatible for caramel skin tones.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the youtube reviews.  I must say that I have been pleasantly pleased with the results.  It keeps shine at bay and has a gorgeously translucent finish.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent setting powder. Love it</li>
    <li> It works great and doesn&#x27;t aggravate skin. It makes me look like someone has activated the &amp;#34;Beauty&amp;#34; settings in real life! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> it comes off on brown skin(black) as a white ashy cast. Nothing like banana power.</li>
    <li> This powder is definitely yellow! Be careful with it...use sparingly or you&#x27;ll be buffing it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed that a product at this price point can compete with the department store brands but it does. I can&#x27;t tell the difference. I&#x27;ve been using yellow based makeup products for years as they are more natural looking on your face but I&#x27;ve been shelling out big bucks for them. This stuff is twice the size of the department store brand at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve used several e.l.f. Products lately, including their brushes, and they are top quality. If they would just come out with a cream foundation I&#x27;d be a total convert!  At this price it&#x27;s sure worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mature woman with normal to dry skin and very few wrinkles so if it works for me it should work for anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in translucent for years. I have acne prone oily skin. After a couple of hours in the Texas heat, my face looks wet. It doesn&#x27;t make my face stay matte but it maintains a dewy, natural finish when I would otherwise look greasy. I just purchased this in Corrective Yellow for the first time because it&#x27;s not sold in stores and I have to say that it is a lot more yellow than the picture depicts. It is a dark and bright yellow. The good news is that you can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s a dark, bright yellow when you apply it. My skin has yellow undertones and it&#x27;s hard to find foundation shades that are yellow enough for me. This helps add the slightest bit of tinge that my skin needs for a natural looking finish.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on my face. It is very fly away and rests in my eyebrows so they look yellow.  The shade is an unnatural yellow so it looks odd when it does stay on your cheeks. I bought two so I am very disappointed. On the plus side, they give you a lot in the container, more than other powders.</li>
    <li> I add it to other e.l.f. Studio High Definition Powder to reduce the pink tent. This product works good for my skin type.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing! So light!</li>
    <li> Light powder.  Does the job and stays all day.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Gave me a nice soft focus glow! Elf products are so good and inexpensive, will be buying more of this</li>
    <li> I like it okay, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d order again.  Doesn&#x27;t keep shine away in t-zone.  I don&#x27;t see any major difference in pores or lines.  If I need a translucent powder, I&#x27;d rather it be yellow, though.</li>
    <li> the color is VERY yellow. the product is nice, but the color is kind of unnatural</li>
    <li> good powder. I use it to set my undereye concealer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and presentation. The package protect it very well. I would love to buy a second one. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Good product, leaves skin matte and does not alter the base color. Great for when you want to look natural</li>
    <li> Great prowder for the price.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what the result was supposed to be from this but there&#x27;s no difference with it. Maybe I&#x27;m applying wrong? Open to suggestions!</li>
    <li> Was going to buy ben nye powder but decided to try this add on and I am very happy with it. Nice matte finish and just enough yellow hue where it brightens !</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectation container did not have much powder in it.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! I have yellow-toned tan skin, so I wanted to get the yellow powder instead of the white because I thought it would blend better with my tone. No ashy look - success! I tap a little of the powder into the lid (probably less than a quarter teaspoon), swirl with a brush, and apply all over my face. I use this over bare skin when casual, and over BB cream/foundation when I&#x27;m getting more dressed up. The results are unbelievable - it&#x27;s like real-life airbrushing. It smooths out my skin with a &#x27;blurring&#x27; effect, evens/brightens the tone, and even minimizes wrinkles! Hard to describe until you see it in person. Lasts me all day. Lots of product, and great value. I&#x27;m not a fan of sifter tubs because they can get messy, but this does not diminish how much I enjoy using this product. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
    <li> Like Ben Nye, works on me.</li>
    <li> havent really had a chance to use the powder alot but from what ive used so far it seems to be a good purchase</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be similar to benefits former Bluff dust.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not.  I found that it sat on top of my skin and looked very obvious.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my technique?  For the price I suppose it&#x27;s not too bad, but I was really hoping for something just a tad better.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try the corrective yellow powder from elf because i liked the HD version. This does great job of cutting down redness and good for blending in with blush if you realize you were to heavy handed and need to tone it down. great seller and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin a awful sickly yellowy/orange color. The powder instantly sticks to my concealer and makes it go dark. I&#x27;ve tried using a powder over my concealer first and still had not luck. Its also super messy keep the white powder puff in the container or it will have yellow powder coming out every time you put on and take off the lid. I had high hopes for this based off of reviews but it just does not look good on my skin tone - medium beige. I do like the consistency of the powder I will probably try the translucent one.</li>
    <li> I have been a long term user of MUFE&#x27;s HD setting powder, but I really wanted to find something similar for a lower price tag. This is great! I got the yellow color correcting one, and it really balances my uneven skin tone and gives me a smooth finish. My only complaint is the packaging. It is so big for the amount of product you actually get, and the lid isn&#x27;t so secure. I feel like some if the powder seeps out if you have it on its edge.</li>
    <li> I am not incredibly impressed with this Powder. HD it is not. I am in my late 30&#x27;s and wanted something to set and smooth my makeup better with the recent changes to my skin (such as larger pores and fine lines) that didn&#x27;t set into my pores or fine lines. This did both sadly. I looked more aged putting this on after all my makeup. And it gave a odd hue to my fair skin. It did not smooth much out except the non-problem areas. Their was no flawless look there.&lt;br /&gt;I used this in conjunction with the ELF Mineral Infused primer, my usual foundation and the ELF Sheer eyelid primer. All the ELF products were used for the first time and they all Looked horrible. NOT for aging faces and the Primer made me break out severely. Haven&#x27;t had that happen since I was a teen.</li>
    <li> I use corrective powder before and this one works so much better without the high price as banana powder ...hope this product keeps me happy</li>
    <li> Beautiful finish! I don&#x27;t like too much shimmer and shine so this provides just the tiniest bit to polish up and make everything look put together at the end! I&#x27;ve tried the translucent version from a friend which I loved, but they didn&#x27;t have it in stock when I came to order it. I went out on a limb and bought the yellow since I read that it looks just a little more natural anyway and of course, it does. I have medium beigey color skin, sensitive and combination.</li>
    <li> I would not repurchase this. It&#x27;s not horrible and it&#x27;s not great. It is ELF so you get what your pay for. The packaging is not durable so keep that in my when storing this.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work for fair, pinkish skin tones, but would be great for darker and olive skin.</li>
    <li> Not used it sold into a friend got my money&#x27;s worth. Win win</li>
    <li> Awesome . Works just like Ben Nye Banana powder.</li>
    <li> Good powder, crummy packaging. Powder gets into the area where the threading of the lid is while closed, thus spilling everywhere upon opening it again. Just have to handle it carefully.</li>
    <li> Nice powder!! At first you get a little freaked out by the color, but once you add this to your T-Zone it really makes a difference in pics. I&#x27;m light skinned, but have a yellow undertone and this matches my skin perfect! Good buy and cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a setting powder which means you still have to use concealer and/or foundation before you add this to your face. You also must use a setting spray after you apply this or it won&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the white HD powder for my for my skin color. I love this stuff. Sets make-up and makes things like pores look less harsh. Doesn&#x27;t look too matte. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Works very well and sets my highlight beautifully! I like that it is more yellow than the ben nye banana powder because it makes me look more golden and warm (I&#x27;m african-american, same skin tone and the woman who played &amp;#34;Mya&amp;#34; on the show &amp;#34;Girlfriends&amp;#34; lol).</li>
    <li> This is a good powder, it is very sutil and soft are a yelloweee powder!!!&lt;br /&gt;And matifiying good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it should be in an HD category, I am a makeup artist and I don&#x27;t feel it compares to something more expensive. Wanted it to help with my redness but looks chalky even blending it really well</li>
    <li> Is this powder like banana powder</li>
    <li> Happy with my product.</li>
    <li> I tried liking this. But it doesn&#x27;t set concealer/foundation any better than any other powder. And the biggest bummer is that it leaves a really dark yellow cast...even though I&#x27;m not fair and have yellow undertones. There&#x27;s just nothing HD about this either...it&#x27;s like any other powder. There are much better powders out there.</li>
</ol>
