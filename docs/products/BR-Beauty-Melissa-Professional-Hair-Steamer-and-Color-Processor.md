### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Melissa Hair Steamer is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I put it together the best way I could given the incomplete directions.</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>let me start by saying that my steamer is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in my hair care routine.  </li>
      <li>It provided a great steam and was comparable to services received in the salon.  </li>
      <li>Without having experienced it, it seemed to me like steam treatments were a passing fad.  </li>
      <li>The item arrived sooner than it was even estimated to ship (VERY happy about that)and packaged very securely &amp; safely.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>Giving 1 &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; for this product is too good. 1</li>
      <li>Good steamer.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with.</li>
      <li>The setup was very easy and I give it 5 stars for ease of use.  </li>
      <li>I bought this instead of the More popular brand; for all of the reasons that you may have heard.</li>
      <li>I am irritated because I could have saved moneyby buying the more popular one....</li>
      <li>I am sure longer</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this steamer.  </li>
      <li>What a wonderful way to deep condition your hair.</li>
      <li>In addition, the water reservoir rusted and I&#x27;m no longer able to use my steamer.  </li>
      <li>I was able to adjust the height &amp; hood to fit both me &amp; my 10yr old daughter perfectly and we tried both a bar stool and the dining room chair to test it.</li>
      <li>HEALTHY, which is most important to me and its growing to boot.....</li>
      <li>SO if thats the only thing stopping you from buying the more popular Brand(go with the more popular</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>steamer is sturdy, easy to put together, and is of salon quality.  </li>
      <li>So after going against the grain and not ordering the popular table top steamer that is advertised on many natural hair care forums, I received this one just today.</li>
      <li>so moisture is important when it comes to taking care of my hair.  </li>
      <li>but in the end i am free from the chemical relaxers.</li>
      <li>I had to remove my plastic cap, to even get comfortable results.</li>
      <li>The hood is there to trap the steam; this causes uneven at best distribution of the steam.</li>
      <li>So I am very pleased with my new product...</li>
      <li>it makes me wonder if the steamer should have more steam - if the right conversion from water to steam is not occuring.  </li>
      <li>and it looked someone tried to wipe the hood clean</li>
      <li>this particular model, I am happy with this steamer and can&#x27;t wait to share the difference (if any) it will cause for our newly natural heads.</li>
      <li>I use Design Essentials products which are amazing for women with natural hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I find the steam output to be appropriate to steam my hair and face (but I have never used another steamer so I really have no point of comparison).</li>
      <li>CON#3, there is not alot of steam coming out of mine, as I have seen with other more popular Steamers and I am pretty sure mine is hooked up</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchasing this product is worth the investment.</li>
      <li>but I hand wash it from time to time with  bleach/water solution and that helps to make it more clear.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for inquring to about my satisfaction and for whoever invented it:)</li>
      <li>Even though I took a risk since I couldn&#x27;t find a single review A-N-Y-W-H-E-R-E about this particular model, I am happy with this steamer and can&#x27;t wait to share the difference (if any</li>
      <li>every time I wash their hair they go right under the steam</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking maybe something&#x27;s not connected right.</li>
      <li>Ok, I love that the  steamer adjust in it&#x27;s height (slides up and down almost like a mic stand) as well as the hood tilts downward and upward.</li>
      <li>The penetration that it offers is far more superior than that of a traditional heating cap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be asking for a quick return from the seller and will be sure to check back re: the response received.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s working fine so far.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant about purchasing a steamer because I couldn&#x27;t see the difference between using my heat cap on a weekly basis versus using a steamer.  </li>
      <li>(one second, it cut off once more)</li>
      <li>Unlike the table top steamer, the entire head &amp; nape of neck is covered.</li>
      <li>I first started using this steamer</li>
      <li>I use this same chair for my hooded dryer and it is of appropriate height.)</li>
      <li>key to wonderfully, amazing soft hair is to purchase a good quality conditioner and stay under the steamer for AT LEAST 25 minutes.  </li>
      <li>The product is simple and easy to work.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll get a strong male person to reattach it for me and see if that makes a difference.</li>
      <li>There were no explanations as to why certain buttons were on the machine.</li>
      <li>Really large piece of equipment</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although the hood is large and it gives you the impression that this covers the Nape(back of the head), it DOES NOT.</li>
      <li>but since I have been using &amp;#34;my new steam dryer&amp;#34; not only does it feel better</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what i wanted, my hair dresser all ready was using one each time i went to her to hydrate my natural hair before blowing drying and flat iron straight, so i purchase my own to use at home no problems so far</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The hood is very generous in size and can accommodate any size head or amount of hair.</li>
      <li>auto shut off and I am sure that is because the reservoir was empty of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Its very simular to the one my stylist use</li>
      <li>how would I really know with crappy instructions.</li>
      <li>It is like holding your head over a pot of hot water; only the section of your head over the pot gets adequate steam.</li>
      <li>I condition my hair by mixing my favorite conditioner with a little oil, and I sit under my steamer without a plastic cap.</li>
      <li>I is for low and II high because the steam seemed to flow moreso when we switched?!?!?!?</li>
      <li>The steamer leaves my hair feeling so soft and very manageable.</li>
      <li>I will add a post-review comment as for recommendations to buy or not to buy after a few more uses.</li>
      <li>I air-dry as normal.  </li>
      <li>The steamer was in new condition when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>A very professional help for any hair.</li>
      <li>this product was far below expectations (a steamer that does NOT steam!).</li>
      <li>But my hair is feeling soft!</li>
      <li>I definitely should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Sitting higher in the unit also provides the added benefit of a steam facial.  </li>
      <li>My 7 year old daughter can also use it without me sitting her on 4-5 pillows.</li>
      <li>The results are soft, flowy, moisturized</li>
      <li>I found that the steam was not reaching my hair near the nape of my neck.  </li>
      <li>: My hear is soft and moisturized, so it did the job.</li>
      <li>My hair is natural and my stylist has a hair steamer in her salon which I use at every appointment.</li>
      <li>) it will cause for our newly natural heads.out</li>
      <li>I have owned this steamer since April 2011, so it is going on three years old as of the date of this review.</li>
      <li>If you have natural hair this is a must buy.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s  a lot of work maintaining your natural hair</li>
      <li>I am a cosmetologist and wanted to start offering steam conditioning treatments like others in my salon, however, this &amp;#34;steamer&amp;#34; barely even emanates steam plus, I think it is used although it is supposed to be new.</li>
      <li>This product is advertised as 49 pounds shipping weight that is not accurate, true weight incorrectly documented to justify the shipping cost.</li>
      <li>When removing the water jug, we let the steamer run to clear water that may be left in the tank and after about 15mins (we set it to 60)it</li>
      <li>I have a relaxer, and I live on the West coast where the climate is dry and arid</li>
      <li>To remedy this I sat on a pillow to make myself sit little higher under the hood,</li>
      <li>chose this steamer simply because of the listed product features for height &amp; tilt adjustment and because so many people complained about how inconvenient the table top was for comfort.</li>

    <li> So after going against the grain and not ordering the popular table top steamer that is advertised on many natural hair care forums, I received this one just today. The item arrived sooner than it was even estimated to ship (VERY happy about that)and packaged very securely &amp; safely. It arrived in several pieces and needed to be assembled. The directions were useless but luckily a bit of patience and a little common sense saved me. Ok, I love that the  steamer adjust in it&#x27;s height (slides up and down almost like a mic stand) as well as the hood tilts downward and upward. I was able to adjust the height &amp; hood to fit both me &amp; my 10yr old daughter perfectly and we tried both a bar stool and the dining room chair to test it. The hood is very generous in size and can accommodate any size head or amount of hair. Unlike the table top steamer, the entire head &amp; nape of neck is covered. I am sure longer hair (mid-back lenth &amp; longer) will need to be pinned up for steaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer has two switches at the back of it that is suppose to help you regulate the flow of steam however with no directions you have no idea which switch controls what. I guess switch I is for low and II high because the steam seemed to flow moreso when we switched?!?!?!? Also, the steamer directions mentions a fuse but no directions on where / how it is to be used, we figured that it had to be an extra one since we tested the steamer &amp; everything seems to work. There is a dial type timer that goes up to 60 mins. When removing the water jug, we let the steamer run to clear water that may be left in the tank and after about 15mins (we set it to 60)it auto shut off and I am sure that is because the reservoir was empty of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this steamer simply because of the listed product features for height &amp; tilt adjustment and because so many people complained about how inconvenient the table top was for comfort. Even though I took a risk since I couldn&#x27;t find a single review A-N-Y-W-H-E-R-E about this particular model, I am happy with this steamer and can&#x27;t wait to share the difference (if any) it will cause for our newly natural heads.out this particular model, I am happy with this steamer and can&#x27;t wait to share the difference (if any) it will cause for our newly natural heads.</li>
    <li> This steamer looks like the ones at the hair salon. A very professional help for any hair. I loved it.</li>
    <li> The instructions are USELESS. I had to remove my plastic cap, to even get comfortable results. I have never used a steamer. I bought this instead of the More popular brand; for all of the reasons that you may have heard. CON #1, im sitting under it now and it has shut off 3 times for no apparent reason and then cut back on. Well if I am on a time limit, and it shuts off for about 2-3 minutes, then i am clearly not getting my entire 50-60 minute hair treatment. CON#2,the directions did not indicate what switch #1 and 2 were for...i just picked a switch, who knows..UGH...(one second, it just shut off again)....CON#3, there is not alot of steam coming out of mine, as I have seen with other more popular Steamers and I am pretty sure mine is hooked up appropriately)but how would I really know with crappy instructions. I am irritated because I could have saved moneyby buying the more popular one....ANOTHER FAIL!!!!!Hopefully, I will get at least my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the hood is large and it gives you the impression that this covers the Nape(back of the head), it DOES NOT. SO if thats the only thing stopping you from buying the more popular Brand(go with the more popular brand)....(one second, it cut off once more)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: My hear is soft and moisturized, so it did the job. My 7 year old daughter can also use it without me sitting her on 4-5 pillows. GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Melissa Hair Steamer once. Its very simular to the one my stylist use and it saves me $20 for each of my visit (my stylist charge $20 extra per steam treatment). The setup was very easy and I give it 5 stars for ease of use.  I will add a post-review comment as for recommendations to buy or not to buy after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience! Giving 1 &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; for this product is too good. 1) the directions were inconclusive &amp; poorly translated. There were no explanations as to why certain buttons were on the machine. 2) this product was far below expectations (a steamer that does NOT steam!). Tried several times to use it to no avail.  I repacked it for return the day I put it together the best way I could given the incomplete directions. 3), and worse even, I lost a lot of money returning this product.  I definitely should have read the reviews first. I guess the word &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; threw me off! I hope this review saves someone else their hard-earned money!</li>
    <li> I have a relaxer, and I live on the West coast where the climate is dry and arid so moisture is important when it comes to taking care of my hair.  At first I was hesitant about purchasing a steamer because I couldn&#x27;t see the difference between using my heat cap on a weekly basis versus using a steamer.  Without having experienced it, it seemed to me like steam treatments were a passing fad.  I looked at reviews on the internet and youtube, heard raves about steam treatments, and considered purchasing the tabletop version, but I was concerned about the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well let me start by saying that my steamer is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in my hair care routine.  I condition my hair by mixing my favorite conditioner with a little oil, and I sit under my steamer without a plastic cap. I air-dry as normal.  The results are soft, flowy, moisturized hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This steamer is sturdy, easy to put together, and is of salon quality.  The only issue you may have is that this steamer takes up a lot of room. I take the head off my steamer and keep it on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my steamer for a little over 8 months and my unit started constantly dripping.  In addition, the water reservoir rusted and I&#x27;m no longer able to use my steamer.  I still like the steaming technique but I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchase the steamer and  just arrived today. I  was very excited to open the box and start using my steamer right away, but unfortunately that did not happen for me because the seller decided to send me a broken down used steamer when i ordered a New steamer. very upset and absolutely frustrated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be. I am very satisfied with. It is being used in my salon. Great!</li>
    <li> Under the steamer and typing this at the same time.  I had to put down a few towels as the steamer was/is dripping out water from the hood. I have wood floors so that&#x27;s not cool.  Water is dripping on me too! The dripping water bothers me. I&#x27;m thinking maybe something&#x27;s not connected right. Since it&#x27;s dripping from the hood it makes me wonder if the steamer should have more steam - if the right conversion from water to steam is not occuring.  Not sure???? But my hair is feeling soft!</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and wanted to start offering steam conditioning treatments like others in my salon, however, this &amp;#34;steamer&amp;#34; barely even emanates steam plus, I think it is used although it is supposed to be new. The part where the water goes in seemed like it was rusty already and as i unpacked it, there were little bits of hair on it and it looked someone tried to wipe the hood clean but it looked greasy. I will be sending this product back and getting a different brand.</li>
    <li> Really large piece of equipment so if you purchase it as I did for home use, you may want to consider where you&amp;#34;ll store it. Otherwise, I am hooked. The penetration that it offers is far more superior than that of a traditional heating cap. You also get the added benefit of your face getting &amp;#34;second hand steam&amp;#34;, so no make-up on when under it. I do wish that the container where the water is held was made of glass. Plastic  tends to look milky after awhile. Assembly was fairly easy, but the base is wobbly. Maybe I&#x27;ll get a strong male person to reattach it for me and see if that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have owned this steamer since April 2011, so it is going on three years old as of the date of this review. The steamer was in new condition when I opened the package. Despite the scant assembly instructions that were included in the packaging, I did not experience any problems putting the steamer together (although after all these years I still do not know what the two buttons on the back are for-- I just turn them both to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position before setting the timer). I use this steamer about twice a month and it has held up over time and continues to function well.  I have noticed that the overflow jar can take on a cloudy hue but I hand wash it from time to time with  bleach/water solution and that helps to make it more clear. (This is a minor issue in my opinion and I only make mention of it because some other reviewers have noted it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this steamer I found that the steam was not reaching my hair near the nape of my neck.  To remedy this I sat on a pillow to make myself sit little higher under the hood, (For context, I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and sit in an office chair when using the steamer. I use this same chair for my hooded dryer and it is of appropriate height.) Then I remembered that the steamer is adjustable and after lowering it just a bit, I no longer have to use the pillow and my entire head gets the benefits of the steam. Sitting higher in the unit also provides the added benefit of a steam facial.  I find the steam output to be appropriate to steam my hair and face (but I have never used another steamer so I really have no point of comparison). For those of you who want to increase the steam it may be helpful to close the vents on the front of the hood so that no steam escapes.  All in all this product works as advertised by providing moisture to my hair and enhancing deep conditioning treatments in the convenience of my home.</li>
    <li> I bought the Melissa hair steamer in October 2011 and it stopped working in October 2012. It worked extremely well for the entire year until it just stopped steaming in October 2012. It came with two extra fuses and I replaced the fuse, but it still does not work. And as others have said, the directions are very poor and does not contain troubleshooting. Will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steamer.  If you have natural hair this is a must buy. The product is simple and easy to work.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s working fine so far. was expected to be noisy but it&#x27;s not at all. wish to instructions manual for assembling</li>
    <li> I used this steamer monthly for about 8 months.  It provided a great steam and was comparable to services received in the salon.  Unfortunately, after only 8 uses it has stopped working.  The unit leaks water and fails to produce any steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be asking for a quick return from the seller and will be sure to check back re: the response received.</li>
    <li> This hair steam does not produce ample steam. The hair steamer was one U-shaped bar in the rear of the hood to provide the steam. The hood is there to trap the steam; this causes uneven at best distribution of the steam. It is like holding your head over a pot of hot water; only the section of your head over the pot gets adequate steam. This product is advertised as 49 pounds shipping weight that is not accurate, true weight incorrectly documented to justify the shipping cost. Ladies this product is not worth your time or money.[[ASIN:B004O3UK4A \\&quot;Melissa\\&quot; Hair Steamer]]</li>
    <li> The Melissa Hair Steamer is wonderful.  I researched this product for quite some time.  My hair is natural and my stylist has a hair steamer in her salon which I use at every appointment. The conditioning steam treatment cost $$20.00 not including my wash, blow-dries and curls so I had to find a way to reduce my cost per visit. The steamer leaves my hair feeling so soft and very manageable. I have two daughter ages 12 &amp; 8, every time I wash their hair they go right under the steam machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this product is worth the investment. I&#x27;ve had this machine for almost TWO months and I&#x27;ve already started saving money. I still go to the salon for a simple wash but not as often since I have the Melissa Hair Steamer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to wonderfully, amazing soft hair is to purchase a good quality conditioner and stay under the steamer for AT LEAST 25 minutes.  FYI..I use Design Essentials products which are amazing for women with natural hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS FOR THOSE ON THE FENCE!!!</li>
    <li> Its a descent product but I need to sell it as I only used it a few times. I also dont know if it working as it should.</li>
    <li> Good steamer. Easy to assemble. Arrived in timely order.</li>
    <li> I had never even heard of a &amp;#34;steam hair dryer&amp;#34; before but have a friend who purchased one and told me about it. What a wonderful way to deep condition your hair. I ware &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; and my hair tends to feel and look dry but since I have been using &amp;#34;my new steam dryer&amp;#34; not only does it feel better but it LOOKS EXTEMEMLY HEALTHY, which is most important to me and its growing to boot.....So I am very pleased with my new product...Thanks so much for inquring to about my satisfaction and for whoever invented it:)</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what i wanted, my hair dresser all ready was using one each time i went to her to hydrate my natural hair before blowing drying and flat iron straight, so i purchase my own to use at home no problems so far, it&#x27;s  a lot of work maintaining your natural hair but in the end i am free from the chemical relaxers. Thanks</li>
