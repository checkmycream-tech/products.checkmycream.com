      <li>and I love that it is cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>Great for my acne so far.  </li>
      <li>so she can scar easily.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a mascara, lip gloss or tube of concealer and is just as easy to apply as those items as well.</li>
      <li>Used couple times, it did  help but the alcohol smell is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I must warn you it does have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I really like it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So happy I found something for her that works.#34;It is the only product that keeps my face clear&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>A really thoughtful design.</li>
      <li>I applied this right to the Spot and while it stings a bit I am ok with</li>
      <li>Pretty good for this deal, since most products I have tried do not work well on adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this acne spot corrector from PureLx Skin Care for review, and I&#x27;m happy to say that it has been quite effective without drying my skin out excessively.</li>
      <li>So I was super excited when I was awarded the opportunity to try this product.  </li>
      <li>It should not be used on young skin, in my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my results and will definitely be using this product in the future.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this corrector for all its many benefits.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of dark spots and am never quite happy with the way makeup covers them.</li>
      <li>This is working GREAT on my acne and dark spots.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
      <li>Within the first couple of days, you can see a noticeable difference!</li>
      <li>do the fact that it did calm my acne</li>
      <li>Alcohol has a drying effect which is useful for acne.</li>
      <li>Turns out that ingredients are powerful to use on brown spots.</li>
      <li>The opinions stated above are my own and may differ from yours.</li>
      <li>and I did notice first off the strong smell, to me much like alcohol,</li>
      <li>I am noticing more with the pimples not black heads.</li>
      <li>Adult acne is embarrassing and this product really helps me clear up breakouts and feel more confident.</li>
      <li>I have had really great results with PureLx products in the past &amp; this is no exception.</li>
      <li>My bottle was brand new, unopened, packaged well, and filled to the brim.</li>
      <li>As I have combination to dry skin, skipping the moisturizer is kind of a problem for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far so good, minus the smell, but honestly, what acne treatments actually smell good?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you treat it a couple times of day when you first notice a pimple it is gone way sooner than just leaving it alone.</li>
      <li>Its liquid so it goes fast and the applicator should be like a brush not sponge tipped which gets absorbed.</li>
      <li>so i can apply it several times in a day and you wont be able to tell.</li>
      <li>When I get really hot my chin breaks out and this has helped them stay at bay.</li>
      <li>I have to say that there is a stinging sensation when first applied.</li>
      <li>and I question how many of the reviews on this site are from actual customers (as opposed to friends or family of the PureLX company).</li>
      <li>No dripping, no running, just goes exactly where you need it/want it.  </li>
      <li>I am sure with continued use they will totally disappear.</li>
      <li>The applicator is like a lip gloss tip, so the product goes exactly where you want it.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter and I are loving the results of PureLx spot treatment for acne and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so far this has been a pretty good spot treatment, i enjoy the fact that it is a wand applicator and its not a messy application like other products ive tried, also its clear</li>
      <li>I was given the opportunity to try this product at a slight discount to try it and give my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I have mild adult acne and this product worked for me.</li>
      <li>It does, however, work on my mild adult acne.</li>
      <li>I wish it was a little more affordable because I really go through it quickly.</li>
      <li>am giving this product 4 stars because I really like it and it works for my mild adult acne.</li>
      <li>I also noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin as it was much softer and even.</li>
      <li>This does not bother me, however, my tweenage daughter was very put off by it.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about dispensing too much and eating product.</li>
      <li>(though as the acne cleared up, the redness did go away), but the product works very well for acne.</li>
      <li>the scars on my face were much lighter than before.</li>
      <li>This product really dries your zits.</li>
      <li>i honestly have mixed reviews for this because everyone seemed to say it worked and personally for me i would give it a 5 out of 10</li>
      <li>As a beauty buff, my face is so important to me and being an adult with acne is no less than mortifying at times.</li>
      <li>Like most other acne products, the sting indicates that the alcohol is cleaning and healing your skin.  </li>
      <li>It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions.</li>
      <li>and if I have an open blemish I just apply it to my clean finger tip and then apply it to my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used just one entire tube, but I used it faithfully morning and night every day until it was all used up on my dark acne marks, and I didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
    <li> This Dark Spot Corrector is wonderful for many reasons. I use mostly on my face and hands. I have had a small cluster of black heads in my chin since high school. With this corrector they are almost history wahoo. My pores also have gotten smaller. My face tone is even and shining. I also used on my hands for dark spots and even my skin looks better. I would highly recommend this corrector for all its many benefits.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do! I had really bad acne when I was younger and I was looking for a solution to my dark spots and acne scars. Within the first couple of days, you can see a noticeable difference! I also noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin as it was much softer and even. the scars on my face were much lighter than before. I am happy to recieve this item to review! I&#x27;m really pleased with the results! Good job!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product at a slight discount to try it and give my honest opinion. I loved it. I think it worked great. I have had really great results with PureLx products in the past &amp; this is no exception. It works very well on my sensitive skin unlike other blemish treatments I have tried. There are no harsh chemicals, only natural ingredients that work to alleviate dark spots, acne scars, sun damage and a variety of other pigmentation issues. It is packed with antioxidants so I know it his healing my skin, not just masking it. I am very happy with this product. All statements made are solely my own.</li>
    <li> i honestly have mixed reviews for this because everyone seemed to say it worked and personally for me i would give it a 5 out of 10 do the fact that it did calm my acne but it also made the area where i used this product dry out fast and the smell is kinda overpowering very strong but only last for a minute or so</li>
    <li> I came upon a promotional offer to try this product. I can honestly say that I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the negative reviews before trying it, and I was a bit hesitant. My bottle was brand new, unopened, packaged well, and filled to the brim. The applicator is like a lip gloss tip, so the product goes exactly where you want it. I have mild adult acne and this product worked for me. I have to say that there is a stinging sensation when first applied. This does not bother me, however, my tweenage daughter was very put off by it. She washed it off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 4 stars because I really like it and it works for my mild adult acne. It should not be used on young skin, in my honest opinion. I cannot attest to the &#x27;dark spot remover&#x27; claim because I don&#x27;t have any to speak of. It does, however, work on my mild adult acne. I would recommend this product based on how it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It works well and I love that it is cruelty free.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the price.  I wish it was a little more affordable because I really go through it quickly.</li>
    <li> Tried numerous products to lighten sun aging brown spots besides acne nd decided to give this a try and it worked faster than all others. Turns out that ingredients are powerful to use on brown spots. Also using but b3 and olive oil with lemon, and coconut oil to complement.</li>
    <li> I got this for dark spots, but it&#x27;s actually for pimles. Spot corrector, not DARK spot corrector. I don&#x27;t know if it works on pimples, but it is not for dark spots.</li>
    <li> After using up for 1month, nothing changed. It contains very little liquid. Do not waste $20.  i think some 5star reviews are made up.</li>
    <li> It is a acne or past acne scaring treatment that comes in a bottle with a wand. I must warn you it does have a strong smell. I got through through the smell by remembering. That by using this I am going to heal up my face. So if you are sensitive to smell you might not get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the treatment on set of acne pimple that shows up or if you have some past scaring or redness left behind. It is recommended if you are trying to lighten up past acne scars to do it for a minimum of 30 days. I have noticed by using it not quite the thirty days time frame some of older and past acne scaring is lightening up. Not gone but it is less noticeable. This treatment can be used under you makeup or on it&#x27;s own. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the other use I have been using this for. I spoke about acne pimple and black heads. I am noticing more with the pimples not black heads. If you treat it a couple times of day when you first notice a pimple it is gone way sooner than just leaving it alone. I will say if you see a pimple as hard as it might be make sure you keep the area cleaned and do not squeeze it. It actually effects the healing time. So if you have a teenage who wants to get rid of a nasty pimple on their nose think about this.</li>
    <li> Burns skin! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> So many choices on the market today for acne.  As an adult I am no longer personally afflicted with acne but my 30 year old daughter is.  That is why I asked her to use and review this product for me when I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the packaging is very nice.  It is about the size of a mascara.  The wand inside has a soft tip that targets the application of the fluid.  No dripping, no running, just goes exactly where you need it/want it.  There is a very strong rubbing alcohol smell to it which is not surprising since alcohol is the first ingredient listed.  Alcohol has a drying effect which is useful for acne. Other ingredients include Zinc Sulfate and Salicylic Acid which are also acne fighters.  It also contains glycolic acid which is used to improve the skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the skin, weakening the binding properties that hold dead skin cells together. This allows that upper layer of the skin to be exfoliated, exposing live skin cells. Another ingredient, Camphor, can produce either a coolness or warmth sensation and acts as slight local anesthetic and antimicrobial substance.  All in all good, sensible ingredients.  But does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used it on a particularly nasty eruption that was on her back.  It did sting (the alcohol) but that is because the pimple was not fully sealed.  It was partially open.  Overnight she noticed a reduction in redness and size.  It seemed to have calmed down.  By the next day it was drying up and it was only just another day before it was almost gone.  Ones that big usually take a week or more to just calm down, but this one was definitely helped by the application of the spot treatment.  No scarring after either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  8-12-15 - My daughter has asked me to get this for her again.  She says she has never used something so effective.  She says, and I quote &amp;#34;It is the only product that keeps my face clear&amp;#34;.  She loves it. So happy I found something for her that works.#34;It is the only product that keeps my face clear&amp;#34;.  She loves it. So happy I found something for her that works.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the corrector and I was wondering does it actually work on dark skin types? Im hoping it works on me</li>
    <li> I am rarely inspired to write a review for a product, and usually do so only if it was spectacular or an utter failure. With one star I think you can figure out which one it is. I bought this product based on the reviews and I am stumped how it&#x27;s received such stellar marks. The product appears to basically be rubbing alcohol, which I could have bought for a dollar. It has done NOTHING to diminish my blemishes, and I&#x27;m at a loss how this product can be sold for 20$. I previously used Melaleuca&#x27;s acne spot treatment and was amazed at how much it helped, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue a membership with that company simply to buy one product every few months. Honestly, I feel taken advantage of and I question how many of the reviews on this site are from actual customers (as opposed to friends or family of the PureLX company).</li>
    <li> Minimal ingredients which could have been gotten anywhere.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are loving the results of PureLx spot treatment for acne and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on a promotional offer and decided we both needed to try this product, so I ordered it and we are both in the testing phases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far upon opening the tube it reminded me of lip gloss, even the applicator is the same shape and type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few spots to test this on and I did notice first off the strong smell, to me much like alcohol, when I used it on my face it started to burn my eyes from the fumes. The spots on my neck were just red, but by morning the redness has gone away and those spots were definitely less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughter she said the smell was unpleasant, and also reminded her of rubbing alcohol. She said on the one blemish she had on her chin she noticed it reduced the size, and dried it up. The other one also seemed less red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, minus the smell, but honestly, what acne treatments actually smell good?&lt;br /&gt;I have some dark spots from a recent allergic reaction, that I&#x27;m really hoping it can help with. I know this will take some time, and no be overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the amount of product you use, will make this rube last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging design.</li>
    <li> This is working GREAT on my acne and dark spots. The acne is going away after a few days now with the use of this product as opposed to the weeks it was taking to get rid of it before. Adult acne is embarrassing and this product really helps me clear up breakouts and feel more confident. I like the packaging a lot, it makes using it a breeze. I would recommend this to anyone young or old that suffers from acne and/or dark spots. My eye circles are finally lightening up too, which is a total bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> so far this has been a pretty good spot treatment, i enjoy the fact that it is a wand applicator and its not a messy application like other products ive tried, also its clear so i can apply it several times in a day and you wont be able to tell. overall i really like it</li>
    <li> Does nothing for spots but really good on that one pimple a month!</li>
    <li> Tried it as a on spot treatment on occasional pimples and did not work for me, disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week. I can say that it drastically reduced new blemishes. I am very happy with it. It does not seem to treat my acne but I do not have horrible scarring like normal.  I can  not give it four stars just yet because I have noticed a change in existing scars. I will give it time and provide an update.</li>
    <li> This product has a really strong odor which takes a little getting used to when applying it.  However, I find that it does help to dry out my adult (hormonal) acne faster as long as I used it directly on the skin without any type of moisturizer underneath, or on top of it.  (No moisturizer applied at all in order for it to work).  As I have combination to dry skin, skipping the moisturizer is kind of a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this but since I was given a discount to review I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I was surprised at how well it works. When I get really hot my chin breaks out and this has helped them stay at bay. I will run the wand under and around my chin and I&#x27;ve noticed there are much less breakouts. When I do get one I apply a little and it dries it out. I can actually feel it working. Very happy with the product and its a great price point. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Used it overnight on my pimple. The next day the pimple had dried out! I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! This product is Amazing. During my chemotherapy treatments I got alot of dark spots on hands and face. Some of these spots didn&#x27;t go away after treatment was finish. Thanks to this dark spot remover, the spots have diminished to practically nothing. I am sure with continued use they will totally disappear. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I do LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I saw if as a deal, I typically pay 4x as much, and this is one of those products that you can feel it working, you see results, and you can carry everywhere with you. As a beauty buff, my face is so important to me and being an adult with acne is no less than mortifying at times. I saw an incredible difference after the first time that I tried this and I have continued to use it since. It has a wand that works well for the spot treatment, but I have also swabbed it across my entire face in order to de-bacterialize and prevent breakouts. It made a difference in the dark spots and discoloration that led to uneven skin tone so ever since I have kept it on my wishlist and in the saved section of my cart to watch for price drops so I can stock up</li>
    <li> Could see a difference after applying it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> This product really dries your zits. I used it on my husband because he had some noticeable ones on his forehead. And I dotted the soloution on him and they dried overnight. I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell of alcohol and this product does smell like it but it&#x27;s a drying agent. With that said you should only use it sparingly or it can dry your face. The sample size is quite big and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dark spots and am never quite happy with the way makeup covers them. So I was super excited when I was awarded the opportunity to try this product.  After a few days I started to notice a difference and after a week or two others started to notice. I am very happy with my results and will definitely be using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> The only thing I dont like about this, is that for the price, it lasted under a week. Such a small tube maybe the lenght of a pinky finger. Its liquid so it goes fast and the applicator should be like a brush not sponge tipped which gets absorbed. So I couldnt even give it 30 days to see if it works:(</li>
    <li> Used couple times, it did  help but the alcohol smell is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne unfortunately and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. I received this acne spot corrector from PureLx Skin Care for review, and I&#x27;m happy to say that it has been quite effective without drying my skin out excessively. I can&#x27;t speak to the dark spot corrector aspect of it, because I didn&#x27;t use it for that (though as the acne cleared up, the redness did go away), but the product works very well for acne.</li>
    <li> I have a couple blemishes currently and they are a bit painful as well. I know we shouldn&#x27;t pick at our blemishes but sometimes I can&#x27;t resist. I applied this right to the Spot and while it stings a bit I am ok with it cause it is seeping into my blemish. I like the doefoot applicator and if I have an open blemish I just apply it to my clean finger tip and then apply it to my face. If it is a closed area then I just apply it right with the applicator. This is a great spot treatment. You don&#x27;t have to worry about dispensing too much and eating product. A really thoughtful design. It has an alcohol scent and the 1st ingredient is alcohol which is probably why but alcohol helps dry up the area as well as kill any bacteria. For me it also took the discomfort away from my blemish as well. i have heard of in the go treatments and never really felt any of those were packaged for on the go, but this you can use and apply frequently as you feel the need to do so due to the design. Just like a lipgloss tube. I think this is a great product and will continue to use it. I am currently using on some dark spots as well and while I don&#x27;t see a difference right now since it has only been a couple of days I will repost later with an update. I was sent this for review however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> I have no regret of buying this product.. It is the best...I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great for my acne so far.  I have been using it for about a week now. I apply it after I see a spot coming up at night and in the morning, I can tell it is starting to fade. Pretty good for this deal, since most products I have tried do not work well on adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> While I have not used this product for long, I am hoping to reduce/eliminate several dark spots on my face.  On initial use of the product, I did experience a little burning, but it could have been a reaction with a lotion I applied prior.  The next time I used the dark spot corrector, I did not experience any burning. I am excited to put this product to the test and see the effects over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> The tube is small enough that I just keep it in my purse. It&#x27;s definitely a strong formula! I can feel a little burning when I apply to my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t made my skin red or anything. Usually settles down my pimple within a couple days.</li>
    <li> Little tube bottle came like it was empty.  Strange.  Barely any liquid to apply.  I don&#x27;t see any improvement and now its all gone already.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is a brand new bottle, because it looks almost empty- and it feels almost empty as well. When I applied using the applicator, I could feel a slight stingy sensation to prove that there&#x27;s actually something there- but that&#x27;s all. As far a treatment goes, it does not work for my sensitive skin. So, $20 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all....Waste of money... Don&#x27;t buy this product!!</li>
    <li> I love PureLX.  When this product showed up I thought of my daughter. She is a part time model and event hostess.  When she has a lot of events she has isolated breakouts.  This product works great for her. She has a lighter shade of brown so she can scar easily.  She tired this  as soon as I gave it to her.  It works.  Plain and simple it is a great product.  She keeps it in her purse.  She does not go anywhere without it.  This is a product made here in the USA.  It reduces inflammation within minutes.  They will give you your money back if if it does not work.  You can not ask for more.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover or lighten my dark spots.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well on occasional blemishes.  I still have a couple of troublesome ones that it hasn&#x27;t been able to address.  Appears that there has been some fading of dark spots.</li>
    <li> I am not someone who typically needs to use an acne treatment, but right before or during that time of the month I usually have one pesky pimple show up and not leave me alone until the whole mess is over. If I am going to use a acne or blemish spot treatment product, this one is perfect for me! Its packaging is small and well designed. It reminds me of a mascara, lip gloss or tube of concealer and is just as easy to apply as those items as well. Simply dab the spot treatment onto clean, dry, skin where the blemish is. The acne spot treatment tube can easily fit into a pocket or purse, so you can always have it with you because we all know pimples always come at the worst times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply this to your skin, you may notice a small pinch or sting. Like most other acne products, the sting indicates that the alcohol is cleaning and healing your skin.  Don&#x27;t worry, the sting doesn&#x27;t last long and with this acne spot treatment, neither will your blemishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. The opinions stated above are my own and may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> It was horrible ! It didn&#x27;t help&lt;br /&gt;And after 3 days using it the bottle had nothing inside</li>
    <li> When I got the package in the mail, the box it came in was open. The bottle was not filled to the top with the liquid. It lasted 3 days. All it did was slightly dry my skin. It did not work at all. Waste of money. I think a lot of the 5 star ratings were fake...like the other reviewer said.</li>
    <li> Looks great.  Reviews look good too.  Other products from Purelx work well and I like them.  But I never received this one.  I am only reviewing so it will get off my list of things to review.  Amazon can&#x27;t remove it.</li>
    <li> Tried this for over a month and it has done nothing for the dark spots on my brown Afro-American complexion. No disrespect intended but maybe it&#x27;s not really for all skin color. For the price and the claim and I was very disappointed.</li>
