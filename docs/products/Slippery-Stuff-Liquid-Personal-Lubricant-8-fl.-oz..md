      <li>Feels awesome and actually helps keep your vag and dick healthy.</li>

      <li>No crazy sex jelly smell, and the waterbased product cleans up so easily.</li>

      <li>I forgot about how well it had worked until I came across an old bottle and boy was I surprised to discover how much more sensation it allows (others worked TOO well for me, much too well, NO sensation).</li>
      <li>This liquid is much thinner</li>
      <li>Not very slippery and dries really quickly.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t the worst I have used but not the best, seemed to dry out pretty quick.</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps vital moving parts well lubricated.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> too thin and it doesn&#x27;t stay where you put it, i haven&#x27;t tried that many kinds of lube but i hope theres something thicker out there</li>
    <li> not what I expected way toooooooo big&lt;br /&gt;would not ever buy anything like this again would not recommend it to my worst enemy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sticky, reminds you a lot of vaginal lubrication, but more stringy. It works really well though, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I enjoyed this bottle, but made the switch to all natural with coconut oil. I keep a little container next to my bed now. It&#x27;s great. Feels awesome and actually helps keep your vag and dick healthy. Antibacterial and anti fungal.</li>
    <li> Not very slippery and dries really quickly. It defeats the purpose if you have to reapply 10 times and it still not slippery-smooth. Definitely couldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Get sticky quickly. Went back to using astroglide</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the worst I have used but not the best, seemed to dry out pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for vaginal and anal both and doesnt leave bad smell and mess, The only thing is it is a little thin and using too much will run, We would recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> Not as long lasting as I&#x27;d hoped, but came as described, on time.</li>
    <li> wonderfull product. it&#x27;s even better than lotion. strong recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The brand is good and Liquid is much better than lotion. great production.</li>
    <li> Does not lubricate well.</li>
    <li> Best lube yet! We are blown out of this world with this lube. Cant compare to the over the counter lubes at the store, not even to the KY designs</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago, I&#x27;m talking 30 years ago and for the purpose intended (solo- your guess here). Since then I switched to  what I could easily buy in a grocery store (astroglide etc.) I forgot about how well it had worked until I came across an old bottle and boy was I surprised to discover how much more sensation it allows (others worked TOO well for me, much too well, NO sensation). I highly recommend this product (the LIQUID) for more sensation. You will use more but it works better so you end up using the same amount if you get my drift.  I&#x27;ve not tried the Gel.</li>
    <li> Have no complaints except that the lubricant dries rapidly if exposed to air.  For intended purpose it works great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Long lasting. Makes foreplay a whole lot of fun. No need for anything else to be added to your evening.</li>
    <li> Gave it 5 stars just so amazon would stop bugging me to rate it. It does its job without any odors or nasty leftover residue. Buy it or not.</li>
    <li> Your engines may be running at full throttle, but if you don&#x27;t have the right lubrication there is going to be a catastrophic event.  This stuff keeps vital moving parts well lubricated.  Even if your trying to cold start, or just getting the darn thing running after a long day of work, slippery stuff is there to get it done.  Especially when you don&#x27;t want to smell like you just walked out of the garden section at home depot, and need to get to sleep.  No crazy sex jelly smell, and the waterbased product cleans up so easily.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s not a whole lot to say.  Everyone reacts differently to products which touch their skin or mucosa.  It irritated me but may be fine for others.</li>
    <li> Ideal if you&#x27;re allergic to silicon-based lubes.  This liquid is much thinner and, well, slipperier.  I prefer the larger bottle with a handy pump dispenser.</li>
