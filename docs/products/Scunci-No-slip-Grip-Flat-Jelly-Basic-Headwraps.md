      <li>It&#x27;s Beautiful!</li>
      <li>This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair.</li>
      <li>Best headband I have found for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>These bands work exceptionally well.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these headwraps!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t slip but I feel like they get caught in my hair and kind of hurt.</li>
      <li>Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>Tear easily, doesn&#x27;t always give a good grip.</li>
      <li>These are the jelly ones, so if you have anything but straight, flawless hari, they get tangled easily.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>These would make much better tourniquets than headbands.</li>
      <li>keep out of their reach, my cats got one and loved it as much as I did.</li>
      <li>so it isnt easy to adjust it on your head without pulling your hair</li>
      <li>They have a strong grip that might give you a headache</li>
      <li>They are fine, for wearing while doing yard work, or running errands.</li>
      <li>maybe my hair is just that fine?</li>
      <li>and I was fine.</li>
      <li>I have probably bought about four packs of these over the years, and I have had some that fit too tight and others that fit just perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are a kind rubbery material and very flexible.</li>
      <li>And they look a bit cheap.</li>
      <li>Says it all, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of headbands and will continue to search for the right width that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache!</li>
      <li>I purchased these after experiences with too many headbands that don&#x27;t grip and they work very well.  </li>
      <li>it still slipped right off.</li>
      <li>As many have said before me, I wear my hair in a ponytail, and need something to keep my bangs back.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different kinds -</li>
      <li>These work pretty well.</li>
      <li>Super cute with my new short hair cut</li>
      <li>They do stretch out a little easily, but cheap enough to buy more.</li>
      <li>I dont know how it can get any positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>Overall, I absolutely love these and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>although with so much \\&quot;product\\&quot; in my hair to style it, you would think</li>
      <li>I really like these because they don&#x27;t slip.</li>
      <li>These do stay in position somewhat better than fabric covered Scuncis, but they slowly but surely inch their way back on my head.</li>
      <li>When I pull my hair back sometimes it slides off but for the most part it keeps my bangs back when I need it</li>
      <li>Either my head is EXTREMELY small or my hair is just that fine, but these slipped right out.</li>
      <li>I have below shoulder length natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>After 20 minutes it has already creeped so far</li>
      <li>The other ones are still good, which leads me to believe the clear one is less durable than the other ones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the ones that seem too tight, if I wear it for an hour or two at a time for a few days, it usual starts to fit better.</li>
      <li>Because they hold tight, they might not be right for everyone if you have problems with your head having a band constricted around it.</li>
      <li>They grip very well without slipping</li>
      <li>It was showing the most signs of wear and starting to develop small splits in it while the other ones haven&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you have straight or slightly curly hair.</li>
      <li>After wearing them daily (rotating the 4) for over a month, there is no slippage and they are not stretched out at all.</li>
      <li>The first use I sort of had a head ache because it was too tight, but by the second use my big head stretched it out</li>

<li> Though they will still slip after wearing for several hours, the adjustments needed from slippage are minimal.  </li>
<li> When my hair is straight it is very slick, I wore this</li>
<li> These bands are entirely made of this silicone material so they are very minimal.</li>
<li> they are too tight on my big head, im not sure if this would be an issue for someone with a normal sized head, but i can not wear these.</li>
<li> Within 2 minutes (just enough to fill water bottle and find iPhone) it had slipped past my ears and onto the back of my head.</li>
<li> Not really non slip.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other kinds with the silicone strip inside the band but between the fabric, elastic, and silicone strip</li>
<li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
<li> the translucent clear one has broken.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now and have never had a problem with them slipping.</li>
<li> Keeping a headband on that will not slide back or off is difficult, especially since it has to fight against the might of my hair.</li>
<li> I think my head just is oddly shaped or something.  </li>
<li> So - if you have trouble with other headbands, this may not solve your issues!</li>
<li> Too tight and does have gel underneath.</li>
<li> Does not feel to tight.</li>
<li> I wear my hair up in a small pony tail and use a head band to keep the hair out of my face.  </li>
<li> I must have an extremely small head.</li>
<li> headband sliding around tgat I have to constantly fidget with drives me crazy, these headbands were a godsend for my sanity and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> I find these to be too thick and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> They are really thin and made out of plastic.</li>
<li> and I hate little pieces of hair flying around my face while on a run, so I always wear a headwrap.</li>
<li> it looks ugly</li>
<li> These are the worst bands ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tear easily, doesn&#x27;t always give a good grip. But when they work, they do the job. Does not feel to tight.</li>
    <li> I purchased these after experiences with too many headbands that don&#x27;t grip and they work very well.  Though they will still slip after wearing for several hours, the adjustments needed from slippage are minimal.  Because they hold tight, they might not be right for everyone if you have problems with your head having a band constricted around it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these headwraps! I am a runner and I hate little pieces of hair flying around my face while on a run, so I always wear a headwrap. I&#x27;ve tried other kinds with the silicone strip inside the band but between the fabric, elastic, and silicone strip I find these to be too thick and uncomfortable. These bands are entirely made of this silicone material so they are very minimal. I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now and have never had a problem with them slipping. I have probably bought about four packs of these over the years, and I have had some that fit too tight and others that fit just perfect.

    <li> These are the only headbands that stay in my hair!</li>
    <li> These do stay in position somewhat better than fabric covered Scuncis, but they slowly but surely inch their way back on my head.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair up in a small pony tail and use a head band to keep the hair out of my face.  I thought that these were stretching out so I knotted one to make it tighter and put it on... it still slipped right off.</li>
    <li> I cannot get this type of headband to stay on my head.  I have tried so many different kinds - I think my head just is oddly shaped or something.  So - if you have trouble with other headbands, this may not solve your issues!</li>
    <li> Super cute with my new short hair cut but they do feel like they are starting to loosen up a bit but it doesn&#x27;t bother me! they were only a couple bucks!!</li>
    <li> These are the worst bands ever! I dont know how it can get any positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - none&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It slips and does not stay&lt;br /&gt;- it is made of Plastic material so it isnt easy to adjust it on your head without pulling your hair&lt;br /&gt;- it looks ugly&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
    <li> Pulls on my hair when I take off</li>
    <li> They do tend to slip.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well. When I pull my hair back sometimes it slides off but for the most part it keeps my bangs back when I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a kind rubbery material and very flexible.</li>
    <li> This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair. It&#x27;s Beautiful! Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are the jelly ones, so if you have anything but straight, flawless hari, they get tangled easily. A buying mistake on my part.</li>
    <li> These were actually all plastic. Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I needed a head band that would stay up during exercise and activity. This is just the one. I will never wear a fabric headwrap again!</li>
    <li> These headbands have practically no stretch to them, they cut into your skin and it actually hurts. They cut so deeply into my mother&#x27;s forehead that I could see her pulse; it was blocking her blood flow. These would make much better tourniquets than headbands.</li>
    <li> they are too tight on my big head, im not sure if this would be an issue for someone with a normal sized head, but i can not wear these.</li>
    <li> I have below shoulder length natural curly hair. Keeping a headband on that will not slide back or off is difficult, especially since it has to fight against the might of my hair. These bands work exceptionally well.  After wearing them daily (rotating the 4) for over a month, there is no slippage and they are not stretched out at all.</li>
    <li> Not really non slip. They hold for may be 1 hour tops. Don&#x27;t buy if you have straight or slightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> When my hair is straight it is very slick, I wore this and it didn&#x27;t slip off the back of my head, I even forgot i was wearing it.</li>
    <li> I must have an extremely small head. As many have said before me, I wear my hair in a ponytail, and need something to keep my bangs back. Either my head is EXTREMELY small or my hair is just that fine, but these slipped right out. I didn&#x27;t even make it to the bedroom to put on my running shoes before it slipped back. I even tried wearing it IN FRONT of my ears, hoping it would work....no such luck. Within 2 minutes (just enough to fill water bottle and find iPhone) it had slipped past my ears and onto the back of my head. Still looking. Like I said earlier...maybe my hair is just that fine? although with so much \\&quot;product\\&quot; in my hair to style it, you would think that by the end of the day it would hold.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t do what they are made to do! After 20 minutes it has already creeped so far back there&#x27;s no point in wearing one.</li>
    <li> Work well, they do keep your hair pulled back and they don&#x27;t slip unlike cloth head wraps. Works well on staying in place during runs/cardio work outs as well and the different colors allows you to match with your outfits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do advise if you have a cat, keep out of their reach, my cats got one and loved it as much as I did.</li>
    <li> Love these!&lt;br /&gt;A headband sliding around tgat I have to constantly fidget with drives me crazy, these headbands were a godsend for my sanity and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m out of excuses to not workout :|</li>
    <li> Simple, stays in place - sometimes that&#x27;s all you want.</li>
    <li> They are really thin and made out of plastic. They have a strong grip that might give you a headache</li>
    <li> Best headband I have found for my fine hair. They do stretch out a little easily, but cheap enough to buy more.</li>
    <li> These are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. They aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34;, though. And they look a bit cheap. They are fine, for wearing while doing yard work, or running errands. But that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I really like these because they don&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t slip but I feel like they get caught in my hair and kind of hurt. I didn&#x27;t care for these bands - no longer use them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re the perfect combination of plasticy and rubbery. They grip very well without slipping and they don&#x27;t pull my hair!  I wear them when I sleep to get my hair out of my face and off of my forehead. After months of use, never have I had them slip off while I was sleeping. Even with short hair (&amp;#60; 3 inches), they still stay in and hold hair back.  EDIT: After more than 2 years of using them (randomly selecting one each night) the translucent clear one has broken. It was showing the most signs of wear and starting to develop small splits in it while the other ones haven&#x27;t. The other ones are still good, which leads me to believe the clear one is less durable than the other ones.</li>
    <li> These do not slip, but they were not what I was expecting. They are a rubber, plastic hybrid. The first use I sort of had a head ache because it was too tight, but by the second use my big head stretched it out and I was fine.</li>
    <li> Says it all, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of headbands and will continue to search for the right width that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache! Too tight and does have gel underneath.</li>
