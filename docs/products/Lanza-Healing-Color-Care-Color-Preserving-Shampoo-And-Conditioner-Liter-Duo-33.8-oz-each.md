      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely and comes with the pumps, which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
      <li>It took me Many years and lots of money to find a product that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw.</li>
      <li>I love this Shampoo and conditioner I have used it for years</li>
      <li>and I always get compliments on how healthy and shiny and my hair is I will never use anything else</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Shiny and healthy looking</li>
      <li>It leaves it shinier, in better condition, and cleaner, with no residue.</li>
      <li>When my stylist got more stock, I bought a conditioner from her.</li>
      <li>Great product, makes my hair feel sleek and color stays like new between colorings.</li>
      <li>Not only does this leave your colored hair tangle-free, shiny, smooth, and silky, but it feels great as you are using it!</li>
      <li>I loved how healthy and shiny my hair felt afterward, so I bought some Lanza shampoo and conditioner for normal hair (my hair has never been dyed or chemically treated).</li>
      <li>However, if you have fine hair you may want to consider the Pureology brand instead.</li>
      <li>My hair is fantastic with this product.  </li>
      <li>I am also very conscious about the ingredients in the products that I use and I feel very good about the natural plant derived content.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly and looked fine.</li>
      <li>I rarely stick with one product line but the Lanza color preserving shampoo and conditioner are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I have a new favorite...</li>
      <li>No matter what I&#x27;ve tried I always come back to Lanza, love my hair!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>I used Matrix Biolage Hydrating Shampoo and Detangling Conditioner for years, and always liked how it left my hair.</li>
      <li>is pretty rare.</li>
      <li>On Amazon you can usually find a great deal on the price.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it as well, so for the past two years, I&#x27;ve been using the Color Care line, and it&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>
      <li>The only shampoo and conditioner that I use and this is such a great price</li>
      <li>Will buy again, fast shipment!</li>
      <li>Well at first I started noticing that something wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; when I washed and conditioned my hair.</li>
      <li>First time purchasing via Amazon</li>
      <li>I am sure my color stays looking good at least twice as long because of this product!</li>
      <li>you manage to get a genuine product, which on Amazon (from 3rd party sellers)</li>
      <li>It really helps to preserve my color.</li>
      <li>Gentle cleaning and does not affect you hair color</li>
      <li>I truly this whole line</li>
      <li>and it makes my color hold much longer than normal!</li>
      <li>When I ran out I went back to the salon to get more &amp; discovered the salon moved to a different city!!  </li>
      <li>My most recent supply I bought from a beauty salon, and I still had some left</li>
      <li>I love them above all the big names out there.</li>
      <li>Anyway, Highly suggest to try.</li>
      <li>Not going to waste my time looking for something better, because I don&#x27;t think that it is out there.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look shiny healthy and feels soft after blow dry and flat iron.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;anza is not super smooth and creamy (conditioner), yet the Beautogen product is.</li>
      <li>It works as well (or better), is similarly priced but doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy feeling that weighs down fine locks.</li>
      <li>The color and texture was completely off.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft &amp; shiney.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost - I use about half of what I did in high end store brands.</li>
      <li>The only product that makes my fine, limp, color treated hair soft and fuller!</li>
      <li>But I tell you I tried to buy store bought version of high end and threw it away and came back.</li>
      <li>My guess is that Beautogen or their supplier is taking real product and watering it down at least 50% or more.</li>
      <li>3 weeks later  My hair is shiny and baby soft</li>
      <li>When I squirted a small amount of the conditioner on my hand from both the old and new bottle, I could see a clear difference.</li>

    <li> I use both the shampoo &amp; conditioner. I am sure my color stays looking good at least twice as long because of this product! It&#x27;s worth the cost - I use about half of what I did in high end store brands.</li>
    <li> Perfect product and shipped right away</li>
    <li> No matter what I&#x27;ve tried I always come back to Lanza, love my hair!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my stylist. It works well enough and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Smells lovely and comes with the pumps, which isn&#x27;t always the case. However, if you have fine hair you may want to consider the Pureology brand instead. It works as well (or better), is similarly priced but doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy feeling that weighs down fine locks.</li>
    <li> Great stuff my hairdresser commented on the improvement in the condition of my colored red and blonde hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Great price and shipping.</li>
    <li> conditioner had to have been very old, had turned a dark yellow color</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner saved my life after my hair was ruined by some bad color!  it leaves your hair feeling smooth and healthy!  Its the only stuff i use now and it makes my color hold much longer than normal!</li>
    <li> I have a new favorite... Living proof!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have always bought these from my hairdresser and they were way more expensive.  Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I love it its the best hair care products I have ever used. Everything in the hair care line is amazing</li>
    <li> Much more cost effective - love the product - had to exchange the pump in one of them but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since I had the same product at home.</li>
    <li> Lanza is the best color-preserving shampoo that I have ever used. My hair is bright and gleams in the sunlight and I color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance too.</li>
    <li> The only product that makes my fine, limp, color treated hair soft and fuller! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo and conditioner I have used it for years and I always get compliments on how healthy and shiny and my hair is I will never use anything else I truly this whole line</li>
    <li> Lanza is absolutely the very best hair products that anyone could purchase! I love them above all the big names out there.</li>
    <li> No matter what shampoo/conditioner I try, Lanza is always a staple in our house.  Just a great product.  Smells great, does a great job with color treated hair.  On Amazon you can usually find a great deal on the price.</li>
    <li> Great product! Not only does this leave your colored hair tangle-free, shiny, smooth, and silky, but it feels great as you are using it!</li>
    <li> I have used the L&#x27;anza line for well over a year now. It&#x27;s truly amazing........*if* you manage to get a genuine product, which on Amazon (from 3rd party sellers) is pretty rare. Unfortunately my local salon didn&#x27;t have stock when I needed it so I was forced to buy from Amazon seller Beautogen. The product arrived fast, but unfortunately it was fake. How do I know this? Well at first I started noticing that something wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; when I washed and conditioned my hair. Then as I started to ponder what it could be I started to wonder whether the product may be fake or not. When my stylist got more stock, I bought a conditioner from her. I took it home and squeezed a quarter size out. I did the same with the bottle Beautogen sent me as well. The difference is actually laughable. The Beautogen product still has faintly the same smell but the texture/thickness and overall look of it is all wrong. L&#x27;anza is not super smooth and creamy (conditioner), yet the Beautogen product is. My guess is that Beautogen or their supplier is taking real product and watering it down at least 50% or more. Shame on you Beautogen.</li>
    <li> I rarely stick with one product line but the Lanza color preserving shampoo and conditioner are fantastic.  I am also very conscious about the ingredients in the products that I use and I feel very good about the natural plant derived content.  Not going to waste my time looking for something better, because I don&#x27;t think that it is out there.</li>
    <li> Smooths frizzy hair.  When drying my hair it takes half of the time now.  My hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced to this product through my hairdresser.  It makes my hair color last longer and makes my hair manageable.  I have recommended this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It really helps to preserve my color.</li>
    <li> It is an expensive shampoo and conditioner. But it&#x27;s one of the best one I&#x27;ve tried. My hair love it!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have Black Filipino hair texture. It makes my hair look shiny healthy and feels soft after blow dry and flat iron. I use a heat protection oil and Bam! I feel beautiful. I get compliments on my hair all the time. It took me Many years and lots of money to find a product that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw. No lie this product is forever my shampoo and conditioner. First time purchasing via Amazon but I have been using this product for about 2-3 years? Can&#x27;t remember so that tells you how long. Anyway, Highly suggest to try. What do you have to lose? But I tell you I tried to buy store bought version of high end and threw it away and came back. Love it.</li>
    <li> Pump came broken leaking product! Not good to nit have working pump!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend - great item for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> My hair is fantastic with this product.  Shiny and healthy looking</li>
    <li> My hair feels and smell great with shampoo and conditioner.  I am very happy I purchased this as a mothers day present for myself.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best shampoo for the whole family.  Gentle cleaning and does not affect you hair color</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.  It leaves your hair extremely moisturized and soft.  Everyone should use it at least once.  You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> I bought a small bottle of the L&#x27;anza shampoo &amp; conditioner in a salon.  When I ran out I went back to the salon to get more &amp; discovered the salon moved to a different city!!  I googled the product &amp; found it on Amazon and bought the largest bottle I could of the shampoo &amp; conditioner. It leaves your hair soft &amp; shiney.</li>
    <li> My highlight and color look like I just got my hair done- 3 weeks later  My hair is shiny and baby soft</li>
    <li> I used Matrix Biolage Hydrating Shampoo and Detangling Conditioner for years, and always liked how it left my hair. Two and a half years ago a friend was spending the night at my house and urged me to try her products - Lanza Color Care Color Preserving. I loved how healthy and shiny my hair felt afterward, so I bought some Lanza shampoo and conditioner for normal hair (my hair has never been dyed or chemically treated). I didn&#x27;t like it as well, so for the past two years, I&#x27;ve been using the Color Care line, and it&#x27;s great for my hair. It leaves it shinier, in better condition, and cleaner, with no residue. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Will buy again, fast shipment!</li>
    <li> Originally, I was happy with the product. Came quickly and looked fine. I read another review that it seemed to be a fake product, so I decide to investigate. My most recent supply I bought from a beauty salon, and I still had some left so I decided to compare. When I squirted a small amount of the conditioner on my hand from both the old and new bottle, I could see a clear difference. The color and texture was completely off. I have yet to try it on my hair, but am disappointed to see that it is clearly not authentic.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my hair feel sleek and color stays like new between colorings. This is a must have beauty buy.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that I use and this is such a great price</li>
    <li> It shipped in the amount of time stated but the pump for conditioner doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hairdresser can tell the difference since I have been using this exclusively. My color holds up much better between color.</li>
