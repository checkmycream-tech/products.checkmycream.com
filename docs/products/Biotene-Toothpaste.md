### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Glaxo has ruined this wonderful product by changing the formula!!!  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for my travel case.  </li>
      <li>They even removed the wonderful bio-active enzyme system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are the best!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great toothpaste</li>
      <li>Like that it isn&#x27;t so foamy yet very effective for my needs.</li>
      <li>The Biotene toothpaste is good.</li>
      <li>good product to use to help guard teeth &amp; gums before you go to sleep at night</li>
      <li>A wonderful toothpaste which is very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>and it is no longer effective for what was intended for, IMObservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound good.</li>
      <li>Biotene used to be a saving grace for me for many years.</li>
      <li>you get a bit more ~4.7oz per tube.</li>
      <li>I will be sure to also let my dentist know that GSK has turned Biotene into just another run-of-the-mill toothpaste at a niche</li>
      <li>Years ago (2007), my dentist recommended Biotene because Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in most toothpastes were a contributing factor to the formation of said sores.</li>
      <li>It may contribute to more canker sore</li>
      <li>was a very loyal Biotene fan 10+ yrs and now am done with them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It also kept me cavity free. .</li>
      <li>It has a great taste and has actually helped me with &amp;#34;No Cavities&amp;#34; check-ups!</li>
      <li>Need to pay more attenion to weight Next Time,I love the product but the size is Foolish!</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I assumed it was a full size toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I thought I was buying the full size tubes.  </li>
      <li>but I seemed to get more with the \\&quot;new</li>
      <li>PLEASE be aware this is a TRAVEL SIZE, you may get a week use of it!  </li>
      <li>Good for dry mouth which everyone in Arizona has!</li>
      <li>Of course, the Biotene is a great product that really helps with gum health (turns gums nicely pink and tends to help with dry-mouth produced sores, etc.).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Beware - I saw \\&quot;Fresh Mint</li>
      <li>This is for good reason as the new formulation foams up just as much as a traditional, SLS-laden, toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great toothpaste for anyone with sensitive mouths or dry mouth.</li>
      <li>I do not think that Amazon is playing fair to re-list it as a travel size, especially since a full size \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; tube is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really like Toms of Maine Clean and Gentle -</li>
      <li>GSK, please offer a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; biotene for those of us who&#x27;ve loved this product in the past.</li>
      <li>I need this toothpaste and don&#x27;t want to travel with a large tube.</li>
      <li>Within two weeks of using this new formula, I discovered two canker sores - the first two in five years - developing.</li>
      <li>Teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after using it like they do with regular toothpaste</li>
      <li>Wish I had read the above review before ordering as I thought I was ordering the full size tube.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Consumers, if you&#x27;ve loved this product in the past, please be aware that this is not the same product that you&#x27;ve been accustomed to.</li>
      <li>Not worth more than a dollar or so, IMO.</li>
      <li>My earlier review was written on the full size tube.</li>
      <li>are the enzymes that made the original product so effective at controlling dry mouth and (at least for me) preventing canker sores.</li>
      <li>I decided to compare the new ingredients label against an older tube that I keep at work and voila.</li>
      <li>I was sent this in replacement for an Amazon subscribe and save product that I normally purchased.  </li>
      <li>The new formulation&#x27;s inactive ingredients is now a mix of sorbitol, sodium saccharin, and sucralose.</li>
      <li>I need to see how I feel about the new formulation.  </li>
      <li>If that is what one wants, all good, but I was looking for a home-sized tube and failed to note the .7 ounce size.  </li>
      <li>I have lichen planis of the oral cavity and my mouth is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you note this is small, travel size.</li>
      <li>New formula just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old formula.</li>
      <li>They changed the formula entirely, added straight fluoride and Sucralose (Splenda) and saccharin, along with other ingredients that don&#x27;t even resemble the original formula.</li>
      <li>Having gone through years of orthodontistry in my youth, I am prone to canker sores of soft tissue in the mouth.</li>
      <li>A complete rip off.</li>
      <li>I get considerable mouth pain with it</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is nice enough, but it&#x27;s a very small sample size.</li>
      <li>The previous order I received and reviewed was for a full size tube.</li>
      <li>Add to it the completely inflated price for this product (I expect to pay more per ounce for a travel size version....but not more than I pay for the regular product!)</li>
      <li>Everything looked the same, except for the fact that it now says \\&quot;New improved</li>
      <li>/&gt;After going through the stockpile of Biotene I had on hand, I recently purchased a new tube.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This reminds me of the \\&quot;new Coke\\&quot; fiasco some years back.</li>
      <li>Original\\&quot; on 2nd new packaging in 1 year&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>those curious, here is a side-by-side image comparison of the old product&#x27;s drug facts and the new product&#x27;s drug facts:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>the only toothpaste I could tolerate without pain and helped me so much with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Wow, I really need to watch what I order a little closer.</li>
      <li>The flavor does not burn my mouth like other toothpaste and it really helps my dry mouth breath when I use it with the mouth rinse.</li>

<li> I wrongly assumed on they had changed back to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;Nope</li>

<li> This is travel size and not a full size tube.</li>
<li> What a waste of money</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a sham and a shame.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it at Wal Mart since this is an expensive price for such a little tube of it.</li>

<li> ( I am not sure about this</li>

<li> Not effective...</li>
<li> It is just a very small travel size.</li>
<li> I use this toothpaste all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;but did not notice the size when I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;A very small size plus shipping</li>
<li> The price was ridiculous for the size.</li>
<li> Too small and too expensive</li>
<li> for the worse (I suspect profit margins for the change).</li>
<li> It now tastes awful and the key enzyme ingredient is AWOL</li>
<li> I know it is expensive</li>
<li> /&gt;this was not a good buy for me :(</li>
<li> Too bad there is not a zero star rating because this is what it deserves.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Glaxo has ruined this wonderful product by changing the formula!!!  I have been using Biotene Toothpaste for over 20 years, post cancer treatment and it is (was) the only toothpaste I could tolerate without pain and helped me so much with dry mouth. It also kept me cavity free. . I decided to compare the new ingredients label against an older tube that I keep at work and voila. They changed the formula entirely, added straight fluoride and Sucralose (Splenda) and saccharin, along with other ingredients that don&#x27;t even resemble the original formula. They even removed the wonderful bio-active enzyme system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a customer service number on their website and invite questions and feedback, 1-800-922-5856, M-F 9:00am-4:30pm ET.  I called them and they were evasive and would not answer any of my questions.  Avoid this product.  It isn&#x27;t what it used to be. Too bad there is not a zero star rating because this is what it deserves.</li>
    <li> Like that it isn&#x27;t so foamy yet very effective for my needs.</li>
    <li> Use it occasionally.  Teeth don&#x27;t feel clean after using it like they do with regular toothpaste</li>
    <li> Make sure you note this is small, travel size.</li>
    <li> Good for dry mouth which everyone in Arizona has!</li>
    <li> Wish I had read the above review before ordering as I thought I was ordering the full size tube.  I need to see how I feel about the new formulation.  It doesn&#x27;t sound good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t ready the 0.7 ounce sizing and it was ridiculously small. I also didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Biotene used to be a saving grace for me for many years. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. But GlaxoSmithKline in their infinite wisdom decided to change the formula...for the worse (I suspect profit margins for the change). It now tastes awful and the key enzyme ingredient is AWOL and it is no longer effective for what was intended for, IMObservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me of the \\&quot;new Coke\\&quot; fiasco some years back. GSK, please offer a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; biotene for those of us who&#x27;ve loved this product in the past. I&#x27;d even pay extra for \\&quot;classic\\&quot; biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then I&#x27;m returning my 5 unopened packages and looking for an alternative...which makes me sad enough to want to avoid all GlaxoSmithKline products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumers, if you&#x27;ve loved this product in the past, please be aware that this is not the same product that you&#x27;ve been accustomed to. This product is now just a different (inferior, IMO) product with the same name. It&#x27;s a sham and a shame. Shame on you GSK!</li>
    <li> My earlier review was written on the full size tube. This is a .7 oz travel size. The previous order I received and reviewed was for a full size tube. I do not think that Amazon is playing fair to re-list it as a travel size, especially since a full size \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; tube is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a dry mouth problem since I had radiation treatments in 1997. My dentist recommended this toothpaste and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. There is no &#x27;cure&#x27; for dry mouth but this alleviates the problem. Also helps if you have sores in your mouth. Not worth the money for a travel size tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, as recommended by my dentist. It has a great taste and has actually helped me with &amp;#34;No Cavities&amp;#34; check-ups!</li>
    <li> The Biotene toothpaste is good. This is the travel size. They also offer the larger 4.5 oz if you are looking for the regular size tube.</li>
    <li> Not effective...I did not see or feel results from this product</li>
    <li> The price was ridiculous for the size. I assumed it was a full size toothpaste. It is just a very small travel size. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is nice enough, but it&#x27;s a very small sample size. Not worth more than a dollar or so, IMO.</li>
    <li> I guess I did not pay close enough attention to the details.  I thought I was buying the full size tubes.  Not the give away sizes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my own fault that I was ripped off, but that doesn&#x27;t make me any less angry with Amazon for not clearly identifying travel-size products. Lesson learned - don&#x27;t trust Amazon; read the descriptions very, very carefully.</li>
    <li> New formula just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old formula. Add to it the completely inflated price for this product (I expect to pay more per ounce for a travel size version....but not more than I pay for the regular product!) and I&#x27;m giving this offer one star. I would give it a zero if I could. A complete rip off.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;but did not notice the size when I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;A very small size plus shipping&lt;br /&gt;this was not a good buy for me :(</li>
    <li> Be warned - I didn&#x27;t pay careful enough attention and thought for this price that I was getting a bigger size.  From now on I&#x27;ll keep buying it at Wal Mart since this is an expensive price for such a little tube of it.</li>
    <li> Horrible value in this size but it&#x27;s great toothpaste</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my travel case.  I need this toothpaste and don&#x27;t want to travel with a large tube.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for anyone with sensitive mouths or dry mouth.</li>
    <li> As other reviews state - GSK changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It tastes like crap now.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is hard to rinse the taste out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It may contribute to more canker sore ( I am not sure about this but I seemed to get more with the \\&quot;new improved ph\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware - I saw \\&quot;Fresh Mint Original\\&quot; on 2nd new packaging in 1 year&lt;br /&gt;and I wrongly assumed on they had changed back to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;Nope - it was just marketing BS. Inside was the the bad tasting formula.  It is almost as though GSK is trying to deceive consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a very loyal Biotene fan 10+ yrs and now am done with them.&lt;br /&gt;I really like Toms of Maine Clean and Gentle - No SLS and you get a bit more ~4.7oz per tube.</li>
    <li> Having gone through years of orthodontistry in my youth, I am prone to canker sores of soft tissue in the mouth. Years ago (2007), my dentist recommended Biotene because Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in most toothpastes were a contributing factor to the formation of said sores. Since switching to Biotene, I had no sores and my mouth felt less dry than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through the stockpile of Biotene I had on hand, I recently purchased a new tube. Everything looked the same, except for the fact that it now says \\&quot;New improved pH formulation\\&quot; on the package. What is in the package, however, is an ENTIRELY different product being sold under the Biotene name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone are the enzymes that made the original product so effective at controlling dry mouth and (at least for me) preventing canker sores. Within two weeks of using this new formula, I discovered two canker sores - the first two in five years - developing. The new formulation&#x27;s inactive ingredients is now a mix of sorbitol, sodium saccharin, and sucralose. As a result, the \\&quot;new\\&quot; product tastes like a pre-chewed piece of Trident gum. Also, while the product is still SLS-free, gone are the \\&quot;low foaming\\&quot; claims of the past. This is for good reason as the new formulation foams up just as much as a traditional, SLS-laden, toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formulation is atrocious and unless the old enzyme formula returns I will have no choice but to look elsewhere for a different option. I will be sure to also let my dentist know that GSK has turned Biotene into just another run-of-the-mill toothpaste at a niche price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those curious, here is a side-by-side image comparison of the old product&#x27;s drug facts and the new product&#x27;s drug facts:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Beware, it&#x27;s .7 ounces, it&#x27;s a trial size!</li>
    <li> I get considerable mouth pain with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 0.7 ounces, which doesn&#x27;t last very long!  I&#x27;ll just buy it at the store!</li>
    <li> PLEASE be aware this is a TRAVEL SIZE, you may get a week use of it!  NOT mentioned on your screen</li>
    <li> Wow, I really need to watch what I order a little closer. This is travel size and not a full size tube. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed at the SIZE! I know it is expensive But this looks like the size You would take on a overnight retreat! Need to pay more attenion to weight Next Time,I love the product but the size is Foolish!</li>
    <li> I was sent this in replacement for an Amazon subscribe and save product that I normally purchased.  Was rather disapointed in the size of the tube.  This is TRAVEL SIZE...  TINY!  If that is what one wants, all good, but I was looking for a home-sized tube and failed to note the .7 ounce size.  Of course, the Biotene is a great product that really helps with gum health (turns gums nicely pink and tends to help with dry-mouth produced sores, etc.).  As a CPAP user, I&#x27;ve found this product beneficial.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Too small and too expensive</li>
    <li> A wonderful toothpaste which is very concentrated.  I use a small amount which gets the job done.  This has become my toothpaste of choice.  Goodbye Dry Mouth.</li>
    <li> good product to use to help guard teeth &amp; gums before you go to sleep at night</li>
    <li> Mouth cannot tolerate any other toothpaste due to dry mouth from Sjogren &#x27;s Syndrome. I use all their products.</li>
    <li> You are the best! Always!</li>
    <li> I have lichen planis of the oral cavity and my mouth is very sensitive.  The flavor does not burn my mouth like other toothpaste and it really helps my dry mouth breath when I use it with the mouth rinse.</li>
