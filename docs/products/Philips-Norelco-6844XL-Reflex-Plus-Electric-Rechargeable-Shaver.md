      <li>During the three months that I have used it, I have been very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this purchase, but I did not expect much.</li>
      <li>This razor works just as good as the top of the line ones.  </li>
      <li>Shaves nice, not as close as a blade but alright for an inexpensive shaver.  </li>
      <li>i liked th trimmer too.</li>
      <li>Better than the mach 3 razor as with this u can cut against the growth .</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver that was priced right when I bought it.</li>
      <li>I bought it one month ago from Amazon, and I worked great so far.</li>
      <li>This gives a nice shave, worth the $30.</li>
      <li>This razor does a nice consistent job and does not have any issues as of yet.</li>
      <li>Great performance overall.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with it, it&#x27;s just a shaver after all.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great unit.</li>
      <li>My old 9.99 electric shaver worked as good.</li>
      <li>This is clean, cuts neat and smooth.</li>
      <li>I do get nearly clean shave, but get skin irritation also.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this shaver because I needed a new one and this one was going for a pretty good price.  </li>
      <li>Only problem is if you skip a day or two and then try to shave your stub, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
      <li>Shaver doesn&#x27;t shave in areas near chin as well as i would have liked.</li>
      <li>He was very excited, as it was something he REALLY needed.</li>
      <li>Mine is still pretty easy to cut.</li>
      <li>If the batteries are drained, you just plug it in and you are up and running right away with full poer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll definetely get the job done just as quick as the razor blades and a pretty clean shave without irritation.</li>
      <li>Nice shaver if you use it daily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth money.</li>
      <li>its worth the price.</li>
      <li>He opened it up right away and charged it up.</li>
      <li>He loves it , it doesnt give me harm and gives a decent shave smoothly.</li>
      <li>What I like is the quick charge and be able to use it corded as I am not regular shaver.  </li>
      <li>the heads spin slowly, as if it is NOT fully charged, although the indicator light say it is.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the first one but the replacement rotary heads would have costalmost the same as a new unit.</li>
      <li>I have never had an electric razor before, and it was not difficult to adjust to this one.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a first time electric shaver.</li>
      <li>I would buy this over those sold at retail store shelfs which cost more doing the same job.</li>
      <li>This shaver works fine but can use a little more power for its motor.</li>
      <li>was looking at the self cleaning electric shavers and they look like an even better buy, albeit a sizeable bit more expensive, but if you don&#x27;t mind cleaning the head a few minutes after every shave these&#x27;ll do great.</li>
      <li>The shave from this unit is wonderful and don&#x27;t have to about cutting myself like with a blade.</li>
      <li>It shaves very well and does not bother my skin.</li>
      <li>Decent value for money ($30) paid.</li>
      <li>The battery last for half an hour at full charge which is more than enough.  </li>
      <li>It took a few weeks to get used to the different kind of shave</li>
      <li>If you buy one that has the transformer at the plug, then evidently it won&#x27;t run when you plug it in and the batteries are low.</li>
      <li>The charge seems to last about 1-2 weeks and an improvement over the old units, you can use the unit plugged in while it is being charged.</li>
      <li>Only thing he worried is, he couldnt shave near the ears.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I really like the flexable shaving elements that follow the curves on the face.</li>

    <li> Great performance overall.  I have never had an electric razor before, and it was not difficult to adjust to this one.  During the three months that I have used it, I have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a similar unit purchased about 3 yrs ago. I was very pleased with the first one but the replacement rotary heads would have costalmost the same as a new unit. The charge seems to last about 1-2 weeks and an improvement over the old units, you can use the unit plugged in while it is being charged. The shave from this unit is wonderful and don&#x27;t have to about cutting myself like with a blade. Overall, it is a great unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver a few months ago to replace regular gillette razor blades.

    <li> I bought this shaver for my Husband for Xmas. He opened it up right away and charged it up. He was very excited, as it was something he REALLY needed. After following the charging instructions and letting it get \\&quot;fully\\&quot; charged, he used it. I heard him in the bathroom complaining the entire time. When he was finished, I asked him what the problem was. He told me the heads turned very slowly, causing it to pull his hairs and he said it just didn&#x27;t seem like it was fully charged up. I told him to return it to the charger and leave it overnight, which he did. The next shave, same process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It just seems that it is running in slow motion. The motor is running very quiet adn the heads spin slowly, as if it is NOT fully charged, although the indicator light say it is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I paid $40 for this shaver and thought it was a good deal. Bottom line, you get what you paid for and I just threw away $40. That will be my lesson from now on. Next time, I&#x27;ll save my $40 and use it towards a nicer, more expensive model!!</li>
    <li> The best deal on Amazon. I got this shaver for only $30 and i can tell you it shaves as if it is a 100 dollar one. Very good shaving. Looks durable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a first time electric shaver. Not sure about how it will work on tougher beards though. Mine is still pretty easy to cut.</li>
    <li> My old 9.99 electric shaver worked as good. Is it says 90.00 MSRP it bull.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver because I needed a new one and this one was going for a pretty good price.  Shaves nice, not as close as a blade but alright for an inexpensive shaver.  Lasts about a week between charges at a couple minutes a day.  It&#x27;s a little on the bigger side but if you&#x27;re not going to take it with you anywhere then it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with it, it&#x27;s just a shaver after all.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I am very happy with this purchase, but I did not expect much.</li>
    <li> Got this product to gift it to my dad.He loves it , it doesnt give me harm and gives a decent shave smoothly.Only thing he worried is, he couldnt shave near the ears.One missing star is due to this. &lt;br /&gt;Moreover, its worth the price. &lt;br /&gt;My dad is using it well daily and I&#x27;m very much impressed with the product! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Murugesh</li>
    <li> This shaver works fine but can use a little more power for its motor. Other than that, I really like the flexable shaving elements that follow the curves on the face.</li>
    <li> Have used it on couple of days growth.  I do get nearly clean shave, but get skin irritation also.  Couple of missed or pulled hair.  What I like is the quick charge and be able to use it corded as I am not regular shaver.  Decent value for money ($30) paid.</li>
    <li> This gives a nice shave, worth the $30. If the batteries are drained, you just plug it in and you are up and running right away with full poer. This is because it has the transformer built in to the unit. If you buy one that has the transformer at the plug, then evidently it won&#x27;t run when you plug it in and the batteries are low.</li>
    <li> This razor works just as good as the top of the line ones.  Quality blades and fully charges in under an hour.</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect that it shaves and does a good job at it.  The battery last for half an hour at full charge which is more than enough.  I would buy this over those sold at retail store shelfs which cost more doing the same job.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver that was priced right when I bought it. It shaves very well and does not bother my skin. This razor does a nice consistent job and does not have any issues as of yet.</li>
    <li> good trimmer. Shaver doesn&#x27;t shave in areas near chin as well as i would have liked. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I owned it for over 3 months, it works well with only one charge.</li>
    <li> This is clean, cuts neat and smooth. Much better than the horrible Remington I had before. Holds the charge well too</li>
    <li> Nice shaver if you use it daily. Only problem is if you skip a day or two and then try to shave your stub, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought it one month ago from Amazon, and I worked great so far. It&#x27;s worth money. I didnt notice any problem with this shaver. I have bought two addional for my friends. Recommend to buy. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a rockstar. Better than the mach 3 razor as with this u can cut against the growth . i liked th trimmer too.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is an example of poor constuction. To date my prior Norelco Razors had metallic heads. This one is plastic. There was no literature included in the package to inform me of battery number ot type. I would not recommend this model.</li>
