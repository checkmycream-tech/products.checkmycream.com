    <li> This face wash makes my face feel and look good, I just think it&#x27;s a little too expensive for what it is. I have the Laser resurfacer and that is amazing so I will probably just stick with that.</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliate I have been using this brand for 3 years I have tried so many brand before and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Best face product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my face feel.  So soft and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t burn of tingle.  The grittiness lets me know if I rinsed it all off.  I think my face looks healthier too.</li>
    <li> this mask leaves my skin so soft. Not only the microdermabrasion but also the extracts in it really help to resurface my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product and works great on my dry skin!</li>
    <li> A really good, wonderfully fine-textured facial exfoliator (nearly perfect)...not too gritty, but not too &amp;#34;whimpy&amp;#34; either...thinking I&#x27;ll buy it again...best if left on the face a few minutes after scrubbing with fingertips in circular motions...a great concoction...</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I stopped using this for a while and was experiencing some acne.  I leave this on my face for 7 minutes.  After washing my face, my pores look visibly smaller and mild acne subsides considerably.  I would caution against using this if you are going to spend time in the sun.  It makes my skin VERY sensitive to the sun, although I do live in a tropical climate.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin smooth and does not irritate like many exfoliative products.  I am making this part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I was not sure this product would work,but if yo follow the directions it works very well, I was just used too a more abrasive scrub</li>
    <li> Seems to work as advertised.  Does leave the skin feeling wonderful and soft.</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old, my skin is dry and sensitive. I have adult acne and rosacea. This product started to improve my skin with the first application.  Wet your face, apply product and gently rub into skin.  Wash off in 5 minutes.  Super quick and easy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff works yet...but I like it a lot! I use it before shaving and it feels pretty good!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I made sure to read the instructions for this scrub when I received it. You don&#x27;t just slap it on your face and wash it off. It&#x27;s almost a mask/scrub hybrid. You have to leave it on clean wet skin for 7 -10 min to get the benefits of it&#x27;s deep exfoliating. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think this particular product was old, because it didn&#x27;t  do much to my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this when showering, leaving it on my face for several minutes.  My face feels a lot softer afterwards.  I usually follow up with their eye and face serums and moisturizing gel.</li>
    <li> I tried this exfoliating scrub for the first time when I ordered the kit a while back.  I&#x27;ve just reordered it.  My skin looks clearer and feels better than it has with any other scrub I&#x27;ve tried.  Love Peter Thomas Roth!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Arrived quickly. I would def reorder!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I received a sample in the mail and immediately I had to purchase a tube. It is expensive, but It works. It exfoliates the face with out pain and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub, it makes my skin look noticeably brighter after use. A little pricy but since you only need a dime sized amount per use it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It is a scrub and mask combined. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to speak of the results though.</li>
    <li> I check out products constantly using ebay; the items are less expensive and I get to have an idea of how well they work without paying full retail.

    <li> I liked this scrub. I was expecting a bit more from it though. It also was packaged like potato chips...too much air so it feels like 1.5oz and not 2oz. Gonna try Algenist next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product to help reduce the appearance of acne scars.  It is essentially a scrub, but it is not super gritty were it hurts to use it. The product smells good and spreads well a small amount can cover a large areas. So far a really haven&#x27;t noticed the scars changing but the texture of my skin is smoother and glowing.</li>
