      <li>These work great on my RV .</li>
      <li>great concept</li>
      <li>I happy with it as I used to end with a lot of water on the floor after showering.</li>
      <li>Works great at stopping water from draining on floor</li>
      <li>It kept the water off the floor though so in happy.</li>
      <li>Besides that, they look nice (just like the picture) and work like a charm!</li>
      <li>Oh well, it was good for the money I&#x27;m just going to add a bit of caulk.</li>
      <li>The idea is good.  </li>
      <li>skipped using tape, works good</li>
      <li>even with a perfect fit I would have used silicon for a longer life...   </li>
      <li>Just like many reviewers said, have to caulk, then it would work great.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>The guards are easy to install and work great.  </li>
      <li>Great product and easy to install.</li>
      <li>Fine for the price but would have been great if it came with a paste/silicone type sealant.</li>
      <li>Great fit and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>And looks nice too, was worried it would look too hospitally, but fits well with a stylish bathroom.</li>
      <li>so you can attach it with adhesive suitable for a moist environment.</li>
      <li>These things are easy to use, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  Bravo!</li>
      <li>Even if you have very smooth surfaces, I don&#x27;t think you could rely on the peel-and-stick adhesive</li>
      <li>Make sure your wall and front wall of the tub are 90 degrees.</li>
      <li>the side sticky part, if placed over tile, will not fully stick and once you put it in place you&#x27;ll never be able to move it to realign it away from the tile grout gaps</li>
      <li>Water doesn&#x27;t pass through most of it except for about an inch at the bottom corner where it meets the wall.</li>
      <li>Most are a degree or two off.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d better hope your tub surround is too.</li>
      <li>stops the water, but only if you have perfect 90 degree corners.</li>
      <li>Make sure you seal it in place.</li>
      <li>Buy really glad that we got it</li>
      <li>Guess OK for the price.  </li>
      <li>I love when my husband orders things</li>
      <li>It was a good product, the description was accurate and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Cheap and easy!</li>
      <li>The truth is that most bathtubs do not have a precise 90 degree angle at the edge of the molding.</li>
      <li>Super easy to install!</li>
      <li>Easy to install</li>
      <li>This was so easy to install</li>
      <li>Easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install.</li>
      <li>Easy to install and seem to be helping.</li>
      <li>The quality of the plastic is fine.</li>
      <li>To get mine to fit I had to add some caulking to get it to fit and do its job.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit in either one of my tubs.</li>
      <li>The great thing was that there were two so going to try the second one with caulking.</li>
      <li>Consider using a touch of super glue on plastic surfaces and a touch of something strong for tubs with coatings over iron.</li>
      <li>Self adhesion is easy to use and the spongy sticky part is good at following contours.</li>
      <li>Make sure your tub has an exact 90 degree angle before ordering from wall to tub ledge.</li>
      <li>This great product will not fasten properly unless that angle is EXACTLY 90 degrees!</li>
      <li>Somehow still the tape manages to stick to the plastic so tenaciously that you can&#x27;t get the part clean and tape-free</li>
      <li>Line it up, stick it on and then lay a bead of clear or white silicone along the edges for a perfect splash guard.  </li>
      <li>Looks kind of cheap, but will try them first before I complain too much.  </li>
      <li>Great size that works perfect at first looks to small that u put on tub an they look to big but</li>
      <li>Items arrived early, very cool ...just haven&#x27;t been able to install them yet.</li>
      <li>Worked good enough, would buy it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly sure these would have done the same thing for many years without the silicone</li>
      <li>I did NOT get this for free or a reduced price nor do I pay much attention to reviews from those who DO get the product for free.</li>
      <li>Like others have said, they&#x27;re kinda hard to get on aligned perfectly, and the adhesive that&#x27;s on there is mediocre at best.</li>
      <li>This Tubb Tender Splash Guard doesn&#x27;t fit the corners of my tub very well.</li>
      <li>I had huge gaps between them &amp; the wall, but after using almost a tube of caulk over a couple of days, got them to attach ok, &amp; they definitely then do the job.</li>
      <li>If you prefer that honest reviews from those who actually buy the product are featured, please click &amp;#34;LIKE&amp;#34; so Amazon knows you prefer &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; reviews......</li>
      <li>The main problem here is that the part that adheres to your tub is fine but</li>
      <li>The tape was already stuck to the guards, and one side of my bathtub is not quite a right angle, so I have to caulk it over the tape.</li>
      <li>They stick right on and have been there for over 2 months now</li>
      <li>Unless your tub is like exactly a 90 degree angle, and not a little curbed like most of them.</li>
      <li>It appears that most tubs will need some extra sealant or caulk and it would be easier to put the caulk/sealant on the wedge then adhere it to the tub, instead of trying to put the sticky wedge in place and failing because your tub isn&#x27;t an angle match.  </li>
      <li>Overall OK for the price</li>
      <li>Mine was a few degrees off - most are - no problem - get clear aquarium silicon adhesive and put a nice 1/4 inch bead on all the adhesive surface.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine it working better if it was stuck on the tile/wall as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i had has higher hopes for this.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s doing exactly what it needs to</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, that being said, I have noticed, it definitely does the job of keeping the most of the&lt;br /&gt;splash from the  shower.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>After first shower both of them loss the adhesive strips and fell off.</li>
      <li>If you have an IQ of 14 and the attention span of a gnat you might just be able to hit the low end of the installation requirements on how to work these things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because they did exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>and it did exactly what it promised.  </li>
      <li>item is at an exact 90° angle.</li>
      <li>Product works and it is large enough to block most of the splash.  </li>
      <li>The sticky back won&#x27;t secure it for long, but held it in place nicely while I caulked them.</li>
      <li>but the item looks to be pretty even and straight.</li>
      <li>It will fill any small angle discrepency and be a better sealant than the original anyway....</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>size works very well together with shower clips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These really work well.</li>
      <li>Mine was angled too much toward the floor</li>
      <li>Unless you are really a pro, you&#x27;ll need to use caulk.</li>
      <li>sticky on the guards work very well</li>
      <li>But really like the product.</li>
      <li>and I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>If this came with a little package of caulk, then it would&#x27;ve been better.</li>
      <li>Not enough coverage to make it worth while</li>

    <li> These lifesavers for those who can&#x27;t seem to take a shower without getting water on the floor.</li>
    <li> The truth is that most bathtubs do not have a precise 90 degree angle at the edge of the molding. Most are a degree or two off. This great product will not fasten properly unless that angle is EXACTLY 90 degrees! Mine was a few degrees off - most are - no problem - get clear aquarium silicon adhesive and put a nice 1/4 inch bead on all the adhesive surface.

    <li> You may as well save yourself some time and spend a little more on a tube of caulk, and a little less on the plastic piece. The tape does not stick very well, then leaks and falls off the first time it gets wet. Somehow still the tape manages to stick to the plastic so tenaciously that you can&#x27;t get the part clean and tape-free so you can attach it with adhesive suitable for a moist environment.</li>
    <li> Works well be you may still need caulking</li>
    <li> This Tubb Tender Splash Guard doesn&#x27;t fit the corners of my tub very well. Water still ends up on the floor.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and seem to be helping. Make sure your tub has an exact 90 degree angle before ordering from wall to tub ledge. Had to caulk in order to make this work because the corner is not a 90 degree angle so a gap was present.</li>
    <li> Is as pictured. I not working  but caulk was needed to fill in the gap between this item and my uneven wall.</li>
    <li> Our tub is uneven, so we constantly had a puddle of water on the floor until we installed this bad boy. I thought it was kind of flimsy at first, being that it&#x27;s thin plastic held on by adhesive strips and reinforced by tub calk, but it&#x27;s been several months now and there&#x27;s no sign of it coming off whatsoever. We didn&#x27;t need one on the other side, so I suppose if it ever does come off, we&#x27;ve got a backup. Hooray!</li>
    <li> they did the job, my wall on outside of tub now stays dry. thanks</li>
    <li> Item is just like it&#x27;s advertised. Easy to install but u still need to silicone the edges. Received item in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This tub splash guard does the job but it&#x27;s necessary to apply caulk, which requires at least 48 hours of drying time.</li>
    <li> Not enough coverage to make it worth while; keep shopping.</li>
    <li> Worked for my needs. However, the tape strips on these do lose their stickiness after a relatively short period of time. Consider using a touch of super glue on plastic surfaces and a touch of something strong for tubs with coatings over iron.</li>
    <li> Just like many reviewers said, have to caulk, then it would work great.  That&#x27;s why 4 instead of 5 stars.  The double sided foam tape it came with wasn&#x27;t enough to do a flushed stick.  If this came with a little package of caulk, then it would&#x27;ve been better.</li>
    <li> The plastic shields affectively but the tape does not stick.  Will need to caulk to keep it in place.  Overall OK for the price</li>
    <li> Stopped water from coming out of shower and now no more water on the floor ruining my floors.</li>
    <li> To get mine to fit I had to add some caulking to get it to fit and do its job. It has been solid for a few weeks now.</li>
    <li> These work great on my RV .</li>
    <li> These things are easy to use, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> Even if you have very smooth surfaces, I don&#x27;t think you could rely on the peel-and-stick adhesive this comes with. I used silicone sealant in a caulking gun and stabilized the pieces with masking tape while it dried.  Now it&#x27;s doing exactly what it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend placing them as close to the ledge of the inside of the tub as possible so as not to allow water to pool next to them.</li>
    <li> This sucks didn&#x27;t stop water from leaking !!</li>
    <li> Items arrived early, very cool ...just haven&#x27;t been able to install them yet. Looking forward to a dry floor in camper next trip.</li>
    <li> The actual guard portion is so shallow, that it&#x27;s not any better than nothing.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, these are useless without caulk, but provide ample protection when sealed. The sticky back won&#x27;t secure it for long, but held it in place nicely while I caulked them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work....water still spills out all over my bathroom floor.  The adhesive strip isn&#x27;t strong enough, so they are constantly falling over.</li>
    <li> I love when my husband orders things and I am the one that ends up installing them. This guy, I tell ya.</li>
    <li> Keeps water in the tub and prevents subfloor and drywall from rotting. Great product and easy to install. I recommend putting a head of silicone around the joints so tape doesn&#x27;t get exposed to moisture.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> skipped using tape, works good</li>
    <li> Great fit and works like a charm. Keeps water inside the RV shower.</li>
    <li> Worked good enough, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit in either one of my tubs.</li>
    <li> i had has higher hopes for this. ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Wanted a wider guard than this product turned out to be.</li>
    <li> As advertised, simple to install</li>
    <li> Not flexible enough for my water slash protection in the tub</li>
    <li> I bought these guards to stop some water from flowing down the shower wall and out of the tub; these guards redirect the water back  to the tub.  I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because they did exactly what I wanted but I will throw out there, I also sealed the seams with clear silicone from the get-go for the overkill factor.  I&#x27;m fairly sure these would have done the same thing for many years without the silicone but I didn&#x27;t want the double side tape getting wet.</li>
    <li> We had a problem with water hitting the back wall of the shower and spilling over the side. I used both of them next to each other for some added converge. They stick right on and have been there for over 2 months now and the adhesive hasn&#x27;t seemed to weaken. We almost hardly ever have spills now. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product works and it is large enough to block most of the splash.  Keep in mind that this is a fairly stiff splash guard.  If the angle of your shower wall / tub is not 90 degrees, you will need to caulk up the gap.</li>
    <li> I needed these splash guards for our travel trailer to keep the water from running out in such a tight space. They do the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I know there is a taller version of this that you can buy, but this style is just a little short.&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, I have noticed, it definitely does the job of keeping the most of the&lt;br /&gt;splash from the  shower.&lt;br /&gt;This size works very well together with shower clips.&lt;br /&gt;I feel if you were only to have splash guards, the larger size would be better.&lt;br /&gt;The sticky on the guards work very well and we found there was no need for&lt;br /&gt;any extra caulking.</li>
    <li> These really work well.</li>
    <li> Had serious leakage due to a poorly designed bathroom that have already ruined the molding in the floor of the bathroom twice now. Tried getting one of these to fix it, but unfortunately it does very little. Ended up getting some shower curtain clips later on which have fixed the problem, but cannot recommend these.</li>
    <li> The seal was not great and the water still leaked through it.  The great thing was that there were two so going to try the second one with caulking.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, they&#x27;re kinda hard to get on aligned perfectly, and the adhesive that&#x27;s on there is mediocre at best. It kept the water off the floor though so in happy. If the glue loosens up I&#x27;ll get some caulk and fix it.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t we buy these sooner!  Installing required a lot of caulk to fill in the gaps, but no more water on the floor.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item to use in my bathtub so that my niece and nephew don&#x27;t spill water out of the tub. The quality of the plastic is fine. It does stick well to the tub however it does not stick to the tile/wall flush. So I have been using it for a few weeks now and it is still managing to stick to the tub this whole time without the support of the wall adhesive. I can only imagine it working better if it was stuck on the tile/wall as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my wall bends or something but the item looks to be pretty even and straight. I can force the adhesive to stick to the wall but it will just come off after a few seconds. If the company had provided me extra adhesive stuff I could custom stick it to the wall. I am thinking of just buying double sided 3M tape and doing it.</li>
    <li> Line it up, stick it on and then lay a bead of clear or white silicone along the edges for a perfect splash guard.  Cheap and easy!</li>
    <li> Caution - not a 90 degree angle.  It&#x27;s move like 87 degrees so it didn&#x27;t seal at all on my new tub/shower.  Buy one that flexes instead!</li>
    <li> Works well with tub/shower combo.  Combo is not exactly a right angle as splash guard, but a bit of caulking and works super.</li>
    <li> This is working wonderfully so far. We have had such a problem with water going around the edge of the tub and around the shower curtain to the floor but not anymore. They are quite simple and feel and look a little on the plain and cheap side but for less than ten dollars I am not going to complain. The only issue to note is that you have to be dead accurate to install them. They attach with a sticky foam pad and it does not release once it hits tile. I put a little silicon sealant around the edges and I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great size that works perfect at first looks to small that u put on tub an they look to big but when an as u use your tub u find them to be perfect size</li>
    <li> These are very difficult to attach.  Mine was angled too much toward the floor but I could not re position it so I had to remove it.  Then could not reattach as the adhesive was ruined.</li>
    <li> If you have an IQ of 14 and the attention span of a gnat you might just be able to hit the low end of the installation requirements on how to work these things. Unfortunately it was way over my head. But then again I tried to install them while arguing with a clairvoyant who lives in my building and wanted to put a spell on my parking space. The main problem here is that the part that adheres to your tub is fine but the side sticky part, if placed over tile, will not fully stick and once you put it in place you&#x27;ll never be able to move it to realign it away from the tile grout gaps and then you&#x27;ll have to use glue and try to saturate it  to fill in all the gaps and then you&#x27;ll ruin the tub finish and there goes your security deposit. And your parking spot is haunted.</li>
    <li> Super easy to install! I am a women and did them all by myself, they keep the kids water in the tub!</li>
    <li> These fit my bathtub poorly and needed grouting. Otherwise it&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t even there. They&#x27;re also cheap-looking.</li>
    <li> It was a good product, the description was accurate and it arrived quickly. Had I known then what I know now, I would have ordered the wedges without the sticky back. It appears that most tubs will need some extra sealant or caulk and it would be easier to put the caulk/sealant on the wedge then adhere it to the tub, instead of trying to put the sticky wedge in place and failing because your tub isn&#x27;t an angle match.  Oh well, it was good for the money I&#x27;m just going to add a bit of caulk.</li>
    <li> The tape was already stuck to the guards, and one side of my bathtub is not quite a right angle, so I have to caulk it over the tape. Besides that, they look nice (just like the picture) and work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Water still leaks through, but it helps. Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Works great at stopping water from draining on floor</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong? I will tell you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is at an exact 90° angle. You&#x27;d better hope your tub surround is too. If you have tile, you are likely in the clear. Still though, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These unstuck at the bottom and stayed adhered to the wall of tub. Needed to be re adhesives down with a liquid nails after 2 months.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because once you can get these installed, they work great.  The problem is that they are made for perfect 90 degree bathroom walls, which I think doesn&#x27;t exist!  I had huge gaps between them &amp; the wall, but after using almost a tube of caulk over a couple of days, got them to attach ok, &amp; they definitely then do the job.</li>
    <li> Excellent concept. Make sure you seal it in place. After first shower both of them loss the adhesive strips and fell off. Do not rely on the foam tape.</li>
    <li> The kids were always getting massive amounts of water on the bathroom floor, and it leaked through to the downstairs.  These were a snap to install with the attached adhesive strips and we have not had any water problems for the year or so these have been in place. They do get a little moldy, but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> Works great! stop all the water from coming out of the bath tub in on the floor so it actually was really convenient Buy really glad that we got it</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for guards like the photo, these are not it--they are about half the size.  They work OK, but not nearly as well as the larger version made by other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Came off after a few weeks of use by themselves. We used on an old cast iron tub and apparently it wasn&#x27;t flat because we had huge gaps between the bottom of the guard and the tub.</li>
    <li> Guess OK for the price.  Looks kind of cheap, but will try them first before I complain too much.  Can&#x27;t imagine how they will stick but there is always silicone.  The idea is good.  We have a low shower and the idea is to stop the water going all over the floor.  Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> I received 2 in a pack. They have adhesive strips on the bottom and back side. The 1st one I tried installing didn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s hard to adhere both sides at the same time properly. I had to remove it and adhere the 2nd one instead. Water doesn&#x27;t pass through most of it except for about an inch at the bottom corner where it meets the wall. I happy with it as I used to end with a lot of water on the floor after showering. Now there&#x27;s hardly any that slip through that non adhered inch at the bottom corner. Improving the design of this product would be through making the adhesive sides thicker/more cushion to them so that one can press on all adhesive parts to stick.</li>
    <li> horrible product you have to have completely straight walls to use this product waste of money threw in trash. would not waste your money.</li>
    <li> use caulk to seal and set them.. works awesome.</li>
    <li> great concept but if your tub and wall are not square (like mine) they will not work unless you use calking on it instead of the adhesive tape that is on it.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that I had water coming out of the shower/tub when I showered and the tile in my bathroom started to curl up on the edges.  This truly solved the problem.</li>
    <li> Very hard to put on.  Unless your tub is like exactly a 90 degree angle, and not a little curbed like most of them.</li>
    <li> Kinda  small, but so far it seems to be doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the one panel, saving the other for later installation.</li>
    <li> The way our shower sprayed would make water leak into the floor, these splash guards solved that problem and made the tub look nicer.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Keep water from coming out of the shower!</li>
    <li> Make sure your wall and front wall of the tub are 90 degrees. Use a speed square to check, if their is any type of curved corner, these will NOT work, they need to fit tight to the corner.</li>
    <li> Excellent in all phases from order to delivery and just what we wanted.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream!  I would purchase again!  BTW, I use it for a walk-in shower and not a tub.</li>
    <li> This was so easy to install and it did exactly what it promised.  No more leaks or drips on the floor!</li>
    <li> Self adhesion is easy to use and the spongy sticky part is good at following contours. Only downside is that because both sides are sticky, it is very, very hard to make both surface connections flush and water tight. Unless you are really a pro, you&#x27;ll need to use caulk. Maybe that&#x27;s obvious to some people, but wasn&#x27;t to me. But really like the product. And looks nice too, was worried it would look too hospitally, but fits well with a stylish bathroom. GF approves as well.</li>
    <li> It worked to keep water out of the floor only after applying caulk to seal it in place. Fine for the price but would have been great if it came with a paste/silicone type sealant.</li>
    <li> This is definitely helpful for keeping water from running onto the floor but some water still gets through because the splash guard does not fit flush with the wall. I use a piece of fabric outside the guard to catch the water that comes from under the guard. That has kept anything from getting on the floor. It is effective but not ideal.</li>
    <li> stops the water, but only if you have perfect 90 degree corners. had to caulk to fill in the gaps</li>
    <li> The guards are easy to install and work great.  Fixed my major problem of water on the floor after showering.</li>
    <li> it does its job. very happy.</li>
