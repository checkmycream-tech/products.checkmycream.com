      <li>Blades are good they ware out fast.</li>
      <li>Works fine the gold version broke too easily.</li>

      <li>I reallyy like the fact that Wahl has these replacement heads available.</li>

      <li>My original razor had gold foil on it</li>
      <li>This is by far the best shaver on the market for personal use  for some of us</li>
      <li>After deciding to keep my head closely shaved, I bought a Wahl Super Close in September 2012.    </li>

      <li>Came later than what was anticipated, but I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>

      <li>He has a ond Wahl Shaver that  he really likes..  </li>
      <li>Ordered this replacement and after seven months it&#x27;s still working, though these days I only use it occasionally and have found a Schick 5 blade &amp;#34;Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor&amp;#34; faster and more efficient and never cutting my skin.</li>
      <li>Super close is the only way to go.</li>
      <li>Works as expected Quick delivery</li>
      <li>I could never find anything suitable for my tough beard until I came across this wahls product.</li>

    <li> great product great price</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for this product for a long time  He has a ond Wahl Shaver that  he really likes..  Got it from this store for a very good price.  No problems with order or delivery.</li>
    <li> ok this is my 2nd pair that work fine just don&#x27;t drop them, bc you&#x27;re be buying new one lol</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Works great.  Close shave.</li>
    <li> bought before like the product</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, lasted not long at all before disposal. The gold head foil is much better.</li>
    <li> Great deal, shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Works as expected Quick delivery</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in the shaving than the one that came with the razor, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing it job. All is well</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product. It is the same blade included with the shaver.  I did want the hassle of having to ship it back.</li>
    <li> do not buy this replacement foil...it broke off after one use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver on the market for personal use  for some of us this is that shaver the barber usrs on those baldheads or close fades. A must own peice of equipment for every man&#x27;s grooming gear  The replacement foils and blades cheap and easy to find. This seller got me the purchase 3 days before expected  Expect return business.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping. Product just as described.</li>
    <li> Blades are good they ware out fast. Have a barber Shop. You also need to use a per electric  solution  It will give you bumps as you have to repeat over the same area too mant times .</li>
    <li> It lasted one time and then fell apart like the others.  I&#x27;ll never order another.</li>
    <li> Great item, didn&#x27;t think I could find one, fast shipping</li>
    <li> My original razor had gold foil on it this has silver on it this seems not to shave as close as the gold foil !!!</li>
    <li> I could never find anything suitable for my tough beard until I came across this wahls product. The best on the market by far!!!!</li>
    <li> very happy with my order</li>
