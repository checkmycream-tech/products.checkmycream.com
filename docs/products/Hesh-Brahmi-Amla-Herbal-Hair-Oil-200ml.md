<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hestitated on buying this product for a bit due to the negative feedback. I finally bit the bullet and got it a few months back. First of all, for all of you that are concerned about the mineral oil in this product, I can assure you that there is not all that much and it is very thin. My scalp is very sensitive and I cannot abide oil in my scalp. This oil is very thin and will soak into your scalp in no time. It is true that there is a strong smell for the shikakai oil that I use. The Brahmi Amla doesnt have that much of a strong smell. I mix both oils together in a ketchup squeeze bottle I got a walmart for $.97. When I first both this oil my hair was just creeping to the top of my shoulder blades. Now it is past my shoulder blades. I could not believe it. It seems to have grown so quickly. I also noticed that the Shikakai oil did indeed clean my scalp of sebum build up. I used to have dry scalp that would flake like crazy but within two weeks it was gone. I used to put it on every single day and now I just put it on at the weekends. My hair is soft and healthy and so is my scalp. Please be aware that everyone&#x27;s scalp and hair is different and it may not work for everyone. It doesnt hurt to just try it. Keep that in mind when you read these reviews because more than likely you may be reading a review of someone who didnt use the priduct as they should or lost interest when they didnt grown 10 inches of hair over night. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is a good brand. I received it earlier than expected in excellent condition. This brand gives you good value for the money.</li>
    <li> So I bought this oil for my hair for all the reasons others have stated.  Hair growth, strength, density etc. The first night I got it I went ahead and slept with it on my hair.  It does smell very bad but with a shower cap it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The worst part was the shower cap itself but oh well.  I did then mix a little the next day into my powders.  Again with a shower cap the smell wasn&#x27;t horrible and left the paste on for about an hour.  I shampoo/conditioned my hair and made sure everything was out.  I did dry my hair as well and the smell seemed to be completely gone.  HOWEVER you cannot get rid of the smell completely.  A few days later I went to get my hair cut and as soon as it was wet the smell was back.  Also I am a person who works out and sweats a lot.  I was so embarrassed by the smell that I had to leave spin class early and have completely removed this oil from my routine.  I do still use amla powder but it does not leave such a potent lingering smell as this amla oil does.  I have switched to the vatika oil instead and although it doesn&#x27;t smell great from the bottle there are no after effects and I can now go back to doing my regular spinning and body pump classes.  I guess this oil is ok if you don&#x27;t sweat, plan on getting you hair wet in the vicinity of people or don&#x27;t mind walking around smelling like rancid, old, stale perfume.  But I would suggest looking at the vatika oil instead and love love love all of my powders that I am using on my hair and face.  But this product was not worth the money, as stated go try the vatika oil instead.</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell. It also has mineral oil in it. Does it work? I need to give it some more time since I just bought this product to see if does help stimulate the hair follicle to make your hair grow long and thick.</li>
    <li> I really loved this oil it makes your hair shiny,managable,condition and strnghthens at the same time. who ever buys this product will be lucky and happy with what they brought. \\&quot;Just like my family memebers say\\&quot; you pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a oil, but I thought it would really moisturize my scalp and hair.  It is oily but it absorbs and drys out the hair, my hair broke off instead of growing out which is what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> SO I bought this Brahmi Alma Oil for my hair.  My hair has dry ends and I thought this was going to help out as the explanation on the back side of the bottle claims it should.  What happened is entirely opposite.  I felt as though I was actually rubbing baby oil onto my scalp.  It smells and feels just like baby oil  &#x3D;]  However, it was so bad on my hairs.  The next morning in my shower I noticed little peices of my hair everywhere on the shower walls and on my shampoo bottles, every where.    I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  What seemed to be so easy to use and gentle was DEFINATELY NOT.  It would be fine if it didn&#x27;t break off my hairs, and if this oil had a more natural list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll work for everyone, or that after only a few uses it made my hair ridiculously healthy and shiny. However, it did help a lot with my hair problem. I had destroyed my healthy hair by dying and bleaching multiple times...the end result being my hair having to be completely cut off it was so damaged. When it grew back, it wasn&#x27;t the same at all. It was dry, very frizzy, and broke easily. I bought this product and used it many times, besides being a bit of a mess, it did it&#x27;s job. My hair is much better now, strong and healthy, still a little frizzy, but not too bad. I&#x27;d recommend this oil to anyone with damaged or dry/brittle hair! It lasts a really long time too! I didn&#x27;t need to use the whole bottle to get my hair the way it is now and I have quite a bit of hair, it grew back fast after chopping it all off.</li>
    <li> As I went through the reviews, I noticed some women said it made their hair soft, others said their hair broke off.  I decided to give it a try.  I have natural, thick 4a hair, one try and this stuff DEFINITELY dried out my hair and made it brittle.  If your hair is natural, do NOT use!!!Some women with relaxers seem to like it</li>
    <li> i started out using this product, a bit too enthusiastically..it is not greasy, thus, i felt, my hair/scalp wasn&#x27;t well moisturized..it has a light scent - almost like chammomile, and can be worn in hospital environments..    if you use too much, you will notice an \\&quot;oil halo\\&quot; around the neck and shoulders of your clothes..if you&#x27;re wearing white, it will be a light green color..I was walking around the gym, and wondered why i was getting these strange looks...and was laughed at while i was work..no one told me about this \\&quot;halo\\&quot; until i took off my lab coat at the end of the day to see this light green seepage..or this dark seepage on my favorite workout sweat shirt...    otherwise, i use this, and the shikaki oil, intermittently, and they are definitely staples in my hair regimen..if used sparingly..</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first got this product. because I thought is was going to really grow my hair like it claimmed to on the back of the box, but I felt disappointed because it did not live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> The oil isn&#x27;t greasy on the hair and the fragrance is very mild.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The product has been working wonders on my hair. Its really good.. makes your hair darker, stronger and denser. The only problem was the seller, He didn&#x27;t provide any shipping tracking no. I was left guessing the arrival time. &amp; it took little more than the usual shipping time(around 7-8 business days).</li>
    <li> This oil is great for pre pooing purposes and to add a little extra special something to deep conditioning treatments as well as stream treatments. I am so happy that I bought this.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of this product. Also it has mineral oil in it.</li>
    <li> I think that this product is fantastic. I love how this product makes my hair look and feel. This product is really great for growing hair and making it stronger. It really does stop hair from falling out and breaking off. Thank you so much for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> This oil makes my relaxed hair feel extremely smooth and soft. After reading about brahmi amla and the properties the herb has, I tried it on my son&#x27;s skin (he has a bit of exzema) and it&#x27;s healing it super fast. It&#x27;s working much better than his prescriptin cream from the doctor! This oil (and the powder also) is a gift. Try it...you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  it makes my hair soft, shiny.  my hair is never the same when I stop using this.</li>
    <li> i live in a very dry place and your hair can take on hell of a beating here. Ive used this stuff for 1 year and my hair has grown so much 5 inchs total. I will admit the smell is something to get use to and you only need a LITTLE bit my hair looks thicker and my hairdresser loves that i use this and has recommended this to other people who have damged dry hair. i will advise this will make your hair grow like crazy and if you cant deal with the new growth then i suggest you use this product only once a week instead of every other day as i did.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for approximately 2 years on and off. I will simply say, if your hair is weak, breaking, dry itchy scalp and generally looks fried- you need this oil.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really an oil that you use daily in a heavy way. It is more of a put on the ends of your finger tips and rub into (massage) scalp oil- daily.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this oil is potent. One reason is, it has like three different mixtures of oils. Castor oil is good for the hair(growth) but I am hesitant to agree with having a mineral oil in the hair. Mineral oil is a fancy word for a derivative of petroleum oil. That does not mean it is a poor product. It could just do without these two oils( I think).&lt;br /&gt;Now, I admit I have used this over the past few years. I use it especially when my hair is lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;Dry.... or over processed. Like if I add streaking to my hair with a  bleaching agent it causes my hair to sometimes break off or look a bit brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS oil works if your hair is over processed, brittle or weak.  After you style hair you work some of this oil into your scalp with less concentration on hair length but more focus on roots n scalp only. Massage scalp with fingertips softly but all over head. I do this after a shower day or evening  but only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too much applied makes your hair, heavy and oily looking( especially for straight hair).&lt;br /&gt;For ethnic hair its great,really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other method of application for me is, similar to whats an indian head massage.&gt; You can buy this oil or simply take 1 part coconut oil, 1 part olive oil and 1 part castor oil and almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;you may warm product(oil) before placing on your hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;warm oil((use alot don&#x27;t be shy).&lt;br /&gt;pour over head starting at forehead hair line. pour down the parted hair row by row. let it drip down your hair (use a old towel to catch excess).&lt;br /&gt;keep pouring over head(scalp area mainly) until you feel it running down each parted hair line.&lt;br /&gt;then begin to massage( fingertips) on full head. softly but be firm with the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do this until you feel like the oil is no longer dripping but absorbed by hair n scalp.&lt;br /&gt;(10 mins)&lt;br /&gt;cover with a hot or warmed towel and hang out, do nails or watch tv- whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rinse hair with warm water thoroughly.  pat dry( or air dry as you style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is highly perfumed too. If you have a sensitive nose( skip this oil or use VERY sparingly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sometimes this oil gives me a headache because its so flowery and overly perfumed. It still works- my hair grows and is moisturized when I use this the first time and even moreso over the weeks with the daily(fingertip to scalp application after shower- this is the maintenance phase- just using it as a touch up once or twice during week to massage a touch into scalp during your day routine or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps..  do this until you feel like the oil is no longer dripping but absorbed by hair n scalp.  (10 mins)  cover with a hot or warmed towel and hang out, do nails or watch tv- whatever.  rinse hair with warm water thoroughly.  pat dry( or air dry as you style).  This oil is highly perfumed too. If you have a sensitive nose( skip this oil or use VERY sparingly).  sometimes this oil gives me a headache because its so flowery and overly perfumed.

    <li> This oil did wonders for my hair. My hair became dry and brittle from using an informercial product,and after reading the reviews for this oil I decided to try it.  Within one week my hair was so soft and shiny that I will never want to be with out this oil again.  Afican-American hair can be very hard to maintain especially in the winter combined with damage from a gel like product,so I would recommend this oil to anyone experiencing dry .brittle, and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I thought I was just ordering the Amla Herbal Hair Oil which I love for all types of reasons, from the shine it gives my hair to the way it makes my dark hair darker and softer.  This bottle was a little different but I&#x27;m getting the same results with a little less smell.</li>
    <li> Hmmm, ever smell something that takes you to a calm place? This oil will do just that. It is a good scalp massage oil. Use sparingly, it has a light green tint that can seep down to your neckine and show on shirts. Very pleasant scent. Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love it. As a African American woman, this oil is magnificent. My hair is quite kinky. [It] has totally changed the texture of my hair as well as growing my mane.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair oil for a few months now and my hair is noticeably longer and have hardly any hair loss.</li>
    <li> Today&#x27;s date is April, 20, 2011. I started using Hesh Brahmi Amla Herbal hair oil mixed with the Hesh Shikakai Herbal Hair for about two weeks now. About every few nights I mix the two oils together and massage my scalp with my figer tips (not my nails) and then I put on a silk bonnet.So far I have mixed feelings about this product. I first purchased this product because of all the high reviews it recieved. One of the things I like about this product is the way my hair feels in the morning when I wake up. I find using this oil,and massaging it into my scalp helps my hair to be more managable when I wake up. And I don&#x27;t have to put to much work in styling it. And it also helps stop breakage So that&#x27;s a major plus. As of right now it is way to soon to tell if this oil does all the things its promised to do like grow hair which is the main reason I ordered it. Since healthy hair grows 1/2 per month I expect six months to pass before I see major results.I&#x27;m also doing other things to help in hair growth like taken Biotin/ Nioxin hair supplements and getting my dead ends trimed, as of right now my hair is shoulder length. The Brahmi Oil can be a bit messy and it tends to drip down your neck and eye if you apply too much in your hair the smell is also a little over powering. I&#x27;m in college and I live with few other girls and none of them are a fan of Brahmi. But Beauty is pain, so I will keep using the oil for six months before I write another review. And doing any type of oil treatment is time consuming so if you don&#x27;t have much time on your hands I would not recommand oil treatments.</li>
    <li> I find that this oil is good to make hair growth faster but as soon as you stop using it, your hair will start to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I stopped using it is that my husband cant stand the smell.</li>
    <li> My hair is softer now.</li>
    <li> Excellent on keeping the scalp in good condition.  I sometimes use it as a leave in, and it works really good.  As a prepoo, the hair turns out beautiful.</li>
    <li> The ingredients from the bottle are below.  The product contains more vegetable oil than brahmi.  Vegetable oil is suppose to be a good emollient but if I wanted that in my hair I could easily buy a bottle for less at the store.  I found the oil did not absorb that well but then I saw it had mineral oil,and now realize why.  Also silicones can cause build up over long term use and does not do well with everyone.  I think for a really good oil that absorbs well stick to extra virgin coconut oil.  As for the smell, I didn&#x27;t like it.  The consistency is thin like coconut oil and the color is green.  Alma supposedly darkens the hair color but I wouldn&#x27;t know if this product would do so.  I threw it out after a couple uses.  I tried to like it but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients, for those who may not know the ingredients on the bottle is listed by the largest quantity to smallest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Centella Asiatica (Brahmi) Extract, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Oil, Phyllanthus Emblica (Amla) Extract, Parfum, Isopropyl Myristate, Evolvulus Alsinoides (Shankapushpi) Extract, Celastrus Paniculata (Malakanguni) Extract, Vitex Negundo (Nirgundi) Extract, Acorus Calamus (Godavaj) Extract, Cyclomethicone, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Cl 47000, Cl61565, Cl 26100</li>
    <li> I am sadden that I purchased this product from Amazon.com, when I found this product at my local grocer for cheaper. The oil has a woodsy smell but its bareable, I have noticed a difference in my hair, no more shedding and it is much stronger.</li>
    <li> it made my hair shed like crazy and i dont like that. used it about three times. threw away the rest</li>
    <li> The hair oil smells awful.  I wish that there was another hair oil that smells like shampoo.  Are there any out there?</li>
