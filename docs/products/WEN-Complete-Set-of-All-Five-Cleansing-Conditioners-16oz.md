      <li>Love WEN.</li>
      <li>It is the best I have tried, and I have tried dozens of different shampoos.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The products cost more than the shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>and my stylist was so alarmed by what was happening to my hair she made me go for blood-work to make sure I was OK</li>
      <li>My hair has become more manageable, softer, stronger, shinier, you name it.</li>
      <li>I also find that I can now go two days without washing my hair which is much better for it.</li>
      <li>I had to buy more of the wen cleansing conditioner as it makes my hair feel and look healthy and all of the one&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I decided to give it one more</li>
      <li>The fig is my favorite though</li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I will be using that and the almound more often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioners for about 9 months now, and my hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>After using Wen for 4 months, I am so pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>I am a shampoo/product junkie; Absolutly love this product.  </li>
      <li>Those of you who may have inherited that gene causing thinning or loss of hair, the absence of sodium laurel sulphate is the best thing that could happen to your hair.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to comb!</li>
      <li>I have a lot of healthy, fine medium/long length hair</li>
      <li>It has never felt so clean!</li>
      <li>I like sweet almond scent best and will buy the bigger bottles from now on.</li>
      <li>this hair product very good only need to use it once on your hair and give a condition and make your hair soft but have to use the product for a good 6 month to see result.</li>
      <li>However, I wanted to give them a try, and sure enough, fell in LOVE!!  </li>
      <li>Great products and fast service, however my only concern is the price, otherwise all good.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell a huge difference in the scents but this does not concern me as long as I get a beautiful head of hair as a result.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m so happy to have 5 different scents to use.  </li>
      <li>My hair is manageable and must be staying attached to my scalp because my drain is still free of hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair has never felt so light and smooth...</li>
      <li>I bought a set of 4 bottles last year with great anticipation based on the ads I&#x27;ve seen on Wen.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this cleansing conditioner.</li>
      <li>but I need shampoo for my hair to feel clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the sweet almond mint, but so far, the Tea Tree is my favorite, and I love the tea tree</li>
      <li>Some of the conditioners were better than others, but really all it did was create a build up on my hair.</li>
      <li>Anyhow I tried so many products in hopes of improving my hair, tried switching to organic, gave up my crimping iron, stopped coloring so much,</li>
      <li>I bought the sweet almound mint wen cleansing conditioner set.</li>
      <li>I reordered this pack (with 5 different bottles) to try all the different kinds of Wen Cleansing Conditioner and find the one that worked best for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I will probably try them all eventually, but this is my new favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Wen takes out the frizz and makes my hair soft, full and healthy.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed all of them so far!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle &amp; work fabulously.  </li>
      <li>Worth every bit of money you spend on it....</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference right away.     </li>
      <li>right?  </li>
      <li>My hair is Super soft shiny and free of tangles</li>
      <li>I massage it in but do not comb it in like they tell you to, and I leave it in while I shower and then rinse it out VERY, very thoroughly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product and love receiving all five scents!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and will never use anything else.  The first shampoo, i was disappointed.  My hair is fine and dry.  It didn&#x27;t work.  So I thought i&#x27;d try it again the next time I shampooed.  It worked and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since, 3 years ago.  I find that sometimes the almond mint makes it a little too conditioned, so the rep suggested I try the cucumber, it isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or conditioning.  I use it alternatively and am very happy with the results.  If you&#x27;re not sure which one to order you can always call the company to find out what they suggest for your hair type.  I found that the tea tree shampoo was the deepest cleansing of all of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hearing jenny mccarthy praising it. I suppose my hair is not like her hair at all. I bought the sweet almound mint wen cleansing conditioner set. it came with everything including a comb. the problem I have is that my hair may get oily sometimes but my scalp dries out daily. The wen products lasted about nine days for me until my scalp started to dry out so bad that I had to run out for a emergency batch of TGel. The unusual thing is that I hadn&#x27;t had to use TGel in quite a while due to using Paul Mitchell Tea tree shampoo and conditioner so in essence I suppose you could say that the wen conditioning clense put my scalp into a melt down of the dry flake variety. I gave my wen to a friend who had no scalp issues and she loved it. I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it for people like me, but for people like my friend it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Great products and fast service, however my only concern is the price, otherwise all good.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and have struggled my whole life with lifeless, straggly locks. I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioners for about 9 months now, and my hair has never looked better. I could never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly blonde hair and this is one of the first products that I have tried that works. I love it. It straightens my hair while eliminating the frizz, something that I could not do before with any other products (and I have tried many of them). It is true that it does not lather but who cares as long as it cleans my hair. I also find that I can now go two days without washing my hair which is much better for it. I cannot tell a huge difference in the scents but this does not concern me as long as I get a beautiful head of hair as a result. Love it!</li>
    <li> First, I have thick, wavy, dark hair. I also suffer from itchy scalp, so I was using a few different medicated shampoos with mixed results. The medicated shampoos (Selsun Blue, Head N Shoulders) stopped the itching, but made my hair look terrible. It was oily at the scalp and very frizzy on the ends.     So, I ordered this and gave it a try. It was weird at first, because it doesn&#x27;t lather-- I kept wanting it to foam up, and to tell you the truth, I haven&#x27;t quite gotten used to that yet. But even after the first time I used it, my hair was soft, silky, and not frizzy at all. I let it air-dry and then I flat-ironed it. Flat ironing took less than 5 minutes, and it was even shiner (my hair is cut just above the shoulder). And my scalp did NOT itch. This product has aloe vera in it, and I think that actually helps the itch and to heal my scalp.     Three people said the same thing to me that day, \\&quot;What did you do to your hair? It looks great.\\&quot; I noticed the difference right away.     I&#x27;ve also tried the sweet almond mint, but so far, the Tea Tree is my favorite, and I love the tea tree smell-- plus tea tree also has healing properties, so I feel as though this one will always be my favorite, and I&#x27;ll probably just use the other ones as my leave-in conditioner. I will probably try them all eventually, but this is my new favorite hair product. My flakes and itching are gone!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this cleansing conditioner. I tried all five, and my hair became increasingly greasy and smelly. Some of the conditioners were better than others, but really all it did was create a build up on my hair. I will not be purchasing anymore Wen, it&#x27;s a nice conditioner but I need shampoo for my hair to feel clean.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical the first time I ordered the Wen products.  However, I wanted to give them a try, and sure enough, fell in LOVE!!  I reordered this pack (with 5 different bottles) to try all the different kinds of Wen Cleansing Conditioner and find the one that worked best for my hair.  I have enjoyed all of them so far!  I always order the product to 2nd Day Deliver and it never fails to arrive the 2nd day.  I received a VERY helpful DVD with this order.  It taught me how to use the product properly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, if you ignore the bit about using 30-some pumps in each wash. The idea that \\&quot;more is more\\&quot; is an awful sales tactic, I guess. I have a lot of healthy, fine medium/long length hair and I use 4-5 pumps in the initial wash, then I do another half pump to full pump at the end as a leave-in. If you can leave it in for longer than 5 minutes, it helps (just like any conditioner).    I used to get a disgusting buildup of skin on my scalp, like a psoriasis, that would itch like crazy. Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, etc. did nothing. My stylist had mentioned this product had worked for some clients of hers, and when the itching finally drove me nuts one day, I broke down and bought it. No more scalp icky and one happy camper here. The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is not tossing your other styling products just yet - their styling cream and stick leave MUCH to be desired. I still use my mousse/gel/hairspray to style. Now if only it were cheaper. LOL</li>
    <li> I  like this stuff after my first use I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair its so much softer and manageable it works for me so far so good  but 1 bottle doesn&#x27;t last long with  me  I only can get about 5  washes from 1 16oz bottle wish it wasn&#x27;t so exspensive</li>
    <li> I bought this set to try Wen out, and I won&#x27;t go back to normal shampoo! It is the best I have tried, and I have tried dozens of different shampoos. Wen takes out the frizz and makes my hair soft, full and healthy. I like sweet almond scent best and will buy the bigger bottles from now on.</li>
    <li> Wen is amazing! My hair is so soft and has a ton of volume. It has never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to hair shampoos!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used this before.I love this product!! Makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to WEN cleaning conditioner. When I saw what a great deal this was, I HAD to order. I had my items in less than 48 hours. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy the Wen product after someone gave a me a sample of it.  I was amazed by the results and bought a set of all five cleansing conditioners on Amazon.  I was extremely happy that I received my order within a few days considering that I live in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before; ordered on ebay.  So, I knew I liked it.  I am a shampoo/product junkie; Absolutly love this product.  Just took some getting use to the shampooo not leathering up.</li>
    <li> I have tried the whole set of cleansers and I don&#x27;t like any of them. They have frizzed my hair out so bad I feel like putting a bag on my head. The scents are not very pleasant, to manly. I used them according to directions including applying some just before towel dry and still no good. Please don&#x27;t waste your $$$ and the shipping rate is out of the ordinary. I am now trying to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I LOVEWen! My sisers all use it and one of them bought me some to try. I have used nothing else since. My hair is very thin and oily and this works beautifully. My color lasts much longer between hairdresser appointments. I bought the spray volumizer as well, by WEN. Excellent. I purchased this 5 pack so I could send my daughters a bottle each to try! :o)</li>
    <li> I was introduced to WEN one Christmas, when it was given to me as a gift.  It looked and felt like a conditioner - there didn&#x27;t seem to be any shampoo in it, (this is a normal first impression, as we are \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; to expect for our hair to become clean, we must use shampoo that \\&quot;lathers\\&quot;) and I was really skeptical when it said that you should put a lot of the product in your hair, (use it up faster so you can give them money to buy more faster, right?  Well, by the time my hair was dry after that first use, I was a skeptic and cynic no more!! There is no store or salon product that you could convice me to trade my WEN for.  I ran out for a couple of days, and went back to using the half empty shampoo and conditioner of the expensive salon brand I was using before the day when I tried WEN for the first time.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that I used to think these products did a good job on my hair!  It felt so dry - it looked limper and the color looked duller somehow.  This is definitely a product worth trying - I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have bought 3-32oz. bottles already.  I don&#x27;t use as much per use of the product as is suggested, just 3 pumps.  My hair is naturally waving with frizzy curls around my face and I use a flat iron almost daily, I also have highlights, so my hair was dry.  After using this the girls at the salon can&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny my hair is.  When I go in for cut, or color I have no damage.  I love this stuff.  Wish it was less expensive, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Of course this is a great product but I only use it on the ends of my hair.  I have oily hair at the roots and dry on the ends since I process slightly.  I am 51 now and have to take a lot more pains to make my hair look....well...  like hair :)  This is a great procuct and at great price :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very dry hair. In the last year or so I&#x27;d been having problems with my hair falling out, thinning and breaking off - and abnormally so, to the point where I literally have one-quarter the thickness and my stylist was so alarmed by what was happening to my hair she made me go for blood-work to make sure I was OK (blood came back normal, still not sure what&#x27;s causing problems except maybe my age and hormones, almost 50).  Anyhow I tried so many products in hopes of improving my hair, tried switching to organic, gave up my crimping iron, stopped coloring so much, etc. and nothing helped. My friend tried WEN and loved it and purchased a set for me as a gift. I tried it twice - followed directions and didn&#x27;t like it - made my hair look dirty. But she spent so much money on it for me I decided to give it one more try I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!! First of all, I ignored the directions and just put less in my hair than what they called for. I think they call for like 20-pumps for my length hair, I only use about 6 or 8. I massage it in but do not comb it in like they tell you to, and I leave it in while I shower and then rinse it out VERY, very thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve been using WEN regularly for about 3 weeks now and can&#x27;t BELIEVE how much my hair has improved! to the point where I&#x27;m getting compliments again. The burnt-out coarse \\&quot;horse-tail\\&quot; hair is gone and it&#x27;s now soft, subtle and shiny!! I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my stylist next week to see her reaction.... THANK YOU WEN!! - PS for those who think the Almont-Mint smells too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, try the Pomegranate - smell is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> This cleanser by far is the best on the market. Well worth the money. Tried it once and now I&#x27;m hooked. I go to the beautician with my own cleaner. I used my other shampoo once after starting Wen and hated what it did to my hair. I will never use anything else again.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of 4 bottles last year with great anticipation based on the ads I&#x27;ve seen on Wen.  I have short hair and after several shampoos I realized I could not see any benefits to the shampoo.  The purchase turned into clutter sitting in the farthest corner of the cabinet under my bathrooms sink.  That being said, my girlfriend recently told me she loves the product so I have shipped her mine. I guess the result of using Wen depends on your hair.  I give it a half star based on my experience, but my friend would give it a 5.  I would recommend a new user to buy one bottle before investing in a larger set.</li>
    <li> I love the product its work good on my hair</li>
    <li> Shared with family and friends. Worked for some of us, but not all.  One major complaint was more hair loss than usual.</li>
    <li> Since the Wen cleansing conditioners have no sodium laurel sulphate (used in engine degreasers folks), it is gentler on the hair. After less than one month&#x27;s use, I&#x27;ve noticed an amazing difference in the condition of my hair (and I color treat). If you are one of those people who absolutely must have lots of suds when shampooing, you&#x27;re out of luck. Read the ingredients, compare to your current product and do some research. Those of you who may have inherited that gene causing thinning or loss of hair, the absence of sodium laurel sulphate is the best thing that could happen to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since December and I love it! I made the mistake of ordering via an informercial and ended up with products I don&#x27;t use but I remedied that by canceling my membership and ordering a la carte from Amazon.   I have long hair and it is color treated. I noticed a difference after the first use. My hair has become more manageable, softer, stronger, shinier, you name it. My hair dresser was amazed and has started using it herself. She&#x27;s one of those girls who changes hair color like she changes her mind and she loves it too.  My hair is a breeze to comb out after I wash it; in fact, I really don&#x27;t have any tangles when it&#x27;s wet anymore and that used to be a major hassle.  I&#x27;m a total convert.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to this product, and I think I&#x27;m addicted! No more messing with shampoo and conditioners...just wet your hair, apply the cleansing conditioner, use as you would shampoo (it won&#x27;t lather, but that&#x27;s the beauty of this product...it tingles the scalp and feels great!), leave in for the duration of your shower, then rinse as you would any other product. For added conditioning benefit (I&#x27;m Native American and tend to have coarse hair), you can add a single pump of the conditioning cleanser to your hair while it&#x27;s still wet, work it through with a comb or fingers, and then towel dry and style as usual. My hair has never felt so light and smooth...where has this product been all my life!?!</li>
    <li> I guess my scalp is too oily to use these products.  After the first use, my hair was fabulously soft and smooth... after the second use, it started to look oily at the roots and by day three, I couldn&#x27;t stand the oil anymore... I used shampoo. I am a little dissapointed... Melissa Gilbert really sold me on not having to use shampoo ever again. On the plus side, I do love it as an in-shower and a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Perfection in hair care... thrilled and happy here</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  I will never go back to standard shampoo/conditioner again.  This product is great for my hair type - which is fine/thin and super long - doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down and always looks great  :)</li>
    <li> The best product for my hair. I have always had &amp;#34; healthy&amp;#34; hair...but when I switched to WEN I realized how unhealthy it was. My hair is Super soft shiny and free of tangles and I always get compliments! Delivered as described and they all smell great!</li>
    <li> I, no, my hair is so glad I bought this! I have very fine, oily, long hair which is sensitive to bad products. Therefore I&#x27;ve always had to coddle it and spend gobs of money on salon products. I typically used Aveda and Abba, stuff like that. No longer! For about the past 6 months I&#x27;ve used nothing but Wen and my hair loves me for it! Before Wen and after 40 my hair really started to deteriorate. It would get so tangled just from showering I would sometimes have to cut the knots out! Since I&#x27;ve been using Wen, my hair has gotten stronger, easier to comb out, less breaking and splitting, and much softer and shinier. I have replaced my shampoos, conditioners, leave in conditioners and smoothing serums and use only Wen. I will never go back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to Wen and I do like it a lot, however as everyone else feels it is way too overpriced.  I&#x27;ve decided I will keep using Wen if I can find it under $30 a bottle, which is still WAY too overpriced, but I&#x27;ll cut corners elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I had to buy more of the wen cleansing conditioner as it makes my hair feel and look healthy and all of the one&#x27;s I have used smell really good as well</li>
    <li> I bought all these since I was always running low and forgetting to order each month- keeps me stocked up great product</li>
    <li> I have used the Wen products for over a year and love the regular almond but wanted to see how the others worked. First my boyfriend loves the TeaTree. My best friend tried the cucumber and fell in love with it because she says it rinses out easier. I love the lavender, which is not one I thought I would like, it smells really good and makes my hair shinny. The fig is my favorite though and I will be using that and the almound more often.</li>
    <li> Great Product, and Great Price; in my opinion, buying is bulk like this is the best way to purchase WEN; I have found that WEN is great for all hair types, and nationalities. Many times I may be watching a show on television, and see women and men with frizzy, dry, and dulling looking hair, and I think to myself that they need WEN with a quickness! WEN conditions the hair so well, that it stopped my split ends, I used to clip my ends every 30 days, just to get rid of the split ends, but I no longer have to do that since WEN.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and was happy to see that each bottle came with it&#x27;s own pump.</li>
    <li> Ok, just an ok product for my hair; wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  You have to use alot of this product, and even with thorough rinsing, my hair still felt dirty - not shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> this hair product very good only need to use it once on your hair and give a condition and make your hair soft but have to use the product for a good 6 month to see result.</li>
    <li> LOVE Wen!  And I&#x27;m so happy to have 5 different scents to use.  Most effective product for my hair, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to comb!</li>
    <li> I was losing hair at an alarming rate.  Each morning I removed a handful of hair from the shower drain.  I saw the dermatologist and tried several prescription products to no avail.  After using Wen for 4 months, I am so pleased with the product.  My hair is manageable and must be staying attached to my scalp because my drain is still free of hair.  When blow drying, I also don&#x27;t have hair all over my bathroom floor.  The products cost more than the shampoo and conditioner I used previously but if I take hair loss, dermatologists co-pay and prescriptions, into consideration, I&#x27;m ahead of the game.     The downside of WEN is customer service contact.  It&#x27;s impossible to call a representative to inquire about anything.  There are other websites to get the product which I will resort to if this problem doesn&#x27;t go away.  I love WEN and will go to great lengths to buy it but will not be ignored by their non-existant customer service.      Nannie (Myrtle Beach)</li>
    <li> Wen is the solution to frizzy hair days.  I have been using it since 2011.  I tried to go back to regular shampoo and immediately went back to wen.  Worth every bit of money you spend on it....</li>
    <li> I BELIEVE IF YOU USE ANY GOOD CONDITIONER AND NO SHAMPOO YOU GET THE SAME RESULTS AS THIS PRODUCT, THAT IS MY HONEST OPINION</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of wen, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years. I like the fact that you can order what you want and not have to be roped into a auto refill.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I will never go  back to regular shampoo!  For those who have had issues, the only thing I can think of is that they didn&#x27;t follow the directions to the tee.  I have oily roots &amp; dry ends.  Yes, I get oily faster if I don&#x27;t get all the product out of my hair, but the the ends are wonderful &amp; NO KNOTS EVER!!!  It&#x27;s gentle &amp; work fabulously.  Just make sure you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS on the package!  The one product I didn&#x27;t like was the styling creme.  It was too heavy for my hair &amp; attracted dirt.  I just leave-in a small amount of the cleansing creme on my ends &amp; it works for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel clean-not a fan</li>
    <li> Waste of money. My wife couldnt use any of the five bottles. All of these made her head stink. Biggest waste of 160 dollars ever.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve tried many other hair products, and nothing compares with it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Love WEN. My mom and sisters are balding-not me!!! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes the hair, smells nice, and my hair is less frizzy. I also feel like damage from flat iron is lessened while using this product. It is SO expensive but I am finding that since I wash my hair every other day it last a little longer.</li>
