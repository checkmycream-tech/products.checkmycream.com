<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Exercise and eat well instead, save yourself the time and money!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quality massager.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Still using prior product but brush is wonderful. Gave a raving review on prior order.</li>
    <li> Must have product if you are helping your wife battle cellulite!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this mitt. It works well in combination with the lotion I am using. I used to use it in the shower by itself, but it caused a bit of skin pulling. But if you soap-up your body first, it’s a lot better. Gets the blood going. Great product. Can’t beat $7 price.</li>
    <li> I pleased with my new cellulite massager brush mitt.  I tried it out this evening just to see what it felt like.  I rubbed coconut oil on my legs then used the massager as instructed. You just rub it in circles on your skin. It felt invigorating, like someone giving you a massage with their fingers. I plan on using it next in the shower, I think I will apply some body scrub to it and use it while showering. I thought that would take care of two things at once!&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I was able to purchase this at a reduced price in return for an review. I received no compensation and my review is based on my experience.</li>
    <li> I just received this several days ago but I love it already! I use it in the shower after I apply my shower gel. You just massage it on your skin in a circular motion. I have Fibromyalgia and CRPS and this massager mitt feels so good. I&#x27;m hoping to see some results just in time for summer. I received this for free and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Wow its pretty big and I just started using it yesterday night. Feels great, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me when I am massaging my body. Overall I am a satified customer! Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I used it in the shower with soap and a cellulite cream after Im dried off.  Im probabaly overdoing it but I can clearly see that my cellulite on my butt and back of my thigh are much smoother compared to before.  Ive only used it 3 days so far, mostly in the evening, after shower.  What a life saver.  Now I can wear shorts and short skirt again.</li>
    <li> great product. nice size! Make sure you read the instructions on the box before throwing the box away. There are no paper instructions. However the product looks and works great too. I used it last night in the shower! I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cellulite brush I have found!</li>
    <li> Better than the bliss one</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and is exactly as expected and seems fairly good quality and value for the price.  Thanks for the very fast customer services!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and shipping was very quick!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading reviews and talking with a friend about a similar item she received as a gift. I was intrigued about using it to stimulate my skin to release the extra fluids and toxins. The product comes in a nice little box with how to use directions and photos. It’s easy to grip and maneuver over your body. It has a white handle with pink nods of varying sizes.  I currently use the product in the shower with shower gel during my daily routine on my legs and hip areas. It has a great massaging effect and assists with dead skin removal. It is important to use some type of creamy/oil product to ensure the product glides easily over the skin, as to not irritate it with the rubber nodules. It is also great for massaging, if you can get your partner to massage your upper back area with a massage oil, releasing the daily stress built up in your back area. As no product can remove all fat on its own, it is encouraged to use in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise. I have just begun using this product and with the many areas of use, I plan to get a lot of use out of it and report back with great results and update to a 5 star review.  I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to share my unbiased opinion on this product at a reduced price, for the purpose of testing.</li>
    <li> Love this little hand held massager, it works great when fresh out of the shower in conjunction with lotion or body oil. It is not battery operated so no reason not to use it. The nubbys are all shaped and angled different to provide plenty of pressure. Perfect for any part of your body that is tired or needs some smoothing. *product received for review purposes.*</li>
    <li> Excellent fast shipping. High-quality product.  I&#x27;ve only been using the mitt for a week but I believe I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite.  I&#x27;ll update the review again at a later date with results. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful...I use it daily with my Bodishape cellulite cream!</li>
    <li> The pink rubber keeps falling off from the handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this brush in the shower and it is a lot more intense then exfoliating.  I love it and definitely feel the difference after use.  Word of caution: you can definitely inflict pain upon yourself with this brush so don&#x27;t use too much elbow grease ;o)</li>
    <li> Works well. Noticed results in three weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a week, but I feel it&#x27;s working! I&#x27;m gonna keep up with it and see!</li>
    <li> It is good for the price but would be better if the center would roll in circles</li>
    <li> This massager is incredible.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day since receiving it a week ago and I can already see a difference.  Shipping was very fast as well!  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mitt about 4 or five times and the pink rubber is already seperating from the handle. I really like the look and feel of it, unfortunately it is poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money, it wont hold up well.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see many results yet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! There definitely is a change in the appearance of my cellulite!!!</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened it I was so excited to try it and I was not  at all disappointed!  In just 2 weeks I have noticed a difference in the cellulite deposits!  My skin is firming up a little more with each &amp; every use!  I have tried tons of products &amp; this is the ONLY one I have seen change with!  Every night after my shower I sit on my bed and rub a little lotion on my trouble spots and massage it for about 20 minutes &amp; the difference is amazing!  This is by far the best product I have ever purchased thru Amazon!  It truly works!!!!  The handle is designed to fit perfectly &amp; comfortably in your hand with no slipping.  The brush is made of a soft but sturdy material that feels so great on skin when rubbed.  I even use it on my husbands back just to relax him &amp; he loves it just as much as I do!  I definitely recommend this product!  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest unbiased opinion!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It gets my blood moving and this helps to rid me of my ugly cellulite..</li>
    <li> Though I have only recently started using this item I can already tell that it helps. You definitely have to use some kind of lubricant or soap with this item and when you use it in a circular motion you can see and feel it working. Is the cottage cheese look gone?  No as it&#x27;s not a magic wand but it is better than nothing. I hope that with more usage with time the appearance of cellulite will be less and less</li>
    <li> this brush massage good my cellulite,I love it</li>
    <li> I got this Scala Beauty Cellulite Massager several weeks ago, not long after I purchased a cellulite cream.  I thought using both products in conjunction with one another would help to achieve better results, and I was right!  Because it is constructed with a plastic handle and firm, rubber-like fingers, you can safely use this in the shower, but  I highly recommend using the brush immediately following your shower, since the pores are open and your blood is already pumping.  I take my cream and thin it with some body oil for better and faster absorption.  I use it for a couple of minutes on each thigh, always brushing with medium pressure, in a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with stretch marks.  I use it on my abdomen with a stretch mark cream and I am also seeing results with this method, as well.  A huge factor is how greatly it increases circulation.  I use it every day, and it has only been a few weeks!  I know it is only going to get better.  Honestly, I can only see one area others might be concerned about, and that is due to the minimal discomfort when you first start using this.  As long as you use it with body oil and/or lotion, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all.  Just like wrinkle creams and supplements, this doesn&#x27;t work overnight.  It takes time to start seeing results, although your legs will feel great immediately because of the massage.  As long as you continue to use it regularly and have a little patience, I believe you will be amazed by this awesome product.  I received this little miracle worker at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased feedback and review. All statements refer to my own, personal experience.</li>
    <li> Good quality, was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it it works great</li>
    <li> The box that I got only contained the brush. There were no mitt, or cream, or anything else inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great, but I am very disappointed that the box was missing the rest of the stuff.</li>
    <li> Enjoying and all I do is brush up toward the heart. Be sure to use soap or scrub. Gets the circulation going which I need. See some improvement. I use in conjunction with a cream with retinol and caffeine and i also use seaweed powder baths.</li>
    <li> Just before I saw this, I was about to pay hundreds of dollars at a cosmetic salon for a cellulite massage. Lucky for me, I waited and found this massage brush on amazon... Since using it, I have noticed some changes in my buttocks. They appear to be more rounder and less cradled in thin clothing I normally would not wear. So that is a plus for me. Also, I only use it maybe once a day, but plan on using it more often to get better results. FYI: Before using the brush, please use a lotion with a thick substance so it doesn&#x27;t dry out very quickly, bc this brush will leave bruises on you if not.  I just received the item about a week ago and a half ago, so it is still under review and I will send updates in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and the customer service I received.</li>
    <li> Be careful if you bruise easily! I use this on my thighs and I look like a Dalmatian. I have lots of bruising. Have only been using this for a week, so can&#x27;t say if it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this is helping me. I use it to rub in Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream. I have noticed a slight change after about three weeks of using in the firmness of my skin. Granted, I also work out five days a week. I had issues with birth control that caused me to have weird-looking cellulite on the fronts of my legs. I also have the standard cellulite on the backs (top) of my legs. I was hoping this would get rid of it, especially on the front, because my legs are really muscular and not fatty. Unfortunately, the cellulite is still there.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has taken some getting used to. My legs have stayed bruised since I&#x27;ve been using this. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m bearing down THAT hard, so be mindful that you can bruise yourself and lessen up the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this since I already have it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:ca824ae78b5dc77f979af52f3327f45b]] I have finally found a beauty tool that works to help me feel better about myself. The first thing I liked about it upon receiving this item for review is the quality and size of the item. It is well made and perfect for anyone with hands from small to big. I say this because the handle is great and fits all hand sizes and works great for use in the shower. Once I started using this item i noticed it felt like a massage and it helps with the fat . I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it for women that are trying to work on their muffin tops.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;ve been using this with avocado oil. Won&#x27;t get quick results, but it feels super. Plus, you get a nice upper-arm workout. Fast shipping. Comfy grip.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure bout this product at first, looked like it would hurt...but it&#x27;s amazing...I massage it with soap in the shower and I enjoy it...now I will just wait to see the difference</li>
    <li> Horrible. After less than 2 weeks, the product broke. Before it broke, water got stuck in the casing. Really poorly made and I&#x27;m ready to return (once I get back from Europe). Hopefully, I will be in the return window.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker along with seaweed soap.  I also use skinny cream.</li>
    <li> This works as a fabulous massager. I use it every other day either with cellulite reducing cream or in the shower. I am not sure if this has reduced or altered the looks of cellulite but it does feel good when I use it. Sample Received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream and I must say that I really do see a difference. Twice a day I rub the cream over my stretch marks and cellulite and use this massager in a circular motion to rub it in. I try to put pressure on it ( I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference), but i must say that I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin in only a week of using it. HIGHLY recommend if you just want to improve your body without hitting the gym ( like me because i&#x27;m lazy)</li>
    <li> as described and quick ship</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this because ive used similar products.  I will have to admit it does show results especially when you use with a massage oil or skin cream!  Otherwise with out oil it  doesn&#x27;t glid on the skin and almost scratches instead of massaging . Even works great in the shower. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on days when its so hot outside i have to show my thighs! Now im prepared!</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this about four months ago and I really dont see any changes in the back of my legs. Dont buy!</li>
    <li> This thing really works.  I work out a regular basis.  However still have pockets of FAT..I used it a week now and have seen results.  I must caution you that you have to use with a lot of lotion or soap  in the shower.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this product. Used it twice and it broke. Its cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month on my legs in the shower (using shower gel), and it has already made a difference in my skins texture. Very durable and high quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now, and notice no difference.  It leaves me red and a little sore afterwards.  Makes a better back scratcher than anything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this massager brush daily, and it really works well. It actually does feel like a great massage!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. Nothing special really.</li>
    <li> At first was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but within the first 2weeks I saw a difference with diet and exercise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, and it fits well in the hand, easy to use and with nice material that is pleasant to the touch.</li>
    <li> Love this Massager!!  Just started using it.  Will have to wait a little while and give an update.  The surface is soft, not rock hard like other ones I have had in the past. Knowing that there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for cellulite, I&#x27;m hoping for improvement!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It is soft enough not to hurt, yet provides enough stimulation. I use it regularly but not sure if it really helps with cellulite yet. Be sure to use wet and with cleanser or it may hurt.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great and fits perfectly and comfortably in hand! Thank you</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered this mitt , it works good .</li>
    <li> Yes it does work! 5 star✨✨✨</li>
    <li> Love this item. I was skeptical at first, but after two weeks, I definitely see a difference. Skin is smoother and firmer. Cellulite is going bye-bye. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Using this almost daily.  I scrub pretty hard and have had bruising but that&#x27;s probably my fault.  Hoping over time that increased circulation to the area will help with cellulite.  It may actually be helping a bit after a month or so of use.  I don&#x27;t expect a quick fix so I plan on using this for the long haul and keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I like it. I think it does make a difference and helps to even out the cellulite bumps.</li>
    <li> I am using this massager every night with almond oil while I watch tv.  It has only been 1 week, but I have already seen an improvement.  The cream and gel I have used in the past were a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had absolutely no problems with my order. My item arrived and is exactly as image. I appreciated that it was kept in its plastic wrap inside its box .</li>
    <li> I use it the Cellulite Cream from Body Merry and it seems to work well :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> Just an ok product. Nothing to rave about. Probably would not buy another one either</li>
    <li> I like this product. While it tells you to use in the shower or with cream, if used in the shower, heavily apply soap or body wash with it so it&#x27;s slippery. While nothing &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; cellulite, this does appear to short-term tighten up the problem areas and reduce the appearance of the cellulite, which, helps visually speed up the effects of workouts and better eating habits. Less discouraging than having to wait weeks to see if something is making a difference when you can have a visual quick fix.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice in the shower. It really does create better blood circulation. Hoping to see some reduction in cellulite as time goes on. Do be gentle when using this though. The first time, I applied a little more pressure, nothing painful, just a tad tougher and I ended up bruising on my legs. You don&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure as you think, this product works!</li>
    <li> I bought this with a cellulite defense gel-cream.  The product helps work the cream into my skin better than my hands.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about one week and I can already see the difference!!!</li>
    <li> This tool is perfect! It provides a nice and firm massage. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much and expected to end up returning it.  To my surprise just after the first use the minor dimples on my outer thighs and bum were smoother.  My legs looked and felt more toned and smooth.  Excited to see the results after 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a few weeks, I have noticed smoother skin already.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> I used several times a day and I never noticed a difference... waste of money</li>
    <li> I think I used it too hard and I was getting bruising on my legs where I was using it, I took a break from it to let my bruises heal. I will try again and go softer.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for approximately 3 weeks and have not seen any results as of yet.</li>
    <li> This is a new item but I think it has real potential. It feels good and its easy to use in the shower. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Seaweed Powder for cellulite treatment. I don&#x27;t really expect to see a remarkable difference in less than a week but I do expect this to have benefit over time. It&#x27;s very good quality material and a fair price.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It works well with any cellulite cream or  regular cream.  Although I find it does not do such a great job rubbing the product in, it does feel awesome when massaging with it. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be fun to revive my habit of massaging down with one of these nubby little gadgets, like I had in High School (a million yeares ago) but the thing will just not stay together.  I use it for a few seconds and the pink part falls off the handle.  I hang it to dry in the shower and randomly......the pink part falls off.  In the middle of the night it&#x27;s terrifying.  Overall, cheap quality, probably doesn&#x27;t really work, but if it would stay together it would feel pretty good on my tired hips/thighs at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love the way the handles are for this brush mitt as it makes it easy to grab and use even in the shower.  I&#x27;ve been using it with coconut oil on my legs and I it&#x27;s already working.  It&#x27;s become a part of my nightly routine and I can&#x27;t go back to my old way of moisturizing my legs now.  This is such a wonderful tool to have.  I received a promotional price on this item for review purposes.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TRY THIS PRODUCT FOR LITTLE MONEY. I LIKE IT A LOT . MADE OF DURABLE MATERIAL, STRONG, EYE CATCHING FUN COLOR . IT IS A MASAGER, SOFT ON THE SKIN , I NOTICED LESS STRETCH MARKS AND CELLULITE ON MY LEGS AND ARMS</li>
    <li> It hurts I use cellulite creams oils almost EVERYTHING on this site, but this item is hard feels like its ripping my skin off idk maybe its supposed to be used for alot of cellulite that u cant feel if pinched, dont buy. Waste of money the things that are spike looking ARE SPIKEs hard plastic ones at that do not use unless u can scratch ur cellulite and cant feel it!! This is no joke either.</li>
    <li> I tried this product in conjunction with a cellulite sponge that had caffeine and seaweed. Neither product was effective at smoothing cellulite. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 6 weeks. It did, however, seem to decrease the pain I feel in my thighs from bad circulation. But the appearance of my thighs was the same. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s a great size, covers a lot of skin at once perfect for legs!</li>
    <li> I tried these massagers because I use them in a professional bodywrap treatment.  They are so awesome, I had to get one for my mom and daughter. Very stimulating but gentle. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> came quickly - interesting gadget</li>
    <li> Never used a brush before, but I have been using this now for about 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually helps, but I do feel like it assists in the absorption of the product applied.  It also makes it much easier to rub in than just using your hands alone.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see that is doing much and if it does you must need to do it everyday. Maybe in time it will . Jury still out on this.</li>
    <li> Easy grip without sliding hand out.</li>
    <li> It is hard to use. Use only few time and stop using it</li>
    <li> Still using it!!! Haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of difference just yet. Hoping it does something for me though :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it left a black spots on my legs even if I brushed  my legs softly it still left a black spots so I stopped using it .</li>
    <li> I love the products and look forward to the next sale</li>
    <li> I give this 3 stars because I feel as if it may work if I continue to use it, but more so because it helps me when I&#x27;m sore after the gym...</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin. Takes a while to massage all of the gel I use with it to rub out my cellulite. But it&#x27;s a overall good product.</li>
    <li> awesome!! so handy and easy to massage</li>
    <li> With this and a cellulite cream it helps with those areas like thighs etc. Have noticed a difference. For optimum results diet appropriately and exercise</li>
    <li> Works great.  Fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.  So convenient and useful.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Does it actually do anything? No clue. It feels nice though!</li>
    <li> I really like this rubber cellulite scrubber. I am using it on my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas together with a body lotion. It is very easy to use. Just massage your skin in circular motion. I keep it close to my tub for relaxing massages and to improve my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas. The massager should stimulate your skin and release toxins. Can be use on your belly, buttocks, thighs, arms or any problem area that you want to improve.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my cellulite deposits. I would recommend it to other people.  I use during my shower for about 60 seconds per leg.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its helping. Feels good though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional, and spreads lotions around as it claims. You know that you have used it because your legs kinda tingle afterward. But I havent seen a decrease in cellulite yet, it&#x27;s been a week. I will continue using it with hopes it will help reduce the look of the cellulite. The first time I  used it, I felt a little ill, could have been from toxins breaking down. So drink lots of water, to flush them out.</li>
    <li> This does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used it in the shower, as described, and it&#x27;s rubber so it just hurts. Then I used it with lotion, still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy a lotion or serum that works, this does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Using this everyday for about 9 days great to for circulation I&#x27;m sure with  exercise it can reduce the look of cellulite or fatty spots</li>
    <li> This massager works to smooth out the fat pockets and cellulite appears less visible.</li>
    <li> My Cellulite Massage Brush Mitt is great for improving circulation and I definitely feel tightening after my massage. I use it everyday for 30 minutes per thigh, usually right before bed. Be sure to use a cream or gel and never use on dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product came apart in about three days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now.&lt;br /&gt;1. I do not have as sensitive of skin as some have so when I used it I really worked it in my upper thigh area till it was a healthy pink/red. It got the blood circulation going and it felt great!&lt;br /&gt;2. I highly reccommend using it right after a shower or bath. Personally, I use it with coconut oil which is fantastic btw, and absorbs well into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Did I notice cellulite reduction? Yes! Keep in mind that massaging with this mitt is not the only thing I did to bring problem areas under control. Hydration, exercise and proper diet are KEY! If you&#x27;re willing to put the effort into massaging with the mitt every day (or even twice a day) in addition to the above, then yes! You will notice a difference. It takes effort, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Surprised that it actually worked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before (with lots of working out) and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to massage the Merri Body Cellulite gel in twice a day for a week and I can see a significant difference.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!! After 1 week I can already see a difference!!</li>
    <li> I just started using it and seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the point. It gives you pain in your arm when you use it...especially f you have to do it multiple areas.</li>
    <li> Works great, I am actually seeing results.</li>
    <li> It broke after only a few uses so I can&#x27;t say if it helps or not. It did leave a lot of bruises on me after a few uses</li>
    <li> Just as described, fast delivery.  I have used it once and it feels great. It really gets the blood flowing</li>
    <li> It actually works; I use it after a workout at the gym and it seems to be smoothing out my legs. I have only used it three times and I am seeing results.</li>
    <li> I really like the comfort of the brush. Seems to be working well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the pink part fell off and I had to put it back together.</li>
    <li> Great body brush, I absolutely love it and especially loved the fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a week now and I use this every night with my Andre Lorent Cellulite Cream.  I am seeing great results.  A must have!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean.  Just make sure you use lotion or cream before you use the brush.</li>
    <li> Used this with the Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and Retinol (0.4%) + 3 types of Seaweed - BEST Natural &amp; Organic Anti-Cellulite Treatment &amp; Body! Totally worked! Simple to use or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have completed  the  jar of cream. I&#x27;ll save it in case I need it again but I&#x27;m good for now!!</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> I have used the massager for a few time now and think it is just great! :)  recommend to everybody</li>
    <li> I hesitantly purchased this.  I didn&#x27;t think something like this could help with my cellulite (yuck)!  But, it was summer and I was desperate to do something without going to some spa and spending through the nose for some crazy procedure.  Well, I have to say, I&#x27;m happy to report that after only 5 uses, I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit of a difference.  Could it be that I may be dimple free very soon?  Looks like it!  Thanks so much for a great product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;Mind blown.&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite was visibly decreased after a week of use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Insane.</li>
    <li> This thing! I was so skeptical because I thought &amp;#34;okay, it&#x27;s just a textured plastic circle thing that costs peanuts. How the heck is THIS supposed to help my cellulite?&amp;#34; But I tried it and I LOVE it!  While I DO workout regularly, cellulite is a stubborn SOB and mines wasn&#x27;t going away anytime soon. I use this for a few minutes in the shower with soap about every other day to about 2 times a week. The first few times, you will get slight bruising here and there but that goes along with toughening your skin. After a while, your skin gets used to it, the muscle becomes tougher, and your legs get more toned. I&#x27;ve NEVER felt my legs this toned before. I couldn&#x27;t believe this thing works but it does. Also, I use coffee grounds while massaging with this. My legs are so smooth! The razor bumps on my thighs have disappeared completely as well so THAT was an unexpected bonus :D</li>
    <li> feels great again the skin with the creams I use</li>
    <li> I have not seen much results yet.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this massager</li>
    <li> I really like the style and the grip. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 10 days now, I don&#x27;t see improvement on the cellulite. I will continue to use, only time will tell, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it anyway, so why not. It&#x27;s good to improve circulation on the thighs even if that doesn&#x27;t really help w/ my cellulite.</li>
    <li> I had one of these in the past and it really helped reduce cellulite but you have to be sure to use it every time you shower. I soap up and use  circular movements on the areas I want to see results.I would have liked to see this one open so you could place a bar of soap in it, and also know which soap is recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the appearance of my cellulite since using this and a cellulite cream!</li>
    <li> So, I can see why people think that it makes a difference, but I think most of it&#x27;s just in my head.  If there is a difference, it&#x27;s miniscule, and I&#x27;ve been using this thing every day for about a month.</li>
    <li> Works great, but I have a torn ligament in my shoulder makes it hard for me to rub very long on one side, haha, but it does make the shin red which is bringing blood to the surface&lt;br /&gt;To bad my cellulite cream didnt work</li>
    <li> Love the product ...really gets the cream and oil i use into the skin. Love the massaging feeling. Great handle</li>
    <li> Fabulous for circulation and energizing your muscles first thing in the morning.  Simple to use and hangs easily on the shower door.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and I am using it with the cream I purchased. Hoping for the maximum results</li>
    <li> I first tried Lancomes one that you could put their soap in back in the last 1980s. It seemed to work quite well. Needless to say the discontinued it...stopped making them.  The key to theses are diligent and constant use...just like brushing your teeth. Also when you use these types of brushes you must relax your mind and body while using it...meditate on letting go and releasing toxins. Take your antioxidants and Iodine supplements (iodine is the trash truck for your body&#x27;s cellular waste). I use Iodoral brand 12.5 mg (I usually take half of one every day or ever other day...funny, a lot of chemo drugs are ultra high in iodine, hmmm.....most of us are quite deficient these days due to manipulation of the food supply.  Plus, like I tell all people, have you noticed that things are all sold separately now, meaning our vitamins and minerals. I recommend Celtic salt as it&#x27;s fully mineralized. (disclaimer- please check with your physician-although many these days will now admit they don&#x27;t know much about nutrition) do your own research and use your instincts on what may be right for you. These are just some common sense recommendations that seem to work well for me.  I&#x27;ve also been using a retinol cream too and place a heating pad under my legs and bottom to promote circulation. Anyway I notice this products bristles are nice and firm but don&#x27;t seem to hurt. Just use your body-wash or an oil when using.</li>
    <li> I will have to use the Mitt to see if this actually works for me.  At the moment, I haven&#x27;t used it much!</li>
    <li> It is great! I have been using this Mitt for couple of weeks now and I can tell the big difference already. It feels good too with my favorite coconut butter cream. I cant wait to wear my bikini with confidence. It is very easy to use. Seller shipped this product fast. Highly recomended!</li>
    <li> I have been using the mitt now for about 3 weeks and I can definitely see an improvement. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I am sure that with time and consistency I will achieve the results I am expecting.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t push too hard or you will bruise yourself! I use this to rub in my cellulite cream on my legs and butt and in conjunction with the cream I already see a big difference in a couple weeks!</li>
    <li> love it so far. i hope it takes away my cellulite.</li>
    <li> Love using it everyday in the shower. Just make sure you have lotion on b/c it hurts if your skin is dry.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! works great, easy to clean, perfect size and you really feel the massage in your legs! Love it and  im already recommending it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great product that helps minimize cellulite.  I use it at night right before bed.  I slather coconut oil on my legs and use the Cellulite Massager Brush Mitt in a circular motion.  I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Arrived perfect condition</li>
    <li> I like this and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars and thats because it kinda hurts when you rub it across your body and I rub it softly over my legs and butt, but it still manage to hurt, but other than that I can see a huge difference by using this along with body merry cellulite cream. Great price!</li>
    <li> I choose this based on customer reviews and am VERY pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am using it and I love it...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different and it hurts a bit. Maybe because it&#x27;s working? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> love the way my body feels after using massager feel energized and invigorated . can see a difference in the appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well so far!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet if this will do anything to break up cellulite but when I use a rich soap and give my thighs and back ends a vigorous scrub, I can feel the blood flowing. It feels great!</li>
    <li> Feels nice but I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to work on thighs</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any results yet, but have only been using for three days. It seems like it is increasing the circulation just under the skin, so that must eventually break down those lumps and bumps!</li>
    <li> Have been using for one month, it works, but now the nubs are worn down to almost nothing, I have to buy a new one</li>
    <li> Works great!  Been using for a week and already seeing results!  Using Skinny Cream in addition to the massager.</li>
    <li> Great product seems to be working!!</li>
    <li> It works OK. Not that great quality though.</li>
    <li> Feels like it works pretty well (judging after the first use)</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower!</li>
    <li> Love this. But you definitely have to use a cream or something with it.</li>
    <li> This seems to really work and isn&#x27;t painful as it looks. If you have trouble with cellulite, use with a cellulite soap and leave it on your skin in the shower, while you let your conditioner soak in, and use this to maximize results. I was wowed by how great they were.I am very happy to provide my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Just recently started to use this product.  Am still awaiting the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good after using it, so even if it doesn&#x27;t work, I like the massage it gives.</li>
    <li> Along with exercise and eating better, this beauty tool is helping diminish my cellulite. Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Try it with NeriumFirm Body Contouring Lotion, email me for details  [...]  Just WOW!</li>
    <li> This product is very simple and easy to use. Use with oils or lotions at night to massage the area. This product helps circulation to reduce cellulite and improve appearance.</li>
    <li> Great  colour. I was surprised by the size, it&#x27;s actually quite large, which I think is convenient (covers more ground). Definitely use with an oil as the silicon will tug on the skin. Only three stars because I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful! Great for shower use too, but again, the water isn&#x27;t enough of a lubricant.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Just started using it, but am confident I will see results soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay..  I tried to use it in the shower with some soap, but it kinda hurts.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my legs are sensitive?  Putting lotion on my legs prior was a lot better.  I don&#x27;t use it that often.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this yesterday. it arrived quickly. I tried it last night and i believe that its going to eventually make a difference but its much to early to know yet</li>
    <li> I used a massager like this before way back than in Brazil, couldn&#x27;t find another one that I liked until now. This massager is just perfect, I use it in the shower while I lather the soap so it slides and massages my legs and buttocks. I did get it through a great deal to share my honest opinion, and I am very pleased with it.My skin does feel smoother and I&#x27;ve been noticing improvements day after day. It is a great massager and I feel great after my showers now .</li>
    <li> I love the way this is made. It is comfortable to hold and use, and it is very well made and sturdy. It feels amazing to use! Use in a circular motion daily everywhere you have problem areas, and I would suggest even places that aren&#x27;t problematic, and it&#x27;s like a mini massage with the added benefit of ridding cellulite and other unsightly skin problems from your body. Definitely don&#x27;t use on dry skin. I would suggest lotion or some kind of firming or brightening cream so you can get even even more benefits from using them together.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product with a lotion that I also bought on Amazon and I love it. The material is very durable and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Using along with cellulite cream.  I&#x27;m not sure how this product will work because I have not used it long enough as of yet, but as of now, it&#x27;s very comfortable and has a great design.</li>
    <li> I have been using daily for the last 3 weeks.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> This is a nice massager.  It seems to work well and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I agree with others that it comes apart pretty easily but it is easy to put back together.  It&#x27;s ultralight and it fits the hand very well.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
    <li> I received my item. It is well made and easy to use. It is too soon to tell my final results but my body feels like changes are happening so I believe it will give me great results.</li>
    <li> Have to use alot of cream to get it to massage and move around. Hands do a better job, free tools!!!</li>
    <li> Great massager brush, really light and easy to hold. Good quality :)</li>
    <li> it at least gets circulation to those problem areas.  fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Did not work ..worse idea  they could think of. You cannot brush away cellulite it&#x27;s impossible .fast shipping but product was ineffective</li>
    <li> Great product. Can really tell its breaking up my cellulite! Would be nice if it came with a special lotion or deposited it somehow because I had to keep reapplying lotion every couple of minutes. Will try in the shower after reading other reviews!!</li>
    <li> I have been working on losing weight this year but have not been able to do much about the ugly cellulite areas left behind. Especially the ones around my midsection. I bought this massage mitt to use with my cellulite removal lotion - and it is giving me big results. I am very pleased with this mitt. I also really like the handle.</li>
    <li> Although it works, it is broken after 1 week. I can only say bad quality!</li>
    <li> Unsure of any results yet. Does increase circulation which feels good.  A little hard to hold with small hands.</li>
    <li> SO far so good!  I have only used it for about 2 weeks and I have noticed a little change in the cellulite!  It&#x27;s really easy to use and I do feel like it is working!  The seller was great and fast too!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it, uses it daily and says it distributes her cellulite so it doesn&#x27;t look so obvious. Great job, the results have been wonderful and I have been wanting to use something like this for a long time, just never took the time to order it!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product at the store before, but never bought it. After seeing quite a few good reviews on here, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using this on my legs for about a week now. I typically use it after the shower and use Shea butter with the massager. I recommend using lotion with this massager to make it a little less harsh, but the tips of the points are soft, so you can use it without if you prefer. So far, I&#x27;ve seen a little difference, but nothing major. I&#x27;m hoping that by the summer time comes, I&#x27;ll see an even bigger improvement. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week now, but I have high hopes for it. I also really liked the price. Much cheaper than lots of other products that claim to get rid of cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have not used it much yet but it looks and feels like it would help message away cellulite. I will update in a couple months</li>
    <li> good for massaging your legs and improving circulation. nothing great for removal of cellulite.</li>
    <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that It came apart...</li>
    <li> I got this for my girl friend, this is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars only because I do not know yet how well it will help cellulite. If it works I will change it to 5. I know right now it is worth the 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this a day now, so I don&#x27;t know if it reduces Cellulite yet. I had expected something small and kind of hard. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that not to be true. It is soft, and large enough to fit around my whole palm. When I got the box I tried it right away! I was sore from working out the day before, so I started there. It was very soothing and I could feel the blood stimulation in my legs. I have low blood pressure so this was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found this is a great back massager too. I had my boyfriend use it on me, and it really helped with the tension in my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how much it aids cellulite loss but I do know after working out it is a great way to sooth sore muscles.</li>
    <li> It does help the texture of the skin, but broke after two months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no big changes for me though.</li>
    <li> Seemed a little painful. Not sure it is of help.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any results yet, but it feels good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a difference though.</li>
    <li> I have used it for my belly when I took a shower for couple weeks, I didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it really does much. I have been having successful spa treatments for Cellulite.  &amp;#34;Cavi Lipo&amp;#34; is non-invasive and liquifies your fat trapped underneath the skin.  This must be eliminated by sweat, bowel excretion, urine and very importantly....through the lymph system, which is helped tremendously by massage.  I purchased this simple item to use in the shower to stimulate the thigh area.  It can only help!  Alone, no...not much help, I am sure.  However along with FDA approved non-surgical treatments for cellulite, it has to help get the fat moving.</li>
    <li> Works well for stimulation of blood flow and used daily helps reduce appearance of cellulite from my experience. I really enjoy using this brush in the shower</li>
    <li> Thank you for the super fast delivery will buy again</li>
    <li> Now that spring is here, I am working on getting into shape for the summer season.This Cellulite Massager Mitt I have already had success with. What I do is massage in sesame oil and then use this mitt three times a day for about 8 minutes each. Also I have been doing speed walking and other exercises.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that this is working as the back of my legs are looking firmer and also smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am a real person and a real customer .... this actually works!!!</li>
    <li> la la love it.&lt;br /&gt;Use lotion (like a lot or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself) or oil.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Well after using for the last week, of course I can&#x27;t see the difference yet but I can say that it sure feels as if it should be massaging the tissue.  Great shipping time on the item.  So far so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally sure if this is working but it feels like it does. When used in conjunction with exercise, I think it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I am shocked at how much I love this product and the results I have seen. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend - I use this along with an anti-cellulite cream and have noticed a substaintial difference.  It really gets the circulation going which is just what you need to see inprovement.  I also increased my exercise and watched my diet - I do however believe that this product, when used daily and vigorously WORKS!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> After two weeks my cellulite is smoothing and my sking is looking better each day&lt;br /&gt;Convined with vitamin E oil it does wonder on mommy ... Great</li>
    <li> Im not sure if it really does anything...?</li>
    <li> I Just want to start out with that I also use this product with Body Merry Cellulite Defense cream. So keep that in mind. I&#x27;m pretty athletic, and have a good amount of muscle, but lets face it. I&#x27;m also female and have those lovely trouble spots. With this, I feel like I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference and a better feel to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to use in the shower, and massage out some sore muscles. Also, I&#x27;ve seen a better clarity in my skin, not so many bumps and things on the surface. That&#x27;s a good start. It&#x27;s also made with good quality, and creates a good lather. Easy to clean, rinse off, and dry. I would definitely recommend this to someone else. In fact, gonna spread the love to my family.</li>
    <li> works well,just make sure you use with body wash soap not try to use it dry it glides great when soaped up.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  The brush seems to be working.  I use it in the shower twice a day with a body wash.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it with  cream on my arms and it really does the job. The delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Received this today and was very excited until I used 3 times and the pink part separated from the handle/rest of the unit.  I am one handed so hard for me to put back on but it keeps coming off.  Very disappointed someone would sell this so cheaply made.   I taped it up and its been staying.  Its helping my cellulite and I&#x27;ve had a stroke so I used on my affected arm and it helped take out some of the knotts and soreness!</li>
    <li> I do see a difference, but I need to make sure I use it each day in the shower.  I think you need to be persistent with this product to see great results.  I saw minimal change but enough for me to see that it would work with constant use.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working, ez to use, don&#x27;t need a cream or water running. Just do it after finished showering. We shall see the visual difference in a few months I guess.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything</li>
    <li> Not flexible at all.  With sensitive skin, bruising can occur if pressure is used.</li>
    <li> It came apart at the seam between the white and pink sections the first day that I used it.  And even though this product was defective the seller charged me a return shipping cost!</li>
    <li> On using d brush the first time, the pink cover came off while brushing in an up and down movement, I had to fix it and cintinue using it. On the second day of use , same thing happen twice, truly very inconvenient as u have to stop brushing, fix it, washed your hand n start all over again.</li>
    <li> It was awful. It was a complete waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I do not know if this product will actually reduce the appearance cellulite (the concept seems sound enough though), but I am using it to help massage my tummy tuck incision scar (after the scar was closed completely). I use it twice a day, gently on the incision, and I feel like it has sped up the healing process. My scar seems to be improving much quicker than my previous c-sections ever did (without massage).</li>
    <li> I, like others, used it on just one leg for a week. I was seeing results on the fifth day! Started out using coconut oil, but it&#x27;s kinda messy outside of the shower. So now I just use it with body wash in the shower. About 5 minutes total, switching legs and places periodically. Butt, thighs, etc. Immediately afterwards, your legs will look kinda red and puffy, but then it looks so smooth.... beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that if you stop for more than a week, the cellulite starts to come back a little. Not as bad as before, but still noticeable. I&#x27;d say a few minutes every couple days would be good. Keep it in the shower and it&#x27;ll blend right in to your routine :)</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  So happy with the purchase.  Saw improvement on the backs of my legs within one week!</li>
    <li> Already seeing results with regular 2 x/day use.  Certainly can&#x27;t hurt!!  And also massages my tired quads after working out. A plus!!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Feels good.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this for a long period of time, but massage feels good</li>
    <li> I have tried all types of cellulite massagers. I even tried a cellulite serum. Nothing has worked as great as this brush mitt.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for more than 4 months and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was quiet skeptical while ordering the Cellulite Massager. But I am happy I ordered it. I have been using it for a month and I can see a lot of difference. I use it while showering with a cellulite oil or cream. I use it for 5 min daily. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works great. Didn&#x27;t see results as fast at others but I would totally recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I had been using a different product and after about 2 months I realized that I was not seeing any changes what-so-ever. My best friend told me about this product that she had purchased off of Amazon. She had noticed a big difference in her thighs after a handful of months and her rave review was enough for me to come on here and purchase one for myself. I had already gotten into the habit of using my old brush in the shower and I figured before giving up on the concept all together I would replace my old brush with this one. I used it for 2 months (like I did my old one) except this time I saw the results. I need to be clear that these changes were small and did not take place overnight, but they are definitely there. I had been using this once, sometimes twice, daily in the shower on my butt and thighs and I have really noticed a difference. I plan to continue using this product each day as a part of my shower routine and I will definitely be recommending this product to everyone I know; a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have lost almost a hundred pounds in the past year and a half. I have some minor issues with cellulite on my tummy and very mildly on one of my thighs. Somewhere I read that cellulite massagers were often a big help. Coincidentally, I was offered the opportunity to receive this Cellulite Massager Brush Mitt during a promotional period at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My massager shipped quickly and arrived quickly. I put it to the test the first night that I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cellulite Massager Brush Mitt consists of a Roller Massage Plate and a Handle that is comfortable to grasp and use. It is recommended to use the Massager after lathering up in the shower or by applying oil or cream to your skin. Then you simply just apply a comfortable amount of pressure to your skin and massage it into a circular motion. I use it on my tummy and my thighs. I do that and just evenly go over my entire tummy and each thigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my Scala Beauty Cellulite Massager Brush Mitt for around 3 or 4 days now and I have seen a dramatic difference. My cellulite issues are no longer an issue. I use it each day in the shower. That is my preferred way to use my massager. It just effortly glides across my skin once I am lathered up very well with body wash. I am totally satisfied with my purchase and very happy to have discovered such an easy tool to deal with my cellulite issues. I also workout 3 times a week for 30-45 minutes so the combination of the two are simply awesome.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this Mitt, as long as you&#x27;ve got an oil or serum or even lotion on before you use it. It&#x27;s great. Plus it&#x27;s cute. Haha</li>
    <li> I think it actually helps.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I had one like this in the past but it broke. I was so happy to find this one. It got here fast and it was just what I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> This massager feels so good! I&#x27;ve still got a stray patch or two of cellulite on my thighs that the gym hasn&#x27;t fixed yet that I wanted to try it on, and turns out this massager feels amazing the day after leg day when my hamstrings are screaming! With just a bit of pressure I can feel the massager deep into my leg muscles and really doing a number on the leftover fat! It&#x27;s large and easy to hold, and fits well into my gym bag. It works great with body wash and lotion, and I&#x27;ve found myself bringing it into the shower with me regularly! I love the bright colors and sleek design as well. I&#x27;m so excited to keep using this massager; if it feels this good I an only imagine how great it&#x27;s going to make me look! I did receive this product at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how great it feels, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> The pink part fell apart and I can&#x27;t secure it also it sticks back for a little while</li>
    <li> Saw no results, but it is a nice massager.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft... I&#x27;m continually using it although I couldn&#x27;t use the cream with it due to allergic reaction, I still use the brush.  I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the appearance of cellulite so even if u can&#x27;t use the cream, the brush will help also if u can use lotion with aloe or cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Okay i could have did better.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  Granted, this does not work just overnight. But over the course of 3 weeks, maybe 4 times a week; an amazing difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried other massagers to help with my cellulote problem and this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;I used it and could see results almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a chance to get a discount if I gave my honest unbiased opinion of its quality and usefullness.&lt;br /&gt;Wow am I a happy woman because its amazing and the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to but for even faster results pair it with a high quality cream.&lt;br /&gt;I give a five star rate because it is very well made durable and works with amazing results.</li>
    <li> This item need to be use with cream, is very handy</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect size so its easy to grip.</li>
    <li> I really like it when used with creams</li>
    <li> Only used it for a week, but skin is smoother, but I do have some bruising?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I actually followed the advice of a review I read on this product. I really watched my diet, worked out and used the massager plus cream two times a day. First day I had bruising and my cellulite looked worse but I stuck with it. I have now seen and major turn around and feel better wearing shorts!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this massager. I use it along with the Bliss Fatgirlsoap while in the shower. It smooths along the skin well and really feels like it&#x27;s breaking down the fascia and helping reduce cellulite. My thighs are red for a few minutes but they&#x27;re definitely smoother. I like this better than the rolling one because this one you can push harder to massage, so it feels like it does more work.</li>
    <li> I have been scrubbing with this for a month usually 1-3 times a day and sometimes a day or two are missed. I have only done the right thigh so I can easily compare results. After a month I finally see results so I am doing both now. Very happy &amp; highly recommend as I work in cosmetic surgery &amp; even that is not a guarantee to rid cellulite.</li>
    <li> I been using the massager brush over 3 weeks now along wit the retinol cream. I&#x27;ve seen alittle difference. I am doing it twice a day for 15-20 minutes circular motions as suggested results are not wat I expected.</li>
    <li> Seller was so fast and excellent communication !&lt;br /&gt;This product is okay as just a body scrubber BUT it takes some elbow grease and is time consuming if you will get results. It did drop a few times in the shower as I scrubbed vigorously and came apart but I easily snapped it back into place. I think it will take a long time to Honestly see any difference , this is more to break down the fat eventually I&#x27;m sure . I will stick to my CONFIDENCE vibration machine to combat my cellulite as I have seem tremendous results in short time using it , that is serious breaking down of fat and I would highly recommend it as I purchased it here on amazon after using it at a local body sculpting place after a cellulite treatment . For me personally this little brush is not going to smooth my cellulite out , it&#x27;s a nice thought though.</li>
    <li> Love this brush helps smooth out bumps</li>
    <li> Great product, it works well.</li>
    <li> It was uncomfortable to use.  I like the natural bristle brushes better.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my cellulite cream and this piece of s*** came undone as I was (midway) massaging my thigh. The pink, \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; part can be removed by turning and I find that circular motion can cause this to come undone. It flew onto the ground and I&#x27;m not picking it up and continue using it on my body after that. It&#x27;s filthy! If you don&#x27;t want the hassle of stopping and washing it then stay away!</li>
    <li> The rubber \\&quot;sponge\\&quot; part is uncomfortable to rub on your skin and makes a sound that has me react with a cringe. Stick to the regular bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few time  and can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> I use in the shower, with a dab of bath soap.  Only use on thicker fatty areas, as thinner areas are going to hurt!  I carry most of my weight in my thighs, and it doesn&#x27;t actually hurt there, nor on my bottom.  Just kindof a DEEP massage feeling.  But on my thinner areas, it&#x27;s quite painful.  I don&#x27;t see any results yet, but I&#x27;m not as diligent as I should be.  :-)  What can I say, it was an impulse buy.  ;-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works yet but seems to massage well. I&#x27;m trying to get rid of cellulite on my thighs. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to hold. Looking forward to reduce my Cellulite</li>
    <li> After using it for 3 weeks I can see some difference.  I don&#x27;t think it will totally get rid of my cellulite, but even a small difference makes me feel better.  The first time I used it, I rubbed too hard on the inside of my legs and I had bruises. It&#x27;s best to use in the shower with liquid soap. It doesn&#x27;t move on your skin without it.  Even if I find it doesn&#x27;t take away my lumps &amp; bumps I will continue to use it.  I have some nerve damage in my legs and the brush helps by stimulating them. I think the best thing for cellulite is exercise.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I keep it in the shower and use it on my problem areas in circular motions. It really gets my blood flow going! I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it will make a significant improvement, but knowing my own body, I feel like it has definitely started to!</li>
    <li> Well... I don&#x27;t have any complaints.. Slight change in the cellulite.  I couldn&#x27;t use the cream but I&#x27;m still waiting on results on using another skin cream.  The brush isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with the cream and It does work better.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Came apart immediately.  The circular motion you use to utilize it is the same motion that separates the top from the bottom.  Will not stay together.  If it would, I think that it would work, though the hard plastic handle is painful on the sides of your hands when you slip your hand through it to get some traction and on your knuckles when you grab and hold it.</li>
    <li> I love it, easy to use and it&#x27;s getting the job done</li>
    <li> I have no idea whether this works for cellulite removal, but it sure works as an exfoliator at keeping rough patches like elbows, knees and buttocks baby smooth.  After use, my skin felt tingly and flushed indicating the mitt was stimulating circulation to all areas used, including the cellulite prone areas. I believe it could work on cellulite, together with diet and exercise that is.</li>
    <li> it don&#x27;t do any thing</li>
    <li> Great product, I really feel the difference in my skin when you apply with my regular cream of choice, I totally recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see the benefits...but i will NOT blame the product! i&#x27;m very aware that diet, exercise, water consumption, stress, and genetics play a role in cellulite. My Dominican-wide-hip-big-butt body has been accumulating cellulite throughout my 49yrs of life; if i&#x27;d have been smarter, i&#x27;d have taken care of it in my teens/early twenty&#x27;s. At this point in time, i&#x27;m taking better care of myself so that it doesn&#x27;t get worse (i&#x27;ve seen my aunts&#x27; thighs and it ain&#x27;t pretty, lol!) by eating better, drinking more water, exercising 5x/week, and will TRY to be more stress-free. The combination of this product and my essential oils can help but i&#x27;m not expecting an overnight miracle. It&#x27;s taken years to add on the layers, it&#x27;ll take a few more to get rid of them!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush mitt twice a day in the shower. Then I apply the Evelyn Slim Extreme 4D serum. After 2 weeks I could see an improvement in my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with oil before shower, with shower gel in the shower or after shower with a anti-cellulite serum. In my opinion improves cellulite more than any lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after 4 weeks, I am still where I was after the first 2 weeks. Probably this is my final destination. I will continue using the mitt + serum to maintain the results. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. It helps, a little...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost two weeks.  I use it in the shower with a cinnamon and coffee soap.  I do my legs, thighs, but and arms.  After a week I could see my legs smoothing out.  I have a lot of dimples on my but and lots of cellulite on the back of my legs.  This brush mitt really does work.  You have to use it diligently and also eating healthy helps.</li>
    <li> I really was skeptical about this product but thought what the heck I will try it ! I am pleasantly surprised it has really helped !!! I recommend this massager to everyone !</li>
    <li> Fast ship. Product working well so far</li>
    <li> I am on my second  day and it broke. I was able to fix it back and it works again. Since it&#x27;s day two  I didn&#x27;t expect to see any change in my cellulite,  I am consistently using it twice per day with  castor oil. I will write another review in a month&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> The opening in the middle cuts into your hands if you put pressure. The design can be adjusted and be more ergonomic.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to stimulate and smooth the tissue.  I had purchased one of these many years ago through Lancôme and it was effective but also much more costly.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now. Although it did not eliminate all signs of cellulite my skin looks more firm and healthy than before. I will recommend it to anyone who suffers from it.</li>
    <li> I will start out by saying that this has pretty much changed my life. It is amazing. Why does no one seem to talk about products like this one as much as they do creams?! I am a swimwear photographer and I know that almost every single girl that I work with has cellulite, and if swimwear models still have it, God help us! This has worked so well for me that I got one for my mom and she recommended it to her friends too. Obviously it will only help you if you are trying to live somewhat of a healthy lifestyle in the first place, but if you are one of those people that still have cellulite no matter what you do, this will actually help!&lt;br /&gt;It hurts at first and you have to be consistent, but so worth it. Sorry for the freak out. Done.</li>
    <li> It works well if you apply lotion to the areas you want to massage or even soap or body wash while you&#x27;re in the shower. My skin gets red when I massage it with this brush but I consider it a good sign since a brush massage should be intense and energetic for it to generate results. I will continue using the brush until I see external results.</li>
    <li> Dont bother I saw no improvement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty much every day for the past 6 months and definitely noticed a decrease in cellulite appearance. It totally fell apart after exactly six months, the pink portion just ripped apart. Will buy a replacement.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results from this item. I use it everytime I shower but notice no change in cellulite.</li>
    <li> Feels great as a massager and can be used all over the body. A tad stiffer than I thought it would be but perhaps with time it will soften.</li>
    <li> The first time i used this, it broke, i had to snal it back together  I have been using this product for a week in the shower, have noticed a difference in the skin. Hopefully in a few weeks i will have greater results!</li>
    <li> Works great, product does feel great when massaging my legs. I do clean after every use with a little soap and warm water product seems to be holding up just fine. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Great tool, it really helped me to make cellulite less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have to say most things I order never live up to the hype or reviews, but this one has far exceeded my expectations.  Ok, I&#x27;m on the thin side, but being over 60, my skin is thinner that it use to be and shows every bump.  I have spent a lot of bucks on products over the last few years, hoping to find something that worked.  Who knew it could be so simple as this brush.  It has been over 30 days now, and wow what a difference in the appearance of my legs, butt and stomach.  My legs and stomach actually look toner and not so flabby.  I use this every time I shower with a body scrub and it has my tights and butt looking better than they have looked in the last 5 years and my stomach is flatter.  Though the first few times I used it, I scrubbed so hard, I made bruises on my legs, so be careful.  Can say enough about how great this product it.  Who knew!  I&#x27;m actually down a size in my jeans.</li>
    <li> It did help smooth my legs.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush mitt! It&#x27;s great and if you move in a gentle, circular motion, at a decent speed...you will avoid having your hand slip out or avoid hurting your skin. I saw some improvements in skin but I also workout, eat right and apply vitamin E oil on my skin every night to improve my skin.</li>
    <li> This must be my favorite item I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon so far.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday in the shower with some body wash, on my legs, arms, butt, and stomach area.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm! So far my body has made a dramatic change in just 3-weeks.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is looking for a quick fix, forget about it. It takes patience and time with any product.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t any magic pill or product with that effect on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this product as much as I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this mitt to help massage lotion into my skin--and hopefully break down some toxins that are trapped in my body fat!  Last night, I used it for the first time and I have to say I am really impressed by the texture of this mitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mitt has a comfortable handle that slips nicely over your hand.  The pink park of the mitt is actually made from a firm, rubber-type material that flexes a little as you massage.  With each stroke over the lotion, I could adjust the amount of pressure that felt comfortable.  During the massage, I noticed my skin becoming slightly flushed from the increase in circulation to the area.  It felt amazing--like a firm massage should.  The mitt does not absorb your lotion or cream, so you&#x27;re not wasting any product by using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed areas of my body where I had missed applying the lotion, because the mitt pulled slightly on my skin (do not use the mitt on dry skin!).  I liked the idea of this because it made me more aware of my application technique and I could quickly apply the lotion to my missed areas.</li>
    <li> I think this really works and it feels great too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and does a great job.I use it to help massage the skin during a cellulite body scrub.</li>
    <li> Handle is WAY to big. Too difficult to hold or use.Very unconfrontabke. Tried it once and threw it away. Not a good product. Should have ordered the wooden brush with bristles instead.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually been using this long enough to know if it is working or not.  I will tell you that it feels really nice to use. A little leg and butt massage never hurt anyone!  I have fairly big hands (bass player, guitar player and pianist) so this fits my hand snugly, which I don&#x27;t mind. But, I can understand why some people with small hands have left complaints about it. Personally I love it. I don&#x27;t think it feels cheap either (some reviews have stated this). It&#x27;s lightweight, but feels sturdy enough to me. Will update later.</li>
    <li> it best help you for anti-cellulite</li>
    <li> Love pink. I had a similar massager from Bliss a few year back and it was time to replace it. It works reasonable well to stimiulate tissues and I ysyally use it with my massager interchangeably. Every little helps.</li>
    <li> Only have been using it for a few days. Order came quicker than I expected.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product, thanks!</li>
    <li> This does feel good to rub lotion on my legs, but  I don&#x27;t think it has made a big difference on cellulite appearance.  If you bruise easily, be careful how much pressure you apply as bruising can occur.</li>
    <li> This thing broke during the first use. The pink part fell off. You can connect them again but then it fells off again. Meh. Cheaply made stuff. I would NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very useful, very convenient. Just bought it for 2 weeks, looking forward result</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this tool before buying it, did not believe all the claims in the description. However, it does work! My skin looks so much better than before! You need to be very diligent and make sure to use it every day and stick with it even if it hurts and uncomfortable (the first couple of times). The first week I did not apply too much strength (when massaging) as it really hurt. In the consecutive weeks it became less painful and even pleasant! I have been using it every day for about 5 weeks now, and I definitely see significant skin improvement. I keep my “mitt” in the shower for easier access and use it with soap for easier sliding. I would not suggest it to use it just with water as there is too much friction, and there is a huge possibility for bruising. Overall, I am very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I am realistic to know there is no magic wand for cellulite but because of all the positive reviews, I thought to give it a try. I did not have high expectations but think that I may notice some temporary smoothing of the skin. I used it for 2 weeks daily followed by an anti cellulite cream which had great reviews also and unfortunately other than the few bruised areas did not see any difference at all. I really did want this to work. Next step is the plastic surgeon&#x27;s for a non surgical treatment.</li>
    <li> Wow I just used it 3 days &amp; it&#x27;s braking up my cellulite👯I&#x27;m very happy so far. Thank you</li>
    <li> Feels great with a heavy lotion or oil. Increases blood flow to the area.. in a very short session, 1-2 minutes. And reduces tiny bumps in the skin more with everytime I use it. Great product!</li>
    <li> This item was very helpful in the breakdown of the cellulite. The brush tips are rounded which makes it very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product because it broke the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Used it only for a month and the product broke. Pink part and white part separated. I tried to put them back together but it always falls apart.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing. Really makes you look more toned on all areas used after just one use. Would highly recommend. I am purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> Great massager!!, but I have seen no results...I&#x27;ve been using this massager since February 8 2015 so a little over a month.....</li>
