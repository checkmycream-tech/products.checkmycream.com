### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is not the best beard trimmer I have ever owned, but it is the cheapest.  </li>
      <li>The Norelco grooming tool is very good for what it is intended for.</li>
      <li>For $20, this is a good deal if all you want to do is trim your beard!  </li>
      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy about this purchase.</li>
      <li>So, They make a good trimmer no question.</li>
      <li>(helping you not to lose bits as they are all in one place) - comes with a travel bag for storage which is also handy.</li>
      <li>This is sleek, but the length guide system is hand adjustable and not too stable, I liked the one that could be selected in the t series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Get what you pay for so pay more and get more is my advice.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you get both sides of trimmer slotted into the grooves.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and nice and light.</li>
      <li>The twist-to adjust head was very secure and easy to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for the first day with me</li>
      <li>An earlier Philips Norelco beard and moustache trimmer was very good.  </li>
      <li>The blade head also comes off somewhat easily, but this was not an issue during use.  </li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t easily make changes to length with the button on the razor that moves the guide.</li>
      <li>It trimmed the moustache according to the setting I chose and it also, with the comb removed, easily trimmed the edge of my moustache.  </li>
      <li>Plastic feels like it&#x27;ll break easy.</li>
      <li>it cuts fine, but the adjustments on the comb leave a lot to be desired.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is very powerful, easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This one lighter, a little noisier, used NiMh not lithium,  doesn&#x27;t cut quite as well, but price excellent</li>
      <li>Cheap feeling head.</li>
      <li>It is noisy, and the ability to change the depth of cut is no where near as good.</li>
      <li>We had this item for years and bought this as a replacement when the original&#x27;s rechargeable battery just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, light weight and works very well.</li>
      <li>comb is very flimsy and easily slips out of position.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Positives - The motor is powerful and holds a charge really well - the kits is well thought out that it does have attachments for fine blending as well.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price paid for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>Makes quick work of my mustache and beard as well as the stray hairs above my ears (for my glasses to stay on better).</li>
      <li>This was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
      <li>A reasonable price and works well!</li>
      <li>easy to use and simple.</li>
      <li>After several months of use, and adjusting to a longer beard length, I notice that the length adjustment moves to easily out of place when trimming.  </li>
      <li>I have a Philips shaver and this compliments that very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much this relates, but I have a T765 that is 10 years old and works as good as when I bought it.</li>
      <li>Try a larger number first before trying a smaller number - otherwise you may find that you trimmed more than you thought you would.</li>
      <li>If you need only a beard trimmer, the unit is light-weight, compact, and adequate.</li>
      <li>If you have a steady hand and know what you are doing this should keep yiu well maintained.</li>
      <li>I owned the T7xx series (do not remember the exact model) for many many years, could be close to 10 and the blades went bad, so, I got this one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Norelco perfected the razors in the 90s and now, they are just spinning out new designs in the name of innovation</li>
      <li>- Review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this Trimmer now for 2 years - I have been forced to replace due to the plastic comb attachment becoming brittle and breaking around the top of the unit - when i looked to replace this plastic sleeve attachment it was going to cost between 15.00 - 25.00 to replace (making it more than worth considering purchasing a model with out this defect and weak spot</li>
      <li>I settled on this guy because of the basic design, and it does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>, I think they can just stick to what they have and not waste their money on new designs.  </li>
      <li>Since buying it, trimming the facial hair has become so much easier.</li>
      <li>After nearly 2 years of constant use</li>
      <li>Overall, I will rather have the old models.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When changing guide positions to leave longer length hair the whole top of the trimmer tends to come off and it is difficult to use the plastic guide to cut hair to the different lengths.as</li>
      <li>If I am not VERY careful, I end up with a shorter length than desire.  </li>
      <li>I recently ruined a $40 whal trimmer by getting it wet, so I was shopping for a new trimmer.  </li>

    <li> An earlier Philips Norelco beard and moustache trimmer was very good.  It trimmed the moustache according to the setting I chose and it also, with the comb removed, easily trimmed the edge of my moustache.  This trimmer does not trim the edge of my moustache well.  If you need only a beard trimmer, the unit is light-weight, compact, and adequate.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace former Norelco that my son swiped.  This one lighter, a little noisier, used NiMh not lithium,  doesn&#x27;t cut quite as well, but price excellent and it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Easy to use and nice and light. Well worth the price paid for it. Battery charge lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> After nearly 2 years of constant use - Review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this Trimmer now for 2 years - I have been forced to replace due to the plastic comb attachment becoming brittle and breaking around the top of the unit - when i looked to replace this plastic sleeve attachment it was going to cost between 15.00 - 25.00 to replace (making it more than worth considering purchasing a model with out this defect and weak spot you might say. The precursor to this part breaking being the fact that for the low cut stubble look it does not nearly go low enough and you find yourself straining at its limits to come somewhere close - this when the comb is not very strong - i am not very surprised in retrospect that it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: The comb adjustment setting is poor and not easily gauged - being that you simply slide the plastic comb up and down the main trimmer itself. &amp; obviously as per above the comb is week and expensive to replace when it breaks as is likely due to the thin line of plastic on its underside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives - The motor is powerful and holds a charge really well - the kits is well thought out that it does have attachments for fine blending as well.

    <li> This trimmer is very powerful, easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean. I carry it everywhere I go. Its great.</li>
    <li> We had this item for years and bought this as a replacement when the original&#x27;s rechargeable battery just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. This was not a replacement in any sense of the word. It is noisy, and the ability to change the depth of cut is no where near as good. Also it is plastic and the former one was metal. It ended up being returned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this from last one month and I&#x27;m happy about this purchase. It&#x27;s easy to use, light weight and works very well. I would definitely recommend to my friend. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> This item cuts well and holds a long charge. It does not adjust to various lengths so beware of that. If you have a steady hand and know what you are doing this should keep yiu well maintained.</li>
    <li> The Norelco grooming tool is very good for what it is intended for. I use it for trimming my beard. That said, it is fragile and a drop on the floor could render the attached (and removable comb) if broken would have to be replaced. I&#x27;m very careful with mine, however for the price,  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I recently ruined a $40 whal trimmer by getting it wet, so I was shopping for a new trimmer.  I settled on this guy because of the basic design, and it does exactly what it says.  It comes with a blade length guide, charger and brush.  The unit works plugged in or not.  Make sure that you get both sides of trimmer slotted into the grooves.  I initially had some issues until I realized that I wasn&#x27;t sliding the length guide into both grooves.  The blade head also comes off somewhat easily, but this was not an issue during use.  For $20, this is a good deal if all you want to do is trim your beard!  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I owned the T7xx series (do not remember the exact model) for many many years, could be close to 10 and the blades went bad, so, I got this one.  This is sleek, but the length guide system is hand adjustable and not too stable, I liked the one that could be selected in the t series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco perfected the razors in the 90s and now, they are just spinning out new designs in the name of innovation, I think they can just stick to what they have and not waste their money on new designs.  Overall, I will rather have the old models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shaving, I have moved to Braun, but for trimmers, Norelco still has an edge,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this relates, but I have a T765 that is 10 years old and works as good as when I bought it. The battery have never been changed (rechargeable) and its still as sharp. So, They make a good trimmer no question.</li>
    <li> Holds charge forever.excellent!</li>
    <li> After several months of use, and adjusting to a longer beard length, I notice that the length adjustment moves to easily out of place when trimming.  If I am not VERY careful, I end up with a shorter length than desire.  My last Norelco trimmer did not use this flimsy adjuster.  Charge lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> easy to use and simple.</li>
    <li> Cheap feeling head. Plastic feels like it&#x27;ll break easy. Get what you pay for so pay more and get more is my advice.</li>
    <li> this is not the best beard trimmer I have ever owned, but it is the cheapest.  it cuts fine, but the adjustments on the comb leave a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> I used the predecessor to this trimmer for several years, and loves it. The twist-to adjust head was very secure and easy to use. This trimmer is none of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is very flimsy and easily slips out of position. The comb teeth are also too short to lift beard hairs to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use this without the comb for shaping, then it will work for you. But if you mean to use it for keeping a beard at a set length, then STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> Has trouble getting a very close shave, even for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well and holds it charge week after week. Since buying it, trimming the facial hair has become so much easier. Sideburns, beard, tache, you name it! Try a larger number first before trying a smaller number - otherwise you may find that you trimmed more than you thought you would.</li>
    <li> A reasonable price and works well! My husband was looking for a trimmer that cut close without scratching his face. This was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for the first day with me</li>
    <li> There is no control on the adjustable head. When used it will slide down to a lower # causing the hair to get cut to short. I short it is a piece of junk. I returned it.</li>
    <li> The device trims hair as advertised. However&#x27; using the plastic length guide is clumsy. When changing guide positions to leave longer length hair the whole top of the trimmer tends to come off and it is difficult to use the plastic guide to cut hair to the different lengths.as you can&#x27;t easily make changes to length with the button on the razor that moves the guide. Without the length guide the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> I have a Philips shaver and this compliments that very well. Makes quick work of my mustache and beard as well as the stray hairs above my ears (for my glasses to stay on better).</li>
    <li> piece of s***. Now i have to buy another one. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
