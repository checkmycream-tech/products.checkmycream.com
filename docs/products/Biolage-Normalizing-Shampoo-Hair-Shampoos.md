      <li>Best of all, it seems like the normalizing shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh on the scalp or hair!</li>
      <li>This way your ends stay moisturized and your scalp gets really clean.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of moisture, and full of body</li>
      <li>My hair is in follicle heaven right now!  </li>

      <li>A good daily use shampoo.</li>

      <li>Smells clean and fresh</li>

      <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and my scalp is pretty stripped of oils.</li>
      <li>So few shampoos work for oily and fine hair!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many shampoo products, from Head n Shoulders to Clear Men, Scalp Therapy.  </li>
      <li>not spending thirty bucks on something that claps it own hands for doing the basic minimum.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>It left my hair super clean, light and shiny.</li>
      <li>A small amount foams up perfectly and spreads easily onto wet hair.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy this shampoo, but it turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would advise about is that it&#x27;s not color safe.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for years after first learning about it at my hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and it cleaned my whole head!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in a public role at work and personal presentation is important, and in my opinion, paying this price ($25 currently) for a good shampoo is worth the investment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have the type of hair that gets used to whatever shampoo I use quickly, so over the years I have tried many, many brands of shampoo.  With Biolage Normalizing Shampoo, I can use it over and over again without \\&quot;getting used to it\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m on my second 33.8oz container of it and my hair comes out great day after day!  I am so excited that I found a type of shampoo I can use on a daily basis that does not wind up giving me oily hair from extended use!  My hair does not come out overly dried out, either, but looks shiny and healthy - consistently.    The only negative thing I can say about it is the cost.  It&#x27;s very pricey, so look for the 33.8 ounce sized bottle for the best deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biolage hydratherapie for the past month, and I love how soft it makes my hair, but it was starting to make my hair look greasy after washing. I read the reviews for the normalizing shampoo, and read a review from someone who had the same problem as I. I have oily hair, and after using a single shampoo for a while, it stops working so well and my hair looks greasy after a wash. I decided to give this shampoo a shot, and so far so good! It smells great, makes my hair soft and shiny, but no greasy look! I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and happy with the price as well. At a salon, this would probably run me around $40. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> This product from Biolage is reliably good. I have been using it for almost 7 years now. There was a problem with the shipment as Amazon grouped this item along with a Gourmet Cookbook also ordered into one box. The shampoo leaked during transport all over the book which made it useless as the gift it was going to be. Most other sources ship the shampoo in shrink wrap packaging which from the appearance may originate this way from Biolage. Amazon only had the top tapped which did not seem to keep the cap tight enough to hold in the contents.</li>
    <li> They changed the label on the bottle from orange to blue, but it&#x27;s the same product.  I&#x27;ve never had a deeper cleanse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I&#x27;ll be back for more when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who always had oily hair. His hair is never oily as long as he uses this now, and is soft. Not much else to say. A good daily use shampoo.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product. I have fine, short hair and shampoo daily. It works great and I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> My hair used to be greasy and dandruffy, but now when I started using Biolage normalizing shampoo, it&#x27;s shiny, beautiful and smooth! everyone comments on my awesome hair now.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this shampoo for a few weeks now and I have noticed a little less oil in my hair but it&#x27;s not helping fully yet. So Im still giving it a chance. When reading the other reviews about people losing hair, I can&#x27;t complain there. I was losing hair before I started this shampoo and have actually STOPPED losing my hair from using this shampoo. Ive also learned to not use any conditioner now and just stick with the shampoo to help with my oilyness and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to try the normalizing shampoo.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but each time I use it, it leaves my hair too dry.  It makes my hair hard to comb through.  I do have oily hair so I don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t working for me.  I think it&#x27;s due to the fact that this shampoo containes sulfates which I think I&#x27;m sensitive to.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a decade, wife and I, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get oily after just one day of being washed. It was terrible! I have used other BIolage products in the past and totally took a chance on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did! I have used it once and have gone a full 24hrs without having to wash it again. It left my hair super clean, light and shiny. I will definitely be sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and great response time to my order. The shampoo is one of the best, if not \\&quot;the\\&quot; best\\&quot;, cleaning shampoos on the market if used according to the directions provided.</li>
    <li> My hair is very oily, so this shampoo can solution, but after two days, my hair is recovered to oily.</li>
    <li> I have been having difficulty finding this particular shampoo in stores and was glad to find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a shampoo that cleans my fine/thin/oily hair and allows me to go a day in between washing, something that I was unable to do before. It leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of moisture, and full of body when I air dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you hair is similar to mine. I&#x27;m in a public role at work and personal presentation is important, and in my opinion, paying this price ($25 currently) for a good shampoo is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely oily. I thought using harsh chemical shampoos would clean my hair and rid it from oil, but it would just add gunk. My hair was still oily. Worst of all, the shampoos would cause the hair on my scalp to look stringy and dirty, and it wouldn&#x27;t get rid of the buildup in my hair. Then I bought this product based on website articles stating it was great for oily hair. I have to say: the Biolage Normalizing shampoo is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just one wash, my hair was extremely clean and soft, my scalp hair is no longer stringy. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed about my oily hair make me hair look stringy or any buildup. Best of all, it seems like the normalizing shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh on the scalp or hair! I highly recommend this product for people who suffer from oily hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I will continue to purchase it through Amazon as I was unable to find this particular product at the local big box-stores or in the hair salons/boutiques that carry Biolage products.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. I have either to dry or to greasy hair. After 14 hours of work, my hair still feels and looks good</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo for my hair.  It&#x27;s quite noticeable when I don&#x27;t use it as my hair looks flat and droopy.</li>
    <li> A great amount for a great price considering how reliable this brand is. Professionals everywhere use it and it has top ratings according to articles. I&#x27;m happy with the results, but for my scalp, I will have to switch to the scalp therapy version instead of the normalizing one. I encourage you to buy this brand of shampoo or conditioner!</li>
    <li> i have used this shampoo for about 10 years and it never lets me down.  it keeps my oilyness under control without stripping my hair.  one time i went 5 days without washing my hair and it was just starting to look like it.  i didn&#x27;t think one wash would be enough but true to form, it was.</li>
    <li> My scalp is very oily and so is my hair. I have tried numerous shampoos for oily scalp/hair; and Matrix Biolage Normalizing Shpampoo is THE ONLY one that works! I highly recommend this product to anyone that has any oily scalp.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every day because its oily and i don&#x27;t need much product, a little bit does the trick... It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair dry... it leaves it normal.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally oily hair and this is the ONLY shampoo we have found that her hair still looks clean and fresh at the end of the day. This price is way better than what we have found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My hair is in follicle heaven right now!  Great shampoo and not bad price considering I didn&#x27;t need to use much at all and it cleaned my whole head!  I have oily scalp, so that&#x27;s saying something!  And my hair felt perfect afterwards!  Haven&#x27;t felt that in a long time!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for oily and fine hair ~ probably other hair types too.  Really cleans hair without drying.  Don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!  So few shampoos work for oily and fine hair!!!</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve used many shampoo products, from Head n Shoulders to Clear Men, Scalp Therapy.  But none of them were ever able to get rid of this terrible itchiness I had on the back of my head.  Then one day at my haircut place, the person cutting my hair noticed my scalp in certain areas was very dry and flakey.  So he mentioned to me about Biolage and he gave me this one and to let him know if it helped next time I got my hair cut.  Boy was I in love with this product after a few uses.  The itching on the back of my scalp was gone and I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon.  Great product to use if you suffer from itchy scalp that won&#x27;t go away no matter what you use.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great for oily hair. Hard to find shampoo that doesn&#x27;t already have conditioner in it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times online.  I can always find it and it is generally cheaper than buying it at a retail store.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent as a clarifying shampoo, but it can be harsh. It&#x27;s meant for occasional use to remove excess oil and styling products from hair. Someone with oily hair who needs to shampoo daily might be able to use it as often as twice a week, but not more often than that. Those with dry hair/scalp probably shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once per week. I use only a leave-in conditioner on the ends of my hair so once/week use is about all I need. It has a very light citrus fragrance, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Cleans beautifully. Hair rinses clean, soft, and shiney.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Biolage normalizing botanical complex deeply cleanse the scalp without drying hair, leaving hair fresh, full of body and responsiveness\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They promise a \\&quot;deep cleansing\\&quot; without drying out your scalp. Yipee. That&#x27;s what EVERY shampoo does at the least.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not spending thirty bucks on something that claps it own hands for doing the basic minimum. I have oily hair, and I want a shampoo that helps eliminate that - not an overpriced megabottle which promises nothing more than \\&quot;not damaging\\&quot; my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, leaves my hair free of any greasy residue. I love the mint sensation on my greasy scalp. I have greasy hair and dry ends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years. I used to have my hairdresser sister buy it at the beauty supply for wholesale pricing. I moved and can&#x27;t do that anymore. Amazon has a great price and super fast delivery! Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and this is about the only shampoo that works for me to use regularly and not have to wash my hair every day!!! I love this product for that reason!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and my scalp is pretty stripped of oils. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too straw-like afterwards and I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner in order to brush my hair. ( I have fairly long hair ) Though I cannot use it every day as it is too harsh. One of the better normalizing shampoos I have used.</li>
    <li> Love it. I love this shampoo. I received it very quick. Reasonable price. I Can see me ordering this again.</li>
    <li> purchased for my 12 year old daughter.  her hair gets oily and no other shampoo seems to clean as well as this shampoo.  I will continue to purchase as it works best for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the perfect shampoo. I was never convinced that paying expensive salon prices was worth it over drug store brands. I have always used Pantene, Dove or Tressame. After washing my hair with these shampoos I was always left with a waxy type feeling by my roots which felt like I didn&#x27;t even wash my hair. I have very long straight shiny hair, so these shampoos always made my scalp look greasy. Naturally I do have oily skin and hair, so this didn&#x27;t help the problem. I was hesitant to buy this shampoo, but it turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for. I use it everyday, and a little does go a long way which makes the price totally worth it. A small amount foams up perfectly and spreads easily onto wet hair. Finally my hair actually feels clean and light, without anything holding it down. I have also bought the cooling mint shampoo to try, just got it in the mail and will be trying today.. I will leave a review for that as well. Overall, great product, great shipping time and packaging, and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love Biolage shampoo!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Really cleanses the scalp and hair in an awesome way! If you have color treated watch out though. Might be a little too drying.</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp but dry ends. This shampoo is perfect. I worked in a beauty supply store for years and have tried literally every salon brand there is and this is the best for the price. If you want volume this is the shampoo for you. If you have oily scalp this is great. It never stops working, my hair never gets used to it so it always leaves my hair very clean. If you have dry ends i recommend putting some conditioner into the ends of your hair before you shampoo. This way your ends stay moisturized and your scalp gets really clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for oily hair.  Hormonal changes has caused my hair to be extremely oily.  This is the only shampoo I have found that will control the oil.  This is a great buy on this product as I have been paying $20 for a 16 oz. bottle at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Works well and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. Perfect for my hair. Makes my hair feel so clean and easy to manage. Will order again.</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo.  I have issues with oily hair and it has helped so much. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does it&#x27;s job. My hair stands are quite thin and this shampoo works well with my hair type. The only thing I would advise about is that it&#x27;s not color safe. If you use hair color, it will fade while using this. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good shampoo. I bought it with the pump so I could use it much more easily.</li>
    <li> Since I live in a humid area my hair look oily, dirty and heavy after just one day, so I decided to buy this shampoo. It smells nice and cleans the head very well but my hair was still heavy and oily after one day.. For the price of this shampoo it is a little bit disappointing,</li>
    <li> I have really oily hair and most shampoos don&#x27;t do anything to cleanse my hair. I wash it and it&#x27;s still looks oily after it dries. This is the only shampoo that leaves my hair looking healthy, shiny, and completely clean! And even adds some body too. Great product and I have tried almost every clarifying shampoo out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find the Normalizing formula but it&#x27;s the best as far as I can tell for my hair. I have straight, semi thick hair, that can go about every other day without needing to be washed with this shampoo. Any other shampoo there would be no way I could make it without looking greasy at the roots. Smells clean and fresh not flowery and sweet like other brands which is another reason I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years after first learning about it at my hairdresser&#x27;s. This formula works for me but there are other formulas as well.</li>
    <li> the product was not easy to discern from other biolage hair care products. The product seemed diluted from past purchases.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo my husband will use</li>
