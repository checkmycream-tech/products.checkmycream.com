      <li>But I&#x27;m happy enough with it that I will keep it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS HOT TOOLS</li>
      <li>I love this hot air brush.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and produces a smooth finish to my hair.</li>
      <li>But overall this is the BEST and MOST QUIET hot air brush I have ever used!</li>
      <li>The cool button doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I will never buy a tool without a cool blast</li>
      <li>On a design level, I would also have liked the barrel to be at least 3&amp;#34; to get more volume at the top for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I normally love Hot Tools&#x27; products, but this one clearly needs more quality control.</li>
      <li>Ok, this hot air brush is the first I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The motor quickly crapped out.  </li>
      <li>And I LOVE when I get stuff early!</li>
      <li>This burned up in the first 20 min!</li>
      <li>First, I have very wavy, fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>Do your hair a favor and only use warm, hot is too hot and don&#x27;t forget heat protection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for similar product that is more reliable now because I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I loved it since it allowed me to eliminate my heavy blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I like the hot air brush, but it burns out before 1 year.</li>
      <li>the same problem while others love the product, so it must stay attached for some people.  </li>
      <li>I was only able to use this hot air brush a couple of times before it stopped working.</li>
      <li>I have used hot air brushes forever it seems.</li>
      <li>Great design, hot air is hot enough to dry hair, etc...</li>
      <li>First, the barrel is a separate piece that is supposed to snap in place and stay put until you are ready to put it away.  </li>
      <li>Different settings allows you to set the curls in with cool air!</li>
      <li>I saw this product recommended in a magazine and thought it would work with my fine short hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to straighten my kinky curls with one hand and gives my hair some body instead of pin straight like with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>I had seen someone use this online on youtube and went straight to amazon to purchase it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>The bristles on the brush don&#x27;t even go through my hair and the wand itself is too big to fit around my hand.  </li>
      <li>VERY MUCHFOR</li>
      <li>it is fast and gives alot of body.  </li>
      <li>i really like this style of hair dryer for my hair</li>
      <li>It still blows hot air on the top half and only cool air on the bottom 1/4.  </li>
      <li>That quickly faded as I encountered several problems with it after just not even two weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair very soft and straight.  </li>
      <li>But, not necessary with this one by Hot Tools!</li>
      <li>Normally if I wanted to straighten my hair</li>
      <li>1000 watts is plenty powerful enough.</li>
      <li>Ok now for the reason I give it 4 not 5 stars, it is dead after 3-4 months of light-moderate use.</li>
      <li>and it was sent right back to me.</li>
      <li>and now I had to ordered a different hot air brush.</li>
      <li>However, I find that they burn out after a couple of years, but I like it so much, that I always replace it with the same brand.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair and gives a soft curl.</li>
      <li>Good but not perfect air brush.</li>
      <li>You are better off buying something a little more expensive that will last you longer.</li>
      <li>The method sound the same, but this tool was much faster and less of a workout on my arms than the brush and dryer because I just rolled it like a curling iron to dry instead of pulling it out with a round brush.</li>
      <li>The cheaper ones do not have enough power and do not really dry your hair.  </li>

<li> A couple other reviews state</li>
<li> When the roots were dry in that section, I wrap my hair, which is 1/3 of the way down my back, around this tool to completely dry and then blast with cold until completely cooled and let hair down.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not practical at all... the ones that rotate are much better! This brush doesn&#x27;t stick on thin hair, and with the hot air blowing makes it even worse.</li>
    <li> The air brush is everything it advertises itself to be. I bought it because my hair stylist uses it. Great device.  Denver</li>
    <li> i just love this product.  I have learned to use this product after i finger dry, then blow dry my hair until it is almost dry.  i then use the brush like rollers to style my hair.  it is fast and gives alot of body.  for the price it is great.</li>
    <li> It is sometimes difficult to dry short hair with a blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. This product allows me to have both in one hand. It took a little getting used to but I like it a lot. The control button is too easy to move during drying. The blower option is worthless. Overall a good buy!</li>
    <li> I saw this product recommended in a magazine and thought it would work with my fine short hair.  It is terrible.  The bristles on the brush don&#x27;t even go through my hair and the wand itself is too big to fit around my hand.  This product is awful.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush.  I bought a cheaper one because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t matter but it does!  The cheaper ones do not have enough power and do not really dry your hair.  This one has great power and really does a nice job.</li>
    <li> The hot tools air brush is really great.  It makes my hair very soft and straight.  I had seen someone use this online on youtube and went straight to amazon to purchase it.  Still using it today with great results.</li>
    <li> Perfectly blows heat and dries my hair as it should! couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, other than the fact that I bought it at the CosmoProf Store and paid $35.00, had I known it was less on Amazon I would have saved some money! But I&#x27;m happy enough with it that I will keep it!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. Easy to straighten my kinky curls with one hand and gives my hair some body instead of pin straight like with a flat iron. It provides a good deal of hot air power as compared to others like it with lower wattage</li>
    <li> This thing works great, when it works...but after 3 months or so, it starts to burn out.  This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve had to replace</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for a year and only used it about 5 times and it doesn&#x27;t work.  When I turn it on it smells like something is burning.  The comb part does not stay on keeps falling off.  It was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> The last one I had started smoking.  I figured I would try again.  This one the barrel release button is broken.  It will not stay on. Unreal!</li>
    <li> This worked good when it did work.  The only thing was the bristles were so short, it was hard to catch my hair.  I would have to use my fingers to wrap my hair around it but it would burn my fingers sometimes.  I only had it for a couple of months and when I would turn it on, the motor sounded like it was dying but it still worked until one day I plugged it in and it was completely dead.  Pretty lame for a product to only last a couple of months and I didn&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I loved it since it allowed me to eliminate my heavy blow dryer.  That quickly faded as I encountered several problems with it after just not even two weeks of use.  The motor quickly crapped out.  The cool button doesn&#x27;t work.  It still blows hot air on the top half and only cool air on the bottom 1/4.  The off button is also broken.  The only way to turn it off is to unplug it.  On a design level, I would also have liked the barrel to be at least 3&amp;#34; to get more volume at the top for my fine hair.  I normally love Hot Tools&#x27; products, but this one clearly needs more quality control.</li>
    <li> I do like this item but the only thing is that a wire came out of the plug in and now I had to ordered a different hot air brush. I am not to happy about the cord breaking off from the plug.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these for 3 years with no problems. One day the motor went out. I recently bought this one and it is already making noises like the other one that went out. Otherwise I love this product. It dries quickly and produces a smooth finish to my hair. I am keeping my fingers crossed that it lives. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Good but not perfect air brush. Great design, hot air is hot enough to dry hair, etc... BUT the bristles of the brush should be stiffer so that they can hold the hair in place. With current bristles the hair tends to slip out. Also it would be helpful if the plastic end opposite from the main handle were a little longer so that if you need to hold both ends, you don&#x27;t burn your fingers!</li>
    <li> I like the hot air brush, but it burns out before 1 year. Be prepared to buy them yearly. However, one of the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I wash my hair. It dries my hair and gives a soft curl. Saves time and saves money by not having to use a curling tool.</li>
    <li> I have used hot air brushes forever it seems. I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ve used at least 20 different brands. The biggest complaint I&#x27;ve always had was the NOISE. I literally have foam earplugs in my vanity drawer to wear while using the air brushes.  But, not necessary with this one by Hot Tools! 1000 watts is plenty powerful enough. The bristles easily grab even my fine hair so rolling is a breeze. I don&#x27;t use (nor care about) the ionic setting so I can&#x27;t give an opinion on that. But overall this is the BEST and MOST QUIET hot air brush I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is what I needed. It isn’t very difficult to use and it works very well. I’m happy I bought this! And I LOVE when I get stuff early! Got it ahead of time. Yay!!!!</li>
    <li> It looked good.  It was a gift and I&#x27;ve not heard anyting bad about it.  So must have worked for her because she is picky when it comes to her hair appliances.  And I know my daughter would tell me if she was unhappy.</li>
    <li> Ok, this hot air brush is the first I have ever used. I was very skeptical that it would be useful to me but I gave it a shot anyway and held on to the box to return. First, I have very wavy, fine hair but a lot of it. The bristles didn&#x27;t look like they would be able to handle the thickness of my hair...Normally if I wanted to straighten my hair I would use a hairdryer and round brush. I would dry my hair until only slightly damp then use the brush to COMPLETELY dry. When dry, THIS IS THE KEY, blast cold air through the hollow barrel of my round brush while my hair was wrapped around it UNTIL COMPLETELY COOLED OFF. I am not sure why I have gone almost my whole life without knowing the cold air blast trick but the end result is smooth, silky hair with little to no frizz.  Here is how I use this tool and loved it. I still dried my hair almost all the way with regular hair dryer, no brush. Then switch to this tool section my hair, one section at a time quickly dry the roots. When the roots were dry in that section, I wrap my hair, which is 1/3 of the way down my back, around this tool to completely dry and then blast with cold until completely cooled and let hair down.  Do your hair a favor and only use warm, hot is too hot and don&#x27;t forget heat protection. The results are A-mazing, truly. The method sound the same, but this tool was much faster and less of a workout on my arms than the brush and dryer because I just rolled it like a curling iron to dry instead of pulling it out with a round brush. I will never buy a tool without a cool blast it is the key, and for years I wondered what that was for...Ok now for the reason I give it 4 not 5 stars, it is dead after 3-4 months of light-moderate use. It works for a few seconds, overheats and quits. So sad! User error? I don&#x27;t know, my hair is long enough that it did get caught in the fan at the bottom of the brush once or twice? I&#x27;m looking for similar product that is more reliable now because I&#x27;m hooked. Try the method Imentioned, COLD BLAST to set the curl!</li>
    <li> I depend on this hair dryer to tame my curly hair, and it does a terrific job at that. However, I find that they burn out after a couple of years, but I like it so much, that I always replace it with the same brand.</li>
    <li> This burned up in the first 20 min! I tried to return it and it was sent right back to me. Soooooo disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were a little bit longer.  The tool works great!  I use it every day.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS HOT TOOLS ITS AMAZING ON HOW IT WORKS LOVE IT THANK U VERY MUCHFOR THIS I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
    <li> Very easy to use! My hair dries quickly and no curling iron! I just dry and go. Saves time and my hair looks better than before.</li>
    <li> i really like this style of hair dryer for my hair,i haven&#x27;t used a curling iron in years. this brush has alot of power/</li>
    <li> The best hot brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Always a good item but I&#x27;m waiting for it to break. You don&#x27;t get many uses out of it. This is my 3rd in about 1 1/2 years. But the product is good.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately i would have to agree with the rest of the negative reviews. I was only able to use this hot air brush a couple of times before it stopped working. I have tried turning it on and every time it smells like something is burning. Unfortunately not the best quality. You are better off buying something a little more expensive that will last you longer.</li>
    <li> This is great for body and soft curl! Different settings allows you to set the curls in with cool air!</li>
    <li> Does what it claims to do.  Your hair will be dry in no time with added volume.  It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have two comments about this product.  First, the barrel is a separate piece that is supposed to snap in place and stay put until you are ready to put it away.  Nice storage feature if it worked but it keeps unsnapping while I am trying to work with my hair.  A couple other reviews state the same problem while others love the product, so it must stay attached for some people.  Poor design if it doesn&#x27;t snap in place consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it stayed attached however I would not be happy with this product.  The bristles are extremely pliable and they don&#x27;t work with my thick hair.  I would recommend this only for people with very thin hair.</li>
