      <li>but I can&#x27;t tell more than that as I just started using the eye cream.</li>
      <li>The eye cream itself didn&#x27;t reach till the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I am still using it morning and night and hoping for something better as results.</li>
      <li>My darkness may look brighter and better.</li>
      <li>Hope it works better for others.</li>
      <li>and this works better for under $15.00, proving you dont have to pay&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
      <li>this is so smooth and moisturizing!</li>
      <li>This is magic.</li>
      <li>I was using Boots No7 Beautiful Skin Rich Hydrating Eye Cream before I started using Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference; I&#x27;d like to think both products work well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for its price.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the eye cream itself is pretty good and hydrating and it a staple.</li>
      <li>Gives dry under eyes great moisture!</li>
      <li>i love how smoothly my concealer applies on top of this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a serum than a cream, and it&#x27;s really light going onto the skin.</li>
      <li>This eye cream works great as far as moisturizing goes</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead, the original mizon cream works much better.</li>
      <li>I will buy this again because its rich in texture and I love the rest of the line.</li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon for making returns so easy.</li>
      <li>I notice a huge difference in my eye area.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for that reason, although for an eye cream, the price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Think I need something more powerful.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, without the greasy feeling or offensive odor.</li>
      <li>and my face feels baby smooth</li>
      <li>I like the smooth texture and feel on my eye.</li>
      <li>It is so light</li>
      <li>own a real Mizon product</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s an OK eye cream, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out what exactly is causing clogged pores on my temples/brow (not acne, just bumps...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is doing anything for my wrinkles, but it moisturizes the skin around my eyes wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Super light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>and I felt like the jar wasn&#x27;t as full as it should have been.</li>
      <li>The Mizon snail repair creamis really moisturizing has interesting texture sort of like aqua mask.</li>
      <li>No weird scent, easy application, no sensitivity issues, and no balling under makeup.</li>
      <li>The snail bb cream not only is PERFECT for those of Japanese or Russian ethnicity (if your family has the really fair skin genes), but it works so well under translucent powder, does not run, and does not smudge.</li>
      <li>Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear off, doesn&#x27;t create any growths around my eye, and it seems to absorb into my skin fairly quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So wonderful it&#x27;s even can treat wonds and scars</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and it works fine keeps me moisturized for the whole day</li>
    <li> Product severely dried and burned my skin. I&#x27;m afraid it may not be authentic Mizon product.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, non greasy/sticky, feels great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s hard to tell how helpful it is. Granted, I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles so I&#x27;m mostly using it for skin health/preventative measures. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. Sometimes there is a slight stinging, but I&#x27;ve noticed that often happens with products that contain vitamin E....so maybe that&#x27;s related?  I&#x27;m going to continue using this and will update if I notice any marked changes.</li>
    <li> I use it day and night. Wears well under makeup. Light formula; not greasy or heavy.  I tried it because it was on sale. I like it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference before and after use, I am 35 yrs old, fine wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. Goes on smoothly, without the greasy feeling or offensive odor. Takes a bit to soak in, but I think its worth the time. One satr off because whenever it arrived, some of the product had leaked out.</li>
    <li> I joined the Korean Beauty bandwagon and I&#x27;m not sorry at all. If you&#x27;re intimidated by the snails, don&#x27;t be because this is the absolute best eye cream on the market. I use it twice daily and have noticed a huge improvement in every way possible. LOVE.</li>
    <li> This is not a Mizon product -- first and foremost. This is a knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a real Mizon product and it comes with a silver label, a made in Korea stencil, and usually a viable expiration date. This one certainly doesn&#x27;t have a Mizon label. Mizon is a very high-end Korean brand and websites such as Peach &amp; Lilly sell the real deal worldwide. It&#x27;s a pretty penny but you&#x27;re getting the real product imported from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fake and when I got it, it was only half-filled and looked oddly like it had already been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I have tried out the cream multiple times and I like it -- it does hydrate the skin beneath my eyes -- not significantly so, but enough for me to keep on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I won&#x27;t be buying it from Amazon again due to false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this product since I have been using it for about three weeks and its effects are not shown. However, it is a good eyecream for daytime, no irritation caused.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot. I think it burns my eyes a little for some reason but it&#x27;s not that bad it helps my crows feet. Ships faster than expected.</li>
    <li> This was my first korean product and I live it. It&#x27;s a very soothing eye cream. I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the product BUT there was a giant bubble of air at the bottom. I purposely popped this &#x27;bubble&#x27; at the bottom and the lotion caved to show how much was actually in the container... losing about a forth of the volume. Kinda disappointed since it&#x27;s so little to begin with, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I am looking for an eye cream and purchased this  a few days ago. Received it on time since I have a prime account. However, when I open the jar, it only half full. Decided to return it. Since reviews seems pretty positive, I might buy another one to see if they fulfill a full item or not.</li>
    <li> Umm not thrilled on this. Made with REAL snail snot. Ugh. But has a nice texture to it. Didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. So no for me but maybe for someone else. Your choice. 😁</li>
    <li> Very good, it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this out for 1 month and it seems to be working. I used to have deep wrinkles but it seem to lessen. So hopefully after 1 year I&#x27;ll look good again.</li>
    <li> The best experience I had in facial creams , I apply in the morning and my face feels great the whole day even if I wash my face more than once , for me I tried a lot of cosmetics from all around the world and some wore much more expensive but this one is good in price and effect</li>
    <li> I decided to start using eye cream when I realized my regular moisturizer didn&#x27;t do much for that area of my face. Two friends (who both have amazing skin) recommended this product, so I overcame the initial reaction of &amp;#34;seriously? snails?&amp;#34; and ordered. I never saw myself as having a problem with dark circles under my eyes, but I can&#x27;t believe how much brighter the skin around my eyes is after using this nightly for just a few days. Comes with one of those silly plastic spatulas, if you find that to be a plus (I don&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> Gentle, soft, economical everyday moisturiser for eye area.  Immediate softening result visible soon after appllication but too soon to rate long term effects. May work better on younger skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is doing anything for my wrinkles, but it moisturizes the skin around my eyes wonderfully. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Might just be me. I can&#x27;t use this product everday as it burns the outer corners of my eyes abd they weep profusely. The next morning however I feel refreshed and my eyes are brighter underneath and not so puffy</li>
    <li> Which anti-wrinkle eye cream good? Anyone to have any good referrals?  with anti-wrinkle and sunscreen function, suitable for summer.</li>
    <li> Great packaging...haven&#x27;t seen any changes or improvements in the condition of my skin:(</li>
    <li> My jar was open when it arrived. :/</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference.</li>
    <li> It feels good on my skin and easy to apply. I loved the packaging and the little spoon that comes with it. However, I am not sure if it is doing anything to my eyes. My darkness may look brighter and better. Yet it is not much difference... I am still using it morning and night and hoping for something better as results. Though I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again. It was just a wondering buy anyway to see what all the fuzz was about this product. So yeah it is okay and I see little change but nothing major so far.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an eyecream. I dont have any serious wrinkles yet, but my eyes do look dark, tired, and puffy sometimes. I put this on morning and night. I do notice a difference. My eyes look moisturized and brighter skin on the lower and upper lids. It soaks in about a minute or two. Make up goes on easily following. Love Mizon products.</li>
    <li> i dont know what does this cream, but ive got an opened bottle with less than a half of the cream left. Pbviously used. Total disappointment</li>
    <li> There is not a cream in the world that&#x27;s a miracle cream. But we still buy it and slather it on everyday. That being said I am one of those gals that will still buy whatever cream I hear generating buzz. The whole snail therapy idea seems logical after reading studies on cell regenerating but not enough evidence to back it up. However I personally noticed a difference with consistent use and not skipping a day. I use this twice a day along with the whole line. it seems to hide the lines around eyes. I will buy this again because its rich in texture and I love the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> There only half bottle of Eye Cream inside!!!!! And when I open the box, the Eye Cream bottle is covered with dust.</li>
    <li> LOVE this eye cream. Super light and absorbs quickly. I feel like it&#x27;s lightened my dark under eye area considerably and is moisturizing. I want to try the other mizon snail under eye cream to compare but otherwise would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> In three days I saw a difference, I recently had a baby and my bags are dark now but since using this product I&#x27;ve cleared them.. I use a thin layer even on my face . its been good since I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am a snail cream convert. This is magic. I love it. I notice a huge difference in my eye area. The eye cream also does not have a smell, and is pleasant with a nice texture. I&#x27;ve found a winner. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mother who is 53 with crows feet and some other little rinkles here and there. i was trying to prove to her that Korean beauty products are the future and that she needs to stop wasting so much money at lancome, well...i was right and since she started using this her crows feet have almost disappeared and she has asked me where she can find other products like this. i highly reccommend products from mizon and now my mother does too!</li>
    <li> My skin is more prone to breakouts if I use this cream. Also, I noticed deeper wrinkles around my eyes if I keep using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the original mizon cream works much better.</li>
    <li> Im liking it so far. I have only been using it for 2 weeks but so far so good. I like the smooth texture and feel on my eye. Not heavy! At least my eyes dont look tired or puffy. So i guess its great!</li>
    <li> l love this product! thanks!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I lived without this cream! I have very very dark circles that are hereditary and I decided to try this cream. The results are amazing. It&#x27;s only been a week and my circles are visibly lighter! Never going back to anything else. I am very pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Really nice eye cream! will purchase more of these products</li>
    <li> Not sticky or slimie feels like any other cream, I notice my lines are slowly disappearing and my face feels baby smooth</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of time, and like all the other reviewers who said that there was a big chunk of the product &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;, my bottle also seemed like it was missing half the product. BUT total misunderstanding, things shift during transportation, especially creams like these. So if it looks like your bottle is missing some product, tap it on a soft surface a couple of times and your bottle should be properly filled. I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, I just felt that this poor bottle of snail slime was being reviewed unjustly...but I have high hopes. The eye cream that I have been using (from Origins) just wasn&#x27;t working and I tried it for 3 months! So yeah 4 stars because of the quick delivery, nice packaging, amount of product (size matters, 25ml compared to the regular 15ml), and the price. Will update on effectiveness :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK eye cream, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out what exactly is causing clogged pores on my temples/brow (not acne, just bumps...they are different from how I normally break out and it&#x27;s not allergic reaction or milia.) It might be this but it makes my eyelids feel nice and not dry. Hrm.</li>
    <li> I was using Boots No7 Beautiful Skin Rich Hydrating Eye Cream before I started using Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference; I&#x27;d like to think both products work well. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes yet, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it helps with aging and wrinkles, but it keeps my eyes nice and hydrated. My two cons about this product is (1) it burns my eyes if I accidently get some product in my eye, and (2) the tub packaging is annoying (I prefer tubes or pumps, like Boots No7). Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear off, doesn&#x27;t create any growths around my eye, and it seems to absorb into my skin fairly quickly. But, because of it&#x27;s packaging, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. If you don&#x27;t mind the tub-packaging, you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, I&#x27;m liking it so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties and just wanted to prevent crow feet around my eyes,  I didn&#x27;t want something strong since I barely have wrinkles. The Mizon snail repair creamis really moisturizing has interesting texture sort of like aqua mask. It comes with a small spoon spatula but it usually gets lost.  I&#x27;d recommend it for a person wanting to moisturize the eye area and prevent wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Received this cream yesterday and tried it for the first time last night.  I have to say that the skin around my eyes and on my eyelids is more hydrated and smooth than I have seen using any other eye cream -- including the expensive ones.  At only $21, with shipping, for 25 ml (0.85 oz compared to standard 0.50 oz), I definitely feel that I am getting a top quality product at less than a drugstore price.  Having only used the cream once so far, I can&#x27;t answer for its long-term benefits such as wrinkle reduction, but will try to write another review after I&#x27;ve used it for a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days later:  I&#x27;m not one for updating my reviews, but wow!  Just three applications of this eye cream, and I can&#x27;t see my crow&#x27;s feet anymore.  And this from a 52-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 weeks later:&lt;br /&gt;My crow&#x27;s feet at the corner of my eyes are gone, and they haven&#x27;t returned.  Brow area and eye lids have firmed up markedly, and puffiness under my eyes is gone, too.  Eye area stays hydrated for well over 24 hours.  I&#x27;ve used plenty of eye creams over the years, including some quite expensive ones, and I have never, ever seen such remarkable results as I&#x27;ve seen with the Snail Repair Eye Cream.  It truly is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 years later:&lt;br /&gt;Still using this eye cream and still seeing wonderful, amazing results. Everything the other eye creams promise but don&#x27;t deliver, this eye cream does -- and it&#x27;s a great value, too. I recommend this cream to all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works for me. :)</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Item as described,... I just used it and I will wait for the results/effects then I will give another review.</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok, no better or worse than other products. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for that reason, although for an eye cream, the price is fantastic. Still looking for the ultimate eye cream. No weird scent, easy application, no sensitivity issues, and no balling under makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for its price.</li>
    <li> Had no idea what to expect from a snail cream, but my eye area has definitely been brighter and tighter since I started using it... who knew?! And for the price, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> My package came much earlier than the dates Amazon gave me. My item was neatly packaged and was not opened or \\&quot;used\\&quot; like other customers seem to be claiming. I was also given about six samples of other popular Korean skin care brands such as Etude House, Skin Food, and Tony Moly. I think that the customers complaining about \\&quot;used\\&quot; eye creams are just misinformed. I used to work in cosmetics and due to things shifting about during shipment, some of our product&#x27;s contents (if they were liquid or even gel or creams in jars) would shift during transit. So, if a package sat in a certain position for an extended period, the contents of it&#x27;s container also shifted to one side of the jar, thus making it appear as if it was partially used. If you sat it on a flat service in a warm room for some time, it would resume it&#x27;s natural state of being spread across the entire jar interior. This is especially common with gels, creams, or products containing collagen or having a certain thickness to them. Lotions in tubs or jars rather than tubes also do this.    As for the cream itself, I do not have any issues. It&#x27;s wonderfully hydrating, does not smell bad, does not irritate my skin, and lasts a long time. You don&#x27;t need to use much of it and I&#x27;m expecting this jar to last me quite a few months, possibly even a year, before I would need to reorder. The portion is so much more generous than what I was being given with Clinique&#x27;s eye creams. I&#x27;m 23 and don&#x27;t have aging issues, but I use this as a prevention and hydration treatment. I have oily skin and it did not break me out. I do have natural under eye folds, which I had found out from my dermatologist are not wrinkles, though they are aggravating to me because they make me appear exhausted. This cream softens them and I&#x27;m very grateful for that.    I also purchased the snail bb cream and it&#x27;s amazing. I really don&#x27;t have any other way to describe it other than it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m Asian/European mixed and I have very fair skin thathas never sat well with Western foundations, bb creams, pressed powders, or concealers because they&#x27;re always turning me orange or yellow. The snail bb cream not only is PERFECT for those of Japanese or Russian ethnicity (if your family has the really fair skin genes), but it works so well under translucent powder, does not run, and does not smudge. My face is no longer a different color than the rest of my body, unlike what foundations would do to me. I haven&#x27;t suffered a breakout from this, either. Today was only my first day wearing it and I just came home and ordered two more bottles!</li>
    <li> This eye cream has an extremely silky feel &amp; helps my skin stay hyrdrated throughout the day.  My eye make up goes on better,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; smoother, especially eye liners.  Possibly &amp;#34;The Find&amp;#34; in eye creams and price is so much more reasonable than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using an eye cream that is $135.00 for a tiny little jar and this works better for under $15.00, proving you dont have to pay&lt;br /&gt;the big department store prices to get an effective eye cream.  If you have dry skin &amp; wrinkles this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my forehead and it appears to be helping with wrinkles.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one and it is gentle. Does not&lt;br /&gt;burn the eyes like some others.</li>
    <li> Gives dry under eyes great moisture!</li>
    <li> this is so smooth and moisturizing! some eye creams make my eyes itchy and irritated but this one doesn&#x27;t. i love how smoothly my concealer applies on top of this. will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Used this religiously. Nada. Didn&#x27;t do anything with my wrinkles other than moisturize my face. Not worth the money and hopes. Just didn&#x27;t work for me. Hope it works better for others. Think I need something more powerful.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle it seemed like it contained less product than what it should be. The eye cream itself didn&#x27;t reach till the top of the bottle. There was like a gap in the middle. Its hydrating but I can&#x27;t tell more than that as I just started using the eye cream. I received the eye cream in an extra big box, which I didn&#x27;t really appreciate much because I get charged for shipping according to the dimension of the package. The shipping cost was more than I calculated. Other than that, its a good product.</li>
    <li> awful would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I could only use this eye cream twice, because it burned my skin so bad I had to wash it off both times. I was looking for something to hydrate the dry skin around my eyes and this was the opposite of hydrating for me.</li>
    <li> I am trying to plug this in my skin routine and sometimes I forget. I definitely notice the difference when I skip it for a few days. it makes my eyes less puffy. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent and effective Product.</li>
    <li> The effect is moderate.</li>
    <li> Not doing too much on my skin.</li>
    <li> It was a risky buy , but i m glad it is very different and hydrating . I am using for  2 weeks and My dark circles are littleeeee bit light now . I will continue too use it .</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this cream but when I owned the jar (no seal on the box or an inner seal) I was dismayed to see a long black hair mixed in.  Thank you Amazon for making returns so easy.</li>
    <li> First things first, I like it. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but it definitely feels nice going onto my skin. It&#x27;s more like a serum than a cream, and it&#x27;s really light going onto the skin. As far as everyone says about it feeling sticky, I don&#x27;t have that problem. It does feel a little greasy but that just means it&#x27;s really moisturizing. I am only 20 years of age but I wanted to start a good skin care routine early, so as far as this product fighting wrinkles goes, I can&#x27;t say 100% but I don&#x27;t have any problems with irritation on my skin and it soaks right in. I could put makeup on over it if I used it in the morning, but I use it before I go to bed after I shower. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I opened the box, the container had dust all over it and I felt like the jar wasn&#x27;t as full as it should have been. I don&#x27;t feel like I got what I paid for, but for the price, I won&#x27;t argue. So if you&#x27;re considering this product, I would definitely say to go for it. The shipping was incredibly fast-- came within 2 days of ordering and aside from the minor complaints I have I am pleased. Will I buy this again? I will have to use it for a few weeks before I give a definite yes or no answer.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It is so light I wear it during the day. A little goes a long way. It is too early to tell if it is repairing the eye area skin.  I will have more to say later.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye cream and was skeptical. After using it for several weeks, I&#x27;m happy with it! I can&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, but every other instead. It seems to be a little too strong if used every day for me. It feels good and doesn&#x27;t have a smell with it. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The bottle comes half empty. Does NOT worth the money.</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND IT COMES IN A GOOD SIZE.</li>
    <li> Not that effective as yet</li>
    <li> Almost done with the entire jar.  I have not seen any difference.  It&#x27;s just a big jar of plain eye cream to me.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars but my containers lid came to me cracked. It didn&#x27;t harm the product inside but I just wish it hadn&#x27;t cracked on the way to me. Otherwise the eye cream itself is pretty good and hydrating and it a staple. You only need a fairly small amount! And theirs a lot of product in this jar than you may think. Just as expensive as some drugstore eye creams so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This eye cream works great as far as moisturizing goes but it burns a tad after its applied, the burning lasts about 2 or 3 minutes and then goes away. I can&#x27;t day much in regards to wrinkles as I am 22 years old but my eye area is much less dry than it used to be. For reference have super dry skin. I started using this as preventative measures for wrinkles and hadn&#x27;t used an eye cream before this.  Overall I will keep looking for an eye cream that doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> the product was open and half used!</li>
    <li> I was browsing for eye creams when I came across this snail product. I&#x27;m only 21 years old so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles to worry about yet but the cold harsh NYC weather really dries my skin out and I needed something meant for eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this every morning and night habitually and although I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes in my eyelids, it has cured my dryness and is a great primer for eye makeup. It absorbs fast and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product. I just take a small dot and gently tap it on and around my eye. Don&#x27;t rub! That pulls your eye skin causing wrinkles in the long term. Another plus is that when it gets in your eye it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and it has no scent. Great gentle eye cream!</li>
    <li> Received the item on time. However, the product is one year expired! I returned it and expecting a refund. Always read the expiration date on all items you are purchasing, it maybe the reason of skin reaction.</li>
