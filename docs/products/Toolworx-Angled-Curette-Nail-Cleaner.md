      <li>I think it is very well made and will last forever, I just find myself not using it every day</li>
      <li>Should have more and larger pictures of the tips, which are actually identical, so that is a waste as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sharp, so it shouldn&#x27;t cut you.</li>
      <li>Has weird little circles on the edges that kind of scrape away underneath the nail, but does not have the pointy side I expected, more like on a dental instrument, that I thought would help really get under the nail bed and move dead skin out of the way.</li>
      <li>its rounded/blunt scoops on each end it painlessly worked like a charm and will certainly find regular use in the future for other non-fungal, nail-related issues/applications on both the upper and lower</li>

    <li> It is very strong, and you can get into small places, but the ends are sharper than I would like, and I struggle with holding it at the right angle for what I need.  I think it is very well made and will last forever, I just find myself not using it every day like I thought I would.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality nail cleaner. It&#x27;s a lot like a dental tool, but the ends are made for nail cleaning.</li>
    <li> In my quest for improved toenail health, I&#x27;ve tried numerous tools for the various jobs. This little tool is high quality, does the job well, and will last a long time. Don&#x27;t be fooled by its delicate appearance--its sharp enough to remove unwanted build-up under the nail. Its angled tips make reaching under nails easier if you lack flexibility! A guaranteed hard worker.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and is a solid functional too, but I cannot see a difference in performance between this and a metal nail file tip....</li>
    <li> This was the first item by Body Toolz that I purchased and like the ingrown toenail clippers and the ingrown toenail file (see my reviews) that I bought subsequently I am very pleased with this curette double-angle nail cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically purchased one of these handy, extremely durable, stainless steel, double-sided, angled tools for both left and right-handed scooping of keratin and other nail debris out from beneath my large right toenail while it was undergoing fungal nail treatment with Kerasal (see my review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what was needed to keep the area in question free and clear and thus maximize the effectiveness of the daily applications of the antifungal medicinal therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its rounded/blunt scoops on each end it painlessly worked like a charm and will certainly find regular use in the future for other non-fungal, nail-related issues/applications on both the upper and lower extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely thick fungal nails a more radical approach in addition to this curette double angle nail cleaner can be effective.

    <li> Strange little tool for cleaning around toenails; but it work really well. It&#x27;s not sharp, so it shouldn&#x27;t cut you. However, it has just the right angle for \\&quot;pushing\\&quot; between toenails and the skin around toenails.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to have paddle like tips. It is a good quality tool and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a long time ago, loved it and decided to get another.  That vendor sent me something different but Amazon refunded my money quickly without hassel (Thanks Amazon).  The look-alike that was sent was flimsy and the spoons were way too small to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vendor, Body Toolz, sent the correct item, now I have one for the house and one for my purse.  I love this tool because you can scrape away overgrown cuticle if need be and it cleans under nails very well.  I also use it to clean my 3 year old&#x27;s nails.

    <li> Very useful tool for cleaning under nails.  I also like to use it to remove cuticle from the surface of the nail.  The angle makes that easier for me.</li>
