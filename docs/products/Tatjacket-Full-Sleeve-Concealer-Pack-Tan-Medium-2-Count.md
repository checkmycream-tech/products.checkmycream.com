      <li>These tatjackets are amazing</li>
      <li>They match my skin nicely.</li>
      <li>The elastic at the top of the sleeve by the shoulder is very good quality and it will not slide much</li>
      <li>Very comfortable, does not hold heat, wicks away</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and fit nice.</li>
      <li>love&#x27;em.  </li>
      <li>Not the most fashionable item.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>I love my tattoos, but my boss doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34; says it all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, if I could do over, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s able to push it up to do shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Works great and covers tattoos very well, I wear it all the time to the hospital for my clinicals for school and most people at a glance do not realize I have it on.</li>
      <li>The Tatjacket is so much more comfortable!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>At times the sleeve wasn&#x27;t able to be noticed.  </li>
      <li>i love them now</li>
      <li>The fit is great, the material is cool and light but doesn&#x27;t show my tattoo through.</li>
      <li>make up doesn&#x27;t cover great but its fine thanks</li>
      <li>Rubs a bit on the arm but other than it does its job perfect.</li>
      <li>Good product, works as advertised, good price, and so far has been pretty durable</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and cool 😎.</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and cool and easy to wash.</li>
      <li>and we received it very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Tatjacket sleeves are great, definitely recommend :)</li>
      <li>its awesome for work when i need to hide my sleeve, jush wish it covered the shoulder also, none the less no body can tell diff</li>
      <li>Overall, this is great and I will probably get a lot of use out of it.</li>
      <li>Overall, great product.</li>
      <li>While not 100% match for most peoples skin color, this product is quite useful, I purchased it for my wife to wear over her tatoo at work</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, comfortable and my tattoo doesn&#x27;t show though at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These sleeves also serve a great second purpose in aiding of healing fresh ink; one of the healing methods we employ is to use moistener of choice, plastic wrap and then the cover-up sleeve to hold the wrap in place while sleeping.</li>
      <li>It does stay cool.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great product</li>
      <li>Due to my employer enforcing their &amp;#34;no visible tattoos&amp;#34; policy, I purchased a pair to keep my employer happy.  </li>
      <li>they keep your arms cool during hot days and are comfortable to wear...</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>Well, covered the tattoo very well and was comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Rarely ever have to pull it up; maybe once every 6 or 7 hours.</li>
      <li>The product does the job, just gotta get your sizing right.</li>
      <li>Just right for me, to protect my arms from the sun on hikes.</li>
      <li>Had I bought the small, it would&#x27;ve been more effective.</li>
      <li>They worked very very well to cover the tats on my daughters arms for work but they do take some getting use to</li>
      <li>The only advice I can give is whatever size you think you need get a size smaller and it will fit alot better!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to cover their tattoos comfortably.</li>
      <li>, my arm doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
      <li>I have tried various sleeves and this is one of the better quality ones.</li>
      <li>Exactly what i was expecting</li>
      <li>make sure you order a size smaller...</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>, it works exactly how they say its going to.</li>
      <li>So I read some reviews about the sizes that said the large was enormous and how I&#x27;d be better off with the medium.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that the seam at the top is big, and the elastic seems cheap</li>
      <li>The tattoo cover up sleeves are great other than the color I feel doesnt come close to any human skin.</li>
      <li>Medium too large for my daughter&#x27;s arms.</li>
      <li>Great quality, but I ended up only wearing the black.</li>
      <li>These things saved my aviation career haha</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does cover the tattoos really well.  </li>
      <li>color is also a bit too much like grandma&#x27;s stockings..</li>
      <li>Tatjacket keeps my arms cool in the hot sun and allows me to wear short sleeves during work.</li>
      <li>I bought a pack of these sleeves for my wife; she has a full sleeve on one arm and the need to cover it for certain work and social events.</li>
      <li>When we recieved the originally placed order, the packaged was mismarked and instead of full sleeves, they came as half sleeves.  </li>
      <li>the longer I wear them the more they slide down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more lightweight than a sport sleeve and doesn&#x27;t slide down or bunch up.</li>
      <li>The company ought to consider adding some darker browns, instead of just tan or black, so more people can have them to match their skin tones.</li>
      <li>The problems, I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s skin is this particular color.  </li>
      <li>After a couple wears the band at the top does get loose, but once you wash it, it tightens back up.</li>
      <li>But, it covers up my vividly colored tattoo and it stays on my arm</li>
      <li>At first I was a bit skeptical as to the effectiveness vs comfortable, but my worries were quickly dissipated.  </li>
      <li>The color is not nearly as bad as I expected and actually looks pretty natural.</li>
      <li>This ensures that fresh tattoos do not inadvertently dry out and scab during the night.</li>
      <li>a tight rubber band feel that i do not think is comfortable.</li>
      <li>This product worked very well for the medical surgical floor that I work on.</li>
      <li>I keep them in the car in case I get caught out in the sun unexpectedly.</li>
      <li>As far as performance, the sleeve fully hides the underlying ink and is in no way see-through as are some of the sports compression sleeves</li>
      <li>It really depends on your skin color, but at a quick glance it is hard to tell.</li>
      <li>Good product but can be tight especially for all day wear go little bigger than you think.</li>
      <li>The sleeve fell right down my arm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Medium too large for my daughter&#x27;s arms. Should have gotten small.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product got it in timely manner</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews and figured out I should have had a sleeve size small. Sadly, the size was/is not available, so I got the size M, which is too big and I haven&#x27;t worn the sleeve yet.&lt;br /&gt;The color is also a bit too much like grandma&#x27;s stockings..</li>
    <li> No complaints about this product at all. Does exactly what it says. The only advice I can give is whatever size you think you need get a size smaller and it will fit alot better!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll look great!!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality, but I ended up only wearing the black. These look like grandma&#x27;s nylons.</li>
    <li> I work for a local sherifs department and can&#x27;t have my tattoos showing while on duty. These work good for warm weather, my arm doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> Great sleeves for work.</li>
    <li> As my title implies, this sleeve does the job.  The problems, I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s skin is this particular color.  It has a seam that runs down the back of it and a weird cuff seam at the bottom.  So it looks like you are wearing something for medical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cover the tattoos really well.  It does stay cool.  It hasn&#x27;t shrunk or stretched - I wear it and wash it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you need to cover tattoos this is a great solution.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these sleeves for my wife; she has a full sleeve on one arm and the need to cover it for certain work and social events. The color is not a perfect match to her skin tone, but from 5 feet away you cannot tell. The cuff is also not overly apparent as to draw attention that you are in fact trying to cover a tattoo. As far as performance, the sleeve fully hides the underlying ink and is in no way see-through as are some of the sports compression sleeves I see some individuals using for cover-up purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sleeves also serve a great second purpose in aiding of healing fresh ink; one of the healing methods we employ is to use moistener of choice, plastic wrap and then the cover-up sleeve to hold the wrap in place while sleeping. This ensures that fresh tattoos do not inadvertently dry out and scab during the night.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected- covers well, stays in place, and nice and breathable!</li>
    <li> Great purchase! It&#x27;s lightweight, comfortable and my tattoo doesn&#x27;t show though at all. After a couple wears the band at the top does get loose, but once you wash it, it tightens back up. I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Well, covered the tattoo very well and was comfortable.  At times the sleeve wasn&#x27;t able to be noticed.  Very comfortable and cool 😎.</li>
    <li> The medium was a little big for my arm. Had I bought the small, it would&#x27;ve been more effective. The product does the job, just gotta get your sizing right.</li>
    <li> Good product but can be tight especially for all day wear go little bigger than you think. Product holds up to use would buy again.</li>
    <li> its awesome for work when i need to hide my sleeve, jush wish it covered the shoulder also, none the less no body can tell diff</li>
    <li> Just right for me, to protect my arms from the sun on hikes. I keep them in the car in case I get caught out in the sun unexpectedly. They match my skin nicely. The company ought to consider adding some darker browns, instead of just tan or black, so more people can have them to match their skin tones.</li>
    <li> Needed for cosmetology school to cover tats on my daughter&#x27;s arm.  It worked perfectly.  She&#x27;s able to push it up to do shampoos.  She is happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Rubs a bit on the arm but other than it does its job perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly what i was expecting</li>
    <li> WAY too yellow.&lt;br /&gt;and very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> So I read some reviews about the sizes that said the large was enormous and how I&#x27;d be better off with the medium. NOT TRUE. I ordered the medium and it was far to small. I brought the size issue up with the seller and they were awesome. They sent out a replacement (size L) just in time for an occasion I needed these cover-ups for. Great product that stays put that feels durable. Rarely ever have to pull it up; maybe once every 6 or 7 hours.</li>
    <li> Works great and covers tattoos very well, I wear it all the time to the hospital for my clinicals for school and most people at a glance do not realize I have it on. It really depends on your skin color, but at a quick glance it is hard to tell. The elastic at the top of the sleeve by the shoulder is very good quality and it will not slide much, I had a basket ball one \\&quot;NBA\\&quot; and it would slide off all the time. This sleeve will also not stretch out overtime. The package comes with 2 sleeve for booth arms or as a back up sleeve. I keep one in my car incase i need to cover my tats on the go. It is made of polyester and not cotton so when you wash it the little cotton balls will not form. The sleeve is also not hot like cotton can be and it is not itchy at all. I have tried various sleeves and this is one of the better quality ones.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it has a hard seem down the length of the sleeve.  The ends have a tight rubber band feel that i do not think is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Not the most fashionable item. Kinda makes your arm look like a cabbage patch doll. But, it covers up my vividly colored tattoo and it stays on my arm so I don&#x27;t have to wear a jacket to work in the hotter, summer months. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> Due to my employer enforcing their &amp;#34;no visible tattoos&amp;#34; policy, I purchased a pair to keep my employer happy.  At first I was a bit skeptical as to the effectiveness vs comfortable, but my worries were quickly dissipated.  Very comfortable, does not hold heat, wicks away moisture...  Very similar to under armor.  Entire tattooed segment of our workforce is now ordering them.</li>
    <li> make up doesn&#x27;t cover great but its fine thanks</li>
    <li> These tatjackets are amazing i love them now i dont have to where 2shirts at work. I wear scrubs and was told i had to cover my arm tats. So for the last couple yrs ive had to wear two shirts.  Then i found this product and i love it, it works exactly how they say its going to.</li>
    <li> They worked very very well to cover the tats on my daughters arms for work but they do take some getting use to</li>
    <li> Fits perfect and comfortable</li>
    <li> these sleeves work great i do hate wearing them cause they cover my tats but the job requires them. I am glad they are comfortable so as not to make the fact my tats are hidden such a bad experience.</li>
    <li> make sure you order a size smaller...like I ordered a med..get a small. The sleeve fell right down my arm. Didn&#x27;t do a bit of good. The problem is they don&#x27;t sell small at all...so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless your built like the guy in the picture.</li>
    <li> These are a must have if your a Police Officer with tattoos.</li>
    <li> I recently started riding my bicycle to work. Tatjacket keeps my arms cool in the hot sun and allows me to wear short sleeves during work. I&#x27;m a manager at a four diamond hotel, and I don&#x27;t think I could have become one without it. &amp;#34;because I love my tattoos, but my boss doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34; says it all.</li>
    <li> My fiance is a RN and wears one. We are both tattooed and she swears by them. I work in an office and would rather wear a long sleeve shirt. It&#x27;s really not noticeable unless you look close. She has the tan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, if I could do over, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them. They wont stay up on my arm, the longer I wear them the more they slide down. The elastic isn&#x27;t holding up like it should. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s too small or too tight or if it&#x27;s just not a good product. If I could do-over, I &#x27;may&#x27; have bought the wrist-only one. If I were to attempt wearing these with short-sleeves, I&#x27;d be shooting myself in the foot because my tattoos would be showing after about half an hour.</li>
    <li> My husband needs these for work. We buy them all the time from the same people. They are great! Only thing is we need to know how to get the paint out of them. Ha ha.</li>
    <li> The tattoo cover up sleeves are great other than the color I feel doesnt come close to any human skin. They are very comfortable and fit nice. I am going to order a pair in black because the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is just so not a color u can wear unless u are a cabbage patch kid in skin tone. Other than that it is a great product</li>
    <li> These things saved my aviation career haha</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I&#x27;ve always had to wear long sleeved shirts under my clothes, or a sport sleeve, to work. The Tatjacket is so much more comfortable! It&#x27;s much more lightweight than a sport sleeve and doesn&#x27;t slide down or bunch up. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to cover their tattoos comfortably. Also, I suggest getting a size smaller than you think you need.</li>
    <li> Needed these because my work asked me to cover up my tats...  they keep your arms cool during hot days and are comfortable to wear... Tatjacket sleeves are great, definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for work just what I needed</li>
    <li> They are perfect, I had to use them for my teaching class. My observing teacher didn&#x27;t even notice do they work!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the job! A little long for short arms, but still comfortable. Even arrived before said date. Bonus!</li>
    <li> While not 100% match for most peoples skin color, this product is quite useful, I purchased it for my wife to wear over her tatoo at work so she wouldnt have to wear long sleeves all the time and she (and her boss) is happy with the results.  Good product, works as advertised, good price, and so far has been pretty durable</li>
    <li> love&#x27;em.  i just wish my boss wasn&#x27;t a douche and make me wear&#x27;em.</li>
    <li> third par i have bought just wish i could findd a pair just for my forearms. need to cover that not al the way to my biceps.</li>
    <li> When we recieved the originally placed order, the packaged was mismarked and instead of full sleeves, they came as half sleeves.  I contacted Tatjacket and they imediately sent the correct item and we received it very quickly.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for the medical surgical floor that I work on. Just need it in white and maybe just one size smaller.</li>
    <li> A bit on the expensive side for these sleeves, however they work!  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect! 10/10 Tat Jacket is a Job Keeping/Getting Tool Recommend them to anyone with arm tattoo&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I may have ordered a size too large for my arms (I really wish Size Small was available) but the sleeves still manage to stay in place, with minor adjusting after a few hours. They are very comfortable and cool and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Perfect everything about!</li>
    <li> I have a tattoo that covers my forearm and need to cover it up for work. I ordered this in Tan, feeling nervous that it would be an awful color like many of the reviews said. The color is not nearly as bad as I expected and actually looks pretty natural. The fit is great, the material is cool and light but doesn&#x27;t show my tattoo through. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that the seam at the top is big, and the elastic seems cheap so it bites into the underside of my arm no matter how long I have it on. Overall, this is great and I will probably get a lot of use out of it.</li>
