<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product. Foams well, no fluoride-gluten-SLS to worry about, has baking soda, tea tree oil, neem oil, sea salt, etc. and wintergreen leaf oil for this flavor is hardly noticeable. Seems very gentle but the essential oils ingredients can be very effective. Tube weighs net 6.5 ounces/176 grams but remember a little goes a long way.    For those who have gum disease, find yourself some food grade neem oil and apply at the tooth and gum line front and back with a Q-tip. Rinse lightly to leave some residue on. Try it daily for a week at night and see what happens to any inflammation. Doesn&#x27;t taste all that great and smells worse but will do the job on bacteria. Works on skin problems too. Swishing with food grade charcoal, plant base ex. coconut, and holding that in your month for 10, 15, 20 minutes will also kill bacteria and the slight acid base will whiten teeth. Don&#x27;t brush with it, to gritty and abrasive but it will absorb and neutralizes bacteria then rinse it all out when done. Once a week would be more than enough for a regimen.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste works great. The package was shipped quickly as well which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Really like this toothpaste.  No overwhelming taste, just a nice clean feel after brushing.  Good service; will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use every day ,i don&#x27;t understand anymore the regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Waiting for checkup results but So far so good</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I use, I have reordered many times and the price is the same as the Health Food Stores.</li>
    <li> Love this fluoride free all natural toothpaste without all the chemicals and it&#x27;s Made in the USA. I&#x27;ve tried the peppermint too, but prefer this flavor.  Tea Tree and Neem is supposed to have healing properties for your gums.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste once to give it a try. I just got it a second time because I LOVED it. It leaves your mouth feeling so clean and fresh. I have braces and some toothpastes burn my mouth but this one is perfect. I highly recommend it!! You will never go back to the other &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name toothpastes again!</li>
    <li> The taste is a little strong and unusual at first, but I love this product.</li>
    <li> Good taste, good price, organic. What&#x27;s not to like</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Keeps teeth white and doesn&#x27;t taste bad</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste  around and cheapest  price  around!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste. Found it first at Whole Foods, so when I liked it.  Next time I bought it on Amazon.  It is great, tastes good, no flouride, and does the job.  I had gum disease and I like using the &#x27;melaleuca&#x27; aka Tea Tree Oil, to sooth the gums.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Fab!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste if you don&#x27;t want the  traditional foaming and burning toothpaste. Cleans well and leaves your mouth fresh.  This is an easy way to get the toothpaste- very fast service.</li>
    <li> We have been enjoying this toothpaste for several months now. It provides a healthy alternative to the commercial toothpastes that are not as good for us, despite being touted that way. Definitely worth trying out!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - good product - no nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Keeps your teeth white, SO minty and not sweet, which I love.  I recently went on a trip and had to be without it for four days and could FEEL that my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean.  When I got home, one brush with this stuff again and I was as good as new.  My teeth are so squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Has reversed my 10 pockets. Definitely a must have for periodontal disease victims. I see a real difference in my gums.</li>
    <li> Love the fennel flavor,my teeth seems to be whiter now.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Before I was using Colgate and other big name brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, because I started getting a line of natural shampoos/conditioners and essential oils (one of which is tea tree oil!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more effective for me. My breath is definitely neutral and my teeth are far whiter than before. I&#x27;m guessing the anti-septic properties are working better for my teeth and killing really small bacteria that cause discoloration of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap.....but is it worth the price? It is in my book, especially if you don&#x27;t have 3 or 4 people in the household who also use it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...decent taste, no chemicals, and good foaming action :-)</li>
    <li> It is really good. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming mint taste. It just tastes clean. 😊</li>
    <li> Meh.  It tastes ok and works ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to give that same clean feel as products with more chemicals.  That being said, this is like 5 million times better than Tom&#x27;s products.  So if you need to go natural, this is a good choice.  I will probably be heading back to drugstore brands though.</li>
    <li> Started using this toothpaste due to health concerns.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect at first but was pleasantly surprised.  After using the toothpaste my mouth felt clean and I had fresher breath.  I would highly recommend this product.  It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars only because I&#x27;m still looking into some of the items used to make the toothpaste.  I was hoping for 100% organic and toxin free.</li>
    <li> I love this natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and usually purchased it from Whole Foods. Thank goodness that I can purchase it through Amazon. It lasts long, and keeps your teeth squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste so far! Great product.</li>
    <li> While the toothpaste does not whiten my teeth, it does leave a clean and refreshing taste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains two of my favorite ingredients for healthy gums - tea tree and neem. However, the formulation is sorely lacking (pun intended!) due to the fact that it contains no fluoride. I used this twice a day exclusively for 2 weeks before I noticed my front teeth had become extremely sensitive and painful. Fluoride is needed to keep tooth enamel healthy and enable re-mineralization, so I wish this came in a fluoride version. Therefore, I will need to cut down my usage to every other day, once a day.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a really good flavor.  I purchased it for the Neem.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and leaves your mouth nice and clean.  Will be using this toothpaste from now on - flavor is fantastic and my teeth are nice and pearly white.  Was afraid of enamel damage from some of the other brands and this seems to be perfect for remedying the concern.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. takes away sensitivity, I enjoy the flavor and I am not poisoning myself with fluoride, checks ups ok so far too.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product as I am more recently in love with more natural cosmetic products, especially tea tree oil. The taste is very unappetizing to start with and it only fades further after brushing. The lather is very intense after brushing for a few minutes if you use the traditional half inch strip of paste. I tried using only a pea sized amount and I never felt that my mouth was truly clean. I think if I used this product for longer than a week that I would get better results but I noticed my gums were getting swollen so I had to discontinue use. For someone who was looking for natural products and did not have evidence of other dental health issues, I think this product would be good for maintenance.</li>
    <li> No artificial anything, no poisonous fluoride, not  bad tasting. If there is better I haven&#x27;t found it, but not really exciting.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no other toothpaste me or my family will use besides this!</li>
    <li> Very fresh and invigorating flavor.  Smooth texture and not gritty.  Teeth felt clean and smooth after use.</li>
    <li> Not only did it ship fast, I just had to try it immediately!!!!! Omg!!!!!! I&#x27;m sold and never using another brand of toothpaste again!!!! Definitely ordering more!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this!!! It&#x27;s my favorite!! I used to use Jason, and this is ten times better!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very good natural product that does last a long time.</li>
    <li> Best natural toothpaste I have ever used!  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I have had gum disease for many years. Each check-up seemed to show the pockets getting worse and the dental scaling is not a fun experience.  About a year ago, I started looking at various essential oils and their uses.  I wanted to try a toothpaste with tea tree oil.  I had also heard of the great benefits of neem oil.  When I saw the reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try.  (I purchase it locally because it is the same cost as ordering it.)  I love this product.  I waited almost a year to review, because I wanted to see how the dental check-up went after using this product.  I just had the best dental check that I have had in years.  I had a small area on the left side that still needs some attention, but the rest of my mouth was in great shape. I was told I had no plaque.  It had been a year since my last visit.  Of course, the dentist was not pleased that I am no longer using a toothpaste with flouride. didn&#x27;t think tea tree oil would do anything to help my teeth and wanted me to return to a name brand mouthwash.  The results were outstanding using this product. I am very happy with the results, even if he wasn&#x27;t.  I also use the Desert Essence Tea Tree Mouthwash.  I love the taste of both and have bought both repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Really, really foamy! I miss the good flavors of traditional toothpastes but what can you do. That&#x27;s the price you pay for better ingredients. Overall, I&#x27;d say the flavor is decent though. I think it works pretty well, but it&#x27;s kinda hard to judge toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Best natural toothpaste I have ever used!! I have tried many pastes before and never felt satisfied. I would constantly find myself going back for just a brush or two with crest or a toothpaste that I actually felt gave me that feeling of minty cleanness. This toothpaste delivers that feeling while still being natural and healthy. Although a bit pricier than most, I feel it&#x27;s worth it! I have finally found a product that is healthy and effective. I would highly recommend this product to you!</li>
    <li> Great flavor, you only need a little at a time, lasts for forever.</li>
    <li> Tried this based on reviews, very pleased, the taste is mild and refreshing vs the chemical traditional toothpastes. Lasted me about 6 months, had a very good cleaning checkup after using, so I think it was helpful. I will continue buying this as my daily toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have used the Desert Essence Toothpaste for more than 3 years now, and I love it.  (No cavities!)  I like using this natural toothpaste plus since San Diego now adds Fluoride to the drinking water, I would rather not use a Fluoride toothpaste (e.g. Crest) in addition to drinking tap water with Fluoride.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I am giving this 4 stars because I really like the way it tastes and how clean it makes me teeth feel. It doesn&#x27;t leave that sugary sweet taste behind like other toothpastes. It also appears to be a good value, because it&#x27;s a pretty big tube and you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it. I am really hoping for good results at my next dentist appointment! If it&#x27;s good, I will definitely bump this up to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Nice fresh toothpaste and without any fluoride which is already too prevalent in our water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for several months and I love it. It keeps my mouth feeling clean all day and it has a very pleasant taste. I&#x27;m definitely a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I like the taste very much. It is very soft and leaves a minty fresh taste in your mouth. The best thing of all is that it does not have all the bad chemicals. It arrived fast. I would recommend it to anybody that wants to keep the teeth healthy and ready for the dentist to see.</li>
    <li> This product tastes GREAT!!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was thinking that tea tree oil and neem might be bitter tasting, but I was willing to deal with it knowing the toothpaste was healthy for me.  But I was so happy when I first tried it and discovered it tastes just as good as any other toothpaste.  And I feel good knowing I&#x27;m not putting sucralose, sacharine or flouride into my body anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came well packed and shipped quickly.  Would do business with this merchant again for sure!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing!  I have been battling minor periodontal and after using this toothpaste just for a few days along with doing a couple of other things my gums look healthier and the color looks much better. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My husband  like the product really good if he like it has to be good</li>
    <li> I have searched quite awhile for a more natural toothpaste, but so many felt like I was using wet sand. I really missed the foaming aspect, but hated using ones with fluoride.  This has a perfect mint flavor, and foams up great.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Great alternative to standard offerings.  Good for your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This was my second time ordering this product. It always comes on time and is a wonderful product! It will be a regular item in our bathroom!</li>
    <li> Healed my sore gums after 2 tubes! Just ordered my third! Never going back to Colgate or Crest!</li>
    <li> I am about half way through my first tube of this and I am really liking it!</li>
    <li> Other toothpastes seem to over-reach in mint, or other flavors.  This one is just right for me.  I like the cleanliness and freshness.</li>
    <li> Have not been using the toothpaste very long but in a week I saw some very positive results. First let me say I like the mild taste for this toothpaste, not medicine-y or chemical tasting , no strong aftertaste. A little goes a long way. My gums have better color &amp; firmness after only a week. My teeth are brighter &amp; feel slick &amp; clean after I brush. Can&#x27;t wait til next dental cleaning, they will be as impressed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find a natural tea tree toothpaste, thinks it is a healthier choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of this toothpaste. I think it works, but it had a strong baking soda taste and is not very refreshing. My wife uses the kiss my face toothpaste and I like that much better. If this toothpaste had a better taste and freshened my breath better, I would give it more stars.</li>
    <li> Both Neem toothpastes that I biught from Amazon are good. This is the first time I tried this brand. Neem or Tea Tree is the only kind I use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where they got the idea that this stuff taste like wintergreen but it does not. What it does tastes like is that old yellow mouthwash that mom use to buy, ie awful.&lt;br /&gt;noelvm</li>
    <li> I love that this tooth paste has tea tree oil in it.  Nice taste and is not over powering.</li>
    <li> Fast, well-packaged, and exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Seems good, tastes ok, and very foamy.  EWG rates it very low, which is a good thing!</li>
    <li> even though i didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon, i just love this item a lot!&lt;br /&gt;i used to use toms flouride free spearmint toothpaste and i liked it too.&lt;br /&gt;i accidently used this desert essence tea tree oil &amp; neem, wintergreen. and i just fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;it leaves my mouth feel super fresh and clean, more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;i found the off-line store slightly cheaper (which was -i remember- about 7 something dollars + tax)&lt;br /&gt;anyway i will keep using this item in the future!</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this as much as I have. It REALLY cleans your teeth better than conventional toothpastes.  There are no films left on your teeth like with some toothpastes.  Also, the wintergreen tastes good, and is not too overpowering.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  Neem is suppose to be very good for your gums and provides good hygiene for your teeth.</li>
    <li> The tea tree and neem taste was very overwhelming at first, but after a while of using this toothpaste you get used to it and like it. Very refreshing feeling left in your mouth. Cleans my teeth good. I love the paste toothpaste over gel, so this product is awesome for me.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Minty flavored toothpaste that sometimes tastes medicinal. Have not really seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a fine toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Only the best toothpaste ever!!!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old actually likes this stuff! Her grandpa uses it and now it&#x27;s her toothpaste. Works for me, I got to skip those silly fruit flavored toothpastes and all that stuff!</li>
    <li> I had tried this toothpaste with the mint flavor and loved it, as my 5 star rating indicated. However, I like this one even better without the mint flavoring!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for several months. I believe it is helping my teeth not to be as sensitive. The taste if fine once you get used to it. You can definitely taste the tee tree oil. I know that is supposed to be antibacterial, and that&#x27;s a good thing. I will continue to use it. The price is more than  other toothpastes, but if it&#x27;s better, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This is really good-just what I wanted-gets my teeth really clean-I can feel it when I run my tongue over them.</li>
    <li> The price is high but I love this toothpaste and my teeth are very white</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  It is gentle and my teeth do not feel sensitive when I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a year. I am extremely picky with toothpaste overall. The only ingredient that I&#x27;m not crazy about is CALCIUM CARBONATE, its derived from rocks and it ends up calcifying your PINEAL gland (the mother of all glands)!  But I still haven&#x27;t found a toothpaste better than this!</li>
    <li> I liked this toothpaste. It tastes good, kinda like a very mild mint chewing gum. And it&#x27;s SLS free. Overall, no complaints about this. By the way, the toothpaste is white in color in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste hands down. I won&#x27;t purchase any other unless I am in a bind. Great flavor and long lasting fresh breath</li>
    <li> Truly love all Desert Essence products!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I really like this toothpaste. It is nice and clean w/o too much flavor and it is all natural. I use daily and have ordered a new round.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  The neem oil in it helps minimize plaque and tarter buildup.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and my dental hygienist never needs to scrape plaque and tarter off my teeth.  It tastes great if you like wintergreen.</li>
    <li> I love knowing this is all natural &amp; antibacterial -  leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  Also only need a tiny bit as it foams up!</li>
    <li> A good toothpaste that we&#x27;ve been using for years.  Because I have to use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, I use this one for when I brush in between the morning and night.</li>
    <li> Our family favorite for a natural fluoride-free toothpaste alternative.</li>
    <li> Bought this late at night a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;d heard good things about Tea Tree Oil in dental hygiene.  I have NO idea whether it is more effective than any more common toothpaste.  I will say that I did find it a few days later at Whole Foods for a few pennies cheaper (and, of course, no shipping).</li>
    <li> The taste is light and minty. A lot safer to use than a fluoride toothpaste. Arrived promptly.A safe alternative for use than other fluoride products.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will continue to buy it. It came the day I was told.</li>
    <li> great buy. I love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Had problems with several other toothpastes causing shedding on inside of cheeks; also had gum line sores. That has ceased since changing to this toothpaste. Have used it for a month now.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste with no fluoride, but it foams a bit too much. Leaves your teeth slick and clean with a good taste. Box says SLS free (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), but one of the ingredients is Sodium Coco-Sulfate which is just the same. The product states it does not contain SLS, but it does so that definitely a mislabeling. Also you can get it cheaper directly from Desert Essence.</li>
    <li> Did you know that some of the chemicals in commercial toothpastes can cause chapped lips?  Me, either, till a few years ago.  Then I put 2+2 together, did some net research &amp; confirmed the correlation.  Now what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several healthier toothpaste alternatives over the years &amp; this is my hands-down favorite.  Neem is an excellent cleaner and tea tree oil has some antiseptic qualities that lead to clean teeth, fresh breath, and healthy gums.  All in a toothpaste that actually tastes pretty good.  AND, you don&#x27;t have to use much more than a pea-sized dot of paste.  This foams very well, unlike other healthy alternative toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?  Yes and no.  A tube lasts a long time &amp; a healthy mouth is absolutely foundational to your overall health. Google the links between oral health and cardiac health, for starters.  Then check out info on oral health and inflammation.  You&#x27;ll be convinced. Thrilled that Amazon&#x27;s offering this now; hope it gets added to the Subscribe &amp; Save program soon.  Most highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions about this review, please leave a comment &amp; I&#x27;ll help you if I can!</li>
    <li> great toothpaste - I actually have also used this for blemishes on my face -the Neem and tea tree oil make it versatile for use</li>
    <li> I have used this for a about two months now and so far I am very pleased with this product,  my teeth definitely feel stronger and healthier after using it.  The tea tree oil is also very mild.</li>
    <li> This an all NATURAL toothpaste withTea Tree Oils added to it.  Very economical because you only use a &#x27;dab&#x27; of toothpaste (the size of a pea) instead of applying it across the entire tooth brush bristles.  It has a pleasant, natural taste of mint and works very well to sweeten the breath and kills bacteria in the mouth due to the natural Tea Tree Oils added.  I have no worries about using unwanted chemicals in my mouth now, especially &#x27;Sodium Lauryl Sulphate&#x27; which does more &#x27;harm&#x27; than any good for one&#x27;s teeth.  Actually SLS removes enamel from the teeth and is absorbed through the skin and is on the Cancer Causing Ingredients in our Cosmetics and Healthcare products  Update: August, 2016 This is my second time I purchased this &#x27;tooth paste&#x27; and will continue to purchase as my personal contribution to my oral health. I find it to be very pleasant in taste, works well in lathering up with just a dab, and it has lasted two to three times longer than general toothpastes. .</li>
    <li> Arrived on time exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste felt and tasted more like &#x27;toothpaste&#x27;.  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Oh wow this toothpaste is amazing after just 1 week my teeth are whiter, can&#x27;t wait to see them after a month!!!!</li>
    <li> We were surprised at the great taste having tried lots of different brands of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste. This one definitely has the best taste. Nice slim tube that stands upright (which I appreciate as I have limited counter space in the bathroom). Leaves teeth feeling fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> This is great. A different taste. Not sweet. My husband hates sweet toothpaste because it makes him salivate too much. He loves this one. Haven&#x27;t tried the other flavors of the tea tree and neem products.</li>
    <li> Teeth are squeaky clean and I can tell a tremendous difference from Colgate that I&#x27;ve used for years. Sure wish I had switched earlier.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Pleasant taste, not too gritty, not too sweet. Using it only at night; brushing with Colgate Total in the morning. We&#x27;ll see at the next check up if anything stands out.</li>
    <li> I made the move to cruelty free products and this is my first natural toothpaste buy, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I love the taste of this, it&#x27;s nice and minty. I was afraid the texture would be all wrong, but it&#x27;s nice and smooth. For some reason I pictured natural toothpaste to be gritty, who knows why, but this is just like regular toothpaste from the drugstore. I was also worried that my breath wouldn&#x27;t feel as fresh, but again I was wrong. I&#x27;m going to look into the floss and mouthwash of this brand I&#x27;m so happy with this!</li>
    <li> Love using this product! It has the flouride-free option which is good for me.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;the taste isnt the greatest but u get used to it very fast, but this toothpaste keeps my teeth white and clean all day long with only one brush per day, and i love the fact its flouride free, and doesnt irretate my gums.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for years, and absolutely love it.  Discovered it at Whole Foods, after deciding to go fluoride-free.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, refreshing toothpaste that leaves my teeth feeling super without the nasty taste I get from the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; toothpastes. And all the other reviews are right - you only need a very little as it foams a great deal, so a little will go a long way. I like this - I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube of this tooth paste. My gums have never been so healthy. If you looking for a whitening toothpaste, this isn&#x27;t it. It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, smooth and delightful mint tasting Desert Essence Tea Tree toothpaste. Prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> Minty and not sweet. I like the taste and my teeth feel very clean after it. I can&#x27;t go back to the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brands again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for treating bad breath which I expected</li>
    <li> All natural giant tube, works GREAT ! Love it ! Price id great !</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree and Neem. This works great. Using it for over a year, no cavities and my receding gums have reversed. Along with changing my brushing style, I&#x27;d say this stuff works!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite natural toothpaste, by far! I love that it is full of healthy ingredients and still leaves your mouth feeling clean after brushing! I don&#x27;t have the patience to make my own toothpaste and this is a close second to homemade!</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get adjusted to the texture, but it&#x27;s a great product! The winterfresh oil is phenomenal, and my mouth feels exceptionally clean.</li>
    <li> Subtle mint flavor, and good for you! Glad to have found a good, flouride-free toothpaste</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I saw a show on TV about Neem on TV and decided to give it a try. (Neem oil is a vegetable oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of the neem (Azadirachta indica), an evergreen tree which is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. It has properties as an antiseptic, antifungal, antipyretic and antihistamine. From Wikipedia) I have always required a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I now have no sensitivity... none at all, hot or cold. As an added bonus, there are no plaque deposits forming on my teeth between cleanings. It&#x27;s fluoride free, SLS free and gluten free. Who needs that? Nice Wintergreen flavor. I will use this forever. Shipping was good as well. Arrived quickly and undamaged.  BTW - I tried another brand with Neem, TheraNeem Organix in the yellow and green box. The toothpaste is brown or tan, which stained my toothbrush a dirty-looking color. The sensitivity was gone, but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel or stay clean. When I switched back to Dessert Essence, my toothbrush... and teeth quickly became white again.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and leaves teeth very clean. However, it contains sodium coco sulfate which is basically diluted SLS.  Also, am u the only one who is concerned that there is no mention of ANY sweetener in the ingredients? I know it says free of artificial sweeteners, but what exactly ARE they using then?</li>
    <li> Makes mouth feel very clean. I wake up in the morning with a fresh mouth. Don&#x27;t even feel like I need to brush again, but of course I do.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Great clean and refreshing feel. A little goes a good way. I keep finding my mom creep into the bathroom to take some. Even these little girls I babysit like it. Will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> Our favorite natural toothpaste ever. The &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; does not sound good when you read it, but the taste is really nice and leaves breath fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I like the way this toothpaste leaves my mouth and teeth feeling fresh.  I am allergic to most toothpaste and this one does not cause a reaction.  However, it is a bit pricey and really doesn&#x27;t help protect your teeth, just cleans them.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothpaste. Does the job better than store brands. My teeth get cleaner with this paste and stay clean longer throughout the day. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Seems to keep my teeth cleaner longer than the standard toothpaste brands that contain fluoride.  My teeth feel smooth and clean all day, seems to be a great deterrent to tarter and other grime throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Good, clean free of fluoride free, parabens, sulfates etc (no garbage ingredients) toothpaste. Leaves your teeth, gums and tongue feeling fresh, clean and no aftertaste. Looking for trustworthy websites to look up products for safety? Here are two: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ and http://www.goodguide.com/</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste has pleasant taste and very health for gums as well . Glad I found this healthy alternative to ordinary and expensive toothpaste.  Thank you for your wonderful product .</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I buy now. It&#x27;s very healthy for gums as well as teeth.  I just wish the flavor had a little more mint taster.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  Not as foamy as normal toothpastes.  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Don&#x27;t give the fifth star because of the price.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Unlike other regular toothpastes, which give me the clean-but-not-clean feeling, this toothpaste really refreshes and brightens my mouth/teeth.  I suffer from receding gum line and was initially worried that this will cause sensitivity but having used it for about 2 weeks now, I actually think it is helping my gums instead.  I will certainly purchase this again.</li>
    <li> After buying a number of organic toothpastes, I find this one to be a keeper:    PROS  Cruelty-free product, certified by Leaping Bunny  The Wintergreen flavor is perfect.  No sting and no overpowering mint flavor, unlike those put out by Colgate, Crest or NatureGate.  Compared to other organic brands, the tube is actually a decent size.  No travel-size tube while you are shelling money for the price of a standard-size tube    CONS  Price is a bit out there</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay and does not taste bad. Leaves teeth feeling pretty clean. I can only give a better assessment after perhaps 2 more dental appointments.</li>
    <li> The flavor is different than your standard toothpaste, but pleasant.  Someone mentioned foaming - I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case, but then I think I&#x27;ve always used a small (pea-sized) amount of paste on my brush.  I really, really like how my mouth feels after I use this paste - fresh, clean, not so much as a speck of gritty feel - and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This product does foam and has a nice and strong mint flavor. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this stuff.  No chloride, natural, and leaves your mouth fresh.  Dessert Essence is awesome.</li>
    <li> We used this for a few months. Our household used Crest for years, but wanted to switch to something with less chemicals. I was making my own toothpaste, but my spouse wouldn&#x27;t use it because he wanted something with the texture and taste he was used to.  This is a clean, invigorating product. It has just enough roughness (probably baking soda) to feel like it could remove some plaque. Traditional toothpaste always feels too slick to feel like it could do anything with its texture and tiny bit of foam.This is gritty and produces a large amount of foam.  My spouse claims his teeth are whiter. I have noticed that his teeth bleed less. My teeth feel cleaner to my tongue after I brush.   I really don&#x27;t know if it is healthier, but I wanted something with aloe and tea tree oil and to eliminate sodium lauryl ether sulfate, the foaming agent in typical toothpaste. I also found the reports of microbeads in typical toothpaste to be freaky.  Update: We recently tried some other products (Earthpaste and Priobrite) when I noticed this had sodium coco sulfate and titanium dioxide in it (not a listed ingredient in the description, but was listed on the box).</li>
    <li> taste awesome teeth white fresh breath!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few organic, natural, without fluoride tooth paste before but this one is by far the best tasting and iny opinion the best in cleaning. Strongly recommend . Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive gums/teeth....this could be your answer.  My gums/teeth feel much better!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! This is my 2nd order, i ll continue to use it, i definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste. It has no plastic microparticles. Always arrives timely and intact, undamaged. No more tenderness from other toothpaste&amp;#34;s chemicals; get better results....happier hygienist and dentist.</li>
    <li> Neem was recomended by a doctor on the Dr Oz show. It has helped with my sensitivity issues. We will see inJan how effective it was on everything else when I go for my next tental cleaning. Taastes great.</li>
    <li> The taste is very very mild.</li>
    <li> This is taking some getting used to. Wintergreen is a mildly pleasant flavor, but I think I&#x27;m conditioned to thinking &#x27;minty taste&#x27; is the only thing that makes fresh beath, so I&#x27;m insecure using it for not-alone situations. But even occasional use will reduce my exposure to fluoride, and that&#x27;s a very good thing.</li>
    <li> No Fluoride and the taste is good.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product and great taste.</li>
    <li> Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste ..GREAT.............teeth feel awesome........tastes great too......after trying other Natural Brands I have finally found one that has the ingredients I want based on research, works and tastes good</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing but Love in this toothpaste. Thanks:)</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste - I use it every day.  The seller I purchased it from is very good.</li>
    <li> Great Product,  teeth feel clean an it tastes good too !</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but it does what it needs to do .</li>
    <li> I really did&#x27;nt like the flavor that much this time .It was alright</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Does wonders for your teeth and gums. This is my first tube and I plan on switching to this from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This has a nice, clean taste and smell. I was wondering if it might be too strong, but it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this toothpaste. Awesome product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this had the highest avg customer review for toothpaste on amazon. I feel like yes it cleans my mouth, but not quite well. And also tea tree is just as harmful if swallowed as fluoride...so I&#x27;m still torn on whether this is any better than what I was originally using. I like the minty taste, but I wake up with bad breath which is a new thing for me since using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> yes, love this toothpaste so much.I either order this from Amazons, Dessert Essence or their TTOil toothpaste with baking soda and mint. Both are good and have the same effect except the other one has a good minty taste....Teeth do not hurt even if i had cavity due to loosened filler for 3 months. makes my breath fresher too. ..highly recommend this toothpaste instead of those commercially advertised toothpaste with lots of chemicals that are highly toxic and bad for the body..</li>
    <li> excellent , must get several more next time !</li>
    <li> Great taste and I would buy this again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothpaste. I&#x27;m just finishing a large tube just like this of the Mint flavor. It has lasted a long time and is a good value. I thought to try the Wintergreen thinking it would be even more minty -- but I like the Mint better. It&#x27;s the more minty and fresh tasting/feeling of the two for me, which is the only reason I give the Wintergreen 4 stars. I give the Mint 5 stars -- at least. This is the best/freshest tasting and feeling toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I will always buy it as long as it&#x27;s available. I never cared much about which toothpaste I used before this. This one is definitely different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten all my friends and family on this stuff.  None of that bad chemical/sugary taste in your mouth!</li>
    <li> I only use toothpaste with tea tree oil. Always get a get report from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for past 1 year and I feel it is a very nice toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My neighbors recommended this to me after I revealed to them that I was suffering with tooth cavity pain. I had been using &#x27;Sensodyne&#x27; with some relief, but it still hurt and it didn&#x27;t help for very long. In my humble opinion, this stuff works great but tastes terrible. That&#x27;s why I only give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most fabulous toothpaste ever. We have tried lots of natural toothpaste and this is the absolute best paste. We ran out so we bought Doterra brand toothpaste at a local seller. Within a week, everybody in the family was complaining that their teeth had become super sensitive. I quickly ordered two tubes of this Desert Essence Tea Tree toothpaste and it arrived in a very quick time!  Within three days everybody&#x27;s teeth started feeling better. Everyone loves the fabulously clean feeling after brushing with this. The taste is great, it foams, and that little &#x27;gritty&#x27; feeling is not an issue. Just reminds you how naturally healthy it is.  We won&#x27;t be running out of this again.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly. Love the toothpaste. My teeth feel smooth and clean, my mouth feels fresh. My gum health has improved and it has no &amp;#34; junk&amp;#34; or harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;How does it get any better?</li>
    <li> I was afraid that a non-fluoride toothpaste wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as a fluoride toothpaste, but this worked just as well!</li>
    <li> Have only used this a few times since it arrived but so far am impressed. Leaves a very fresh taste in the mouth and feels very clean. I tell myself this is 2nd best to oil pulling which is so troublesome.</li>
    <li> Have used this toothpaste for some time and love it.  Great to find it at a lower cost.  Package arrived in a timely manner and in great shape. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like the reviews say</li>
    <li> Love this all natural, GF toothpaste!  I feel like it gets my teeth whiter, than the other crest brands!  My teeth feel smooth after too!  I will continue to buy this over and over!</li>
    <li> I love the toothpaste. Refreshing feel, good taste. I find my teeth have been less sensitive since i started using it.</li>
    <li> This is probably a simple matter of personal taste, but I found this toothpaste to have a rubbery (not latex) undertone that was a bit unpleasant.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of artificial sweeteners or potentially dangerous additives, but I didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was clean and fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> Great just wish they had for sensitive teeth</li>
</ol>
