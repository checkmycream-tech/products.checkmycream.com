### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a wonderful oil moisturizer and scalp conditioner.</li>
      <li>It changed my hair for the best!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cover your hair in olive oil and rub it in real good, concentrating on the hair closest to the scalp if you&#x27;re anything like me.</li>
      <li>Then I learned that this makes an excellent body softener.  </li>
      <li>Its especially great on heels and elbows.</li>
      <li>the wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got great lather and smells amazing, so</li>
      <li>It works great with sealing in the moisture making my hair feel nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When she tried it on, the effect was not as good as before.</li>
      <li>She loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Had to take a star away for not including instructions with the product.</li>
      <li>It also smells really good.</li>
      <li>This hair balm is surprising lightweight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been really good</li>
      <li>Smells really good and keeps my hair hydrated.</li>
      <li>I bought this yesterday at Wal Mart on clearance because it was obviously a good buy</li>
      <li>Basically it&#x27;s vaseline that smells really good.  </li>
      <li>product is like a pomade a really good one.</li>

      <li>Smooth, shinning, brilliant sheen.</li>
      <li>Very Okay.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful smell, it just isn&#x27;t right for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I believe that under the right circumstances this might do wonderful things - just not in my hair.</li>
      <li>my hair will probably be drier and more brittle when I&#x27;m done than it ever was before I started!</li>
      <li>It works great and makes your hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>So while I NEVER look at reviews on a product before I have a chance to form my own opinion and write my own review, I broke that rule here.</li>
      <li>Nice hair product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of oily.  </li>
      <li>If I hear anything from the company, I will update this review, to show what kind of customer support (or lack thereof)</li>
      <li>/&gt;the product had a nice consistency and the smell was</li>
      <li>The good stuff would cost a lot more than this.</li>
      <li>I hear anything from the company, I will update this review, to show what kind of customer support (or lack thereof)</li>
      <li>I have to honestly say that it gives a nice sheen to your hair but not make it to greasey.</li>
      <li>I liked the sheen that I got from using it</li>
      <li>It has a nice, but very strong fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Works incredibly well with hot straightening comb.</li>
      <li>Good value for such a great product!</li>
      <li>It is not heavy nor greasy, and it smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>must say that after reading some of the reviews for this product I had a great laugh.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how many of you are upset because a product did not cater to your hair type...but its understandable because you&#x27;re used to everything being for your hair type and skin color.</li>
      <li>Smells very light not over powering.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild but soothing and the ingredients have lots of good stuff like sunflower, almond, and coconut oils, as well as aloe.</li>
      <li>They were not dry and cracking, my nail beds and cuticles were awesome.</li>
      <li>Welcome to my world, the world of trial and error when it comes to products for my highly textured hair, its nice to be able to pick up a product designed for my hair type.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shea butter is great a conditioning skin, may be great for a dry and itchy scalp but is horrendous to wash out.  </li>
      <li>Just wanted to make sure</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African/Caribbean American, and this is the best scalp grease I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so I did the coke rinse once more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a scalp &amp; hair therapy, more the waxy consistency of shoe polish than a cream.  </li>
      <li>so I did what most treatments and masks say to do which is put it on after shampooing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still in there though.</li>
      <li>I was about to give up hope and reach for the dish soap when I came across a much better solution.</li>
      <li>So I like so many people who have reviewed this product before me</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m about to go take a shower and thought I would look it up to make sure I used it correctly (because they have to put directions on shampoo but not this mystery goop).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works wonderfully, for both the intended hair type and others, when used properly.</li>
      <li>But, um, that&#x27;s mostly because it was at an F&#x27;in Walmart in Kansas along side</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Upon trying it out she marveled at the wonderful texture of it and how easily it mixed in her hair.</li>
      <li>It has been 30 minutes and feels slightly better.</li>
      <li>I lathered my hair so many times.</li>
      <li>I wish the product description had been written better.</li>
      <li>And realized my hands, that are washed 100 times a day as a nurse, never felt better.</li>
      <li>review continues on as so many others do:</li>
      <li>Smelled much better, but still looked (and felt) like grease.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>So I use it more as an intensive hand therapy than as it was intended.</li>
      <li>The itching and dryness I have suffered for years is much better, and my need for prescription shampoos has ended.</li>
      <li>So I took to the internet to find more information, and learned that it is not a product designed for my type of hair.</li>
      <li>Then lathered, rinsed, and repeated MANY times with Dawn...and still my hair remains too waxy to do anything</li>
      <li>/&gt;Buyer beware of what you are getting yourself into when you see this innocent looking jar of \\&quot;hair therapy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>that is like this, i would love to buy this product more.</li>
      <li>someone could design a better way to get the product out</li>
      <li>Perhaps it was meant for women with more course hair?  </li>
      <li>After reading many reviews on this product I had to leave my 2 cents.</li>
      <li>So many stories of people who used it and ended up needing to wash repeatedly to get rid of the greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the product as advertised in a timely manner and was pleased with the overall experience.</li>
    <li> I really love this product; it works great for my relaxed hair. My scalp tends to get dry at times, and this product helps with keeping my hair moisturize and soft especially for the winter season. All you need is little to rub onto your scalp and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> No instructions number one problem number 2 does not say it is for afros! This does not even deserve a 1 star. Leaves your hair nasty and greasy for weeks. Have washed my hair at least 10 times a day and still feels and looks like someone dumped motor oil on my head. This crap should be taken off the market until they change the labeling. I will be taking this back to get my money back and will never purchase another item with the words CLEAR on it.</li>
    <li> I used it on my hair ONCE.  Bad idea.  Then I learned that this makes an excellent body softener.  Its especially great on heels and elbows. I use it immediately after turning off the shower, together with a body oil, and air dry as much as possible, rubbing it in every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I put a ton of this on my hair while I was in the shower.  I thought it was a conditioning masque.  It&#x27;s not! I think I figured out that even though it doesn&#x27;t say on the label anywhere or have real directions for that matter, that it&#x27;s for African American hair.  It takes a lot of washing, blow drying and straightening to get it out.  It&#x27;s still not all the way out but it&#x27;s getting there.  **Blow drying it in makes your hair super shiny and soft so that was a nice plus to the other wise crappy situation.</li>
    <li> This would be a great skin lotion say for stretch marks. It even has lanolin in it. But hair... not so much. Super greasy hair is the result if you apply it like normal conditioner. Someone suggested using Dawn and baby powder to get this out. Hmmm. Maybe instructions on the jar would clear up the confusion.</li>
    <li> The product had been used... the jar was not sealed and there were finger prints in the product.</li>
    <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy - I thought the name spelled out what I was looking for, but the only way this could help your scalp is to apply it directly to the scalp.  The consistency of the product is very much like shortening ... and requires as much shampoo to get it out of your hair as if you had used shortening.  It has a nice, but very strong fragrance.  If you are looking for dry scalp relief, keep looking (and please let me know if you find something!).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I just put a dime size in my palm and massage it through my hair and onto my scalp.  It works great with sealing in the moisture making my hair feel nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that after reading some of the reviews for this product I had a great laugh.  For those of you that don&#x27;t know products that say that they are for \\&quot;relaxed and natural hair\\&quot; imply that they are for ethnic hair... ie. Black hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m African/Caribbean American, and this is the best scalp grease I have ever used. Please read the description before you purchase. This product is NOT an everyday, light moisturizer. It is a damp hair moisture sealant, and a thick scalp protectant. Remember: A little goes a long way &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Fabulous for the roots and entire hair really. It changed my hair for the best! XOXOXOXO</li>
    <li> It was used.  It looked like someone stuck their fingers in it..</li>
    <li> This product is light and more like \\&quot;old school hair food\\&quot; just not as oily/greasy. This is not something I can use regularly during the year&#x27;s early Texas heat without being a sweaty and dare I say oily/greasy mess. As with the Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil a little goes a long way so does this product. This will be more of a cool weather product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/14/2012: I do not recommend using this on WET hair. A dab of this balm used sparingly on DRY hair after using the Shampoo and Conditioner will deliver good results. The product is oily, coats the hair and adds shine.</li>
    <li> I think the problem with this product is people don&#x27;t realize that this is a product to use to seal moisture into the hair.  It does say SEAL on the product but if you don&#x27;t know what that means, you will end up with a problem.  I took a small amount and used it on my damp hair to seal the moisture after shampooing and conditioning and using my leave in.  It can also be used on dry hair to add moisture or sheen.  Basically this is a what a lot of us african americans use as hair or scalp oil to be used to keep hair from being brittle.  Please don&#x27;t use as a conditioner or deep conditioner as it is not meant for that.  I found it did its job just fine when used in the manner intended.</li>
    <li> Next to the sugar-free gummi bears, the reviews for this item are the fuinniest. I also bought this expecting a leave-in type hair treatment conditioner. I also bought the Clear dry scalp/hair shampoo and absolutely loved it. It&#x27;s got great lather and smells amazing, so a few days later I bust out this leave-in treatment to have a go. Luckily I took one look and realized that I should not put a large glob of this stuff in my fine/thin white girl locks. So I went looking for instructions and, like everyone else, I found none. I was stumped, so I came here to see if anyone had reviewed or left instructions. At the time there were only a couple of dish-soap horror stories from fine-haired folks, so I packed this up and mailed it off to my niece, who is mixed and uses similar products. She loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Had to take a star away for not including instructions with the product.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is mild but soothing and the ingredients have lots of good stuff like sunflower, almond, and coconut oils, as well as aloe. It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy, so application to the scalp doesn&#x27;t affect the overall appearance of your hair. I&#x27;ve found it helps with dandruff, too.</li>
    <li> This hair balm is surprising lightweight.  I was expecting this to be a heavy, gooey, greasy experience, however I am pleasantly surprised and happy to report that this actually helps to tame my dry color treated hair.  I color quite often due to the battle of the gray.  I use this on the ends of my hair prior to drying and straightening my hair.  The result, silky smooth healthy looking hair.  Easy to apply, but use sparingly a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do; it moisturizes and protects hair, it has a pleasant scent, and the scalp feels better after it&#x27;s been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to warn you about is that this product does not seem made for my particular type of hair; instead, I think if you have much coarser hair than I do, this product would be much better for you than it was for me.  Mostly, I believed this helped me some, but I think it would help someone with very coarse hair far more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works, and it does what it says it will, which is why it deserves a four-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
    <li> i bought this thinking it was a after wash hair mask that needs to be washed off after used. thank god i researched online on how to use and read some other reviews about this. this is used in minute amounts like a leave-in hair oil. many users mistook this as a hair mask and used large amounts after hair washing, thinking that they could wash it off. but this product is made of mostly different types of nut oil etc, so it is impossible to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with this product is that they didnt offer any user directions, thus the confusion. But otherwise, as a leave-in hair oil, it&#x27;s great and it smells wonderful. just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Nourishes my scalp, and moisturizes my natural African-American hair.  Noticeably strengthens, and thickens my thinning hair.  Works incredibly well with hot straightening comb.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders for myself and my little princess...The BEST scalp product I&#x27;ve found even after spending $$$ on other expensive products. Clear Rocks! ijs</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;ll eventually figure out exactly how this product is intended to be used, but so far I&#x27;ve had no luck; there are no instructions regarding amount or application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried applying a nickel-sized amount to my scalp. This was a huge mistake as my hair was then greasy and gross. I had to wash my hair twice before it started to look and feel ok again. So next I tried putting a tiny amount on my hands and then smoothing it through the ends of my hair. This was a little better, but my hair still felt greasy. Since both of these attempts were on dry hair and the balm says it can be used on dry or wet, I decided to try it after washing my hair. Again, my hair ended up greasy.</li>
    <li> Other commenters have noted that people are using this the wrong way (and therefore disappointed with the results).  I agree.  Probably, like me, they assumed this product to be a creamy deep conditioner that you massage in, leave for a few minutes, and rinse out.  No, no, no!  It&#x27;s a scalp &amp; hair therapy, more the waxy consistency of shoe polish than a cream.  As others have noted, the lack of directions is a big mistake on Clear&#x27;s part, but when used correctly I think the product is fine.  Just be sure to read enough reviews to really understand what you are ordering before you buy.</li>
    <li> I bought it at the grocery store. There were no instructions on the container, but I expected it to be a &amp;#34;smooth on, rinse out&amp;#34; preparation. BIG mistake! You can&#x27;t rinse it out and after shampooing my hair 8 times, it still feels like grease. I&#x27;m going to try dish soap next. Maybe this goo works for certain hair types or for people who understand how to use it, but it certainly did not work for me. This is the first Clear product that I have tried; I will never buy or use another one.</li>
    <li> So I, like everyone else it seems, just grabbed this at walmart thinking it was a regular in-shower hair mask. The label even looks almost exactly like ones I&#x27;ve used before from them. Shame on me for not looking close enough I guess. I knew something was up the moment I opened it. It looks like Vaseline. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I&#x27;m about to go take a shower and thought I would look it up to make sure I used it correctly (because they have to put directions on shampoo but not this mystery goop). I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m a white girl but I have really thick curly hair. Have to say I&#x27;m scared to try it though after reading all the horror stories about how hard it is to get out! I think I&#x27;m just gonna use it as body moisturizer for heels and elbows like someone else recommended. Lesson learned, read labels extremely closely and if its not clear enough, find something else.</li>
    <li> This is by far one product that works its a good for natural hair for sure I love it. The negative reviews or way off the label is on the product if you can read.... on the back it says peel back to read directions. Would like to know why the consumer stop shipping to Walmart?  Happy to see it on amazon now I&#x27;m one happy customer. I&#x27;ve referred this product to friends and they love it if you have natural dry to extra dry hair this product is for you. Thanks Clear hope to see you soon back in Walmart:)</li>
    <li> Very Okay. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do (deep condition for your hair, by coating it with oily substance) but the smell is not my favorite and it feels icky trying to wash it off your hands, almost like a watery wax.</li>
    <li> Why, you may ask? Oh, let me count the ways...&lt;br /&gt;1) There are NO DIRECTIONS printed on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;2) Nowhere on the package does it say it&#x27;s for ethnic hair, nor was it in the ethnic hair care section.&lt;br /&gt;3) IT DOESN&#x27;T WASH OUT OF YOUR HAIR!!!!! Even after 10 washings!!&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do, which is nourish the scalp and hair, because after it&#x27;s used you spend DAYS trying to get it out, and put your scalp and hair through TORTURE along the way!&lt;br /&gt;5) The stress caused by this product far exceeds the few moments of excitement felt for being &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; enough to get it on clearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to let you in on the secret to getting it out: olive oil and dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;I kid you not.&lt;br /&gt;Cover your hair in olive oil and rub it in real good, concentrating on the hair closest to the scalp if you&#x27;re anything like me. Once it&#x27;s rubbed in, follow with the dish soap. You might need to add a little water, but you want to work up a lather. Rinse, then wash again with only the dish soap - you might have to do this multiple times, but for me it only took once. I followed that with a conditioner on the ends to make my hair more manageable, but the choice is yours.&lt;br /&gt;You can also search the internet for how to get petroleum jelly out of your hair, as the main ingredient in this product is just that - petroleum.</li>
    <li> The Clear Scalp Hair and Beauty Therapy is great product once you understand how to use it.  Essentially the product is similar to hair oil or grease/ cholesterol that was used in the \\&quot;olden days.\\&quot;  Most of the ingredients are different forms of oil such as almond and coconut oil in addition to petrolatum (vasoline) and mineral oil (think baby oil).  This may sound bad because our society now automatically associates oil as being unhealthy, but this is very nourishing for our hair, scalp, and skin. I have curly-wavy hair and when I applied this to my wet hair it worked well to seal in moisture and keep my hair looking shiny.  The product is essentially oil so you want to be careful about where you put your head (you don&#x27;t want head marks on your furniture).  Overall the product works wonders on dry and frizzy hair and it saves me from having to have a \\&quot;scalp treatment\\&quot; at a salon due to dry scalp.  The only downside to this product is that there are no real instructions on how to apply or properly use the product so this may turn off some consumers.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my daughter who is biracial Caucasian and African American. Her hair is extremely dry and frizzy. I am laughing at all the bad remarks from Caucasian women on here and Walmarts sites as this Is NOT for you. Yes it doesn&#x27;t have intense instructions on not to be used on thin slightly dry hair but the front of the jar says for relaxed and natural hair! Not to sound unsympathetic to those who cannot use this product but people read it says it right there on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;This product is like a pomade a really good one. I apply to my daughter hair sparingly after washing and the moisture lasts for 2 days without any other products, that is a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this but not for straight thin slightly dry hair or scalps!</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday at Wal Mart on clearance because it was obviously a good buy and I have been trying out new hair treatments and things. I go to use it today and discover there are no instructions so I did what most treatments and masks say to do which is put it on after shampooing. So I get a big scoop out and start working it in my hair. Nope bad idea my hair is now a tangled mess and a grease ball. Disgusting. I will be drenching my hair in Dawn now. Thank goodness my college campus is closed tomorrow and I don&#x27;t have classes on Tuesdays. Know the intended use for this before you purchase it. At least I only paid $2.50 for it because it is going in the trash now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand how to use this effectively.</li>
    <li> I purchased this stuff for my winter dry, LONG blond hair and scalp. When I opened the jar, I realized I paid in upwards of 6 bucks for petroleum jelly. But I had a few days off so decided to try it. Knowing I couldn&#x27;t very well glob it on to my hair, I wanted to see how much was recommended.  Directions? WE HAVE NO STINKING DIRECTIONS!!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t (at that time), understand what relaxed and natural hair was and thought, well my hair is relaxed, not curly, and it is natural, not processed or dyed. So a dime size amt., rubbed all over my hands and smoothed on to my towel dried hair.... and my hair looked like it never dried. Multiple washings later, it was fine. I tried again (I paid for the stuff, might as well try to get some benefits out of it).&lt;br /&gt;Pea size this time, rubbed over my hands and LIGHTLY over my hair, and WONDERFUL results. Smooth, shinning, brilliant sheen. And realized my hands, that are washed 100 times a day as a nurse, never felt better. They were not dry and cracking, my nail beds and cuticles were awesome. So I use it more as an intensive hand therapy than as it was intended. OH WAIT, I DONT KNOW HOW IT WAS INTENDED, THEY WERE NO DIRECTIONS!&lt;br /&gt;The most positive thing about this stuff... the wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;Now if someone could just put directions for multiple ethnic groups on the damn container, everyone could use and not have to use Dawn to dry out their hair even more (as I read in the reviews). Or is this L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s way of getting people to purchase more of their products, by making customers use Dawn to strip their hair and need another product to put the moisture back in???? Hmmm...</li>
    <li> Because of the limited information given, I was unaware that this product is not best suited for Caucasian women with finer hair. I was under the impression that it was an intensive scalp moisturizer similar to a deep conditioner--nope!  Thankfully, it was easy to make a return.</li>
    <li> I too was confused by the label and directions. The Clear Shea line in the gold bottles is intended for ethnic hair. Silver bottle line is for Caucasian type hair.  I too didnt know they had different product lines and thought this was a conditioner treatment but the #1 ingredient is petroleum jelly.  I have very curly dry hair but putting petroleum jelly on is not going to do anything forcme but make my hair look like I put petroleum jelly on it. I know this product has its purpose but it&#x27;s not made for my hair type. I really can&#x27;t see how this can nourish any human beings scalp. It&#x27;s not the fancy ingredients it says it is. It&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the only real fault of this product is lack of clear instructions on HOW TO USE IT.  I&#x27;m familiar with this type of hair care product, so I knew the one simple truth that helps make it wonderful: Use just enough to coat your hair in one layer.  Don&#x27;t slather it on like it&#x27;s a regular shampoo or conditioner.  This is a leave-in moisturizing conditioner than is meant to keep your hair slightly moist, thus preventing damage while healing previous damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job very well, but just make sure you aren&#x27;t using too much.  If you end up overusing, you&#x27;ll know it.  Your hair will be lanky, heavy, and uncomfortable, thus defeating the purpose of it.</li>
    <li> This has a great smell, and the texture is nice, but I had to wash my hair so much to clear it out, that I am not sure if I didn&#x27;t end up drying my scalp and hair more than it helped overall!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t provide any extra moisture benefits that I could see or any extra nourishment.  The nourishment I think I would have to use for a longer period of time to see the benefit if any. It contains Nutrium 10 but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out exactly what that is. Dove mentions Nutrium in some of their body washes but doesn&#x27;t mention exactly what nutrium means.&lt;br /&gt; The product has a nice light fragrance, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any heavy or \\&quot;chemically\\&quot; smells in your hair. I liked the sheen that I got from using it but I can&#x27;t say that it is a sheen that I can&#x27;t get from using my other hair products.  The moisture wasn&#x27;t any longer lasting than any other product that I use.This product can be used on natural or relaxed hair and does contain shea butter. The first ingrediet is Petrolatum, second is mineral oil, followed by paraffin then lanolin wax.  I try to avoid these ingredients but I did want to try the product out. There are some good oils ( sunflower seed oil, weet almond and coconut oil, etc) listed as well. The jar comes in a 6.7 oz size so you get a lot of product.  Overall a light moisutre balm that provides good sheen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works wonderfully, for both the intended hair type and others, when used properly. Only thing, if you don&#x27;t know how to use it before you purchase it you&#x27;re in for a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I have colored, past my shoulder length hair that is frequently damaged from a straightener. I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for products to improve its texture. I stumbled across Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm on a morning shopping trip (after I had worked 14 hours) and that should&#x27;ve been my first warning. Several hours before a date, I decided to try this product. I searched for directions, even pealing back the label in hopes it would be underneath. There were none to be found. Not to be thwarted I continued on, caking the Vaseline type goop all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;My review continues on as so many others do: I freaked out, unable to get the waxy mess from my hair. Then lathered, rinsed, and repeated MANY times with Dawn...and still my hair remains too waxy to do anything with.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I canceled the date.&lt;br /&gt;This product has so much going for it...except for the most basic marketing step...DIRECTIONS.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with the ingredients of this item. All of the cheap ingredients are listed first. Things like Petrolatum, Mineral Oil and Paraffin. Then comes fragrance. Then come the cool sounding ingredients like Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Wheat Germ Oil and Aloe. In other words there&#x27;s less Shea Butter which is part of name of the item than there is fragrance and it only takes a minute amount of chemical fragrance to scent up an item like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it when companies put infinitesimal amounts of positive sounding ingredients in a product just so they can add them to the ingredient list. Basically this is a gel of petroleum and wax products with scent. It feels very oily on the scalp. The scent is unpleasant. I really have nothing positive to say about it.</li>
    <li> no matter how I tried to massage this into my dry scalp it ended up all over my hair&lt;br /&gt;okay this could be user error but it took some time to wash out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good feel and consistency however just did not work on my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the consistency of a thick Valvoline --nice scent and my hand felt good after trying to apply it but not for thin hair</li>
    <li> The product was not to greasy Just right for today&#x27;s hair styles. Smells very light not over powering.</li>
    <li> I was open to new products since my hair was feeling straw-like way too soon after a wash &amp; blow at the salon.  I soon realized that it was the products that were not helping me.  This particular product did help a bit but not as much as what I ultimately settled on.  This scalp nourishing product gave me some much-needed softness without any sticky greasiness.  I only used it a day or two before a salon visit because I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance that it would force a too-soon visit.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and I am getting long-term results in that it seems to be helping me get longer life from post-shampoo softness.</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair with keratin treatment. This product left my hair greasy for days. It took 3 showers before my hair went back to normal. Looking at other reviews, I now know that this means I used too much. Unfortunately, there are no directions and I&#x27;m hesitant to try it again.</li>
    <li> As you might of already surmised by reading the multiple reviews on this product is that it is more of a hair pomade/wax rather than the scalp moisturizer that the packaging would lead you to believe.  I bought this because I was looking for a scalp moisturizer for my son who has eczema and a very red, irritated and dry scalp.  I found it in the regular shampoo section at my local drug store and thought I would give it a shot.  After shampooing and conditioning his hair as usual, I grabbed this stuff, tried to follow the directions and noticed there were none.  I took a small amount of the product and rubbed it into his scalp the best I could.  I immediately felt a sense dread and knew that I had ruined his really pretty longish, thin and very blonde hair.  I tried and tried to wash out the pomade and wasn&#x27;t able to make any headway, even after shampooing his poor head 10 times that evening.  For days my kid looked greasier than the entire cast of the walking dead combined, even though I shampooed his hair multiple times every evening.  I wanted to cut his hair since it looked so bad but he wouldn&#x27;t let me.  Needless to say, I felt really stupid and was really upset about the complete lack of directions on the packaging and how they completely mislead you to think that the product is to treat a dry scalp when that is completely not the case.  Does this work in the manner it should be used?  Probably.  Put some actual directions on the packaging and market it correctly and I would give this product a better review than what I think is a generous 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I figured out instead of using a moisturizing product for my son&#x27;s eczema I have just started putting cetaphil lotion on his scalp about 1 hour before showering him which helps keep his scalp less irritated and itchy and does not have the whole \\&quot;greasy head\\&quot; side effect!  :)</li>
    <li> while there were no real instructions with the product, assumed it was for dry scalp treatment. \\&quot;balm\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried on dry winter scalp before sleeping. tried an extra shampoo in the morning to remove it, but hair still felt a little greasy. However, my scalp felt fantastic after just one use. greasiness was gone after a few days of normal shampooing. The increased moisture in scalp lasted much longer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use sparingly and as close to your scalp as possible.</li>
    <li> Ok. So I bring it home (from Wal-Mart) and look for the directions on the jar.. What Directions!?&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is dry especially on the ends and in my excitement of actually finding something to help my problem, I immediately hop into the shower and start gobbing this stuff all over into my hair/scalp. Oh NO! That was a BIG MISTAKE!! I had the greasiest head of hair (and I have very long hair).. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, washing it out with your average shampoo won&#x27;t cut it. I contiued to wash multiple times for two days until this morning in a moment of desperation (lightbulb turned on) I run into my kitchen and snatched the Dawn dishwashing liquid which did help immensely after two good latherings. It&#x27;s not all out but I&#x27;m on my way..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware of what you are getting yourself into when you see this innocent looking jar of \\&quot;hair therapy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on this product I had to leave my 2 cents. Reading comprehension is key people, the labeling is just fine but it clearly says on the product \\&quot;for relaxed and natural hair\\&quot; which means it is aimed for people who textured, curly or hair that has been chemically altered to be straight...ie the hair that many black and some latina women have. It&#x27;s amazing how many of you are upset because a product did not cater to your hair type...but its understandable because you&#x27;re used to everything being for your hair type and skin color. Don&#x27;t worry though, you&#x27;ve got entire aisle&#x27;s at drugstores for your hair, I&#x27;m quite sure you&#x27;ll be able to find something else to suit you. Welcome to my world, the world of trial and error when it comes to products for my highly textured hair, its nice to be able to pick up a product designed for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the product actually isn&#x27;t that bad, its much better than the shampoo and conditioner which did not give me enough moisture and left a film on my hair. It left my hair extremely moisturized and not greasy, I didn&#x27;t even need to apply my coconut oil to my ends for a few days because my hair was just fine. It also smells really good. I will agree with other reviewers that it needs better instructions but as someone who is used to to using these kinds of products, I made it work just fine.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely awful!! Not only are there NO instructions on the jar but it even looks and feels just like Vaseline or baby butt ointment....I should have gone with my gutt instinct and not even tried it but being that is said it was a hair balm I thought it would be something to massage through my hair like a hair masque...so I did and it  was a sticky mess like I had put stick glue in my hair or something. I left it on for awhile thinking it would wash out fine but that was soooooo not the case. I have washed my hair with 2 different shampoos, dish soap, and even used bar soap thinking it might degrease it but after 7 washes I am still sitting here currently with residue in my hair...I don&#x27;t even know what to do...I have seen a few suggestions but I&#x27;m scared my hair will fall out or at the very least need cut after this...mind you I have very long hair that has taken me many years to grow!! I&#x27;m furious and will never recommend this product to anyone...its trash!!!!!</li>
    <li> Review of \\&quot;Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Balm.\\&quot;  This product left my wife&#x27;s hair feeling greasy and hard to work with.  It was intended to provide nourishment and conditioning for thick straight hair.  Instead it left her hair with an unappealing residue which was hard to remove.  Perhaps it was meant for women with more course hair?  The instructions on the product were not clear.  Just FYI.</li>
    <li> Got this looking for an intensive conditioner to treat my dry scalp.  When I opened it, it was apparent that it was a pomade or wax rather than a conditioner.  It also had no instructions on the package.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance and applied it to my dry scalp,and a little rubbed first on my palms to my thick dry and curly hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it helped my scalp or not, but it was not a good styling or conditioning product for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t disperse and was very greasy and hard to wash out.  I have gotten similar results in the past by applying a thick moisturizing cream to my scalp, which is obviously not ideal. Currently in the trash can.  Got the curl enhancing smoothie instead, it is lovely.[[ASIN:B0038TVH3Y Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie - 12 oz.]]</li>
    <li> This is by far the WORST hair product, let alone beauty product that I have EVER used. This is a subpar product and should be pulled from the shelves. I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, I bought it from a grocery store, but I wanted to do a review here because I feel so strongly about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a scalp treatment because I live in a dry area and my scalp gets very dry and big flakes come off of my scalp. I use Head &amp; Shoulders as a shampoo and it is effective, but I still notice dry scalp sometimes, so I wanted to get a good scalp treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are NO instructions or product usage on this tub. It just states the benefits of using the product and the ingredients. Common sense told me to apply to scalp, massage it in as best you can, then rinse it off after awhile. After shampooing I applied this balm to my scalp. It is very thick, like pliable pomade or thick Vaseline. It was so thick that it was very hard to spread it around my scalp. Then I used a hair masque for the rest of my hair and put a shower cap on over my head with all my hair inside. I kept the shower cap on my head for awhile while I did other bath things (washed body, shaved,) then I took off the cap and rinsed off my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correction: I TRIED to rinse this God-awful product out of my hair. I could still feel it in my hair, it felt very stiff and gooey. I rinsed my hair for as long as my poor neck would allow (I was taking a bath.) I could tell it wasn&#x27;t all the way rinsed off, but I thought, how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY, VERY BAD. I allowed my hair to dry naturally, and the rest of my hair (where I applied the hair masque) was dry and normal, but the scalp and top part of my head where I put this balm was a horrid, stiff, greasy mop. It was so greasy that if I ran my fingers and hands over the area, my fingers and hand was greasy and shiny. It also seriously irritated my eyes during the rinse off process, made them red and I was unable to wear my contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night I tried shampooing my hair again to get this stuff out, to no avail. I shampooed my hair three times with Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (which, as I said before, always works well for me,) scrubbing my scalp vigorously to rid myself of this product. What I ended up with was a burned and irritated scalp and hardly any more of the ghastly product out of my hair. It was still a stiff greasy mop. Again, my eyes were irritated during the rinse off process, it made my left eye red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I had to wear a hat when out in public to cover up my poor scalp and hair. Later that day I shampooed again to try to get the balm out. This time I shampooed three times with a Suave Volumizing shampoo, but this time just washing my scalp and hair as best I could so as not to irritate my poor scalp again. Still no results, this horrid product was still in my hair. I had to use a hat again to go out in public. As I write this review, this balm is STILL on my scalp and in my hair. I may have to go to a salon and see if they have some tricks up their sleeves to get this vile product out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent a message on Twitter to the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair company telling (in what little space Twitter allows,) what my experience with this balm was, and I received a message back asking me to call them at an 800 number so they could learn more about my experience, and that I should seek medical treatment should I need it. I called the number today, it was an umbrella phone number for the parent company, Unilever, and they were closed, so I&#x27;ll try calling them tomorrow and see what they say. I plan on returning the product to the grocery store I bought it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is guilty of negligence in their part on not putting instructions and user guidelines anywhere on this vile product, and I think that this product should be taken off of the shelves. If I could give it zero stars, I would. After six times of shampooing my hair with two different shampoos, and this horrible product is still in my hair, and I had to wear a hat to cover up my head when I went out, the burning and irritation it caused my poor scalp, and the irritation it caused in my eyes, I feel I must warn consumers NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, or at the very least, buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hear anything from the company, I will update this review, to show what kind of customer support (or lack thereof) they provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 9/1/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This disgusting product finally came out of my hair - 3 days later, 14 washes using 2 different shampoos and Ajax dish soap. For three days my hair was absolutely disgusting, and I had to wear a hat anytime I went out of the house. I have never used such a terrible product before. I called the 800 number to the parent company and left a voice mail because all of the agents were helping other customers. I never got a call back. So not only is this product subpar, the customer service is too. I cannot say enough bad things about this product and the lack of customer service I received. Unacceptable.uct is still in my hair, and I had to wear a hat to cover up my head when I went out, the burning and irritation it caused my poor scalp, and the irritation it caused in my eyes, I feel I must warn consumers NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, or at the very least, buyer beware.

    <li> There are no instructions on this product. Do not apply this product prior to washing your hair! The balm needs to stay in your hair for a good few day&#x27;s, or you won&#x27;t be able to wash it out at all!  If you follow my instruction&#x27;s it works wonders on your hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> As African American (Jamaican) it just seems like there&#x27;s no product out there for my texture hair. Anyway after using Pantene for the past 5 years or so I saw the commercial on TV the other day for this product and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been really good so far- better than Pantene. My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage. I bought the entire set.</li>
    <li> It cleared me dried flaky scalp problem</li>
    <li> There is nothing special or unique about this product. I noticed people are upset that the bottle didn&#x27;t have instructions. I was upset at that as well but, to not publish the ingredients, that is just beyond irresponsible.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SUCKS. IT MAKES YOUR GAIR ALL GREASY AND IT TOOK 3 WASHINGS BEFORE IT CAME OUT.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK. HOW DO I GET IT BACK////</li>
    <li> In case of any confusion, this is marketed towards ethnic hair as far as a mask.  That being said,  I just have very dry hair, and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s good as a moisturizer for my ends.  It also adds a lot of shine!  Basically it&#x27;s vaseline that smells really good.  It makes my hair look a bit greasy at first, but does soak in after a while.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am very pleased with this scalp treatment. This is great dor my braids and will also work on dreads . I have to honestly say that it gives a nice sheen to your hair but not make it to greasey. If you are using this for breads, you only need a little to go very far. I will use this after shampooing my hair as well. It will give it a great sheen. Just a quarters worth in your hand goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using this product at first because I was afraid it would clog my scalp. I was not familiar with the ingredients but I gave it a try anyway. I did like it somewhat. I prefer something less oily and more absorbing, but the product did a pretty good job of keeping my scalp from itching.</li>
    <li> i did enjoy this product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;usually i get too greasy or too watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product had a nice consistency and the smell was very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yet like with all products like this, it&#x27;s difficult to get out of the bottle. My fingers get messed up and once you get to the middle it gets even more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone could design a better way to get the product out that is like this, i would love to buy this product more.</li>
    <li> Too many people are not using common sense when applying this product. Directions or not, when you remove the lid, and it looks like an oil based product, WHY would you gob it on your head? It takes very little....I use about a dime size on my pixie cut hair, and if used properly when hair is damp, works beautifully. I have a very dry scalp due to eczema, and this is the only product I have found that works not only to add moisture to my scalp, but smells great, and has eliminated my need for other styling product. I have very course straight hair, and I am Caucasian. The itching and dryness I have suffered for years is much better, and my need for prescription shampoos has ended. The people complaining, did not understand the labeling or use for this product. It smells great, and if used properly, should last a very long time. Good value for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients.  It&#x27;s Vaseline and  mineral oil primarily.  Might as well be motor oil.  If I could give this no-stars I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought I was buying a Loreal product.  What?  Am I a moron? No.  The packaging is nearly identical to Loreal&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;Evercreme&#x27;&#x27; line and this \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; product was on the same shelf, next to Loreal.  This is a \\&quot;Unilever\\&quot; product.  Shame on them for many reasons, outlined in all the negative reviews below.</li>
    <li> I really like the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy. I find myself using it on my scalp after I wash and condition my hair. It has a pleasant scent. You definitely don&#x27;t want to use too much because it will weigh down your hair. This product has reduced my split ends and my scalp normally stays moisturized for days. It is also not super greasy which I like. The key is to use it in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This product is geared towards more ethic or African American hair which I have. :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a product for African American type of hair when I chose this as a product to order through Amazon Vine.  I wish I had.  I simply cannot write an accurate review.  I thought that this was a scalp treatment for any type of hair.  I wish the product description had been written better.</li>
    <li> I requested this item from Amazon vine with the hopes that I could give it to my sister because she suffers from intense dryness in her hair. Upon trying it out she marveled at the wonderful texture of it and how easily it mixed in her hair. To be quite honest I was expecting a larger vial but I was happy to see that she was pleased with what I had picked out for her. Perhaps in the future they could offer an economy size of this since my sister has extremely long hair almost down to her waist and more product is needed for a full month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once. It seems to do as it says but I can&#x27;t tell considering this summer heat and sweating so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 thumb up</li>
    <li> Not ready to like this product.  It is too greasy that it feels very uncomfortable on your head that it is hard not to be bothered by it. Smells fine but what the use if it feels nasty to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Uu&lt;br /&gt;Even difficult to remove.  It feels like it is still there even after repeated washings.</li>
    <li> Warning!!! That&#x27;s exactly what it should say on the jar....along with instructions on how to use it. This product is NOT for Caucasian hair....unfortunately I&#x27;m learning the hard way:-( I got this product as a hair masque that would help my dry scalp....WRONG....what it did do is leave me with the most heavy greasy hair, since it cannot be washed out. I have very long hair, and I have never used this much shampoo in my life. The Dawn dish washing detergent help some after 2-3 latherings. This is the biggest mistake I have ever had with hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and learn from our mistake</li>
    <li> So I like so many people who have reviewed this product before me thought that this was like a deep conditioning treatment. Therefore I slathered it on my hair without a second thought after shampooing. I have used products in the past that weren&#x27;t too far off to this consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Then I spent the afternoon freaking out about the fact that I could not wash this product out of my hair. It was the greasiest I have ever seen my hair and I was really concerned. It pretty much would have been the same result as if I had covered my hair in Vaseline. I washed it three times with noticeable improvement. I read that many people suggesting using Dawn dish soap to remove the product, but I knew that was extremely damaging to my hair. The whole reason I bought this product is because my hair is already damaged from all the chemical processes I have put it through.&lt;br /&gt;So I was about to give up hope and reach for the dish soap when I came across a much better solution. A friend of mine had had a child who had accidentally gotten covered in Vaseline a while back so I called to ask how she removed the Vaseline from her kids hair. She imparted her wisdom on me of her week worth of trial and errors. The thing that finally removed the Vaseline was Coke. Yep that&#x27;s right Coca Cola.&lt;br /&gt;I had a half of a large bottle still sitting around my house so I got back in the shower and proceeded to pour coke right over my head. I then shampooed and noticed a marked improvement. I thought it was still a little areas that still felt producted up so I did the coke rinse once more. I then conditioned my end of my hair and got out. what a relief that my hair felt back to the state it had been in before this whole ordeal. So if you like me accidentally used this product go get yourself a bottle of Coke to help rinse the gunk out!</li>
    <li> This actually worked on my scalp which shocked me. Nothing does. I love this stuff. But I have to use it the night before and wash in the morning otherwise my hair gets extra greasy looking. My issue was up front near my hairline so that is why. If the problem was in another area, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have that issue. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife buys all kinds of hair products. This shampoo , that conditioner. This gel , that mousse.&lt;br /&gt;When she said she wanted to try another one , I gotta admit I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. Her hair looks fine.&lt;br /&gt;After using this long lasting balm , she was happy with the results. She felt her hair was nourished and repaired.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta admit - she and her hair look great !</li>
    <li> I tried this, not realizing it was for ethnic, or African American hair. Couldn&#x27;t get it out of my hair for a week. Just wanted to make sure no one else makes the mistake I did. I did, however, give it to my neighbor. She said it was great.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how exactly to apply this product since there are no directions, but being that it is for the scalp, I rub it into my scalp over my whole head.  The next morning I had to use Dawn dishwashing liquid to attempt to get it out.  Now my hair is even dryer and still greasy.  It went straight to the trash this morning.</li>
    <li> This product is made for African-American hair. Unilever (the makers) should just stop tip-toeing around this in their marketing. The model shown in the photo is an African-American woman of light complexion. On their website is African-American hair stylist, Oscar James, who does Tyra Banks&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick kind of pomade, with the pale yellow look, feel, and consistency of petroleum jelly because that&#x27;s what it is! The first ingredient listed on the label is petrolatum. Next is mineral oil and paraffin. While prominently marketed as being made with expensive and luxurious sounding ingredients like shea butter and argan oil, it&#x27;s really just a big tub of petroleum jelly with trace amounts of the good stuff in it, with no mention of petrolatum in the advertising. Because of this, the formulation is heavy and it leaves residue on the fingers. My co-worker tried some of this product, but prefers to make her own scalp and hair products from mixing natural oils herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this product are not particularly high-end, but if you are looking for cost-control, it certainly fits the bill. The good stuff would cost a lot more than this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It smells good and works without being too heavy.  I used it as a scalp treatment between shampoos and I also put it on my hair before drying my hair.  It gives the hair shine and my scalp is moisturized without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Firs to fall, i thought it was going to be a small tub.  I was surprised to see a large tub, which kind of concerned me about the quality.  The cream doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and it&#x27;s kind of oily.  I did not see much improvement after using this product for a week. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Nice hair product. Smells really good and keeps my hair hydrated.</li>
    <li> This would have been a great product, had there been some instructions on who should use it! It&#x27;s not meant for Caucasian hair but for coarser hair types. I&#x27;m sure it works wonderfully for that.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice fragrance, however, I found the consistency very heavy. Better for natural hair styles, not for relaxed or very fine hair. I am not convinced that petroleum in hair products is even necessary.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift to one of my dear residents at a nursing home. She has been talking about this product and how it is difficult to find in stores. When she tried it on, the effect was not as good as before. Maybe they changed the product or new management?</li>
    <li> I need the moister and this is not available in stores. Its a dream but don&#x27;t over do it, this product comes out in a similar texture as vaseline. I only use on ends before styling when hair wet or after flat ironing for a natural healthy look. This or the Clear&#x27; Shea Oil will do the job correctly but both are only found online and last about 2 months when rationed. This product is great to wear hair curly after a shower if you have unruly puffy naturally curly hair like me.</li>
    <li> i luv this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works really well with my extremely dry kinky coarse dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t have any problem using the product. it was in the hair section..so i used it in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also didn&#x27;t have any problem shampooing this product out of hair. i just used a chealating /clarifying shampoo, conditioned, used a leave in conditioner and applied this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitley buy it again</li>
    <li> This product has really worked to end my dry scalp and flaking.  When used like a pomade it holds up throughout the day.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I had gotten this product from my mom who is a huge coupon lady, and had this in her stockpile. I thought I would give this a try because my hair is breaking really bad, and is often times very dry and brittle. So I figured this product would do the trick. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st sign was no instructions on the bottle. So I figured I would just wing it. Let this gunk sir in my hair for a few minutes and lather, rinsed and conditioned like normal. Dried my hair, and the gunk was still in my hair! After trying to go online to figure how to remove this, I came across this review and face palmed ! Like me, other reviewers said it was so hard to get out. Supposedly it is made to be marketed to African American woman? I have no clue. All I do know is that this was petrollium based and mission impossible to get out. I lathered my hair so many times. I even used vinegar and dawn dish soap SEVERAL times. This wasn&#x27;t giving at all. Well I scrubbed my scalp. Caked and massaged regular conditioner through my hair, let sit for a bit, then scrubbed my hair as I rinsed. It has been 30 minutes and feels slightly better. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still in there though. I&#x27;m sure, had this bottle had instructions, that it would be perfect for me. It has a wonderful smell, it just isn&#x27;t right for my hair type. If this product is being marketed to African American woman, and heck, even men, then I am wayyyyy off base. Hope this helps other people before they decide to put this in their hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this stuff to put in my hair before I went swimming.  I put too much in my hair and my hair was so greasy.  That&#x27;s my fault.  The people who are leaving bad reviews because of that...that&#x27;s not the products fault...it&#x27;s yours.  It&#x27;s not made to be gobbed all over your head.  Lightly rub your fingers on the product and put on your hair.  It works great and makes your hair so silky and smooth.  As for the swimming--I just bought a cap.  The greasy hair was the worst experience but I laugh about it now.  I believe this product would be more for African Americans but it can be for a Caucasian if you use it correctly.  If you have the problem with the greasy hair I suggest putting baby powder in your hair.  Worked for me.  Plus dawn dish soap.  You&#x27;ll be fine.  Can&#x27;t get upset over grease, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down about this product...no directions.  This should be fixed because all products should have directions!!</li>
    <li> I had to throw this away. Was not good for my hair. It contains Petrolatum and Mineral Oil and I’m just realizing my hair doesn’t like these ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is truly as awful as everyone says.  Wish I would have read these reviews before going to Walmart.  Now I&#x27;ve got a week full of twice daily washing to try and get this slime out of my hair and my hair will probably be drier and more brittle when I&#x27;m done than it ever was before I started!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is great a conditioning skin, may be great for a dry and itchy scalp but is horrendous to wash out.  My hair gpt drier with me trying to rinse the balm out.  The second time I use less of it and was careful about the amount of product used and had nice, soft hair after, buy there is still this caked on greasy feel to my hair.  This may be Clear Scalp&#x27;s answer to WEN, and like WEN it&#x27;s not something I personally like.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil moisturizer and scalp conditioner. It is not heavy nor greasy, and it smells wonderful. I use this mainly for treating my scalp, and I follow it up with a liquid oil moisturizer for the ends. I agree with the other reviewer who pointed out that this product is not meant to be washed out right away. This is supposed to be for hair that requires leave-in moisturizers for dryness (commonly, but not always African Americans). The product description could have mentioned this to make a lot of people&#x27;s lives easier. And I do agree that if you got this through the Vine program then you would have had no clue exactly what it was intended for. If you are trying to use this as a quick moisture treatment, then you will be very disappointed as it is not. But if you are using this as a daily leave-in treatment for dryness at the scalp, then this is a great product. It is great for relaxed or natural hair.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dryish hair, whether I am coloring it or whether it is the gray that seems to be growing exponentially. So I was excited to try this. Unfortunately, when I opened it, I was looking at something that resembled Vaseline. Smelled much better, but still looked (and felt) like grease. So I took to the internet to find more information, and learned that it is not a product designed for my type of hair. In fact, the product line is apparently designed for the unique problems to do with black hair. Hm. Not *quite* what I was looking for. So while I NEVER look at reviews on a product before I have a chance to form my own opinion and write my own review, I broke that rule here. Honestly, I was afraid to try it and wanted to see the comments rather than the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the comments only reinforced my fear of trying the product on my hair. So many stories of people who used it and ended up needing to wash repeatedly to get rid of the greasy feeling. I believe that under the right circumstances this might do wonderful things - just not in my hair. I did, however, learn from another review that it works WONDERS on dry skin! I have been using it on my heels under my socks and they are in terrific shape. The smell is wonderful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, what this comes down to is a probably terrific product that is getting killed by less-than-terrific marketing. The genius behind this one just might not be cut out for the job. I have used other Clear products and quite like them, so I have no reason to believe this would have been anything different - had it been appropriate for my hair. Fix the marketing, and you *may* fix the problem.</li>
    <li> Yeah- I&#x27;m the idiot who bought this thinking it was a hair mask for white girls. But, um, that&#x27;s mostly because it was at an F&#x27;in Walmart in Kansas along side every other available rinse out hair mask. I feel stupid enough, but I also look like a greaseball to boot. Seriously, who doesn&#x27;t print instructions? I mean, ultimately I&#x27;m to blame for using it anyway- but this stuff is terrible.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted.</li>
</ol>
