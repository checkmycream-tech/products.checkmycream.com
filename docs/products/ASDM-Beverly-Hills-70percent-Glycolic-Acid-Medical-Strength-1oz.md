<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This one I used on body, not face. For the body, it really didn&#x27;t do anything. Meaning, my skin did not peel with this on. I applied it as usual with peels. This is my first time with this one. For a high concentration of acid, it really let me down, big time. When I make a purchase as with this, I am expecting to peel, as least at some point. Well, that some point never happened. So sad. I really love to peel. I won&#x27;t be buying this again for me. This is my review. I am still giving it a 3 star. Just because everyone&#x27;s skin is different and knowledge and history of peels too. This did nothing for me, but it also did nothing bad either, no bad effects.</li>
    <li> Like this product better than previous brand I bought.</li>
    <li> Great results. Burns for a little while</li>
    <li> I followed directions and have been using it for 4 weeks now. I see not even a hint of results. Did not make me flake or nothing. I&#x27;m getting ready to use the tca peel instead.</li>
    <li> I like how it helps with my melasma I do a peel twice a month. When I order this product I thought it was a 50% it turn out to be 70%. I added water to water it down and I leave it on for about 4 minutes. After I do the peeling I use shea butter mixed with vitamin E. I don&#x27;t have peeling or dryness but I do see that my skin looks better after a couple of days. Not every one peels some do and some don&#x27;t. I will continue to buy this product. Happy and Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I liked the other brand I got last time better, I feel like it was more effective and it had a slow drip top which really helped.</li>
    <li> Acid peels were costing me a fortune!  I purchased this product in both 50% and 70% strengths.  I recommend starting out with the 50%.  Then, if you want something stronger, also get some 70%.  I use the 50% all over my face and the 70% on dark spots on my face and hands.  Skin much brighter and &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots are nearly gone. My hands look lots younger, too, without the brown spots.  Read and follow ALL directions because it can and does burn.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for peeling !!!</li>
    <li> THIS  PRODUCT  IS  A  SHAM.  I  ORDERED  THIS  ASDM  BEVERLY  HILLS  70%  GLYCOLIC  ACID  PEEL  AND  I  JUST  OPEN  IT  TONIGHT  ,  AND  CAREFULLY  MIXED  THE  HIGHPOWERED  SOLUTION  AS  I  WAS  TOLD  FOR  IAM  MOST  CAREFUL  ABOUT  IT  ANYWAY,  HOWEVER  WHEN  I  MIXED  THE  WHOLE  1 OZ  BOTTLE  AND  PUT IN  THE  LITTLE  4 OUNCES  OF  WATER  ,  FOR  I  WAS  TOLD  THAT  ITS  WAY  TO  STRONG  TO  APPLY  IT  TO  YOUR  NAKED  SKIN  RIGHT  ?  WELL,  WRONG  READERS,  THIS  PRODUCT  SAT  ON  MY  SKIN  LIKE  SOME  COLD  WATER  AND  I  LOOKED  AND  WAS  ABSOLUTELY  SHOCKED,  I  FELT  NOTHING,  NO  TINGLING,  NO  BURNING  NO  WARMETH,  NO  NOTHING,  FOR  YOU  KNOW  FOLKS  A  70 %  GLYCOLIC  SOLUTION  HAS  POWER  AND  WILL  BURN  YOU  AND  THIS  WAS  LIKE  COLD  WATER.  THERE  MUST  BE  A  LIE  SOME  WHERE  AND  ITS  NOT  ME.  SOMEBODY  NEEDS  A  LAW  SUIT.  I  PURCHASED  MY  HARD  EARNED  MONEY  IN  GOOD  FAITH  AND  GOT  DOOPED.  THIS  WAS  NOT  A  REAL  CHEMICAL  PEEL  SOLUTION,  BUYERS  BEWARE.  I  LOST  14.OO  DOLLARS  BUT  IT  COULD  HAVE  BEEN  WORSE.   IAM    STILL   SHOCKED   FROM   THIS   BAD    LYING   EXPERIENCE   FROM   THIS  ASDM   BEVERLY   HILLS 70%   GLYCOLIC   ACID  PEEL,     IT   DIDNT   WORK   AT  ALL  NOR   COULD  YOU  FEEL  IT  EVEN  TINGLING ,   BETTER   YET   BURN,       I   GOT  TO  SAY,  THE    BOTTLE  HAS   GOT  TO  BE   WATER.</li>
    <li> It clears my blackheads.</li>
    <li> I wanted the glycolic acid to peel off the dark spots that I have but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.it does peel but not the way I need it too.</li>
    <li> GREAT . USE TO EXFOLIATE AND DEEP PEEL. FOR USE TO IMPROVE LINES, SCARS AND WRINKLES. USE SUNSCREEN.</li>
    <li> it seems like a great product but it just stings too much, I didn&#x27;t use it so I cant tell if it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using for my back after scars from having shingles over 5 yrs ago.  I&#x27;ve used 40% for 4 months one application every 10 days.  I&#x27;m starting this regimen the same.  4 treatment s per bottle for back</li>
    <li> This stuff works! My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I applied some to a Qtip and dabbed it on my sun spots on my face chest legs and hands. All are gone!!!! It was a little scary because the healing took about 4 weeks and my bigger raised spots really burned deep but it took them away. I also used on my heels that are always cracked and dry and they are smooth and nice now! I put a few drops in my daily lotion a few times a week for a light exfoliation for my whole body! Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!  I will always have this in my bathroom! !!!</li>
    <li> I have used glycolic acid 70% for a while and was satisfied.  I decided to try this brand and I am glad that I did.  There is less burning (always some) and it leaves my skin smooth, soft, and very clean feeling.  I have thick, somewhat course skin, but I feel like the glycolic acid is leaving my skin with a finer texture and more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> Amazing is all l can say lm addicted to this,lm telling you please do this ASDM,..</li>
    <li> This product works very well for heavy age spots and wrinkles. Always follow up by applying a good neutralizer.</li>
    <li> I have had great results so far with this peel. I&#x27;m 24 and wanted to start on keeping my face healthy and young looking, I don&#x27;t have bad acne or severe wrinkles. But this stuff is great, I will be honest, It gets worse before it gets better. I used it two days in a row followed by an extremely moisturizing lotion overnight... My face got dry/slightly scabby on my forehead but I could only feel it and only see it, nobody else noticed... It only lasted about a day or two. Now that my skin has healed, I noticed it is so much softer, brighter and fresh looking! My boyfriend has even been complimenting me. I have to give it to this stuff. I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate as much this stuff does it all and lasts a lot longer. I last used it a week ago and my face still feels like I just exfoliated. I feel like my face a has a pretty glow to it, more even skin tone super soft. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Works! Use as directed because very strong.</li>
    <li> Works great....good price</li>
    <li> Wonderful, a great skin care product!!!</li>
    <li> This acid gave my skin such a beautiful glow, I used it on my elbows and knees and also added a small amount to my body butter, my skin never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> My face is glowing!!! I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going to professionals for peels until a friend of mine told me about this product. Ummm I bought it and used it right away. IT ABSOLUTELY BURNED!!! I didn&#x27;t leave it for too long. I used baking soda to neutralize the acid and my face was red and raw for awhile. It even started peeling right away. It hurt, but I put neosporin on the areas that were peeling and within days I healed. After a week my skin peeled ALOT. after the peeling my skin is absolutely glowing!!</li>
    <li> Was great! Removed the dark freckles and spots on my skin! Took 2 bottles!</li>
    <li> Boy this stuff is strong. I bought it to use on the top of my hands for all the age spots that are popping up. Also have 2 tiny spots on my face to get rid of. I found using a q-tip makes it easier to apply. Does burn but hope it does the job. Will update in a month or so to give results. Hope it works.</li>
    <li> Is this really 75%&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product back on November after reading all the reviews and have tried it 3x.  The first time I diluted the product by half ( a tsp of product and tsp of distilled water), left on for 3 minutes and nothing happened - never peeled.  The second time, I diluted to around 50%, left on for about 5 minutes, began to tingle, cleaned off - no peel.  A few days later my skin was a healthy pink but no peeling which is why i purchased the product.  The last time (a week ago) I applied the product directly on a cotton pad and rubbed it on my face.  I have bratty melasma on both sides of my face, and serious lines on my forehead (its been a while since I have had botox) - so I scrubbed these areas and put more pressure around my &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; eye area to help with the fine lines.  I left the product, full 70%, began to tingle about 5 minutes but left on for 7 minutes.  NO PEELING this time, not even that healthy glow like before.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch but it is NOT 70%.  One of my good friends she lives in WA and I asked her about 70% before applying this product and she suggested starting at 30% so that is exactly what I did.  I would not recommend this product if you are wanting a high performing peel.</li>
    <li> Not my first bottle, I love this product for my oily skin &amp; skin that blemishes easily.  However, I would not start out with a 70% if your not a seasoned Glycolic Acid user, start with a lower acid &amp; work your way up (if you need to).  Great packaging &amp; shipping here!</li>
    <li> Great peel after one use ! ;) you must follow instructions with this peel or you will burn your skin ,im not new to peels I&#x27;ve worked my way up on the strength level for skin. I believe you should start with a lower percentage if your a beginner please because you can damage your skin really bad and do your homework first on the peels because different peel for different reasons. I myself have had amazing results an also bad I&#x27;ve burnt my skin and i&#x27;m very fair so you could see every thing on my skin only because i didn&#x27;t do my homework on peel and i wanted results very quickly than i didn&#x27;t follow the instructions i left some on to long or i exfoliated an did my peel the next day or the same day an do not pluck any hair on the face and the do a peel it will plump up red bumps that take days or months to heal and maybe scar hyperpigmention. So yes I&#x27;ve done at home peels for almost a year now well worth it my skin glows now and no makeup wow . I do wear aveeno sunscreen my love really great an i use kojic acid soap and olay microdermabraison thumbs up .looking amazing try this peel it&#x27;s worth it truly</li>
    <li> I am fearful to use it.  It is 80 PERCENT.  In searches most are 20 percent.  Please advise.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I dilute this  because it&#x27;s strong but I use it once biweekly and my skin looks red at first, then once its calm, theres a glow to my face. Love it</li>
    <li> This is professional grade! Do not use this in its original bottle. Make sure you water it down or you WILL scar your face.. I loved it and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> it is strong but good! :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results.  Great value and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I use this to peel my acne scars and brown spots it&#x27;s work better than TCA peel that might increase hyperpickmentation later ... After peel i also use hydroquinone 2% and 100 spf sunscreen lotion and I am happy with result on my face .</li>
    <li> This peel is great at giving your skin an overall glow and unclogging pores.  Very few blackheads remained after a couple of uses.  I also noticed the more I used it the longer I could leave it on..up to 4 min.  I would not advice this for someone with sensitive skin or inexperienced with peels.  I noticed only mild peeling but moderate redness for a couple of days after.  Great product and great value!</li>
    <li> This product does the job. I normally dilute it down to 20% for a treatment every two weeks. I would not recommend any higher concentration for a first time user.&lt;br /&gt;It has drastically improved my skins appearance and almost completely erased my sebaceous filaments on my nose. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Good quality and does the job.</li>
    <li> I like glycolic acid. I have used 70% for years now. I&#x27;m glad I tried this brand. It seems as good as my other brand that was 3 times the price. Love it</li>
    <li> I use this weekly and it works well vs. paying a esthetician for the service.  Be VERY careful of &#x27;burn&#x27; if you leave on too long -- I use 40% on my face, but bought this for my hands.</li>
    <li> Ok i thought about by buying this product for rough skin that i caused from waxing and a buffer sand pad so its looks like Singhs of keratosis pilars on my legs. Its black rough spots i caused  but i was not born with it so im  wondering will this help me get my skin to normal i just really need some help please or second opinion</li>
    <li> Great company. My order shipped in no time. With great packaging. However this peel just didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t purchase it for my face so maybe that is why. But it did absolutely nothin for my legs.</li>
    <li> I used to buy 50% glycolic acid but found 70% is much better.I use it  to cure seborrhea keratosis on my hands.</li>
    <li> I advise not to use this product at all, i had a few acne scars i wanted to clear up but what i got instead was a very huge burn on my face, now its worst than  it was ever before I&#x27;m not sure if this will fade overtime but at this moment it has left my skin with a huge burn mark across my face. sadly there is noting i can do but warn others that its just not worth it try lightning cream or just face wash do not use peels. most people won&#x27;t listen but i hope this at least stops one other person from ruining there face. I&#x27;m trying everything to heal the mark but no success yet.</li>
    <li> Really like this product! I&#x27;ve tried other glycolic acid brands, but this one works the best. Very strong, though, so I do need to be careful how I use it.</li>
    <li> Ok. I read a lot of review and this is what I did. I tried it with mixing it with lotion. Felt a little sting not much happened and no peel. Then next time I put a lot less lotion and that stung but no peel. Now mind you this is supposed to be really strong so I was really careful. Then I just said forget it and did the bare with no lotion. What it did was sting and burned and left spots of scabs. Not deep ones but it was not even at all and was like little burn scabs. I am lucky it did not scar like this. So I guess full strength does burn but not even and did not seem to deplete any wrinkles or dark spots at all. I believe it will regenerate collagen as used with lotion just as a firming mask may do but that may be all it does. Did not have any affect like the rest of the reviewers had said. I only have fine forehead wrinkles and this does not seem to help. Again it feels like it tightens the skin a little but only mixed with lotion. I believe any other strength is way too weak and a waste of money because if this being the strongest percent only does this then those will do nothing. Maybe it&#x27;s just this brand.</li>
    <li> love it, will be buying again, it keeps my face clear of blackheads and makes my face looks fresh at all times, i don&#x27;t wear make up so this helps my face looking it&#x27;s best at all times.&lt;br /&gt;i usually do it once every two weeks, but now because of how great it makes my face look, i only use it once a month.&lt;br /&gt;i am almost out, so will be buying again soon.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a girl must have.</li>
    <li> this is awesome product..i would love to order it again and again..it is good to my skin,,it might not to the other but I love it..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will burn yourself. Take it slow turbo.</li>
    <li> Be very careful when applying this product please do a skin test first!!!  I am so very glad I ordered this product instead of going to the dermatologist paying an arm and  a leg for the same results. My skin is so soft after it peeled and I notice it has gently lighten s few dark marks I had from sun exposure and acne.  I will use this product again and recommend it to others SKIN TEST FIRST!!!</li>
    <li> This item worked as stated. It is very strong as the dermatologist office only uses 30% Glycolic acid so I advise to just be careful! Keep it applied for 5-10 minutes, but if it burns jump in the shower fast or splash cold water on ur face</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when ordering this, but using this only 3 times I have seen a tremendous difference in my skin.  I had 2 black heads on my face that looked terrible.  I did not want to pick them because it causes more damage.  I&#x27;m happy to say they are gone. I also had a bit of scaring on my chin and the side of my face.  They are starting to fade also.  I have also noticed my complexion is brighter and so much softer.  I will say the little bit of wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing are still the same, but I don&#x27;t think anything like this works for that.  I would definitely recommend ordering this peel.  I would also recommend being very careful when using it, it&#x27;s quite strong!!!</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to use this product when it arrived. I usually use skin lab products but wanted something stronger..  Out of the blue in June this year my face started breaking out horribly in the chin and cheek area. I&#x27;ve been using different peels for over a year now however not as frequently, maybe once a month. Well after the breakouts i started to resume  the glyco/lac 60, BHA, with no results. I then went to my primary doctor who  prescribed doxycycline but I felt horrible when taking it.. She then switched me to aldactone but too low of a dose from what I have read.. After reading reviews i decided to try the Glycolic acid first before the TCA.&lt;br /&gt;So I did the mild cleanse followed by the alcohol to clean the residual dirt, allowed to dry. I then applied the Glycolic acid with brush all over my face concentrating on the areas of hyperpigmentation and acne. Immediately started feeling burning sensation however it was tolerable.. Waited approximately 1.5 min after application before rinsing off with cold water profusely .. I never have used baking soda mixture  to neutralize.  After rinsing there is still some burning and frosting.. Applied bio oil all over face. Definitely some redness to my cheek area. I can tell there will be peeling in those spots.. I will update the review in days to come.. This was used at full strength.. I do believe I have a high tolerance to peels.. I will attempt again next week.. I do this in conjunction with salicylic acid peel</li>
    <li> Received and used today. I did dilute it, I dunked a cotton ball in the acid and then in water. I left it on for about 2 minutes and there was mild stinging so I did rinse with a baking soda and water mixture after I rinsed the acid, water solution off. I think, just after one use, it made my skin look smoother. I also used it on my elbows, it did not sting at all on the elbows and they now look so much better. I highly recommend and can see this is going to be one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin you might want to go with 10%. Its a bit powerful, and it will sting...</li>
    <li> This product was So pointless , I suggest not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Fails claims of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t have purchased it , if I knew better.</li>
    <li> this burned my face off</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than going to dermatologist.  Thank you for making this product available.</li>
    <li> It works well but you have to be oh so careful.  Water is down and have baking soda ready to stop the burning.</li>
    <li> Yes it met my expectations. ..great product. .....</li>
    <li> I diluted to 30% as close as I could with my Jr High school algebra, and who said we would never need it. Lol, it was amazing, I had herd that it takes 4 or more sessions, not true! 1 application and wrinkles I never thought would disappear washed away with my old skin. Seriously I just went out tonight and people asked me what was I eating or working out, I looked 5 to ten years younger! I&#x27;m impressed with this!!!!</li>
    <li> Just tried it tonight. It didn&#x27;t burn to bad and can&#x27;t wait to see the final results. Fingers crossed: )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed by the results, of course it burned at first but in about a week I healed and my skin looks amazing, all the large pores are gone, skin looks and feels smoother!!</li>
    <li> I spent $360 for 6 visits to a dermatologist for glycolic peels. This product is much stronger than what I was getting at the dermatologist (though I was told I was getting 70% and 100% mix). This product gives better and longer lasting results. Use it with caution - 70% is a strong acid. Even after 6 treatments at the dermatologist I used this 70% for only 15 seconds for the first time. Then gradually over the weeks I increased time up to 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also use acid neutralizer after this product and then apply generous amount of moisturizer and sun screen. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good.  I usually use the 70&lt;br /&gt;% glycolic acid from beauty solutions and it usually stings more.  With that being said, I noticed that my skin was clearer from this purchase with Asdm Beverly Hills.&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and have marks from bites and hives on my back, legs and arms.  I do a glycolic peel twice per week for one month leaving solution on for ten minutes.  I apply Neosporin to cuts and cover them, and then I use Ambi hydroquinone with sunscreen.  After one month of treatment I take one month off of the glycolic peel and just use the hydroquinone.  I have been doing this for four months.  My marks have been cleared about 40% of the way.  It takes dedication and persistence but I do think that my skin will be pretty much clear again within one year.</li>
    <li> Amazing product &amp; received promptly with tracking information! I&#x27;ve been doing mild 30% glycolic peels at home on and off for a few years it always stung and gave me a beautiful glow to my skin but I wanted more of a peel being 29 years old and acquiring fine lines around my eyes. Nothing seemed to work to remove them. I&#x27;ve used this peel just once last week so far left it on for just five minutes rinsed with baking soda and water then cold water and was red as a tomato. Over the next few days I wore massive amounts of sunscreen and only washed with baby soap. On the fourth day my scabs washed off and my skin has never ever looked this good. I am addicted! I&#x27;m going to use this once a week! I will always order from this seller!</li>
    <li> I underestimated this peel the first time I used it &amp; got mild burns after I applied it on my face a minute too long; This stuff is the real deal xx</li>
    <li> would prefer not to rate it even one star......wastage of money</li>
    <li> Works great for scars .</li>
    <li> This product is mighty and does its trick, yet if one is a whiner..get over it</li>
    <li> It works wonders on my skin... ;)</li>
    <li> Works great. It is very potent so it should be diluted and not used at full strength.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom and she loves it!  It&#x27;s great for peeling hands, knees and elbows.  I dont think it should be used on the face it is pretty strong.  It also comes with a little jar of post peel cream that is 30% that helps you peel and makes the skin look really nice.  I recommend this product and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark skin African American so I knew there was a possibility this wouldn&#x27;t work but I expected to see even the smallest result... Never even felt a slight burn</li>
    <li> I love this product ! I recommend it for lips</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 star cuz I didn&#x27;t see any major difference but did see a little change. I guess I have to order another bottle to see a major improvement.</li>
    <li> This product really works - you just need to follow directions.  I bought it to help with dark spots &amp; after a few applications, they are starting&lt;br /&gt;to fade away.  I predict after a few more times they will be gone...a lot cheaper than paying a professional to remove them which adds up&lt;br /&gt;to a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. I e-mailed the seller to get some tips, and was completely ignored.</li>
    <li> The product came in a small container covered In thin  plastic the top wasn&#x27;t sealed.. I used and followed direction, and  it burnt my face. Maybe I should have purchased a lesser strength.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It did not seem like 70% glycolic acid. I used as directed and it seemed very weak. I didn&#x27;t even get a tingle. Maybe mine came from a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Quick shipper and it works as promised. Leave on just a few minutes as it does cause excessive peeling.</li>
    <li> I used this product within a DIY lotion with kojic acid powder and had lovely lightening results. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> Please please don&#x27;t purchase this. Wasn&#x27;t on my face a minute when it started to burn realy bad. I washed it off but my face was burned and swelling. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have any permanent damage,  however, this should be taken off the market. Could not imagine if I had left this on longer.  All the phone  number on the cards that come with this product is disconnected.  Guess we know why!</li>
    <li> Jury is out on this i only used it once, no results so far.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician so I know all about peels. I am concerned that the instructions on this says to use once a week. It takes your skin 28 days to regenerate; if you&#x27;re using it once a week, you&#x27;re not giving it a chance at all. This being said, I do like it. It will make you break out if you have any underlying blemishes, but they heal quickly. All in all it&#x27;s a good product but I use it in combination with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quick and easy way to get rid of blemishes and or blackheads, have someone use hard wax on your face. It will remove all blackheads and clear up any blemishes you may have. I do this once every two weeks or so and I&#x27;ve had clear skin for a while now. I do get the occasional breakout, but a strong solution of salicylic acid (not over the counter) will clear me up in a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am used to much stronger peels, this is not very strong for me, but still a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I look better now.  Works good tome.  I look younger  Helps to improve skin.  I cent be without that thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to try it.but it kind of hard to use in summer..Thanks to you soo much..and I will bye in another time inshallah</li>
    <li> Very strong, use with caution and read directions. Love the product.</li>
    <li> If you have used glycolic acid in the past from a doctor this is the closest I have seen to it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good stuff. Just make sure you have something to take off the dead skin and make sure&lt;br /&gt;you wipe it off thoroughly. I skiped a spot around my nose and it burned. As long as you use&lt;br /&gt;properly great stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the hopes of improving the appearance of mild-to-moderate acne scars, both indented and pigmented-only. To use the product, I diluted to half strength with water, applied with a synthetic brush, and left on for 3 minutes before neutralizing with a baking soda solution and rinsing off. The first time, there was no noticeable peeling, but my existing blemishes dried up into scabs. Days later, my skin looked much fresher and clearer than it had looked in some time. The acne scars, while still present (they probably always will be there to some extent) simply looked BETTER, somehow. On the second use, I have noticed more obvious drying and flaking of the skin in certain areas. Perhaps I over-moisturized the first time. This also improves the depth of the not-so-fine lines on my forehead, at least temporarily. I anticipate good results on repeat use.</li>
    <li> Be very careful!  I was used to peels several years ago and when I used this one on my forehead I looked like I had been beat up!  I purchased a PH  balancer and that helped a bit.</li>
    <li> Works well, left it on about three minutes....be careful it is strong, follow up with coconut oil every night for at least a week!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. As an esthetician, I am trained to use this product. It produces wonderful deep peels. I don&#x27;t use anything higher than 30% on my face, but 70% is great when mixed with moisturizer and worn all day or overnight.  It reduces potency by 40-50%, but is more effective than leaving on for the standard 10-15 torturous minutes of insane, intense itching. This has all but cured my keratosis pilarsis (there is no cure) on my upper arms and thighs. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really good..however very strong..I leave it on about 8 minutes...I am African American. I do not peel. But it leaves skin glowing. It helps my frown lines..overall good...about the same results as the 50 percent. I do dilute the product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use on some dark spots on my abdomen as well as my face. So far I have noted a glow in my complexion and smaller pores. Some improvements also seen  at the abdomen but I&#x27;ll have to complete the 1 once bottle to see how much the discoloration will fade.  Overall, good product</li>
    <li> Fixed my terrible super deep ingrowns completely but I have to keep up the treatments to maintain results. Diluted this with water at first, but used full strength the third time and it was great. Haven&#x27;t tried other brands but this worked and is cheap so I will definitely rebuy</li>
    <li> This product worked on age spots on my face. I used it at 70%. I put it on a small patch of skin. It stings very much and I only left it on for 5 minutes then washed it off with soap and water. The next day a dark scab formed then it came off in about three days and the age spot was mostly gone. This is a very strong acid so be VERY CAREFUL if using around your eyes! Wash hands after use!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for removing a pimple that had turned into scar tissue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Glycolic Acid once a week for over a month.  My skin has improved and looks refreshed.  Yes, there is skin burning,  but I can handle it OK.  If you gave sensitive skin use caution.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I received this glycolic acid very fast. I have to give it time before I see results, but judging from past experience with glycolic acid at 70%, it should do well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great peel and lord knows people need facial peels. They look like they have a mask on and their face is crying out for help.</li>
