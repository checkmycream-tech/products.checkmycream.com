      <li>Downside, I have some chicken from happy hour stuck in my teeth...</li>

      <li>gave 1 star to complete review</li>
      <li>This was puchased for my 4 year old</li>

<li> Unlike other products I have used, Bite No More goes on clear and looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
<li> (I&#x27;m seventeen, and have bit them for as long as I can remember) and found that it doesn&#x27;t stop me from biting at all.</li>
<li> This stuff tastes so bad that it makes it so very easy to not want to bite the nails</li>
<li> bite them, there is a hint of a weird taste, but a true nail biter will ignore it.</li>
<li> Slight taste reminds you that it is there but not strong enough or bitter enough.</li>
<li> After talking to a few people I got similar stories this product is a joke</li>
<li> For us, this had been a complete failure of a product.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s an extreme scenario....</li>
<li> Against what other people said, I used it a few times a day anyway.    </li>
<li> /&gt;Originanally I gave a bad review that this product does not have bitterness required to deter biting even when applied thickly and recommended spending more for something that works.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a firm believer of not subjecting my son to anything I wont try myself, so we did a test together... applied as directed to all of his nails, and one of mine.</li>
<li> After it dried I tried to taste it and couldn&#x27;t taste \\&quot;bitter\\&quot;, or any taste at all.</li>
<li> I wasted my money...</li>
<li> No More.</li>
<li> When you&#x27;re like me, biting nails since a small child, you don&#x27;t think that you could ever stop.</li>
<li> I think the problem with people not finding that it works is that if you can actually tolerate the horrible nastiness of this stuff long enough to either chip it off with your teeth (my situation...) or canNOT tolerate it</li>
<li> Otherwise they are slowly getting longer as time goes on.</li>
<li> upside, this nail polish tasted bad enough that I&#x27;d rather just leave it in there.</li>
<li> I feel like the taste gets WORSE after every time I apply it.</li>
<li> Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t bother purchasing this,I was looking for help with my nail-biting habit, bought this item, used it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad</li>
<li> There IS a very nasty taste that stays in your mouth and makes me regret putting my finger anywhere near my mouth.    </li>
<li> the product does not have the bad taste it says it does.</li>
<li> But it works if the user is actually serious about wanting to use the nasty taste to stop the nasty habit.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a nasty, nasty taste.</li>
<li> I think it tastes HORRIBLE</li>
<li> but when you bite your nails, it takes a couple of seconds for the horrible taste to kick in</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It took me only a weeks time to stop nail biting...my nails have started growing stronger.this product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Inmediate result for stop the nail biting!!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of arrangements with my son.  This is effective and I had tried it for one week!!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I found this product from a friend, who let me try it first. Downside, I have some chicken from happy hour stuck in my teeth...upside, this nail polish tasted bad enough that I&#x27;d rather just leave it in there.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;MMMM, tastes good!\\&quot; That&#x27;s exactly what my 7 year old daughter said the first time I put this on her fingers, and had her stick one in her mouth. For us, this had been a complete failure of a product. Maybe I will just have to use Tobasco sauce.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product because as a waitress, nobody likes to see you gnaw on your nails, then serve them their food. It was cheap so I gave it a try. I read some reviews after I first purchased it to see what I was in for. Against what other people said, I used it a few times a day anyway.    The reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t have a taste at all must have not followed the directions properly. It specifies to use it after washing you hands and before bed. It dries relatively fast, so I did this. I feel like the taste gets WORSE after every time I apply it. There IS a very nasty taste that stays in your mouth and makes me regret putting my finger anywhere near my mouth.    If you follow the directions, and apply it after you wash your hands, or even just throughout the day when you get a chance, it has the right effect. I haven&#x27;t stopped biting my nails yet, its only been about a week, but this product sure makes me want to stop as soon as possible. :)</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I had hoped, but received the product quickly and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it worked really well for me. Unlike other products I have used, Bite No More goes on clear and looks like clear nail polish.  Others have turned my nails yellow.</li>
    <li> Its really good! but when you bite your nails, it takes a couple of seconds for the horrible taste to kick in</li>
    <li> Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t bother purchasing this,I was looking for help with my nail-biting habit, bought this item, used it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad and it&#x27;s just like clear nail polish, the smell and everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this today after finally getting fed up with biting my nails (I&#x27;m seventeen, and have bit them for as long as I can remember) and found that it doesn&#x27;t stop me from biting at all. It&#x27;s too mild. In fact, I enjoy the taste, and find myself even more drawn to biting them. I&#x27;m very disappointed, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Helps you NOT bite your nails.  Nails look better from NOt biting .... taste crappy but is suppose to make you not want to bite your nails.  Helps you break the habit.</li>
    <li> This was puchased for my 4 year old it did not work at all. In fact she liked the taste making a whole new problem. After talking to a few people I got similar stories this product is a joke now I am one off the many people with nothing good to say.there should be a 0 star spot in ? #1  &lt;br /&gt;only gave 1 star to complete review</li>
    <li> We loved this.  My siste-in-law used it with her son and he stopped sucking his thumb in 2 nights.  My daughter stop the first night.  It worked miricles.  We have tried Thumb guards, Thum nail polish, band-aids, bribes, you name it.  This was the key.  My daughter is 7 and we have shared this with several of her friends.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re like me, biting nails since a small child, you don&#x27;t think that you could ever stop. This stuff tastes so bad that it makes it so very easy to not want to bite the nails and it is worth it to buy. It is only a matter of remembering to put it on after you wash your hands or take a shower. It will only work if you always use it. My nails get so much longer when I use Bite No More. Right now nails are not so long only for the fact that I keep forgetting to put it on again. Otherwise they are slowly getting longer as time goes on. It also works for picking noses. One of my friends did it to her kid and well he doesn&#x27;t pick his nose anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 25. I first bought this product when I was maybe 17. I used it, and it worked wonderfully. I&#x27;ve stopped using it several times b/c the taste is so intolerable, but each time I go back to it I manage to keep it on my nails for about a month before I give up and remove it. I cannot STAND the taste of this stuff. When I actually bother to keep it on my nails they do not make it inside my mouth. You can&#x27;t get the taste off of your lips. It&#x27;s a nasty, nasty taste. In any event, this stuff works. It really does. I think the problem with people not finding that it works is that if you can actually tolerate the horrible nastiness of this stuff long enough to either chip it off with your teeth (my situation...) or canNOT tolerate it so you remove it with nail polish remover or something (something else I&#x27;ve resorted to) you find that you can go back to your nail-biting ways. That&#x27;s an extreme scenario.... But it works if the user is actually serious about wanting to use the nasty taste to stop the nasty habit. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> the product does not have the bad taste it says it does. once applied all it is, is a shiny clear coat on your nails. bite them, there is a hint of a weird taste, but a true nail biter will ignore it. buy something stronger</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails for over 30 years and NOTHING has helped excite this stuff! Since buying it 2 weeks ago I have not bit my nails once! It peels off and needs to be reapplied a lot but to me it is well worth it. I think it tastes HORRIBLE but my husband said it didm;t taste like anything to him so I think this obey works for certain people. For the price it is worth a try for sure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  My daughter didn&#x27;t seem to mind the taste at all.</li>
    <li> Maybe wasn&#x27;t invented for dogs as it didn&#x27;t work on my bichon.  She still chewed the soft paws off</li>
    <li> Good Idea, but only helps a little unless you really want to quit anyway</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer of not subjecting my son to anything I wont try myself, so we did a test together... applied as directed to all of his nails, and one of mine. After it dried I tried to taste it and couldn&#x27;t taste \\&quot;bitter\\&quot;, or any taste at all. And, my son was chewing within 20 min like no difference. I wasted my money... awesome</li>
    <li> This product was essentially nail polish. Didn&#x27;t help at all... Ended up buying a different product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product became more bitter after the seal was broken for a couple weeks and it is very potent so now I changed the rating to super.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originanally I gave a bad review that this product does not have bitterness required to deter biting even when applied thickly and recommended spending more for something that works. I even wrote that this product would not even work on a baby.</li>
    <li> Not very strong and wears off very quickly . Have to reapply evety time you wash your hands. Slight taste reminds you that it is there but not strong enough or bitter enough.</li>
    <li> The taste is very light it will not stop any one from bitting their nails.  The coating peels off very easy.  Save your money because this product does not work.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!! It&#x27;s just a normal nail polish with no taste.</li>
    <li> 14 yr old daughter who has always bitten her nails had full nails grown in 3 weeks - the constant reminder was all she needed by the taste when she put her fingers near her mouth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s day 2 and my little one is still nibbling on the nails and toes but spitting more. Unsure about this stuff thus far.</li>
