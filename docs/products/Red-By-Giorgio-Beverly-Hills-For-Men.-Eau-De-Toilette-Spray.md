<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it, it last just long enough and its not over bearing...</li>
    <li> Cologne is a favorite of  my hubby. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This red for men isn&#x27;t the same as the red for men that was made in the 1990&#x27;s. Exact same package but not the same smell. I guess they had to quit making the old stuff because of the baby boom. lol the old stuff would shoot the panty&#x27;s right off of a woman.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my favorite fragrance on Amazon.com and I am very pleased.  The price was great.  Even with the shipping and handling charges, it was much less than it can be purchased at regular retail, if you can find it.</li>
    <li> im so glad that this cologne was put back on the market,it is my favorite and my girl loves it too...far and away the best one out there and the price is right also.this is a &#x27;must have&#x27; for any man who wants to smell great.</li>
    <li> I buy this item and it goes over well everyone loves the scent it is priced very well and I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about it and dealing with this seller is awesome never a problem always more then satisfied... I highly recommend it to every one I know...</li>
    <li> THE LADIES LOVE IT, TRUST ME !  it&#x27;s my favorite cologne, and i bought it on amazon for 1/2 the price of retail.</li>
    <li> Love it. Couldn&#x27;t find in stores anymore. Favorite cologne for my husband. Quick delivery. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Had I walked from my home in Iowa to Monroe NY to purchase this cologne and walked BACK to Iowa I would have STILL beat this sellers  &amp;#34;free shipping &amp;#34;. Product is AAA+,  price was fairly inexpensive and customer service was, at best, an afterthought.</li>
    <li> The women in my life love this on me.</li>
    <li> I remember first time i bought this, it was 1990-91 in broadway dept. store. I loved the smell from the beginning. Now after 20 years, it&#x27;s good to have the RED back. Smell very good. Not too fruity and not too spicy. and the price, well i use to pay $55.00 and now is a bargain. I&#x27;m going to buy more just in case it disappear again.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for money. I used it  for my office today and nearly 10 people complemented the fragrance. It is really very strong and gives a high quality. Highly recommended. I still really cannot believe this costs only 16 bucks.  It is highly suitable for mild use and party wear. I should say, for the kind of fragrance it gives, its recommended for occasions too. Great product !</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive this item it has met my expectations completely and I recommend it to others I&#x27;m sure they will be as happy as I am and the price was very good also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M SO GLAD YOU HAD RED BY GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS. MY HUSBAND JUST LOVES IT.&lt;br /&gt;HE ALWAYS SMELL SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;  HAPPY NEW YEAR.</li>
    <li> I thought this cologne was discontinued. I was surprised to find it so cheap in an Amazon.com warehouse. It smells mostly of alcohol when you first spray it on, but the true smell eventually comes through. Perhaps it is many years old just sitting in a warehouse somewhere? Still, I think I found a great deal on a cologne I can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> Smell good on a man, Wow !!!!!  like this one a lot. My son get noticed every time</li>
    <li> This was not on the market for a while. I am glad to see it back....and yes this is the real deal. Great price for a nice cologne. It is unique, not overbearing, and the ladies love it :)</li>
    <li> Very much like this new cologne. I would recommend this cologne to others. It is not over powering or strong.</li>
    <li> Umm ... makea me smella good</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> This is a discontinued fragrance but they have it and it is my favforite scent. Everything is great.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for a friend of mine. He had been looking for this product because apparently every time he wore it a girl would stop him and tell him he smelled awesome!</li>
    <li> Cologne stays with you and smells good!</li>
    <li> Thanks had been looking for it for years</li>
    <li> Keep buying it all the time, this cologne is excellent, and the delivery was pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Have purchased &#x27;Red for Men&#x27; from Amazon before.  The product had been discontinued a few years ago but brought back.  I found it at Amazon and bought a couple of bottles at a great price for the 2009 holiday season. Bought again this year just to ensure my supply in case it is once again discontinued.  Great price, great service, great cologne - way to go Amazon.  Musky, manly.  Not wimpy or fruity.  Not for the fainthearted!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and was heartbroken when it disappeared off retailer shelves! I am very pleased that it is once again available and I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this quite by accident tonight, and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I had long since given up hope of ever finding Red for Men again! I wore this scent exclusively for YEARS, and then one day when I went to get a new bottle, it was on sale for half price, so I asked the clerk if they had a second bottle. They did, but she told me it was on sale because it was discontinued and was no longer being made. For so long I have gone without, and yet still looked for it every time I was someplace that sold cologne, hoping I might come across a bottle. I had only ever run into one other person who wore it, so I guess it was never a hugely popular cologne, which was something I liked, and yet I received SO many compliments when I wore it. In fact, no other scent I have come across since I had used the last of my Red has earned anywhere near the amount of compliments. Several times I had dates repeatedly stretch up and stick their noses into my neck and take deep sniffs, followed by a long &amp;#34;Mmmmmm...&amp;#34;, and if that isn&#x27;t a cologne WIN, I don&#x27;t know what is! I don&#x27;t know why it went away, I don&#x27;t know why it is still not available in any stores I have been in, but I am extremely happy to have found it again! Once again, Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> My husband always wore red when I first met him.. It was a real bummer when they stopped making it... When I discovered they are again making it, I purchased a bottle for him for Christmas... Smells like the original Red.. Glad it&#x27;s back!</li>
    <li> Bought it because of people saying how good it smells. Come on, this thing stinks exactly like \\&quot;TROIKA odekalon\\&quot; (whoever from Soviet Union knows what I mean), I mean it smell like the cheapest aftershave you can buy... I don&#x27;t recommend this to anybody</li>
    <li> I brought this item some months back but never really used it. Today when i sprayed it on my new White Tee Shirt, it left yellowish stains.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it will evaporate  in some time but it did n&#x27;t . This left me very annoyed. Please beware if you are using on light clothes.</li>
    <li> OMG!!  This cologne is the bomb! Went clubbing and chicks were swarming me all night! It was insane.</li>
    <li> This product was (foolishly) discontinued and began to command ridiculous prices on eBay.    I am glad to see it back and my lady loves the smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these at Christmas for 3 of the men in ny family.  I bought this based on reviews I read. I had never actually smelled it before.  The men I gave them to are not that crazy about it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really bad or really great. That is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing Red for years.  At one time, it was discontinued but now back on market and Amazon&#x27;s price was great!</li>
    <li> I first came upon Red about almost 20 years ago.  Fell in love with it.  Had a bottle of it in my luggage and when I was leaving Calgary, someone remarked that the scent of my luggage was wonderful if a little bit overpowering.  I checked my luggage, only to find that the bottle had busted and permanently fixed itself in my suitcase.  Problem at the time was that Georgio had stopped making it available.  I was stunned!  Finally, in checking on and off for some time, I found it was available on Amazon, so I immediately order a new supply.  Have had many, many favorable comments about the pleasant sexy scent of Red. It&#x27;s a winner as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Excelent price.and smell&lt;br /&gt;For any reason use, Great for day time or night time i loves this Eau De Toillete.&lt;br /&gt;Great product I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red By Giorgio Beverly Hills For Men</li>
    <li> Red by Giorgio is my favorite product! It was hard to find here in Las Vegas for quite some time. To my surprise, this dealer offered it at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> Great cologne for the price. The scent lingers and is not strong.  It has a classic smell.  I love it for my husband!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has good reviews and it is relatively inexpensive (paid less than $17 for the bottle).  The smell is so powerful it made my female worker cough and my male workers cover their noses.  I need to donate it charity ASAP.  Lesson here?  Buy high quality cologne.  They usually have better quality.</li>
    <li> Since Red for women is one of my favorites I bought the men&#x27;s version for my husband. We both love it &amp; I will always check here when looking to purchase</li>
    <li> I got this for my cousin for Christmas; he likes it very much, and he&#x27;s a REALLY picky guy. The fragrance is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since I was in high school and have received a lot of compliments on the smell.&lt;br /&gt;A shame that it is not in production anymore, but I will buy it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have liked and used this product for several years and it is now only available though Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I receive many compliments about its scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for keeping it available and thanks for great service</li>
    <li> Great smell, woman appear to really like the almond woody smell.  I received a sample from the store before I tried it.</li>
    <li> i love this spray, nice and stay longer. very good price and my all friends like it.great, nice we use it all the time.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find Red for men in the stores anymore. I am glad that I can find it online.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells awsome, used to wear it years ago then they discontinued it. Now it&#x27;s back but hard to find in stores. My wife loves it !</li>
    <li> My husband found an almost empty bottle of this in an abandoned apartment and brought it home.  I loved the way it smelled on him enough to order a brand new bottle.  great transition...came when it was suppose to and now I am enjoying a great smelling husband.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father.  He loves this cologne.  We cannot find it in the stores where we live.  I will be ordering this again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great scent and unchanged from 10-15 years ago when I first tried it.</li>
    <li> great price and great price</li>
    <li> Wonderful real Red...not a knock off.  Really enjoy the Red for Men and bought it at a good price.  Extremely happy.  Will buy again.  Many thanks.</li>
    <li> While this item isn&#x27;t the aftershave soother, I am quite pleased to have found the cologne as it&#x27;s my husbands favorite. Fast service, great packaging, would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> Good clean smell. Will purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> Nice old school scent. Kind of on the strong side. So be careful with the sprays.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance, easy to use spray, wonderful product, will buy it again and again</li>
    <li> My husband has used this cologne for years and it is the only one he will use.  We were pleased to find it available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very difficult to find online and impossible to find in stores.  Great price, fast shipping, product as advertised.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> What a classic scent.  This is my second bottle from Amazon and the price is still amazing. I have tried hundreds of cologne for men but this  remains to be my favorite......it just makes me feel good inside....love the smell:-)</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> There is much truth in the perception that there is no correlation between the price of cologne and how nice it  &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34;. This brand is not available in stores. I used it 15 years back and have been searching all over for this. At $16, it is a steal !!  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a product that had been dicontinued years ago. I still had several small travel sizes of the original product which I would use for special occasions. Very happy to see it back, the new product is dead on compared to the original. Sweet, musky scent. My all-time favorite.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent...and so do I!</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  It has a smokey, masculine sent. It gets compliments.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in time and in a good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap and I will do it again. I recommend to every one</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome.  My son  loves it as well as his girlfriend!  I think it smells so good I might just buy a bottle for my husband. It&#x27;s an extremely subtle scent but once you smell it, you&#x27;ll never forget it!</li>
    <li> This juice is pungent leather. It&#x27;s a very manly scent. It looks like bourbon. It really does. I find the smell way too potent and in your face for my taste. This stink would probably work really well in a dive bar, or at a motorcycle convention. Spray some of this juice on and I can guarantee that women will KNOW you are there. Whether that is a good or bad thing I can&#x27;t say. I can say that this stink isn&#x27;t for the shy, timid types. It&#x27;s a great cologne to wear to the zoo or the gas station. Lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the stuff back in the day when it first came out</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments not complaints. Been asked a lot, &amp;#34;what is that?&amp;#34; Can&#x27;t tell you what you like but I would almost bet you can&#x27;t loose...bet on Red.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute great find. I have worn this scent for many years and could not find it at my local mall stores. By luck I found it and have purchased many backup bottles. The price is unbelievable and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome for close up range without being overbearing.  Great product and I am pleased it is again offered!</li>
    <li> RED has been my favorite fragrance for many years.  When it was not available I didn&#x27;t wear cologne much.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am very pleased it has returned.  I hope it will continue to be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Giorgio Beverly Hills for bringing it back.</li>
    <li> Aroma didn&#x27;t last like it used too</li>
    <li> The item came, unsealed as promised. I can&#x27;t say more because I won&#x27;t be the one testing it. But,I have no complaints either</li>
    <li> been using thai colon for many yrs when I got my 1st  one it was  like 45 to 60.00 for the 4 oz  wow love it</li>
    <li> Buena fragancia por el precio, para uso diario en el trabajo o cualquier actividad. La he usado en otras ocasiones y es agradable.</li>
    <li> good to find my favorite cologne again!  love the way that it smells, doesn&#x27;t take much of it and the fragrance last all day.</li>
    <li> RED by Giorgio of Hollywood great product got lucky first time all she said is that cologne is driving nuts try it  RED by Giorgio of Hollywood</li>

    <li> i personally enjoy the scent of this product.  i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just what I expectedgreat man smell</li>
    <li> Nice price and received as promised</li>
    <li> great price; on time delivery;  VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. When I wear it, I always get comments from the ladies on how great I smell when I&#x27;m wearing this. It works.</li>
    <li> One day I asked a customer at work what cologne he was wearing and he said it was called red (something). So I checked it out on the reviews on youtube and amazon, mostly everyone said it smelt great. I said to myself \\&quot;this has got to be it\\&quot; This stuff smells horrible. This is not what the guy was wearing. I boxed it up and tossed it under my bathroom sink. I would never be caught wearing this. Good thing I have a little of YSL \\&quot;La nuit De L&#x27;homme\\&quot; left.</li>
    <li> Giorgio Red cologne is a masterful blend.  It definitely catches the attention of those you are around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve G.</li>
    <li> Purchased this cologne for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and it just arrived. When he opened his gift he was in shock and wanted to know where I had found it. This just made his Valentine&#x27;s Day and mine even better. He has been looking everywhere for the Red By Giorgio Beverly Hills For Men for years and had no luck whatsoever. I am so very Happy and my husband is one Happy Man today. Thanks again for bringing it back and PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue selling it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Product arrived on time and packed perfectly.</li>
    <li> PERFECT PRICE FOR THE ITEM. ITS A REALLY GOOD SMELL.. YOU WILL BUY IT FOREVER.  THEY SHOULD CALL IT FOREVER RED.. BECAUSE YOU WON&#x27;T WANT TO CHANGE A THING. MMMMMMMM GOOD.</li>
    <li> very strong colonge, i choose this cologne for my son. he likes it because it is lasting send me more product</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t EVER stop making this fragrance it is one of my favorites!!! My father introduced me to this fragrance when I was very young and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since...</li>
    <li> Used to use Red daily for years before it was discontinued. There was a few places that still had the after shave for $40-$50 but the cologne was gone. I was excited to see it online again. The after shave is still $40 but the cologne is $15-$20 ???  That&#x27;s very cheap for any name brand cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have my doubts as to whether the formulation now is the same as before. It is a much sharper smell, a little less sweet. If it is truly from Giorgio I guess it is not an knock off,  but it doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> nice sophisticated cinnamon cologne. classy.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with this gift. He hadn&#x27;t been able to find this for years, and loved it when he wore it. He said it smells just like he remembers. It made a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Every xmas i get this for my husband for xmas. Wish I could just subscribe.</li>
    <li> Super item with a real good price. I have used this product for years but have always paid much more. you can find this item at better stores to see what their price is.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Could not find for years. Very glad to see its back.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast service.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best colognes on the market for the price.amazon has a great price on this cologne check it out.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Just like it!  Will continue buying it and would definitely recommend to a friend as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> B.B.H. well again just the name calls for your full attention. Still smells good just like it did when it was first introduced to the public. Makes a statement it yes it does last ALL DAY LONG.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne was Giorgio Red. He wore it for years till it was discontinued. Now, apparently it is back and I was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon. It made a perfect present. I think the scent is a little bit different from what it used to be, but it still makes a man smell really good.</li>
    <li> Ive used Red before and stays on me the longest. Not overpowering yet potent. My wife loves this on me.</li>
    <li> Great size great price</li>
    <li> Only a so so scent and use it sparingly. A bit on the perfumed side for my taste. Not something I would recommend for everyday use but ok for occasionally breaking up the use of your daily cologne.</li>
    <li> This may sound like an Old Spice plug, but my grandfather is the reason I wear it. All the ladies, young and mature, appreciate the dynamic of the aroma. It grabs major attention.</li>
    <li> This did not smell like new cologne.  It smelled old, not good, and like it was left over from the early 90&#x27;s.  The original Red for Men was wonderful, but not this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Red for Men since 1990.  For about 10 years they were completely unavailable.  I did find two bottles back in 2003 in an obscure fragrance shop in New York City&#x27;s Chinatown district hidden back behind some bottles on a bottom shelf in the corner.  They owner wanted to buy them back (probably to sell at a higher price).  Of course, I refused.  I was so happy to see them now available here on Amazon.  When they are available, I buy 5 bottles, which lasts me for a while.  I was down to my last bottle when I ordered here online.  Thanks, Amazon for carrying such a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Wife and I both love this scent. I prefer it for the evening wear. Had a difficult time finding this and the price is great.</li>
    <li> For years, you could only buy this Georgio, but thanks to Amazon, it is available once again. AND at a very low price! I keep three bottles stocked at all times &amp; frequently introduce this product to others as birthday gifts. It is a heavy scent and it last for a long time, so little is needed. It is like by both men &amp; women.&lt;br /&gt;It is a quality product the lasts. They remember you after you hugged them , or have left a room/elevator! : ) enJOY❗</li>
    <li> its what i use, nothing special about it- but price</li>
    <li> Great bargain and wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> Smell great. Repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> This is my cologne of choice.  It has been really hard to find over the last few years.  Excellent cologne!</li>
    <li> I want to tell you that this definately a great fragrance. Try it you cant go wrong. Its still a popular scent.</li>
    <li> When Red For Men became discontinued many years I could not find the cologne anywhere.The only luck I had was acquiring a few bottles of their after shave flash...surprisingly I still have some of a bottle left.In my opinion when Elizabeth Arden acquired the Giorgio of Beverly Hills line and resurrected Red For Men I was very impressed that the scent was untouched to my nose.Other people may say different but all I can say...is it smells like I remember.It&#x27;s just as strong to me and hangs on about 8 hours.It was $15 in comparison to $45 recalling twenty five years ago.The only reason Red For Men was expensive was the obvious.Imagine if British Sterling was made by Giorgio and sold from their shop on Rodeo Drive?hefty mark up indeed.Elizabeth Arden is proof the scent was inexpensive to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Red for Men smell like?&lt;br /&gt;To me it smells of leather and spicy-sweet like cinnamon.Some kind of leafy green quality with a clarity to it of juniper berries...though I confuse it with pine needles.Something else in this cologne which is resinous it took me years to pin from the original and EA&#x27;s formula...amber and anise.Now it&#x27;s just my taste but I think Red For Men is far more interesting to one&#x27;s nose than Fahrenheit by Christian Dior.All Fahrenheit smells of to me is of Kiwi shoe polish,violets,and real lime.But to each his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that the bottle obviously hasn&#x27;t changed and neither has the box artwork for that matter.Has a good sprayer.All I can say recommendation wise is it might fit well for someone who likes mature scents like Drakkar Noir or Quorum who doesn&#x27;t mind something a little sweet to compliment it&#x27;s leather character.A very good cologne and I&#x27;ll never understand why it wasn&#x27;t much sooner.5-stars!</li>
