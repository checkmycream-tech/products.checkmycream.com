      <li>I was able to try a sample</li>
      <li>So I put some more on and...</li>

      <li>daughter (2 years) has coarser, thicker hair and more of a 3b-3a.</li>

      <li>This is one of my favorite styling products.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>I have better results with JAM pudding and it costs $1.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using now - use your favorite brand or mist with water), and get 3-5 day hair before it starts frizzing.    </li>
      <li>Love Miss Jessie&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Loads of volume, perfect big spirals.  </li>
      <li>This gel tames the frizz, gives me great curls which even look good the next day!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m totally in love.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>(The jelly seems to make my hair more defined).</li>
      <li>Will be buying more for sure...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff--all the hold with ZERO crunch.</li>
      <li>AND my spirals come out soooo much better.</li>
      <li>In addition it is flake free &amp; smells amazing (kind of reminds me of fresh cotton laundry :) )</li>
      <li>touchabley soft, beautifully defined curls.</li>
      <li>i ordered a free sample from miss jessie&#x27;s website and i&#x27;ve used it for 2 days and love the results, much better than the curly pudding results :)  </li>
      <li>But do try the above mentioned products, they are very good.</li>
      <li>but I have loved it so much that I had to buy.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair that gets frizzy and breaks easily.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>As my curly as fine</li>
      <li>I liked it, went back and purchased two more in August!    </li>
      <li>First to make this easy - I have a lot of hair, but it is very FINE.  </li>
      <li>I hoped this would help keep my curls smooth (as it claims to do).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it to spend a bit more on a high-quality product that gives you the results it claims.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>As if that weren&#x27;t great enough, this stuff smells DIVINE.</li>
      <li>I use this after Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-in Condish (which is absolutely indispensable for frizz-free curls).</li>
      <li>I had a sample of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Multi-Cultural Curls and loved it, so when I came on Amazon to purchase it, I read the reviews for this and Pillow soft as well.</li>
      <li>I came across this at Target and brought it home without any great expectations; I&#x27;d been let down by so many hair products before  that I wasn&#x27;t about to go getting my hopes up.</li>
      <li>This is a new product from the Miss Jessie&#x27;s line &amp; I had been looking for an effective yet light gel for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have pretty curly hair that gets more poofy and frizzy in the humidity.  </li>
      <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls jelly is possibly one of the best things to ever happen to my hair.</li>
      <li>I also believe film forming ingredients like ethanolamine (TEA, MEA) and polyquaternium (10, 17, 37, etc.) provide great curl definition but eventually leave my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
      <li>As far as the product goes I love it!  </li>
      <li>The only thing that makes my hair look good is mousse.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I remember trying curl activator gel, the clear kind when I was a teenager</li>
      <li>I bought a full size before I ran out of the sample.</li>
      <li>My hair has a zigzag curl pattern, so if I want it to actually come out with spiral curls I have to use a good amount of product.</li>
      <li>At least that way you can try each product and decide what works best for you, rather than wasting money on full size products and wasting what you don&#x27;t want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the price has gone down or what but I think 12 bucks is reasonable!  I got a sample of this in my Birchbox and the sample itself lasted me a week!  My last 8.5oz bottle lasted me well over 6 months.  $24 a year in hair gel is a great price!  As far as the product goes I love it!  It gives me curl definition without the crunch, which is HATE! Again, not sure why others are saying it is crunchy, if anything it is a little greasy.  I guess it works different on different hair types?  I have really dry, really curly hair that tends to get frizzy.  This gel tames the frizz, gives me great curls which even look good the next day!  I tried the &#x27;pillow soft curls&#x27; and I do not like it nearly as much.  My hair still gets frizzy with it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this product, not expecting my hair to turn out exactly the way it does when I use my $2 Ecostyler gel, which is hard, dry and crunchy.  The results were so identical that I decided to look up the ingredients for each product, and the only difference was the olive oil and the blue and yellow color in the Ecostyler gel. Save yourself about $20 and buy the Ecostyler gel - identical product, identical results!  Miss Jessie&#x27;s should be ashamed!</li>
    <li> TOO OILY FOR ME DID NOY ACHEIVE THE LOOK I WAS TRYING TO GET USING THIS PRIDECT</li>
    <li> Worked... But nothing really different from other curly hair products.</li>
    <li> Seller is great, loved everything but hated the product. I dont do crunch. It leaves crunch!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is biracial and has very thick curly hair.  It works really well for her hair.  It makes her hair really soft and gives it some hold.  Fairly good price too</li>
    <li> okay, so girls with curly hair, this product does what it says. I normally using the Redkin curl line products but I don&#x27;t like the crunch. I don&#x27;t have perfect spiral curls, but I have more than a wave. I put this on my damp hair and go- I love it. I was able to try a sample and I was hooked and purchased on Amazon. less expensive than Redkin for me. I only need a quarter size every day-so I know it will last.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in my Birchbox and was very skeptical but I have loved it so much that I had to buy. I have 3a/3b curls and this has been the only product that works top to bottom as described. I live in Louisiana and this has been working great to hold the definition in my hair through the humidity while still leaving my hair quite soft and touchable (something I have never achieved with other products)&lt;br /&gt;~ Jason&#x27;s wife</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it for her curly hair. Holds well in high moisture conditions</li>
    <li> This is a new product from the Miss Jessie&#x27;s line &amp; I had been looking for an effective yet light gel for my hair. I could not be happier...once again Miss Jessie&#x27;s does not disappoint! The product delivers as promised: defines curls w/ a firm hold w/o leaving the hair hard. In addition it is flake free &amp; smells amazing (kind of reminds me of fresh cotton laundry :) ) I have thick curly/kinky hair &amp; my curls are so soft, light &amp; fluffy after applying this product, &amp; they hold throughout the day w/o getting frizzy. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the perfect hair product...love this stuff!!! Will be buying more for sure...</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair like a straw!! Did not work for me maybe it&#x27;s just my hair but not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have past the shoulder length type 2c/3a curls if that means anything to you. This styler is a lot thicker than I expected, but a little goes a long way and my curls have been loving it so far. Instead of leaving my hair feeling crunchy like most styling gels, it leaves my hair soft as promised. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. I&#x27;m trying this new product after using DevaCurl products and I&#x27;d recommend it to my curly sisters and misters.</li>
    <li> There is no other gel out there that is comparable to this one for my fine 3b/c curls. I use this after Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-in Condish (which is absolutely indispensable for frizz-free curls). All I&#x27;ve ever wanted from a gel is frizz control without stiffness (you know that feeling when your curls are defined but you can crunch them?! Ick.) This is IT! Glossy, frizz-free and S-O-F-T curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8.5 oz size usually lasts me 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> I have extremely tight spiral curls and this product has worked wonders. I agree with the other posters that the smell is a bit much, but it dissipates rather quickly and leaves my hair with a soft hold all day. Truth be told, at the end of a humid Houston day, I do still have a little frizz action kicking with Miss Jessie&#x27;s, but it is not nearly as bad as it&#x27;s been with other products... nothing a quick re-touch can&#x27;t fix. I plan to try to pillow curls product next, this one was substantially cheaper so I started with it.</li>
    <li> This product creates a very nice curl - when it is not very humid outside. When it is, need a stronger gel for my curls. But when it is not, I really like how it makes my hair feel - not to crunchy, nice curl, nice scent, not drying, doesn&#x27;t break my hair, no flaking, strong enough hold, lasting, and flexible. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry other reviewers have not had a great experience with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls.  I have been very satisfied with the product.    Please compare prices prior to purchasing this product, I purchased mine for twelve dollars at Target stores back in July 2013.  I liked it, went back and purchased two more in August!    It has a fresh, clean laundry scent, reminiscent of fabric softener.  Scent dissipates as it dries.    It&#x27;s a non tacky jelly, good weight, no stickiness or gumminess.  Dries in several hours without residue or flaking.    I didn&#x27;t use a leave in because I&#x27;m still evaluating the product on its own merit, besides it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair wretchedly dry!    I describe my hair as African American, kinky coily (4c using Andre Walker method; L-O-cottony using L.O.I.S. method).    Technique:  Using my fingers, I rake through a moderate amount (1-2 fingertips) to each section of freshly washed, detangled and separated wet hair till evenly distributed.  I get better results on wet hair, to each his own I say!    I separate and comb thin partings with a Tool Structure tortoise backcomber (from Sally Beauty), till hair is detangled and drops from the comb&#x27;s teeth.  I dip comb in basin of warm water to keep hair wet during styling.    I apply small amount of my favorite oil for sheen after my hair is completely air dried.  I refresh style in AM with shower steam or Jane Carter Revitalizing Leave in Conditioner mist (it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using now - use your favorite brand or mist with water), and get 3-5 day hair before it starts frizzing.    I have recommended Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls to friends and family.  I would purchase it again - but not at this seller&#x27;s price.        ______________________________________________________________  EDIT 9/7/14:    While I believe MJ JSC is a quality product, I no longer use it.  I began to notice how dry it left my hair; during a trip to a low humidity region this summer, my hair appeared &#x27;dull and dusty&#x27;.      INGREDIENTS:  Water (Aqua, Eau), Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Glycerin, PVP, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Aminomethyl Propanol, Fragrance (Parfum), Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein.    I believe PVP and Hydrolyzed wheat protein leave my 4c textured hair very dry.  I now avoid stylers that include them.      I also believe film forming ingredients like ethanolamine (TEA, MEA) and polyquaternium (10, 17, 37, etc.) provide great curl definition but eventually leave my hair dry and brittle.  Please note, the aforementioned ingredients are not found in MJ JSC.      Therefore, the MJ JSC has been shelved.  I won&#x27;t throw it out, keeping it on hand for emergencies because it applies and dries quickly, but I will not buy it again.  Just wanted to let you know.      p.s. It is highly advisable to use a leave in or oil before or after using MJ JSC if your hair tends to feel dry after using these agents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced someone bewitched this stuff, there&#x27;s no other explanation. It does just what it says it does: Defines curls without the crunchy feeling that most other gels leave, also leave it shiny and helps me with my frizz. AND. As if that weren&#x27;t great enough, this stuff smells DIVINE. Like downy fabric softener.</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing ! I have wavy/curly hair that is prone to frizziness and poofiness. I&#x27;ve spent my whole life  searching for a hair product that would give me soft, defined curls without the stiff, crunchy look.I came across this at Target and brought it home without any great expectations; I&#x27;d been let down by so many hair products before  that I wasn&#x27;t about to go getting my hopes up.I applied this to my hair according to the directions (a little goes a long way) and voila!...touchabley soft, beautifully defined curls. Yay !!!!.....Miss.Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Holds well without making my hair hard and as long as I don&#x27;t allow it to build up too much there is no flaking either.</li>
    <li> This product really gave me the same results as my eco gel does. I&#x27;m really not a gel girl anyway but I was like what the heck ill try it. I like my curls to be big soft bouncy and very defined. This stuff did define my curls but left my hair hard and life less. At lest with eco my hair is still soft and moves. I won&#x27;t be buying this</li>
    <li> I have pretty curly hair that gets more poofy and frizzy in the humidity.  I hoped this would help keep my curls smooth (as it claims to do). As soon as I got the product distributed throughout my hair, it dried it up and it immediately made my hair feel like damp straw.  It&#x27;s holding no curl, just looks stringy and gross.  Also it smells like a diaper.  Awful.  I would not suggest this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works really well for my wavy/curly hair, not too stiff or crunchy, but still has some hold. The scent is a little strong, but overall I like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted my money, this left my hair stingy, hard, and dry. This must work for short kinky hair because it doesn&#x27;t work on shoulder length wavy/ curly hair. Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before purchasing.</li>
    <li> smells yummy i luv how soft it still leaves your hair a great product i would recommend to anyone who wears natural curls</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair but I straighten it too. My hair type can be described as the kind that has to be styled in some way after washing it, otherwise it just looks crazy and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this gel, the bottle is big enough to last a really long time and it has a nice smell to it. Which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: I rub the gel it into my hands well, and add a splash of water too. Then, I carefully work it into my hair in small sections at a time. Once that&#x27;s done, I scrunch it and let it air dry or hit it a little with a blow dryer. Total time? 5 mins tops and no crunch left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a pea sized amount in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair when I style hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are reviews that say this product has left hair their hair crunchy, and I will say that it can do that if you use too much of it. I am VERY conservative with this and only recommend using around a dime to a quarter size based on your hair&#x27;s thickness and length.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used bumble and bumble curling lotion and mousse to get my hair to stay wavy and not frizz. Since bumble is 2 separate products, I got tired of it after a while and have since been trying to find a product that was not only comparable in function but more cost effective and less labor intensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve finally found it with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft. I had a sample of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Multi-Cultural Curls and loved it, so when I came on Amazon to purchase it, I read the reviews for this and Pillow soft as well. I was torn but decided on this in the end because of the reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it keeps my hair the way i like it (wavy, not frizzy and soft) and doesn&#x27;t have any crunch to it which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have very fine, very light blonde hair naturally, with natural wave and a tendency to get frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product leaving my hair with shiny, curls.  My hair is soft, and I wake up in the morning with the curls still intact.  All I do is wet my hair, add a little conditioner, and fluff up my curls.  Every other day I add jelly soft, to keep my hair looking great.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but for a much cheaper price you can use \\&quot;ECO Styler Blue level 5\\&quot;, and it does the exact same thing! I looked at the ingredients on both products and its EXACTLY the same, except for the blue coloring in the ECO Blue gel. DONT waist your money on this product just for the NAME!! ECO styler BLUE level 5, will give you the same exact results for a much much cheaper price! (A LIL SCAMISH TO ME)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  After I applied it to my hair I let it air dry and some section of my hair were scrunchy (and I applied a decent amount). I also didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this product.  And most important, my hair became more dry after I used this product. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I don&#x27;t  have curly hair, but this really  works well for my hair. I&#x27;ve finally found something that  works for my hair. Yes I would  buy this product again,except  the price is to high.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with Jelly Soft Curls! Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores in NYC recently, so I had to order it offline. Love this stuff--all the hold with ZERO crunch. I have always been that girl, fighting that  crunchy, heavy, &amp;#34;wet-look&amp;#34;--trying to just get natural frizz free curls! And I finally have it! :)</li>
    <li> I have to mix with mouse in order to have it hold my curls.  I have 2c curls. This gel has nothing but a good smell.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls and recommend it to all my friends and family. It is crystal clear and does not flake. I have very thick unruly hair so for me it works best when hair is a little wet and holds my hair all day.</li>
    <li> I love it I was really happy to receive it and it was exactly as promised. Thank you a million times over.</li>
    <li> My hair is a not very nice looking wave so I bought this to help it but it didn&#x27;t help it get any wavier. It just calmed the frizz which made it a little better, so unless you have very curly hair don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a year and it&#x27;s just the best I&#x27;ve found. It works really well to define curls without making them extremely stiff. In order to get good results you have to use a hefty amount, yet the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this.  I had a sample, not from Amazon.  It made my hair hard and dry.</li>
    <li> My curls are soft boncy but feels and looks dry. I thought  this product  would give my curls that moisturize with the softness.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair type 3b - fine, long, and pretty curly. This product is terrific for warding off frizz &amp; keeping my hair from falling flat at the crown. It responds really well to refresher products (the kind you spritz on for 2nd day hair to refresh your style). No offensive odor and moisturizing too -- it&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a little crunchy, but that&#x27;s mostly ok.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells FABULOUS!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is between 2c/3a curl-wise and tends to frizz without a product to tame it.  I generally uses Pantene&#x27;s curl gel but after seeing a review of Miss Jessie&#x27;s I gave it a go and I&#x27;m totally in love.  Pantene tends to leave a bit of crunch in the curl if I&#x27;m not obsessive about towel drying the curls.  When I first tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s I was exhausted so I just slapped some in my wet hair and went straight to bed. I woke up with absolutely perfect curls, with no crunch! Thinking this had to be a fluke I tried the product again and went through the whole towel dry rigmarole and was even happier with the way they came out. Loads of volume, perfect big spirals.  There was some leftover frizz from the friction of towel drying but a bit of B&amp;B invisible oil fixed that.  This is really an amazing product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down at all, it&#x27;s scentless, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or cake the curls together creating Medusa-like crunchy curls.  I just wound up with soft shiny spirals. So happy with this product, and at such a low price I&#x27;m totally going to stock up!</li>
    <li> Great hold and sheen. Not too stiff. Lasts all week if you use a silk/satin cap or pillow case!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, and I just love it! The problem I have with most hair products is they are either too heavy and weigh my hair down or are too light and don&#x27;t do anything to shape my curls. This gives me the soft, semi-defined curls I want. The only caveat I have is that the directions say to use at least the size of the cap, but that is far too much for my hair. I use about the size of a quarter. But that&#x27;s actually a positive too because that means the product will last longer. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gel and it does exactly what it says, provide maximum hold while leaving your hair pillow soft.  I love it.  I used it for three days in row for my twist out and I was nervous my hair would fall out but it didn&#x27;t.  I am definitely buying another one when it runs out.it is a must buy for your Bantu knots, braid outs and twist outs.  Also there is no build up or white residue that I noticed the three times I used it.</li>
    <li> Would recommend. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great styler for those with 4a/4b/4c type hair, like mine, since I have all three textures. This is not for softer hair textures like 2a-3c hair, that&#x27;s what the Pillow Soft Curls are for. Here&#x27;s my regiment: I wash with my WEN shampoo, then I put the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave-in Condish on my damp hair in four sections. I put all natural African Shea Butter to seal in the moisture, and lastly, as my styler I use Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls (for 3a and softer hair texture I suggest Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls). Use your fingers only when applying these products, never your comb. As Taylor Swift sang, to define your curls Shake It Off! Don&#x27;t try to separate your curls with a comb or your hands, once the products are distributed all over your hair then just shake your hair in a &#x27;yes&#x27; &#x27;no&#x27; &#x27;all over&#x27; motion and voila! you&#x27;re done. I place this regiment in all the Miss Jessie&#x27;s products I use because at times I searched far and wide on how to perfect my wash-n-go&#x27;s and this is how I do it. For those who has given Miss Jessie&#x27;s a bad review, it wasn&#x27;t that the product was bad, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t compatible to their hair textures, so I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is says - gives you soft curls! I just put it on my hair after a shower and let it air dry!</li>
    <li> Good for enhancing curls without making hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls jelly is possibly one of the best things to ever happen to my hair. I have very curly, poofy hair and this jelly makes it clean-cut  and beautiful. I&#x27;ve been reading other reviews about how it makes their hair crunchy and basically &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;. It did that to my hair ONCE. The reason being? I didn&#x27;t comb it with a wide-tooth brush prior to putting the jelly in my hair. (It says to do so in the instructions). I LOVE this product. End of story.</li>
    <li> I have used many of the products in the Miss Jessie&#x27;s line.  This is a light gel that provides a nice hold without the hair becoming hard.  It works well for quick styling.</li>
    <li> My hair has a zigzag curl pattern, so if I want it to actually come out with spiral curls I have to use a good amount of product. With this, I don&#x27;t need nearly as much product as I usually do with other brands AND my spirals come out soooo much better. I love this stuff, seriously. If you have super thick 4c hair like I do, I&#x27;d highly recommend this for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on other hair types, Miss Jessie&#x27;s has an extensive line of products for the curly girls, so I would suggest ordering a smaller size of this or ordering her Deluxe Value Pack. The pack has all of the products in Miss Jessie&#x27;s line in small sample sizes. If you&#x27;re not sure about this product and have $62, I highly recommend it. At least that way you can try each product and decide what works best for you, rather than wasting money on full size products and wasting what you don&#x27;t want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the Deluxe Value Pack: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RS8MWG?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only shows a few of the products it comes with in the pictures, but trust me it comes with all of the products. I was surprised to figure that out when I opened the package, too. I left a video review that shows everything inside of it. Enjoy! :D</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have really fine hair that gets frizzy and breaks easily. I HATE most hair gels, so I never really use them. I got a sample of this in my Birchbox and that alone lasted me a week. I bought a full size before I ran out of the sample.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Target for $14.99. My hair texture is mixed up. I have some 2A, 3A, 3B, and 3C spots. I was hoping this would be a good curl definer without crunch. I used it for 3 days and stopped. It made my hair feel dry and there is a definite crunch. I had no damage to my hair before I used this product and now I have a dry patch in the back. It&#x27;s very small and is at the ends of my hair thank God. This was my first Miss Jessie&#x27;s product and I think it&#x27;ll be my last. I have better results with JAM pudding and it costs $1. If you need a general idea of my hair type IG: @the_royal_court I&#x27;m also biracial. I do not recommend this for multi curl patterns. I used hazelnut oil under it, coconut oil under it, and a creamy Shea whip and nothing helped. This product is drying. Smells nice and it does define some of my curls but it&#x27;s to drying.</li>
    <li> I am a natural hair girl. This is one of my favorite styling products. It gives my twist outs hold. Its not drying, excellent ingredience and an excellent price!</li>
    <li> i ordered a free sample from miss jessie&#x27;s website and i&#x27;ve used it for 2 days and love the results, much better than the curly pudding results :)  my curls are perfect and nice and bouncy.  there is curl shrinkage, but i&#x27;ll take the shrinkage if it means perfect curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed with the product on how it worked on my hair. I&#x27;ll continue to work with it maybe I need to use a diffuser instead of letting my hair air dry.</li>
    <li> Product do not do what it claims very disappointed with product would not buy again.again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you crunchy curls!</li>
    <li> i have searched for good hair products for my curly hair for years. Now i live in NY, and i found this brand and its products. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had more curls than i have now. Very happy</li>
    <li> Makes for a defined, natural curl. I also tried Pillow Soft curls which are also a hit. I have thick, curly hair which tends to frizz in damp, hot weather, but Miss Jessie makes for a wow, soft, natural , defined curl. These are head- turning curls!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products for my curly hair, as most of us have.  It has been a difficult journey.  First to make this easy - I have a lot of hair, but it is very FINE.  So traditional products for curly hair generally do not work for me as they weigh my hair down dramatically.  After reading several reviews, I decided to give several of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products a try.  After a number of variations this is what I came up with.  I use a root booster first - generally CHI.  I comb it through thoroughly.  Then I put about a half dollar size of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls on my hands and rub it through my hair.  I again comb it through thoroughly.  As my curly as fine I need one more product.  For the last step, I use Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls following the same process.  (The jelly seems to make my hair more defined). I then diffuse my hair or let it dry naturally.  The result is like something I have never had before.  My hair is soft, manageable and very beautiful curls.  With the amount of product that I use I have no stiffness in my hair at all.  I can potentially get a second day without washing my hair if I just spritz it with a little water and let it dry naturally with a little scrunching.  I think you will be very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is why I never buy into the hype. I am a 34 year old female that has been struggling to do something with my curls for 22 years. I am mixed ( black,white) and have 3a fine curly hair. My hair is just like Jennifer Freeman&#x27;s and Mya&#x27;s.This stuff made my hair a mess. It&#x27;s sticky-greasy and takes forever to dry( I air dry, hate a blow dryer). It made my head a modge podge of mess. It made my roots greasy and string looking and the ends frizzy. You have to use a ton of this stuff to get good coverage but if I had, it would have been a droopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (2 years) has coarser, thicker hair and more of a 3b-3a.This may work to tame hers when I&#x27;m braiding it.&lt;br /&gt;I remember trying curl activator gel, the clear kind when I was a teenager and that&#x27;s exactly what this works like. Drying and greasy at the same time. How do they manage that???&lt;br /&gt;I cut about 12 inches off my hair about 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. The only thing that makes my hair look good is mousse. I need definition with some hold to give my hair volume and this will definitely not do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced and overrated. I won&#x27;t buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;FYI I didn&#x27;t like the mixed chicks line either.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this gel.  I have some gorgeous waves that always got lost in the frizz.  Regular gels and mousse would work for an hour or two but made it stiff and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;This gel makes touchably soft waves/curls and lasts ALL work day!  It can also be refreshed by misting your hair with water and re-applying.</li>
    <li> I heard some good reviews about this product, but I was very disappointed. I used as directed on my curly/wavy hair and my hair was so sticky and had this really strange texture that I did not like. My curls ended up more &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; than anything. Maybe I had the wrong hair type? I would not recommend for hair that is naturally a beachy wave with some frizz/curl.</li>
    <li> I like it , its not hard &amp; sticky like other gels I have tried .. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love this Product, my hair is beautiful every morning.</li>
    <li> Makes my curls shine and they are not crunchy</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair. This is not crunchy or heavy. I only use a little bit. Worth the $. I mix mine w/ a little morroccan oil.</li>
    <li> This was the worst experience I&#x27;ve had with a hair product...ever.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to define my curls as soon as I put it on.  So I put some more on and...nothing.  It took FOREVER for my hair to dry after that, but once it did, oh boy did it dry.  It ended up being a super-dry, stiff mess.  I couldn&#x27;t stand to touch it myself so I put it up into a ponytail until I could wash it out the next day.  Miss Jessie&#x27;s conditioners are crap too.  I&#x27;m giving the whole lot to a friend who has a daughter with curly hair. Maybe it will work for her, but I doubt it.  It&#x27;s so DRYING!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing works wonders . Would love to try &amp;#34;Pillow Soft Curls&amp;#34; but did not see it on here for sale</li>
    <li> Love Miss Jessie&#x27;s but this is not my favorite product - definitely recommend Pillow Soft Curls over this!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this is just the product I needed. After trying to find the &#x27;perfect product&#x27; for 15 years I think I have finally found my favorite! It&#x27;s worth it to spend a bit more on a high-quality product that gives you the results it claims. :)</li>
    <li> I really like this gel a lot.  It left my hair soft, shiny and bouncy for days.  It&#x27;s the first gel that didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or flake and not white balls (residue) on my hair.  I don&#x27;t like the price when I have to actually buy it, but I believe a little goes a long way.  I ended up receiving a full size for free, and since I like it so much I&#x27;ll have to purchase some.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try to get it when Miss. Jessie&#x27;s has a sale, they usually have some special for Black Friday through some time in December.  I&#x27;ve tired a lot of other gels with a much lower price, but they always make my scalp flake and itch.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price.  However, I will still purchase it.  As I said a little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve used it on my children and they have extremely long hair.  Btw, use some type of moisturizer prior to adding any type of gel.  They even suggest it on their site.</li>
    <li> Love it. I usually buy the pillow soft curls, but don&#x27;t like the odor of it. This one has no odor and doesn&#x27;t leave you hair with a sticky film and is cheaper.... I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I got this because their pillow soft curls crème is excellent but all this stuff did was make my hair sticky and stiff.</li>
    <li> This product was OK, but not great!  The smell of it reminded me of dryer sheets.  Once I got past that, it was pretty good for the first day.  Second day hair wasn&#x27;t very defined and it was hard and rough to the touch.  I don&#x27;t like hard hair, so back to Kinky Curly I go.  KCCC has better ingredients for my hair and is pretty much the same price.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34; I have ever used. My hair is super dry, frizzy, and curly, and I hate how other products make my curls crunchy. This leaves you with the softest girls ever. I received it as a sample in one of my birchboxes, and won&#x27;t be using anything else, ever.</li>
    <li> Not as defined curls as the Pillow soft curls,  Quick curls or Transitioner&#x27;s Magic. It wasn&#x27;t any better than other curl stylers I&#x27;ve used. But do try the above mentioned products, they are very good.</li>
</ol>
