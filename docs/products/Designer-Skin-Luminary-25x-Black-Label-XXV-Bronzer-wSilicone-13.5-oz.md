<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it!!!!...My skin was darker after the first use. The lotion smells really good left my skin shimmery with sparkles. I Loved the bottle too, I didn&#x27;t know when I first got the bottle that there is a tag on the front of the bottle that if you pull the tag...the stars light up.Pretty cool!!...I will be ordering this from Amazon again, I was also very pleased with how fast I received my order. Thankyou!!!:)</li>
    <li> Its the BEST, it costs 120.00 at the salon I go to. Out of the 5 girls that work at the salon 3 use this. It is firming, makes your skin feel so soft and smooth, and gives a natural bronze color. Very pleasant scent, not cocnuty. Im hooked</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING. I have gotten so TAN so fast! I got compliments from co-workers after getting back from tanning at lunch because it already looked like I took a weekend trip! Definitely worth the cost since it&#x27;s 3X the price in the salons!</li>
    <li> This is just basic, to me.  Did nothing for me; all the hype is really about the bottle itself which is cute.</li>
    <li> Looooovveeeee Luminary! Its so light, you can lather it on during a lunch break then go back to work and not feel sweaty and greasy. It has a subtle smell but I love it so much I sometimes use it when I&#x27;m not even tanning. The bronzers will even out the appearance of your skin tone and the silicone makes it light and skin firming. This is one of the best tanning lotions you can buy.</li>
    <li> Not what it was made up to be. Doesn&#x27;t tan like it says.</li>
    <li> I had already bought this from a salon and spent way too much. this is the same great product at a wonderful price. Seller was great. Product got to me very fast! VERY HAPPY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought Luminary from my local tanning salon. I paid $125 for it. With such a high price and it being Designer Skin, I was expecting magic. This lotion did absolutely nothing for me. The smell is great, very smooth, but the effects... none. I have used this lotion dozens of times and have noticed no difference. I will definately not purchase this lotion again.</li>
    <li> Though this one doesnt have as much bronzer as Obsidian,I am in LOVE with the smell. Its amazing! Used it today and love,love,love it! I do see a very good bit of extra color today and that was only in a 12 min stand up bed. In love with it already! Love all of Designer Skins lotions!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product with a great price. It works well. The ease of purchase was very quick. I highly recommend purchasing from here</li>
    <li> This lotion is the absolute best!!!!! Been tanning in a level 5 bed about 1-2 times a week since April and the color I have is perfect!!! Like I just stepped off a tropical island! The lotion has a pleasant smell and it also has a shimmer on it that stays on you until you wash. I highly recommend it and don&#x27;t buy anywhere but here bc you&#x27;ll pay a ton more!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks straight.  If anything I have been loosing my tan.  Talked to the specialist at my salon, she said that this product was basically junk.  Way too over priced.  She had seen other people use this and the same \\&quot;results\\&quot; that I had been getting.  Switched lotions and started getting my tan back.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion also left a residue on my skin as well as anywhere that I touched.&lt;br /&gt;The company was great however, got my lotion on time and packaged like it would have been new in a salon.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic lotion. I only have to tan once a week to stay brown</li>
    <li> this lotion has lasted me several months of indoor tanning about 4 times a week. The scent is absolutely divine! Its been the best tanning lotion I have ever tried. I also love the bottle that lights up when you open the cap! Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell. Honestly will probably not use it again due to that fact. Bottle was really cute though!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product through Glamour Tanning, and the product arrived completely wrapped, sealed, and 100% authentic! I have been using CA Tan Cypher 2011 for my body lotion, but for the first time today I use Luminary in a stand up bed for 7 min (max is 10!). Holy cow!!! I could FEEL my skin tanning, and afterwards I felt soo moisturized. I actually looked a shade darker too, immediately! I feel like my skin has been getting more tan throughout the day, too! The smell is decent (kind of unisex, fresh) and the lotion is kind of thick compared to the Cypher. I prefer the way Cypher feels on my skin, but I LOVE the way this lotion TANS ME!! I could feel it working and I&#x27;m super excited to see how it does on my beach vacation in a couple of days. :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me. The only thing I liked was the smell. But do remember like all products RESULTS MAY VARY.</li>
    <li> I am new to Amazon, and just on a whelm, decided to look for the tanning lotion that I was about to buy from my tanning salon.  To my surprise, I found the exact bottle for over 1/2 the price they were charging.  I, too, was skeptical.  But for the amount of the savings, I decided to hope the other reviewers were right and that this was the &amp;#34;real stuff.&amp;#34;  And wow! it is! I will never pay the extreme mark-up by the tanning salons again! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was really hyped up to try this product considering all the great ratings however  it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin or tan which is a shame... However it shipped pretty quickly so a+ for that</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product. I loved the results that it gave me when tanning. And the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I keep going back to Luminary.  I just finished a bottle of a Kardashian lotion on the advice of my salon owner.  It&#x27;s fine.  But not like Luminary.  My skin GLOWS after using it regularly.  And now after two years of not stocking it, my salon magically has it.  But she wants $125.  No thank you, I&#x27;ll buy it from Amazon, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with old lotion here.</li>
    <li> Excellent bronzing lotion....smooth and silky on the skin with a nice smell!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Even my husband said it gives me a nice browner tan. 2 thumbs up I will definately be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a million different tanning lotions and Luminary is in my top three. It smells really good and you don&#x27;t get that burnt smell after tanning .Gets me really dark and not orange which is what I love about it. Way too pricey at the salons so amazon is the way to go and my bottle came sealed &amp; right on time. So thrilled. The is bottle is super cute, it&#x27;s sparkly and it lights up. Another user mentioned that the glitter falls off the bottle but it doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a plastic cover over the glitter so the glitter doesn&#x27;t fall out. Luminary reminds me of Code by devoted creations which is my favorite tanning lotion but Code is pretty pricey. Luminary is a close second,  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is some really nice tanning lotion for that price. I see results right away. Love it!! I would have has to pay more at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite smelling lotion and I get nothing but great results when I use it. Also, it feels very lovely and silky. I still debate the price though.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a tanning salon real hesistant because it was $120.00! I am LOVING this! I noticed from the first use some color! I have only used it a few times so far. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t know I am even tanning, and he commented on how soft and smooth my skin is all of a sudden! So apparently its working!! I am going to definitely buy more of this! On here of course!</li>
    <li> Great product, I was nervous that this would be a different product or a counterfeit but it is exactly the same lotion they sell in the salon for $125. Smells and looks exactly the same. Very happy with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I just started tanning and was doing some in depth research as to which tanning lotion I should go with. I am light hair fair skinned so I was worried that I would just burn no matter what. I bought this (online of course cause my salon was charging $110 for it) and I have used it now for a half a dozen sessions and I think I am in love :) Not only am I not burning I&#x27;m getting a rich bronze color in only a few sessions AND IT SMELLS AMAZING!!!!!! I would def suggest this as a great tanning lotion for anybody I don&#x27;t even want to try anything else cause I know I will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but the Luminary label fell off (the little one that blinks) which is okay cause the product is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> this really do work. i love the smell and this makes you very soft. i would tell all my family and friends</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who likes the tanning beds but complained that her legs didn&#x27;t tan as well as everything else. This summer her tan is beautifully even, and smooth.</li>
    <li> this lotion does give you great color very quickly but I hate the smell of it and it leaves you sparkly after using it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It left my skin soft and gave me wonderful color! Also didnt give me that burnt skin smell after. And the price was amazing!</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my skin feel amazing and shine and the smell is just heavenly couldnt ask for a better product</li>
    <li> I have worked in a tanning salon, an upper scale salon, tried many lotions, this one I like the best.  Leavs skin hydrated, uniform tan, with no tingle.  The smell is not so bad either.  Every lotion will have some sort of smell, this one leaves a smell that is nice. I would recommend this lotion to anyone that like a great dark tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion about 3 months ago. I REALLY like this lotion, it smells like Tommy Hilfiger (so good) I get really dark after I use this. I would def. reccemond this to anyone. When I&#x27;m out of this lotion I will buy it again. You will not be discouraged.</li>
    <li> This bottle cost 3x as much at my salon. I love the light up bottle and the beautiful, natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> Ok so first off, I ordered this lotion Wednesday May 8th at 7PM and received it on Saturday May 11th in the after noon. I was very impressed with how fast tue shipping was! When I ordered this I was kinda afraid it would be a fake or something wrong with it so as soon as I took it out of the mail box I went to my tanning salon amd asked my friend who works there and who uses luminary to smell and feel my lotion. She said its the real deal so YAY. Now about how I feel about the lotion.. it smells amazing, kind of like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume but I can&#x27;t think of which one. I&#x27;ve only used this twice and so far haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic. I&#x27;m hoping with more use to get a darker color. Also I purchased from \\&quot;Theetanman\\&quot; I also bought bombshell tingle from him as well and loved it.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion out there</li>
    <li> I started out with Australian Gold Sinfully Black then changed to Designer Skin White to Black with Hemp. The W2B was working wonders on me, but it is as if I had reached a plateau. I stumbled across Luminary two weeks ago but the price worried me a little. I decided to sample some from the owner of the tanning salon to see why this product has a $120 price tag. I really liked it, but the tanning salon could only sell at $80 with a discount, and I simply couldn&#x27;t afford that. After using Google to research the product, I found it on Amazon for $42. I was skeptical because of the huge difference in price, but decided to take a chance and order. I ordered from Solarium (fulfilled by Amazon). I am an Amazon Prime customer, so I received my bottle in 2 days. Shipping was fast and easy. The bottle was packaged nicely and the product was sealed, as promised. After using once, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt this is the real deal! Luminary has a very pleasant scent and is not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t streak but can leave spots between the fingers if not wiped off or rubbed in good after applying. After using Luminary, my skin feels so soft and smooth, and I notice a difference after every time I tan. Luminary has little sparkles in the lotion. I didn&#x27;t see them before using but after going out in the sunlight, my skin just shimmers. This is the very best lotion I have used thus far, and I will be ordering my second and third bottles soon, so that I have them ready next year. I would give Luminary, Sold by Solarium, Fulfilled by Amazon, 10 stars if I could. If you don&#x27;t tan easily or have reached your plateau, buy this lotion. You will not be disappointed. I can&#x27;t speak for other sellers, but Solarium is the way to go. I paid $3 more from this seller and got the real Luminary. To me, that&#x27;s definitely worth the guarantee that you&#x27;re getting what you want and need! Luminary is everything the seller promises it to be, and it is worth every single penny spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchaseda new bottle on 01/19/16 @ 4:30PM CST&lt;br /&gt;My package was at my local FedEx Shipping location @ 8:00AM on 01/21/16. This time, the lotion was packaged inside a plastic container and had bubble wrap in the Amazon Prime box. I was so excited to open the bottle and smell that amazing smell again!! I was very near running out of my first bottle, but I was able to compare the two. The packaging says the lotion is good for 18 months. I can tell you that the color of my bottle bought less than a year ago is a lot darker than the new bottle. It is also thinner. This is after sitting on a countertop in my bathroom for the last 8 months. The end result is the same, regardless of the aging of the product. I went 10-15 shades darker after laying 6 times in my KBL level 4 bed!! I had gotten pretty pale since last tanning about 8 months ago, but I have had minimal redness this year. My skin is dark, bronze, and beautiful!! As for the new bottle of lotion, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the ease of ordering, fast shipping, and the consistency of the product. I see myself using this lotion for years to come. I also plan to try out the Designer Skin Miss Designer and Spellbound lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Luminary worked for me, and I ended up with a beautiful bronze brown color that everyone can&#x27;t stop talking about!! Make your friends jealous! Buy this product!!</li>
    <li> My favorite! I used to love Spellbound but this is AWESOME! Smells great and my skin is super soft! Best Bronzer out there!!!!</li>
    <li> Never have I used a lotion that smells great before and after plus leaves my skin feeling refreshed not sticky after my session. And if course it increases my tan like magic. This is by far my favorite lotion to date!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion. I get a nice, deep, rich tan that women love when I use luminary, even more so than other bronzers. (have used dozens) It has a fresh smell and nice texture to it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying it from this retailer is a steal! It cost $110 at my local salon lol. From the moment I clicked order it only took 3 days to get to my door step and I live in Hawaii. Very impressed!! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to tan for the past two years and I&#x27;d recomend this to anyone! It smells so wonderful before and after using the tanning bed. It does have a shimmer to it but its not that noticable. Designer Skin&#x27;s products are all amazing! I went back in fourth between a few by this brand but Luminary by far is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product smelled great, not even like a tanning lotion. I got very dark after only 3 uses!!! The bronzer really helped me achieve that dark color and the moisturizers help keep my skin hydrated. I This is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Once again, DS does not disappoint. This lotion gets the job done. I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the bad reviews are from people complaining about the bottle... who cares what it looks like if the product works? Weirdos.</li>
    <li> I researched for tanning lotions for fair skin and came across this one. It had really good reviews so I gave it a try. I absolutely LOVE IT! Has a pleasant smell, nice bronzer, and I could see results from the very first use. Definitely recommend for beginning tanners or fair skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty great. It&#x27;s good for all skin colors, can even work on fair skin. It looks very natural not orange. Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth too.</li>
    <li> Having tried every lotion out there I have to say this one is the best. You get a great tan without all of the streaky orange bronzer and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. The real selling point with Luminary is that your tan stays forever! I tan in the Matrix high pressure and when I use Luminary I can go once a week after I get my base tan. As for the bad reviews.....anyone who claims it smelled bad, streaked, flaked off...they clearly didn&#x27;t get the real product. The lotion should be light tan with a slight sparkle, not glitter and the scent is not heavy just a clean smell. I purchase mine through the seller Solarium and it come very fast and shrink wrapped.  The little light up medallion even has the battery saving pull tab in place, not that this is a major selling point. I highly recommend both  Luminary and Solarium.</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time, and i am very happy with thenproduct. I do not tan well, and it works great!  I have presently gone without the lotion or tanning for 5 days, and my tan still looks great, so I know it isn&#x27;t just bronzer.  The scent is very pleasant as well.  There is a slight hint of sparkle on your skin, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone would notice. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> It has a great smell.  The glitter comes off the bottle though... and I can&#x27;t say that I noticed a large difference in my tan.  No buyer&#x27;s remorse based on the price.</li>
    <li> It smells alright, kind of citrusy, wasn&#x27;t a fan of the after tan odor. It contains a lot of cosmetic bronzers that wash off in the shower. I won&#x27;t buy a bottle of it again because I&#x27;m looking for results that last, but if I want I start color for an event ill invest in a packet.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Holds tan longer makes u tan quicker, will buy again, just not from the salon where they charge 3x as much!</li>
    <li> Uhhhhh this tanning lotion is on my bad lotion category. The smell is nice and it&#x27;s 100% authentic because the guy at my tanning salon confirmed it when I asked him *lol* but I don&#x27;t really notice a big difference on my tan when I use it on a level 3 stand up bed or the lay down bed. I&#x27;m 19 and Hispanic so I have a nice tan on me and I started tanning when I was 16 so I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions. I would not purchase this lotion ever again! The best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used that has given me the best color has been a Worship Me by Designer-skin and the best scent on a tanning lotion that also gave me GREATTTT color was Tao by Designer-skin. The scent on this Luminary isn&#x27;t very girly or manly, I myself don&#x27;t care about smelling girly or manly as long as it works but this lotion didn&#x27;t do for me.&lt;br /&gt; I have used over 16 Tanning lotions and this one seriously is on my bottom 5&#x27;s. The shipment was fast and the bottle arrived to my mailbox without a scratch on it, The lotion sorta has a shimmer to it that I love but that&#x27;s about it!&lt;br /&gt; My recommendation is if you want great deep color go for Worship Me (smells like honey no tingle UNISEX) or with my second fav Tao smells AMAZING especially for men! SKIP THIS LOTION!!</li>
    <li> I outages this lotion for my first lotion after doing tuns and tuns of research to which one I should get. The reviews for luminary were so positive and they were not wrong! I&#x27;ve used this lotion now a few days shy of a month and am so pleased with results. Not only did I use this to build my base but it&#x27;s taken me beyond it with no trouble except my legs were being stubborn like most people but are caught up no with help of \\&quot; RUBy\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion, it is good for someone who is starting out with tanning and doesnt want a lot of bronzer and the smell wasnt bad.</li>
    <li> I love his lotion, it helps give your tan an extra little kick. Be sure to wash your hands after, as it will turn them orange. The only thingsI really don&#x27;t like about this product was how strong the scent is, even though it is pleasant, and that there is glitter in the lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have used the Luminary Face lotion in the past and loved the way it made my skin feel. This lotion has a very strong scent, kind of masculine in my opinion... You know it has a lot of bronzers in it because the lotion itself is really dark in color compared to some others I have tried. I like the way it easily moisturized my skim, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but that I can deal with!</li>
    <li> Smell is somewhat decent compared to a lot of other tanning lotions. Still last quite awhile if you apply as directed and not taking a bath in it. Price is decent when comparing to the tanning salons prices. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, I almost bought the same exact thing for $120 at my tanning salon after sampling it and wow what a mistake that would have been, I saved tons of money and received the exact same product.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this lotion in the mail and first off I&#x27;d like to say it shipped 3 days faster than it was supposed to and I think that was awesome!! I&#x27;m very skeptable about buying Tanning lotions online because of fakes etc. So I always buy Sample packs at my salon and when my lotion comes in compare the pack to my amazon lotion. I have to give major credit to Sunless Deals. The lotion bottle was FULL and EXACTLY the same product. AUTHENTIC!! I rated a 4 because i have yet to try the lotion but have heard great things!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product but don&#x27;t like the smell very much.&lt;br /&gt;My husband told me I smelled good when I got home so I guess he likes it but it&#x27;s a bit masculine for me.&lt;br /&gt;Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Very very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t anything different but it does leave your skin soft and it smells good even afterwards. I would recommend it to people who already have a base tan.</li>
    <li> I used this tanning lotion once. I loved the color after tanning and the smell. Later on throughout the day my face broke out. I would recommend trying a sample prior to buying the bottle.</li>
    <li> Designer Skin&#x27;s Luminary is the best of all the tanning lotions out there! I&#x27;ve been tanning for 6 years now and this is by far the greatest color I&#x27;ve ever gotten!! I&#x27;m German and Norwegian descent, which leaves me with pasty white skin (LOL) but Luminary gives me a gorgeous, deep bronze color in just 2-3 sessions in a medium level bed! The smell is light and fresh, doesn&#x27;t have a nasty after-tan stink... Leaves a slight shimmer on your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all! The silicone is a MAJOR moisturizer... Leaving your skin feeling like butter. Hands down, greatest lotion there is!! And Amazon has the best deal on it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Shopolocodeals is the best to buy from! Got my lotion in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion! It&#x27;s worth the price. I haven&#x27;t tried many brands, but once I bought this I never wanted to try another one. Why mess with success!? It smells really good before and AFTER...leaves a very smooth, moisturized feeling to your skin. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m staining my clothes after tanning! Not to mention it gets you DARK, and fast too. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This product made me break out into horrible rashes. I will never never never buy from this company. Bought the product at Salon and it was fine.</li>
    <li> makes me look much darker after one tan, helping me go to the tanning salon less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my salon sells it for $100+ but this is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells great, lasts long!</li>
