      <li>The color is cheery and bright but a little more red than the picture on this site.</li>
      <li>I like that it is a reddish pink, not too bright but not too light either.</li>

      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast.....</li>
      <li>This is pretty remarkable because I spend days swimming in the ocean and usually polish doesn&#x27;t last once the finish gets worn off by sand.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>and so far this color/formula has not chipped or peeled AT ALL!</li>
