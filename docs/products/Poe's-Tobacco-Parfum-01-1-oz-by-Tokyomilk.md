### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great scent!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite wonderful.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>This is a great choice for women who like perfumes that err towards a more \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>I love Tokyo Milk though!</li>
      <li>If you do not like that kind of scent then this is not for you.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a nice glass bottle with a reliable spray pump and like I said, I get compliments when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, rich, sensual, warm and unexpected.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a tobacco-y flower smell.</li>
      <li>I love Tokyo Milk</li>
      <li>Milk has more depth and mystery.</li>
      <li>Sexy.  </li>
      <li>I assumed it would be more tobacco scented, but it&#x27;s kinda powdery.</li>
      <li>This smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love it and would get again.</li>
      <li>Poe&#x27;s Tobacco is one of my all-time favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something darker or mustier or more &amp;</li>
      <li>The Tokyo milk mix really has a very nice scent.</li>
      <li>Very unique.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s very unique.</li>
      <li>Very nice fragrance, received very quickly, packaged very nicely; highly recommend this seller!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm and inviting, kind of sweet, and very earthy.</li>
      <li>This perfume is not overpowering; it quickly fades to a lovely hint of jasmine on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I enjoy wearing it and spraying it on my pillow at night.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous fragrance.</li>
      <li>A fun and unique scent that I will enjoy wearing!</li>
      <li>, sadly it never morphed into something greater.</li>
      <li>While I gravitate to more floral scents (especially rose), this clean, green perfume absolutely trips my trigger.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a unique scent this would be good to try cause the bottle isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
      <li>Definitely a darker one, good for winter/fall.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents and I absolutely recommend buying this.</li>
      <li>The bottle is super cool.</li>
      <li>When I put it on it was strong at first, but did settle out after about 5 minutes of wearing it.</li>
      <li>the design on the bottle is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>It was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m just not crazy about the soap scent for myself.</li>
      <li>I am not completely unhappy with it</li>
      <li>CHARMING AND ALARMING!!</li>
      <li>I will know better next time.</li>
      <li>It is a very different scent and the bottle is cute too.</li>
      <li>used to wear Crushed, which is very green and also awesome smelling</li>
      <li>I would say this is a very floral scent.</li>
      <li>I would say if you&#x27;re looking for a straight up tobacco smell, look else where.</li>
      <li>It might sound strange, but this smells like pretty much any Anthro store I have visited.</li>
      <li>Smells almost completely jasmine on me; I do detect something Autumn-ish in the scent; very comforting and yet sexy at the same time!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the store was out of this particular scent from Tokyo Milk, and the clerk informed me that it was their most popular scent.  </li>
      <li>but I will not purchase this particular sent again.</li>
      <li>It reminded me of the dark and sexy cigar lounges in New Orleans.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I find that Dead Sexy by Tokyo</li>
      <li>when I put it on it still had a a fragrance I could live without.  </li>
      <li>I happened across this perfume when I was looking for a fragrance to go with my new haircut.</li>
      <li>It is very sweet and does not last very long.  </li>
      <li>I suppose I was looking for something a bit more dark, smoky and mysterious.</li>
      <li>It is a very unusual smell that I really have not found in any other perfume.</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty long too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very soap-y smell, almost like Irish Spring bath soap.</li>
      <li>On me, it takes on clean green, fig and gardenia notes up front and mellows to tobacco, incense, leather, and amber.</li>
      <li>I was a little disapointed as it smelled too sweet and</li>
      <li>This product was delivered right away (and even came with other samples).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like Old school Sand and Sable meets White Shoulders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain exactly of what it smells, but I can easily explain the \\&quot;experience\\&quot; of this scent: dark and mysterious.</li>
      <li>If you want a hint of tobacco with a long lasting perfume, I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This scent would work on men and women, in my opinion, and really conveys a sense of dark seduction.</li>

<li> I guess that&#x27;s what I get for not testing perfume before I buy, I was totally intrigued by the name and the artistic description made by the seller, I was super sad that the real smell is close to what I would describe as grandma and stale soap, super sad, but...</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I expected, a little goes a long way.  </li>

<li> I feel weird only giving this three stars.</li>
<li> I guess it is really hard to purchase perfumes on line as you have to go by what people are saying about that product.  </li>
<li> The seller was fantastic but this product is horrible!</li>
<li> but the last bottle smelled like mosquito repellent on me!&lt;br</li>
<li> I was shocked that TM would even make this fragrancE</li>

    <li> I was expecting something a bit different. I suppose I was looking for something a bit more dark, smoky and mysterious. This fragrance to me smells like Jasmine.  It is very sweet and does not last very long.  I am not completely unhappy with it but I will not purchase this particular sent again. I find that Dead Sexy by Tokyo Milk has more depth and mystery.</li>
    <li> Great scent!  Very nice fragrance, received very quickly, packaged very nicely; highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> This product was delivered right away (and even came with other samples). It is a very different scent and the bottle is cute too. If you are looking for a unique scent this would be good to try cause the bottle isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
    <li> I happened across this perfume when I was looking for a fragrance to go with my new haircut. Sexy.  The perfume had deep tones of tobacco leaf, leather, musk, and a hint of magnolias.  It reminded me of the dark and sexy cigar lounges in New Orleans.  Unfortunately, the store was out of this particular scent from Tokyo Milk, and the clerk informed me that it was their most popular scent.  I had to wait two weeks until their next shipment came in.  It was well worth the wait. I get compliments on it from men and women.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous fragrance. I enjoy wearing it and spraying it on my pillow at night. Wonderful, rich, sensual, warm and unexpected. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Poe&#x27;s Tobacco is one of my all-time favorite scents. It&#x27;s hard to explain exactly of what it smells, but I can easily explain the \\&quot;experience\\&quot; of this scent: dark and mysterious. This scent would work on men and women, in my opinion, and really conveys a sense of dark seduction. It&#x27;s quite wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance. While I gravitate to more floral scents (especially rose), this clean, green perfume absolutely trips my trigger. On me, it takes on clean green, fig and gardenia notes up front and mellows to tobacco, incense, leather, and amber. Reminds me of a cigar shop my husband and I frequented while honeymooning in Charleston, SC. It&#x27;s complex and somehow manages to be both modern and nostalgic at the same time.</li>
    <li> This smells fantastic! Smells almost completely jasmine on me; I do detect something Autumn-ish in the scent; very comforting and yet sexy at the same time! This perfume is not overpowering; it quickly fades to a lovely hint of jasmine on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear Crushed, which is very green and also awesome smelling but the last bottle smelled like mosquito repellent on me!&lt;br /&gt;If you like Poe&#x27;s Tobacco, you may also like Skinny Dip from the mix and match collection.</li>
    <li> A fun and unique scent that I will enjoy wearing!</li>
    <li> So musky but feminine. Think grandmas perfume but with a seductive side. Very unique.</li>
    <li> I feel weird only giving this three stars. To me, it makes me smell like dish soap. But I get compliments on the scent. So either other people love dish soap or something is crazy with my nose. It&#x27;s a very soap-y smell, almost like Irish Spring bath soap. I was expecting something darker or mustier or more &amp;#34;man&amp;#34;-ish when I purchased. The bottle is a nice glass bottle with a reliable spray pump and like I said, I get compliments when I wear it. But I&#x27;m just not crazy about the soap scent for myself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!  A SUSPENSEFUL SCENT!!  CHARMING AND ALARMING!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I expected, a little goes a long way.  But I like it and will reorder when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all.  I was a little disapointed as it smelled too sweet and when I put it on it still had a a fragrance I could live without.  I guess it is really hard to purchase perfumes on line as you have to go by what people are saying about that product.  Now I know you can&#x27;t trust reviews either.  I will know better next time.</li>
    <li> I guess that&#x27;s what I get for not testing perfume before I buy, I was totally intrigued by the name and the artistic description made by the seller, I was super sad that the real smell is close to what I would describe as grandma and stale soap, super sad, but... The bottle is super cool.</li>
    <li> This is a great choice for women who like perfumes that err towards a more \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent. It is a very unusual smell that I really have not found in any other perfume. Definitely a darker one, good for winter/fall.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more of a tobacco-y flower smell. Instead it&#x27;s a flowery smell with some tobacco. It doesn&#x27;t smell like cigarettes like people would expect when you say you&#x27;re wearing tobacco perfume. I would say it&#x27;s very unique. It&#x27;s almost like if you smelled a floral tea and tobacco flower at the same time. It lasts pretty long too. Also, the bottle is plastic which threw me off when it arrived. I would say if you&#x27;re looking for a straight up tobacco smell, look else where. If you want a hint of tobacco with a long lasting perfume, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would say this is a very floral scent. If you do not like that kind of scent then this is not for you. When I put it on it was strong at first, but did settle out after about 5 minutes of wearing it. I love it and would get again.</li>
    <li> If you turned Anthropologie into a perfume and bottled it, this is what it would smell like. It might sound strange, but this smells like pretty much any Anthro store I have visited. It&#x27;s warm and inviting, kind of sweet, and very earthy. It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents and I absolutely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> The seller was fantastic but this product is horrible! I love Tokyo Milk but this perfume is so gross and smells nothing like what I thought it would from the description! It&#x27;s like Old school Sand and Sable meets White Shoulders. Ick! I felt like a thousand little old ladies when I sprayed it on me, sadly it never morphed into something greater. I was shocked that TM would even make this fragrancE</li>
    <li> I luved the smell!! the design on the bottle is very pretty.  The Tokyo milk mix really has a very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but not what I was expecting. I assumed it would be more tobacco scented, but it&#x27;s kinda powdery. I love Tokyo Milk though!</li>
