      <li>Every morning as my moisturizer I use Neutrogena SPF 50 with helioplex and even with that kind of protection, also putting on powder spf like brush on block throughout the day, my face was getting burned.  </li>

      <li>I dot not notice a difference with lines, but my scars are doing a lot better.  </li>
      <li>But be sure to moisturize too.  </li>
      <li>I sampled these at Nordstrom, but found a much better price here.  </li>
      <li>and I felt like I needed even more sun protection</li>
      <li>Before you downvote my review ask me some questions if you want to know more about my situation.  </li>
      <li>The Face Peel are my favorite.</li>
      <li>Better than my experience with</li>
      <li>Also, before any of that happens I will apply more sun protection.  </li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>I know that one is supposed to gradually transition to their extra-strength version, but I would have guessed that transition time to be more in terms of months, not days.  </li>
      <li>My skin is looking more even toned...</li>
      <li>Dr. Gross has an excellent line of skincare products.</li>
      <li>My skin did not get any better.  </li>
      <li>Wish they offer better deals, but it&#x27;s still affordable on many levels and works that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
      <li>Really love it.  </li>
      <li>really love this peel</li>
      <li>They do look pretty awesome, and they are very soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ingredients are pretty good too.  </li>
      <li>My skin also seemed to burn more easily.</li>
      <li>This bro duct is great to minimize pimples and keep skin looking clear and healthy.</li>
      <li>This holds true, using it more regularly during the week and avoiding or at best limiting sun exposure and wearing a lot of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I am a huge skeptic when it comes to skincare products; I think most products prey on our vanity and make us buy creams to assuage our skin insecurities.</li>
      <li>This is not a waste of money; it is really worth it for how it makes you more beautiful.</li>
      <li>The acne fighting agent is strong</li>
      <li>My skin feels great right after I use it; fresh, clean, smooth.  </li>
      <li>it was oily and had lots of fine bumps along the forehead</li>
      <li>By then, my nose and forehead will really be smooth.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>I originally saw this product on nordstroms website</li>
      <li>somewhere special</li>
      <li>I offered my mom to try some of mine and she instantly wanted her own box and loved how soft her face turned out.</li>
      <li>Dont use too many times or too much.</li>
      <li>It has made a tremendous difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne</li>
      <li>I know that it production costs can&#x27;t be increasing so rapidly for this product, so why is the price getting hiked up so quickly?  </li>
      <li>A quick swipe with these at night clears it all up.  </li>
      <li>a great product it was recommended by my dermatologist for my hyper pigmentation under my eyes AKA dark circle.</li>
      <li>but the changes did occur after consistently using this product for about 2weeks!</li>
      <li>So, while I must say that while I really liked the idea of this product - and certainly need to bolster my skincare regimen as I near 40 -</li>
      <li>Really smooths your skin so makeup goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I do worry that you get more sun damage if you strip off the layer that naturally protects your skin.</li>
      <li>Everything you use after this product goes on better and sinks in better too.</li>
      <li>I really love the results, smooth skin, smaller cleaner pores.</li>
      <li>It really is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>I did not think this was worth the money.</li>
      <li>face is really soft and glowing though and makes your makeup look a lot better.</li>
      <li>I may begin using it again, sparingly, but thought it might be useful to let others know this reaction is a possibility.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m trying to go with more natural products.</li>
      <li>I feel like I did everything right with the moisturizer and the spf.  </li>
      <li>These pads definitely clean and gently exfoliate the face.  </li>
      <li>it works really well, helps keep pores clean.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned, blond hair, blue eyes, grew up and still live on the beach in So.</li>
      <li>I received a single use alpha beta facial peel sample at Sephora and loved the way it made my skin glow!  </li>
      <li>I noticed, part of the way through the first box, that my skin was softer.  </li>
      <li>I still have the same breakouts and don&#x27;t look any brighter or more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>, I do this peel first.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I love the daily face peels.</li>
      <li>During the rest of the year I only use Somme Institute products, but in the summer I&#x27;ve more skincare issues to deal with.  </li>
      <li>This product however, really works!</li>
      <li>It really is a miracle product when used like every 2-3 days!  </li>
      <li>I used it at directed at night, and the very next day I could feel 3 more zits just below the surface waiting to make an appearance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recommended by a friend who gave me a sample to try.  Really love it.  Not only cleans my face, but smooths it during the night.  No problem with the sun, but I do use sunscreen.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Using for a year or so...second box. One use lasts a few days to a week. Nice before going out. Really smooths your skin so makeup goes on smooth. This did not work well for my friend, it irritaed her skin a little, she uses an acne wash, which also strips off dead skin, perhaps it&#x27;s too much if you use other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it works really well, helps keep pores clean. I do worry that you get more sun damage if you strip off the layer that naturally protects your skin. So cover up in the sun if you use it.</li>
    <li> I received this facial peel (ct. 30 pk) and it has an expiration date on it of 7/2010.  This product is 3 years out dated and it smells old and horrible.  I would never use this on my face.  I am seaching for a why to get my money back, but I refuse to pay postage to return a product that is 3 yrs.  out dated.  So disapointed that any seller on Amazon would do this to a customer.  Buyer beware of this seller!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 years, then stopped and  I don&#x27;t know why... But diffidently going   Back to use it. I love this line and I recommend it to   Any one who has an uneven skin tone and   Need radiance.</li>
    <li> It does seem to even things out a bit, control redness (a bit) and oil (a bit).  I think I broke out a little less, too.  Worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I don&#x27;t like to scrub my skin. It&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all.  It made me break out and I felt like I needed even more sun protection than I could manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased this product upon the recommendation of a coworker.  I did not really have a lot of breakouts except for when I was about to get or was already on my period.  The period zit I could handle about once a month and it went away no problem.  I purchased this product because I had a lot of old acne marks that I was hoping would fade with the usage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately that was not that case and I broke out almost immediately after using.  i used the product at night as directed, went to sleep and already I could feel about 2 or 3 zits just underneath the surface about to form.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I too thought these were just imperfections in my skin being brought out so I continued to use the product.  My skin did not get any better.  My skin also seemed to burn more easily. Every morning as my moisturizer I use Neutrogena SPF 50 with helioplex and even with that kind of protection, also putting on powder spf like brush on block throughout the day, my face was getting burned.  I don&#x27;t consider my skin to be extra sensitive either but I will tell you my skin type is dry.  Because this is a peel I used my heaviest cream moisturizer at night, the one I use specifically in the winter time, and that did not help either.  My face was breaking out, dry, burned, and not glowing like all the other reviews said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I&#x27;d take a break and get back into my normal face routine.  My skin finally cleared, my skin was back to normal.  I thought i&#x27;d give it another try with the remaining towelettes I had.  I didn&#x27;t want the product to be a fluke so i gave it a try again.  I used it at directed at night, and the very next day I could feel 3 more zits just below the surface waiting to make an appearance.  I immediately discontinued use and now I am getting over the3 new zits and will not be using the rest of the towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product simply did not work for me.  Before you downvote my review ask me some questions if you want to know more about my situation.  I feel like I did everything right with the moisturizer and the spf.  I also work an office job and really only am in the sunlight on breaks and on the way back home in my car.  Also, before any of that happens I will apply more sun protection.  (I&#x27;m pretty religious about sun protection as I&#x27;d like to stave off wrinkles as long as possible.)  I just think this product is not for everyone.  If it&#x27;s for you, that is excellent; if not, don&#x27;t worry you&#x27;re not alone.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference, my skin looks the same, discolorations did not go away. I did not have any adverse reaction either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use both steps together every time; I usually cleanse my face and use one step one night and then a couple nights later use the other step. The acne fighting agent is strong so I don&#x27;t think I need it every night or it would be drying but it improved my face almost overnight. it was oily and had lots of fine bumps along the forehead but it looks better now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the towelettes for a few weeks now and I can see a difference in the size of my pours! Not really noticable to anyone else but I can tell!  Also my skin is clearer than it used to be.  I would recommend this to anyone!!  But be sure to moisturize too.  The towelettes can dryout your skin a little.</li>
    <li> Works great but it is very strong and can be a bit abrasive. Dont use too many times or too much. Smoothes skin and evens tone. Didnt make me get acne nor did it cure it. I have mild acne</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m so hyped behind this product! I&#x27;m not sure if its only because if this or nit but the changes did occur after consistently using this product for about 2weeks! My cheeks had darkened areas due to old acne scarring and I promise those areas are lighting up!! My skin is looking more even toned... Just lighter in those areas. I plan to keep it up or the 30 days and ill have to research how often to do the cycle. I originally saw this product on nordstroms website so ill check it out. ;)</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta daily face peel. It has made a tremendous difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> a great product it was recommended by my dermatologist for my hyper pigmentation under my eyes AKA dark circle. My doc told me what to expect and so far the product is working well.</li>
    <li> My son swears by these and says they have made a fantastic difference to his extremely acne prone skin.  Pricy though.</li>
    <li> I have recently just started using them.  I dot not notice a difference with lines, but my scars are doing a lot better.  I will continue to use and see if there is more of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My face is really soft and glowing though and makes your makeup look a lot better.</li>
    <li> This bro duct is great to minimize pimples and keep skin looking clear and healthy. I use them in addition to my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product every other day to allow my skin to adjust to it.  I cannot tell any improvement in the reduction on of brown spots on my face -- in fact, the spots even appear a little darker to me.  I am going to increase usage to once a day, but I will not be purchasing this product again when I finish using all the packets I have.</li>
    <li> During the rest of the year I only use Somme Institute products, but in the summer I&#x27;ve more skincare issues to deal with.  A quick swipe with these at night clears it all up.  The packets are much handier than the jars, because the pads in the jar stick together and are difficult to peel apart.</li>
    <li> I bought two of the 30 packet boxes.  I noticed, part of the way through the first box, that my skin was softer.  It does an excellent job exfoliating but not hurting my skin.  (I have dry sensitive skin and was worried that this would give me chemical burn, but I got a sample from my local Nordstrom to try out and it was no problem.)  I noticed some redness after the product was used but it went away.  The lady at the Nordstrom counter said that if you use this once in a while you will only get the effects of the exfoliation, but to get the whole effect you have to sue it every day.  So not surprising that its called a daily face peel.  After one box was done, I took a good look at my face.  Some lines were noticeably lighter, and I had three sunspots (one on forehead near hairline and one on each cheek) that showed marked improvement.  The one at my hairline was absolutely gone.  The ones on my cheeks are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product I use a circular motion and go over my face then neck then the backs of my hands, then I flip the towelette over and do a second round.  Wait two minutes and then use the second step in the same fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said.... Even though I noticed what was happening with my face, my husband actually commented on how much my hands looked young.  They do look pretty awesome, and they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everyone give this a try.  I offered my mom to try some of mine and she instantly wanted her own box and loved how soft her face turned out.</li>
    <li> Actually, skin feels much smoother.  I use it once a week instead of daily based on an owner of a day spa&#x27;s suggestion of how she uses it.  Would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> If I were on a desert island and could only take one skin care product for my face, I think this would be it! If you haven&#x27;t tried the Daily AB Peel by Dennis Gross yet, you should. It&#x27;s for anyone age 16 and up who can afford it. It has something like 40 different anti aging ingredients in it, no kidding. And it leaves my face glowing and feeling soft. That&#x27;s a nice foundation to begin with before I put anything on! I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for about two years and people started noticing the difference in my skin right away. I find the best pricing on Amazon, of course:) Yes, it is not inexpensive. But I find that by using this I can skip the professional facials---at least most of them. Sometimes a girl just needs a little pampering, ya know?</li>
    <li> I love the daily face peels. They feel awesome and make the skin brighter and more resilient feeling! Tingles a bit, but nothing bad at all!</li>
    <li> Really brought such glow n life to my face. This holds true, using it more regularly during the week and avoiding or at best limiting sun exposure and wearing a lot of sunscreen. The results are truly visible within the week, do follow up with a calming mask, of yoghurt/ cucumber or a non hydroquinone calming/ lightening mask or dr Dennis gross after peel moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dr Michelle cope land pigment formula after the dr Dennis gross mask. It really works well as well during the day use the pigment formula after washing your face, immediately after your bath, let it dry and after 10 mins apply a very high SPF. I use neutrogena. Baby skin SPF 60+. After all after a peel containing AHza one gets baby tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this peel and I&#x27;m gifting my mum the mask and dr Dennis gross youth recovery mask.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent range, I always prefer buying doctor certified skin care ranges such as this.&lt;br /&gt;Really excellent product. Wish they offer better deals, but it&#x27;s still affordable on many levels and works that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin with mild rosacea and persistent hyperpigmentation issues.  This product seemed to get great reviews no matter where I searched, so I gave it a try.  The first three or four times I used it, I loved how my skin felt afterward: silky-smooth and healthy.  After that, though, I felt as though the product stopped working for me.  I know that one is supposed to gradually transition to their extra-strength version, but I would have guessed that transition time to be more in terms of months, not days.  So I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but based on my experiences with the product, I hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It does what it promised. My skin does feel more glowing the next morning.  But my skin is a bit sensitive so I only use it about once every ten days.</li>
    <li> The product is AWESOME...I can&#x27;t say enough about it!  I love it!  It really is a miracle product when used like every 2-3 days!  It evens out your skin tone and helps with acne!  Better than my experience with any other acne or skin tone medications out there (i.e. Pro - Active).  TRY IT - I don&#x27;t think  you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of exfoliating products.  My skin is too sensitive for the ones with harsh scrubby things in them.  I prefer to use acids.  This one is pretty mild, although using it everyday would still be too much for me.  Someone with thicker, more sun damaged skin might be able to use them every day with good results.  I really like that they come in individual packets so they don&#x27;t dry out and last a really long time.  I like that the box comes with an expiration date on it so you know you&#x27;re not getting old product.  My last box took me about a year to go through because I found that once a week was good enough for me.  The ingredients are pretty good too.  I was using DDF 10% glycolic moisturizer which worked great, but I didn&#x27;t like some of the ingredients, I&#x27;m trying to go with more natural products.</li>
    <li> These pads definitely clean and gently exfoliate the face.  My skin is smoother with a reduced appearance of my pores.</li>
    <li> These make my face feel wonderful.  Not sure really does anything for my old age wrinkles but skin does have a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I like it because you can feel the difference in your skin within 2-3 uses. Your skin will feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. Glycolic acid and Retinol are two proven skincare ingredients that are essentially god sent. I think the biggest problem is the application. You&#x27;re stuck scrubbing your face for 10-20 minutes straight with this rather rough pad so unless you have all the time in the world, it&#x27;s not for everyone. Not to mention the packaging makes this product not so eco friendly, but we are faced with the conundrum of Retinol being very fickle when exposed to open air so you win some, you lose some.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product because it seems to work - it eliminates blackheads and reduces sebum (alwful skin oil that causes breakouts).  That being said, the price keeps getting jacked up.  I know that it production costs can&#x27;t be increasing so rapidly for this product, so why is the price getting hiked up so quickly?  Not worth it, if their pricing is unfair.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it is pricy. But it lasts a long time because they are individually wrapped.  I really love the results, smooth skin, smaller cleaner pores. Reduced redness and freckles. It really is worth every penny. I have tried other brands. Philosophy, Brandt, Origins... they all work well, but this is the best... I am fair skinned, blond hair, blue eyes, grew up and still live on the beach in So. California so I see sun on a daily basis. This helps me beat the clock and the damage time and living has caused.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I only use it about once a month per the advice of the girl who I get facials from but I find it to be really good at cleaning up my skin. It doesn&#x27;t sting too much and the redness goes away within a few hours. My skin is sensitive so I knew it would react this way. It is a little pricey but really worth it if you&#x27;re looking to slough away dead skin, etc. It leaves my face looking good--pores smaller, less oil, etc.</li>
    <li> good for both genders. does not dry out drier skin. can use on any skin type. your skin will glow with daily use. i use it only every week or so, and so does my spouse. prevents all sorts of spots or removes them with continued use.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product. They make both this original formula as well as an extra strength. My skin likes this one as it&#x27;s a little more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks like it has a glow after using this product, it&#x27;s unreal! And so soft. It&#x27;s not the cheapest product but it certainly does work wonders. Since a daily treatment isn&#x27;t in the budget for me, I use this 1-2x a week and still find visible results.</li>
    <li> I am a huge skeptic when it comes to skincare products; I think most products prey on our vanity and make us buy creams to assuage our skin insecurities. This product however, really works! I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but whenever I have to go out somewhere special, I do this peel first. I feel it makes my skin finer, smoother, younger looking, taut, and maybe even like 10 lbs lighter! This is not a waste of money; it is really worth it for how it makes you more beautiful. It only takes 3 minutes, then you put your regular makeup on and you have a smooth canvas to work on. Sometimes it works so well, I don&#x27;t even need to use makeup base! Love it. THanks for making a really great product.</li>
    <li> I have freakly big pores on my nose.  This daily face peel actually reduced my pores after 1 use!!  No other facial product has done that.  I use it twice a day and it could NOT be easier to use.  I&#x27;m on my second month and will order another month.  By then, my nose and forehead will really be smooth.  Something that works-- what a concept!</li>
    <li> I used the peel once a day for 3 months and did not notice a difference in my complexion. The dark spots did not start to fade and the blackheads did not go away. The only positive I noticed was that my skin felt softer. I did not think this was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have acne scars (plenty of them) and I saw a slight fade, like a 10%, but they were still there. My pore size didn&#x27;t change but it worked as a slight toner.</li>
    <li> Dr. Gross has an excellent line of skincare products. The Face Peel are my favorite. How great is it to purchase them at a reasonable price, and receive them  in record time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
    <li> I received a single use alpha beta facial peel sample at Sephora and loved the way it made my skin glow!  Since I only use this product 1-2 times per week, I was concerned that the container would dry out.  This product is individually wrapped, so the pads will last months!</li>
    <li> Super great product.  Makes my skin glow and it does not dry it out.  Everything you use after this product goes on better and sinks in better too.</li>
    <li> This product came as a sample from another cosmetic company and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  If my husband notices a brighter glow with use then it must be great.  I have even begun using it on my hands as hands can age a woman.  I do not use it daily but rather twice a week.  I highly recommend this product for people with problem skin, aging skin and dull skin.  It has certainly helped me.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for her. She loves it and I get brownie points so all is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would make my face look brighter and clearer, as I have persistent breakouts, an oily t-zone, and all around unevenness in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much (if any) difference.  My skin feels great right after I use it; fresh, clean, smooth.  It feels like my moisturizer really sinks in.  But that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve noticed.  I still have the same breakouts and don&#x27;t look any brighter or more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  As far as any side effects, it stings a little and makes my face slightly red, but nothing unbearable.  The towelettes I purchased had a chemical smell, but that fades after each use.  I recommend using at night if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.  I&#x27;m bummed it didn&#x27;t work for me after reading all the great reviews, but maybe my skin will react better to it in a couple years.</li>
    <li> I sampled these at Nordstrom, but found a much better price here.  I have very sensitive skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t use these daily myself, but 2-3 times a week works fine.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> So, while I must say that while I really liked the idea of this product - and certainly need to bolster my skincare regimen as I near 40 - I experienced the WORST break-out after about two weeks of use. I cannot remember my skin looking this awful, not even in high school. I&#x27;m still recovering and have ceased use of this product, perhaps it was too much (I was using it daily, most often at night)? Any ideas? Did anyone else experience this reaction, and then skin improved? I was hoping to eradicate my occasional closed comedones, fine lines and uneven skin tone (a bit of melasma post-pregnancy). I may begin using it again, sparingly, but thought it might be useful to let others know this reaction is a possibility.</li>
    <li> Great product. I really love it. Use daily and get a more soft skin. I will purchase it again. Enjoy.</li>
