      <li>This is a great set - everything you need to shine and shape your nails, but the packaging needs improvement.</li>

      <li>It makes putting it in her purse very cute and convenient.</li>
      <li>I NEVER got this kind of shine with those.</li>
      <li>I have a very old case, one which was perfect for my needs, carrying a nail file and a tweezer.  </li>
      <li>but it is still a great, useful purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to keep them looking nice.</li>
      <li>For about $7 + super saver shipping for this set, I feel I got a good deal for my expectations.</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>It lasts longer than all the others, and does a better job.  </li>
      <li>This is okay.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t get it &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>This thing works GREAT and it really makes your nails SHINE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with the results of the Tweezerman file, buff and shine.</li>
      <li>I used this to buff out all the scratches on my kid&#x27;s favorite stuffed animal&#x27;s eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>The case is cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and shiny my nails were!</li>
      <li>googled &#x27;best nail file&#x27; on the interest, and Tweezerman File, Buff and Shine came up multiple times.</li>
      <li>This product is OK, but there&#x27;s nothing special or especially useful here.</li>
      <li>It seems cheaper than others I have had and scratches easily.  </li>
      <li>strong?</li>
      <li>fashion file comes in an attractive blue case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a treat to have great looking nails without using nail polish.</li>
      <li>toenails, I used the file to smooth the surface of the nails on my \\&quot;Fred Flintstone\\&quot; feet.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as the one she used, but it&#x27;s considerably cheaper.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my mom, and she has loved both parts of the set thus far.</li>
      <li>I keep my nails at a medium length, I have long fingers and attractively shaped nails.</li>
      <li>This nail file makes quick work of shortening my nails, and leaves a smooth finish.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take much effort either, just follow the instructions going from dark to light and your nails will turn out perfect.</li>
      <li>Smooths, shines and buffs exceptionally well, but it only lasts like 2 or 3 uses before the sides are well worn</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, I bought this product because I wanted to reach the super saver shipping minimum limit</li>
      <li>I love love love this little buff and shine block.  </li>
      <li>These buffers are easy to use and work very well.</li>
      <li>The file is gentle on nails like mine, so if your nails are very thick....or have deep ridges, you may not be happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Love this buffer - the buffing action increases circulation and fuses  peeling nails together.  </li>
      <li>The glossy finish with this Tweezerman set is comparable with wearing a coat of clear nail polish. :)</li>
      <li>If you want a set that lasts longer, I&#x27;d spend more for an old fashioned buffing set that will run about $15-20 (requires files, cream, suede covered buffer, etc)instead.</li>
      <li>This item was much smaller and it is okay for a nail file but didn&#x27;t meet my need.</li>
      <li>My favorite section on the buffer is the white area (that&#x27;s what makes your nails really shine!).</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to remember which colored side to use first</li>
      <li>(my first buffer had this</li>
      <li>Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too much, because that is the one that really creates the shine!</li>
      <li>The nail file itself is an attractive color shading from lime green to lemon yellow.</li>
      <li>I love to paint my own nails at home, but the nail files I use for everyday snags and rough edges weren&#x27;t doing the trick when I needed to take substantial length off my nails.</li>
      <li>file is really...</li>
      <li>I apply my undercoat, nail polish and the fast drying coat, and my manicure lasts for 10 days to two weeks.</li>
      <li>I was really purchasing this item for the case.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready for another already.</li>
      <li>Helps to let me have long strong nails</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands and none compare.</li>
      <li>I feel that this set will last me about 6 months (I&#x27;m pretty \\&quot;low maintenance\\&quot; with my nails) and is ideal to travel with (is small &amp; lightweight).</li>
      <li>Use the grey side to smooth the nail.</li>
      <li>You use the more rough side to shape the nail and the other smoother side to smooth the edges.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This worked very well, my nails were very very shiny and stayed that way for several days.  </li>
      <li>To avoid drying out the nail, do not smooth and buff more than every two</li>
      <li>I usually find files to take off TOO MUCH of my nail which leaves them even thinner &amp; more prone to breaking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective to say the least.</li>
      <li>She especially likes how the file comes in its own little case.</li>
      <li>Her eyes look brand new.</li>
      <li>It looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear coat.</li>
      <li>The directions enclosed say to &amp;#34;apply gentle back and forth for the buffing motion.</li>
      <li>I feel completely ripped off.</li>
      <li>For the price you cannot i wrong, this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yet, I feel that if your fingernails are like my toenails (more likely you&#x27;re a man or are rough with your hands), you&#x27;ll find that this buffer set may not last very long.</li>
      <li>Light green area to buff and the white to shine.</li>
      <li>At least it was cheap.</li>

<li> Sorry...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this thing. ait&#x27;s perfect for my nails. I used to bite them and clip them off but with this file, buff and &amp; Shine I&#x27;m able to keep them looking nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a treat to have great looking nails without using nail polish. These buffers are easy to use and work very well.</li>
    <li> This is okay. I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and I&#x27;m ready for another already.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail buffer I have ever used.  I have used this brand for years.  It lasts longer than all the others, and does a better job.  Nail file is good too.</li>
    <li> My nails look absolutely great. It didn&#x27;t take much effort either, just follow the instructions going from dark to light and your nails will turn out perfect. It looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear coat. Simply  amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but there&#x27;s nothing special or especially useful here. You might as well just buy some emery boards -- that&#x27;s what you get along with some hype and packaging. At least it was cheap.</li>
    <li> This thing works GREAT and it really makes your nails SHINE.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference these products make! I love to paint my own nails at home, but the nail files I use for everyday snags and rough edges weren&#x27;t doing the trick when I needed to take substantial length off my nails. This nail file makes quick work of shortening my nails, and leaves a smooth finish. The buffer is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and shiny my nails were! I almost didn&#x27;t even want to put nail polish on them!</li>
    <li> I love love love this little buff and shine block.  My nails look great and I don&#x27;t have use polish, which always comes off in a day or two anyway.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes very nice, quality products. This set is no different. I gave it to my mom, and she has loved both parts of the set thus far. She especially likes how the file comes in its own little case. It makes putting it in her purse very cute and convenient.</li>
    <li> I was really purchasing this item for the case.  I have a very old case, one which was perfect for my needs, carrying a nail file and a tweezer.  This item was much smaller and it is okay for a nail file but didn&#x27;t meet my need.</li>
    <li> googled &#x27;best nail file&#x27; on the interest, and Tweezerman File, Buff and Shine came up multiple times. For the price you cannot i wrong, this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always taken care of my nails. I had three children two years apart, and my hands and nails were put to the test! I keep my nails at a medium length, I have long fingers and attractively shaped nails. Filing, buffing and shining my nails have always been part of my repertoire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fashion file comes in an attractive blue case. The nail file itself is an attractive color shading from lime green to lemon yellow. You use the more rough side to shape the nail and the other smoother side to smooth the edges. After the nail is shaped, go to the manicure block. Use the grey side to smooth the nail. Light green area to buff and the white to shine. The directions enclosed say to &amp;#34;apply gentle back and forth for the buffing motion. Use the shine surface as often as desired. To avoid drying out the nail, do not smooth and buff more than every two weeks.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingernails have been filed superbly with this file. I apply my undercoat, nail polish and the fast drying coat, and my manicure lasts for 10 days to two weeks. I am very pleased with this file, buff and shine kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-12-13</li>
    <li> It buffs nails like nothing I&#x27;ve seen before. its become a staple in my tool kit.</li>
    <li> Love this buffer - the buffing action increases circulation and fuses  peeling nails together.  Helps to let me have long strong nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with the results of the Tweezerman file, buff and shine. I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo (click the image below the product description) to show what it will do for your nails. Sorry...the image is a bit blurry, but you can still see how shiny my nails were after treatment.BTW, my nails naturally look like a French Manicure (they are mine...not fake!). The file is gentle on nails like mine, so if your nails are very thick....or have deep ridges, you may not be happy with this product. I usually find files to take off TOO MUCH of my nail which leaves them even thinner &amp; more prone to breaking. My favorite section on the buffer is the white area (that&#x27;s what makes your nails really shine!). I cannot compare this with other buffers (or the old fashioned suede covered style)...I NEVER got this kind of shine with those. The glossy finish with this Tweezerman set is comparable with wearing a coat of clear nail polish. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On toenails, I used the file to smooth the surface of the nails on my \\&quot;Fred Flintstone\\&quot; feet. My nails are VERY thick (absurdly so!) and smoothing the entire surface with the file had to be done to prep the nails for the buffer. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results. Yet, I feel that if your fingernails are like my toenails (more likely you&#x27;re a man or are rough with your hands), you&#x27;ll find that this buffer set may not last very long. Given the price, I&#x27;m happy....but you may not be...you decide. I feel that this set will last me about 6 months (I&#x27;m pretty \\&quot;low maintenance\\&quot; with my nails) and is ideal to travel with (is small &amp; lightweight). If you want a set that lasts longer, I&#x27;d spend more for an old fashioned buffing set that will run about $15-20 (requires files, cream, suede covered buffer, etc)instead. For about $7 + super saver shipping for this set, I feel I got a good deal for my expectations.</li>
    <li> I got this after being accosted at the mall by a buffing kiosk salesperson.  It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as the one she used, but it&#x27;s considerably cheaper.</li>
    <li> This works well, just doesn&#x27;t last long enough!  Also, I ordered 3 and have only received one...difficult to make contact to correct the error and receive the other two.</li>
    <li> This is a great set - everything you need to shine and shape your nails, but the packaging needs improvement. Specifically, the white buffer side stuck to the plastic wrapping, making some of it peel off. Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too much, because that is the one that really creates the shine! I like everything about the set other than that. Just be very careful when taking the wrapper off.</li>
    <li> This worked very well, my nails were very very shiny and stayed that way for several days.  The only reason I am not rating it as a 5 is because I am not sure how long this buffer will last as a whole.  It seems cheaper than others I have had and scratches easily.  But for now, it is serving it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> It would be helpful, at least, to state that this is for someone with very thick nails, as the buffer is so coarse that it literally torn off my nails, even though I applied minimal pressure.  Even after buffing, my nails are literally scratched and look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark side buffer left black smudges all over nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally speaking, this product is a poster child for waste.  Way too much packaging for two small items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  I feel completely ripped off.</li>
    <li> This will do for now, the buff and shine doesn&#x27;t last very long due to the buffing pad starts to peel off. It tends to fall apart.... will have to find another buffer and shine pad.</li>
    <li> Smooths, shines and buffs exceptionally well, but it only lasts like 2 or 3 uses before the sides are well worn away.&lt;br /&gt;Would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> The file, buff and shine works great!!  I have tried many other brands and none compare.</li>
    <li> I used this to buff out all the scratches on my kid&#x27;s favorite stuffed animal&#x27;s eyes. It works great for that purpose. Her eyes look brand new.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the buffer doesn&#x27;t have numbers guiding the use of each side after the other (my first buffer had this so I didn&#x27;t have to remember which colored side to use first etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is really...strong? It&#x27;s effective to say the least. The case is cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I bought this product because I wanted to reach the super saver shipping minimum limit but it is still a great, useful purchase.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this set for doing her nails... I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t get it &#x3D;]</li>
