    <li> The fragrance of Jovan Musk by Coty is not as strong as in the past. I like it better!</li>
    <li> I have used Jovan Musk for the last twenty years and I myself as well as my friends enjoy the smell. Some of my lady friends have asked for the name so they can by for their men.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this size bottle for years. The drugstore that was carrying it locally stopped stocking it, so now I order it online. This is one of a few colognes that don&#x27;t make me sick, literally. The fragrance is mild.</li>
    <li> Jovan Musk is the best. I have used it for several years. Get many complements on the smell. Price was excellent and shipping prompt.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for years. It has a fresh, clean scent. I always get compliments and people asking, &amp;#34;what is that colone you are wearing&amp;#34; ?. A guy&#x27;s cologne for sure.</li>

    <li> I apologize in advance, everyone has their own tastes [ok there is the disclaimer].&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like a ghetto pimp or a horny sailor on shore leave this is the right odor. This stuff smells cheap [well I guess because it is!] Is smells just as bad as I recall in the late 70&#x27;s/early 80&#x27;s when I was a teen putting on way too much stink to attract chicks. About the only ones worse are Old Spice and Brut.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after shave. Price is so so. Found 4oz bottles with much better prices. St ill is better than store bought.</li>
    <li> This was made for men. So I have been told by enough women. And that is why I will always use Jovan Musk.</li>
