      <li>I have really fine hair--I can shower at night,</li>
      <li>This product really gives my hair more volume!</li>
      <li>Sebastian hair product are great, but this shampoo and conditioner simply don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>If you do that, you might as well be buying the cheap drugstore stuff.  </li>
      <li>Looked like someone used the shampoo then replaced it with cheap shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for different types of hair.  </li>
      <li>I switched from Sebastian Light to this.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the great results you get when you use Sebastian products.</li>
      <li>and I feel like this product has reduced that loss significantly.</li>
      <li>It is not a perfumy smell, but a clean smell.</li>
      <li>not this one leave the hair feeling clean everytime.</li>
      <li>This shampooo &amp; conditioner works very well - love the smell, even my husband likes it.</li>
      <li>I cant say enough good things about this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely order this product and many more.</li>
      <li>#34;tired&amp;#34; of products quickly bit</li>
      <li>After my first wash with Penetraitt my boyfriend immediately noticed a huge change and couldn&#x27;t stop running his fingers through it, saying \\&quot;I can never get my fingers through your hair, your hair is so soft!!\\</li>
      <li>This shampoo really makes my hair full and thick and just wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I have frizz and mild to moderate curl that does its own thing.</li>
      <li>Not only does this stuff smell amazing.....</li>
      <li>Everyday my hair gets softer but still manages to keep great volume.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is too harsh for my hair and neither one smells that great compared to anything in s salon.</li>
      <li>Give your hair a good shake and a fluff</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>but this one is worth it.</li>
      <li>OR WHAT YOUR MONEY IS WORTH.</li>
      <li>Lots and lots of suds for just a small amount and smells great</li>
      <li>I use this shampoo along with a root lifter (I use Tigi Catwalk Root Boost or Retro Hair Elevate) and large round brush when blow drying my hair and get great volume.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, flat hair and have tried every volume boosting shampoo &amp; conditioner on the market.  </li>
      <li>It also make it super easy to style because it definitely volumizes your hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Just as pictured-super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Mine had the packing tape around the top too, but I could tell it was still the same product.</li>
      <li>This duo never fails to deliver on every level.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first to try this</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean and soft with added volume.</li>
      <li>I can air dry my hair and wear it wavy without styling :)</li>
      <li>Does not weigh down your hair and great for daily use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Sebastian products since my 20&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t say enough about the great results you get when you use Sebastian products. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great Product for fine hair. Does not weigh down your hair and great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good things about this shampoo.  I recently saw my stylist and she told me (GASP) that I had thin hair.  I had always thought my hair to be thick.  Well its just a lot of thin hair.  This shampoo really makes my hair full and thick and just wonderful.  The shampoo works into a deliciously thick lather which is I think part of this shampoo&#x27;s magic.  Really shampoo your hair with this, just dont slap it on your head and rinse.  If you do that, you might as well be buying the cheap drugstore stuff.  I let my hair air dry to prevent damage but it also works if you&#x27;re blow drying.  You&#x27;ll notice that your hair has a little extra \\&quot;texture\\&quot; to it.  Give your hair a good shake and a fluff and you&#x27;ll really see the benefits of using this shampoo.    I was originally a Nexxus Humectress fan, but when I found this, I&#x27;m not going back.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this stuff smell amazing.....it works really really well. I love what great volume it gives my hair. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite shampoo! I don&#x27;t typically like to spend too much on shampoo but this one is worth it. I received it as a gift and had to buy more and found this deal online. I love the smell! It leaves your hair feeling clean and soft with added volume.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for different types of hair.  My entire family uses it and we have four different types of hair- somewhat coarse with waves, fine with curls, fine straight, and thick straight.  If you can manage ordering enough to get free shipping, than it really is a deal.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I just started using this particular Volupt Shampoo and I like the way it makes my hear feel thicker and stronger. I just love Sebastian products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is too harsh for my hair and neither one smells that great compared to anything in s salon.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Never leave hair weighted down. I have very thin fine hair and it get &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; of products quickly bit not this one leave the hair feeling clean everytime. At the price you get more than twice the product as retail for the sa me price.</li>
    <li> This duo never fails to deliver on every level.  I have very fine, flat hair and have tried every volume boosting shampoo &amp; conditioner on the market.  They work for one or two washes, then I&#x27;m back to square one.  Sebastian duo is the VERY BEST you can get in terms of volume and softness and I&#x27;ll keep buying it forever and ever. :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the product. Great price. Received the product in timely manner. Will definitely order this product and many more. Definitely good experience with online shopping.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal. The amount of shampoo and conditioner was about twice what you receive in other smaller bottles for about half the price per ounce.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo- conditioner combo that does an excellent job with my fine hair. It lifts it and detangles. Love it. The price is excellent for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> This product does up the volume in my hair. But warning, it dried my hair out</li>
    <li> Do you want to have a beautiful hair, This is the right product I am been using this for years  and everybody said how can I have  such a beautiful and fuller hair. Sebastian  with me for over 15 years.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  I like the body it gives my hair.  I transfer some of the product to smaller containers to use in the shower.  Large bottles are heavy and hard to hang on to.  Concerned about dropping on my foot!</li>
    <li> So I purchased this item even though I read a previous buyers comments about the packaging not being as what was pictured and that there was some cheap plastic-wrap wrapped around the tops of the bottles. I thought I would take a chance and hope that I would receive what was pictured, two bottles packaged within the black plastic as shown in the main photo. WRONG! I received two bottles described exactly as another user mentioned and as I described above; the two bottles separate and with plastic wrapping around their tops. I made sure I returned the item before I even made an attempt at using it. Another thing is that the two bottles were in a USPS box that was inside an amazon box. Why the two boxes? That&#x27;s weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO IN MY POINT OF VIEW, THIS SELLER HAS DEFINITELY TAMPERED WITH THE TWO BOTTLES AND YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING WHAT YOU SEE OR WHAT YOUR MONEY IS WORTH.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to try this but, I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Everyday my hair gets softer but still manages to keep great volume. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another brand!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the real shampoo. My hair was so dry after using it-and very tangled. I was disappointed I. This purchase and would not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo and conditioner for sometime now. Lots and lots of suds for just a small amount and smells great</li>
    <li> works well and reasonably priced - especially compared to the salon!  I have curly hair - a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured-super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This product has dried my hair out. In addition, my hair is always tangled after using the conditioner. It takes 3x&#x27;s as long to comb out all of the tangles than most of the other products I have used. I will not buy this grand again.</li>
    <li> This shampooo &amp; conditioner works very well - love the smell, even my husband likes it. It is not a perfumy smell, but a clean smell. Also, you do not need to use a lot. Will definately reorder.</li>
    <li> I switched from Sebastian Light to this. This is my second time ordering hair products from Amazon. I am not totally convinced this is the real product and hasn&#x27;t been tampered with. My hair was extremely stiff and tangled after using it.</li>
    <li> I never understood the benefits of hair products!  I have thin fine hair and thought all volumizing shampoos and conditioners were the same stiff product.  GASP!  I was so wrong.  Try this stuff for at least a month and you&#x27;ll notice that your hair is clean and fluffy (dare I say almost thicker)  Plus, the smell is so fabulous that people comment all the time!  My salon turned me on to this product.  Also, use the Sebastian Spray Gel!  I love my hair now!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazeballs. It also makes my husband&#x27;s amazeballs smell great too!!! I gave it 5 stars ( cuz you cant do half stars)</li>
    <li> love this set! my hair feels really good after the wash</li>
    <li> Great product! Decent delivery time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product was not as shown in picture.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this shampoo and conditioner from the salon, but my stylist stopped carrying it.  I have really fine hair--I can shower at night, wake up in the morning and go to work, when I&#x27;m done with work, my hair is looking a little greasy.  I know this shampoo isn&#x27;t marketed toward oily hair, but I found it really helped control it for me.  It also make it super easy to style because it definitely volumizes your hair.  Love the smell of it too.  Nothing wrong with this product--my favorite shampoo/conditioner combo (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of shampoo and conditioners).</li>
    <li> Everything fine! Thanks</li>
    <li> It was not packaged like the photo. The bottles had scotch tape over the lids and there was no plastic wrappers around it. Looked like someone used the shampoo then replaced it with cheap shampoo.It didnt smell like the real product either.</li>
    <li> So good.It gives great volume to my hair.But the packing is different than as it shows on the pic.</li>
    <li> great shampoo and conditioner combo. I have frizz and mild to moderate curl that does its own thing. This product combo calms a lot of my problems. Price is a bargain compared to retail. I lose a lot of hair with washing and I feel like this product has reduced that loss significantly. Not a attribute that the company promotes but I do believe that it has reduced my hair loss as well as improved its behavior.</li>
    <li> Love Sebastian! It is wonderful shampoo, makes my hair so moisturized and smooth!  I would recommend it to every one!</li>
    <li> Sebastian hair product are great, but this shampoo and conditioner simply don&#x27;t work for me. My hair looks dirty the next day after I wash it. My hair became more dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this experience.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a good price on these two. My hair styles very nicely and has lots of body.  Love the conditioner!  Finally found a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my fine, thin hair even flatter.</li>
    <li> The product is outstanding and the seller has fulfilled expected.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo if you want volume, period. Sebastian also makes a volumizing gel that&#x27;s amazing. I put it on my roots and blowdry upside down. Crazy good.</li>
    <li> I like this...its a pretty good deal but still overpriced. I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner, does not have build up after weeks of using. Only wish it would have come with pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me disapointed after the first month of use, finally succumbed to buying the large format only because the product has worked so well for my crazy curly hair!</li>
    <li> I was nervous to buy from Amazon thinking it might be a counterfeit or altered product-- but it&#x27;s not! I have used this product when purchased from a salon supply store and this is definitely the real deal. I have heavily processed, bleached and colored hair. My hair is well beyond shoulder length and typically air dries very dry, gnarly and frizzy. I was using WEN for a long time but the bottles were running out too quickly with my long hair. This makes my hair extremely lightweight and soft with no frizz! I can air dry my hair and wear it wavy without styling :) After my first wash with Penetraitt my boyfriend immediately noticed a huge change and couldn&#x27;t stop running his fingers through it, saying \\&quot;I can never get my fingers through your hair, your hair is so soft!!\\&quot; Haha both the shampoo and conditioner are AWESOME! Buy it :)</li>
    <li> Volume!  Adds tons of volume!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon with Chaos Beauty fulfilling the order. The product was as pictured and it arrived promptly. I had some leftover shampoo and conditioner that I bought from the Salon and compared it to the product I received and it was the same. I was very excited to find this on Amazon at such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: I have fine blonde hair (but lots of it as my beautician says) and have tried volumizing shampoos in the past because I want to give my hair some lift but they always made my hair staticy - fly away but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t. I also have problems with some shampoos causing my hair to be oily, but I do not have this problem with this shampoo and conditioner. I also love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner. I love, love, love this product! I use this shampoo along with a root lifter (I use Tigi Catwalk Root Boost or Retro Hair Elevate) and large round brush when blow drying my hair and get great volume. I always had weighed down hair in the past that lacked volume but with this shampoo and my root lifter I get lots of compliments on my hair now.</li>
    <li> This product really gives my hair more volume! I use just a little drop so it lasts long! I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my hair.  Will use no other.  If you are a baby-boomer and your hair is beginning to thin, try this.</li>
    <li> Great costs benefit value.  Great product for some and I&#x27;m one of them.</li>
    <li> This is the best thickening/ volumizing shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. For what you pay in the salon, its a great buy! Mine had the packing tape around the top too, but I could tell it was still the same product. From now on though, I will somehow have to make sure it is in the duo packaging like it should be rather than separated and thrown in a box.</li>
    <li> Works great and makes hair looker thicker and shiny.</li>
    <li> I adore Sebastian Volupt, so I was excited to get liters of it for a good price. Excellent deal, but they don&#x27;t come neatly packaged together, as shown in the picture. Mine arrived in a wonky package because they had been rolling all around an oversized box together. Satisfied, but laughing.</li>
