      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>So I love it on other people, but not on myself.</li>
      <li>Smells like pure alcohol very little scent to enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scent is like powerful roses mixed with tacky gross stuff.</li>
      <li>It is not strong or over powering and for the price, I felt it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the  fregrance but it is so weak it only lasts for 10-15 min</li>

<li> I would totally recommend hands down !</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> I can find perfumes and body sprays that I like just as well for less money.</li>
<li> However, at least a little bit of Bella goes a long way, so a bottle lasts a while.</li>
<li> However, it is a little pricey.</li>
<li> Shame on you vendor.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again for this Eau De Parfum and waste of money.</li>
<li> The smell is subtle but stays with you throughout the day.  </li>
<li> I should&#x27;ve known it was a bad decision to buy something before actually smelling it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really bad.  </li>

    <li> I smelled this perfume on a friend one day and absolutely loved it, so I bought it. When I received it in the mail I tried it on and it didn&#x27;t smell anything like it did on my friend. On my friend it had a sweet, young, sophisticated smell, on me it almost smelled cheap...So I love it on other people, but not on myself.</li>
    <li> I love the  fregrance but it is so weak it only lasts for 10-15 min then it&#x27;s gone won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>

    <li> This smells like some cheap old person perfume.  It&#x27;s scent is like powerful roses mixed with tacky gross stuff. Total waste of money. There&#x27;s a reason this perfume isn&#x27;t in stores.  It&#x27;s really bad.  Not worth it, thought I&#x27;d get something cheap to replace a D&amp;G perfume I wanted.  I should&#x27;ve known it was a bad decision to buy something before actually smelling it.  Do not buy this unless your an old grandma or want to buy something to wear to work instead of out having fun.  NOT a young girl&#x27;s perfume!</li>
