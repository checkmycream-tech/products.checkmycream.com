<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sophisticated floral scent, multiple compliments from strangers while I have been shopping, women stop me and ask what it is...... I tell them it is French and my husband bought it for me (the first time)/</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and have been using it for years, and I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on it.  It arrived on time and is a great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it. Please don&#x27;t get ride of this.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a store and loved the scent, but the price was a little high.. I looked on Amazon and found the best deal! I love this product, and I will purchase it again as soon as I run out of it. Buying perfumes online can be challenging, because you can&#x27;t smell the fragrance, but once you know what you want, Amazon offers the best prices.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a wonder smell not flowery but yet soft and it stays on all day. Well worth the price. I have seen the same size bottle in department stores for $80.</li>
    <li> lOVE THE SCENT BUT VERY UNHAPPY.  IT WAS VERY CLEAR THE BOTTLE WAS NOT FULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> 100% AUTHENTIC! Bought it for my mom as a gift and she fell in love with it ! Great price for authentic stuff! Definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Amarige has a beautiful combination of spice and floral notes- I&#x27;ve had many compliments wearing this perfume.  It&#x27;s a truly  delightful, playful yet distinguished scent.</li>
    <li> this is my signature fragrance for years now. love it.  I&#x27;m glad to have such a large bottle so I won&#x27;t run out so quickly. Last bottle was small but still lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume exclusively for over 20 years now. It never gets old I love it so much! This seller has the best price &amp; shipping overall that I have seen yet. I highly recommend this perfume to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like the overwhelming scent offensive perfumes-not too strong but strong enough. I get so many compliments from my customers (I&#x27;m a retail salesperson)</li>
    <li> Survey of family and friends was quite positive about Givenchys&#x27; Amarige&#x27; floral Eau De Toilet spray. We love it&#x27;s delicate notes of Spring. Thanks. Niki</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance for years.  I use several other fragrances and try new ones all the time but nothing gets complements like this one does!</li>
    <li> Excellent as described!</li>
    <li> This has been my perfume for past 20 years. Great price.</li>
    <li> Just what it was expected to be... great... and two ladies said so to me.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, excelent price !!</li>
    <li> Favorite scent and worth the money</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. It arrived perfectly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  Great quality and long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> Compliments from many, many people.</li>
    <li> I wear Amarige by Givenchy almost every day.  It is a light, subtle fragrance. I am on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and she loved it.  The price was great too!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Amazon makes ordering and paying very easy!!!  I will order this product again!!</li>
    <li> Only perfume my wife wears. She loves it and always gets compliments.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Amarige\\&quot; has been one of my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrances for several years now.  I love the subtle smell and definitely passes the elevator test (Did you ever ride in a crowded elevator and some woman&#x27;s perfume is so pungent that you get off on the next floor even if it is ten floors from your destination?).  Well, if that woman had used \\&quot;Amarige\\&quot;, it would have been a pleasant experience and I would get off on the right floor.  This fragrance can be used day or night and comes across as smooth and elegant.  I highly recommend \\&quot;Amarige\\&quot; as a gift or for personal use.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite and happy to find it online for a better price than dept stores!</li>
    <li> Since the packaging looked dubios, I am not sure if this is an original. I am hoping that it is.  It sure smells like it. But i was a little disappointed that it was NOT a perfectly packaged box.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Seller!</li>
    <li> I bought Amarige before and liked it very much.  My husband bought the Eau De Tolette Spray and it is a watered down product and lasts no longer than 1/2 hour on your body and he paid $52 for the perfume.  Very disappointed in this.  I had intended to write and tell you of my disappointment then your email arrived requesting my rating of the perfume.  Can this be returned?</li>
    <li> This is my signature perfume so, of course,  I love it! It is a beautiful, long lasting scent that I always get compliments on! The price for this large 3.3 oz bottle is GREAT. It is 3 times the size of the small bottle my husband usually buys me for about $8 - $10 more...a fantastic deal!!! The bottle arrived on time, packed to avoid breakage. Beyond pleased, again, with my Amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a scent I have used for years.  It is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfumes which I already knew, so it was purchased as part of her Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> Amarige is an old time favorite of mine...It is such a clean smell and also loved by people...I would suggest it be worn at night...it is not heavy, however it is not one of my daytime favs...  It is floral with oriental overtones...  It is one of my many favorites...</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance since it was new to market in early 90&#x27;s.  Still haven&#x27;t found another quite as nice.  Classy fragrance...no sweet, overly flowery or pungent fragrance as many are.  Great gift, even if the gift is for you!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the scent is heavenly.</li>
    <li> we always bought this product, it was good quality for a reasonable price. Either my wife&lt;br /&gt;has become more critical or the perfume more deluted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal. What a great buy.</li>
    <li> The real deal, Smells great and lasts (smell on skin) for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fragrance; but I&#x27;m puzzled by those who describe it as light or subtle.  Unless Givenchy has changed it in some way, the bottle I have is most definitely the strongest fragrance I&#x27;ve ever owned.  You need very, very, little of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it dies down a bit, it is soft and elegant and very feminine.  It is definitely a winter fragrance, though, and more of an evening than a daytime.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it, great buy for large bottle. Wear everyday and get many compliments.  Will look on amazon when I need to buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  I love, love this perfume</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for years.  It seems to stay on my skin longer than others and I enjoy the lasting fragrance on my clothing.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume to my wife on Christmas and she loves it. It is really classy and light so it does not give headache (I am very sensitive to perfumes). It is perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume--always have. Strong, but not offensive at all, very feminine. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite and it turned out to be the same as those I have paid significantly more for in block stores.</li>
    <li> I didnt really like it on me. To be honest, it smells like cat piss on me. HOWEVER, I gave it to my mom who absolutely loves it. It smells soooooo beautiful on her. It is a great buy for someone who loves vintage perfumes.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. was a very nice birthday gift. She made it easy though for she specifically asked for it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance myself since the early 90&#x27;s myself. It was a gift from my husband at first, and purchased at Macys at the time. Over the years I continued to purchase from dept. stores. I received many compliments on it.  I have purchased the past few years from Amazon and have not found any difference in the packaging or the quality of the product itself. I there is more than the eau du toilette , which would be a stronger, more concentrated perfume.   I believe there used to be an a stronger perfume of the same scent also , not just the lighter eau de toilette.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for years.  It is a soft floral/ spicy/ sexy fragrance.  It&#x27;s one that I am always asked what I am wearing, and complimented on the scent.  I like that :)  Men and women both have commented on it when worn.  It is long staying, more so when it is layered with the shower gel. It never seems to go out of style.  If you want to be noticed, get some compliments &amp; a &amp;#34;Feel Good&amp;#34;, go for it!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and it is potent. Lasts all fay long.</li>
    <li> Love it love it ..my favorite one ..enjoy yourself with this one . I encourage every woman to buy it</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to get this hard to find fragrance that I have loved for years. I still get comments from strangers asking what perfume I am wearing. Amazon always ships and packages purchases so well.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!  The bottle came packaged well and it was full to the top!  Since perfume is an expensive purchase, this is important to me.  Shipping was quick.  VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this perfume and it&#x27;s been a yearly purchase for Christmas. Amazon always seems to have the best price for it.</li>
    <li> Smells good on my wife!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years.  This one was a fake.  The bottle isn&#x27;t even right.  Givenchy is in the glass on the bottom of the real cologne.  The sprayer was different and the Gold around it was rough not smooth.</li>
    <li> oldie but mmm mmmm goodie love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the smell and will not use anything else.  Nothing else to say . Great Smell.  No more.</li>
    <li> Have loved this fragrance for years.  I am a Givenchy fan.</li>
    <li> MY wife loves this perfume... all time favorite for both her and I. I had not bought this for her in many years and now she is loving it even more because it reminds her of when we were young kids together (been together for 18 years now). I love this scent on her. Original product. Came perfectly packaged and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I have been using Givenchy Amarige for years and it&#x27;s the only Eau De Toilette I use. The fragrance is smooth and last all day long. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve received over the years. As long as Givenchy continues to make Amarige it will remain my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance since I lived in Italy at the age of 15. It is a timeless fragrance that leaves a lasting memory.  The smell is soft, but lingers. It smells divine. My husband tells me this is a perfume that was meant for me.  Highly recommended.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Get compliments everywhere I go. I Love it. But found it for a few bucks less at Costco.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  This is not the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; potency but the &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; potency, meaning you will have to reapply more often. (Noticed many complaints about the lasting power of the scent - there is a difference between the two people!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute favorite perfume, I&#x27;ve been wearing it since 1993. Every time I wear the scent, I get stopped by people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing. My mom also wears it from time to time and it smells completely different on her. I don&#x27;t understand how some people are saying the scent no longer smells the same, I&#x27;ve worn it for over twenty years and it smells exactly the way it did back in the early 90&#x27;s. The best part, it&#x27;s way cheaper here on Amazon than any other place so it&#x27;s well worth the purchase.  Just don&#x27;t buy the bottle with a stopper if you have young kids or you&#x27;ll be buying it more often - it&#x27;s super easy to knock over!</li>
    <li> One of Mother&#x27;s favorites.</li>
    <li> This was just such a convenient way to get Christmas shopping done!  All products worked and in good condition.  So nice to do in the comfort of your own home and have the items show up on your doorstep.  Not even counting how much gas that I saved.</li>
    <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. we have purchased it on eBay and all we got was bad smelling knockoffs. she is not disappoin ted in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the scent - just right for her</li>
    <li> Amarige has been my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; for the pat 8-10 years. ANYTIME I wear this fragrance, I get compliments. The scent is so difficult to describe. It has a distinctive scent and lasts all day. When you put it on, you feel like a million bucks and smell like a million bucks too! I am a nurse and although this scent is somewhat \\&quot;strong\\&quot;, my patients love it! A little bit goes a long way. If they ever discontinued this fragrance, I would have to be put in a looney bin, that is how much I love this scent. It is a sophisticated, elegant, and alluring scent. Definitely not for a \\&quot;tween\\&quot;, but for an elegant lady.</li>
    <li> I get compliments about how well I smell all the time.  This is the best perfume ever.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift and my sister loved the fragrance.  I will purchase again.  Thanks for the quick response.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. She loves this perfume</li>
    <li> I love my Amarige, it was a perfect gift for myself.I got in really quick and no problems. It was packed very good.</li>
    <li> And has too much sweet vanilla after scent..  Not the Givenchy classic scents of other products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Have gotten this brand for years and this is an excellent price with fast service. I would definitely use again in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my product. I enjoy wearing. It was at a good price. It arrived on a timely manner.</li>
    <li> always complimented on this perfume and i like that it stays with me through out the day. Nice big bottle!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for 10 years, and still love it.  Neiman&#x27;s won&#x27;t carry it, not lofty enough, but I love it.</li>
    <li> I had seen some posts about ordering perfume online it not smelling fresh.  I took a chance as it is hard to find Amarige in the stores and it is my favorite.  Someone told me they are discontinuing it so I looked for a long time for it and for the best price. Amazon had it and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is, I love this!!! Lovely fragrance that lasts. Only need to use a little at a time!</li>
    <li> Exactly what the wife was expecting.  Great product, price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume everyone raves about it on me.</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite fragrances and at a great price!!!!  I think I saved almost 40$!!  No cost for shipping, the whole deal was a steal : )</li>
    <li> This item is a cheap knockoff.  It smells completely different, and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.  Do not let anyone fool you, it is not the same product.  If you want the real deal, Macy&#x27;s started carrying it again - that is the real stuff.  Very disappointing, when I tried to return it I was told it was the real product so I hung on to it thinking I must have been wrong, but I was not.  The bottle was printed crooked, the bottle is a slightly different shape, and the label is printed Givenchy instead of de Givenchy like the real product - maybe that should have been my first clue...</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for over 20 years and people still stop and ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s one that when I wear it that my husband says I smell good!</li>
    <li> I bought this on amazon because it is so much more expensive in the department store.  I always use Amarige and was really happy to find it on Amazon.  I smells like the one I bought from the department store.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and it&#x27;s enough I think. Please your wife and be happy!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described.  In time for gift-giving.  Great price.  Mother-in-law was &amp;#34;surprised&amp;#34;.  A timeless, classic perfume.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It is a very good perfume. Thank you</li>
    <li> One of my two favorite perfumes.  I have been using t his for years and am glad that I can order from Amazon</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last. I think it&#x27;s a knockoff....&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend buying cologne this way.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product...don&#x27;t waste your money...buy from a reputable dealer....</li>
    <li> Good service and a good product</li>
    <li> Someone told me that when you buy at this price, that they water it down?  This is my favorite.  I don&#x27;t know why that they don&#x27;t promote this product more in the Department Stores.  I am stopped all the time, by people asking what are I wearing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and reliable delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this company. The products are precisely described.</li>
    <li> This was purchased along with jewelry for my wife at Christmas.  All she had was a small test sample of the perfume and she stated she really like it.  Surprise!!  She loves both gifts.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift.  hope they like..</li>
    <li> I had no idea what this would smell like when I ordered it, but have liked Givenchy before.  I was thrilled when it arrived.  Neither overpowering nor underwhelming, and not too young without smelling like an old lady.  Definitely one of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
    <li> love this classic that never get old fashion</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this parfume on a regular basis.  It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> For my mom&#x27;s birthday- she is on a limited income but it is her favorite and was stunned to receive it as it is expensive in stores.  This was a deal,  Wonderful, light scent!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my girl friend. I&#x27;d recommend it to guys who&#x27;re looking for getting a nice perfume for their spouses.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent and I always get asked....by men...what it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since high school. Absolutely love this fragrance for men and women</li>

    <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite scent so I was overjoyed to find it on Amazon in time for Christmas.  Now, I ordered this for my father who gives my mother this perfume every year, she loves it that much.  I am always thrilled with everything that I order and this was no exception.  If you really want to make a loved one happy for the holidays, this is the scent to get.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. My only complaint is I have to reapply it after a few hours. It is not long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and I love the cologne too.</li>
    <li> Great value...beats department stores</li>
    <li> I had a gift certificate for Amazon, and I was running low of my favorite perfume.  The shipping was quick, and it was easy to process the order.</li>

    <li> gotta love this product.</li>
    <li> My grandmother always wore this and now I&#x27;ve chosen it as my signature scent. Sophisticated and sexy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife. Her is her take on the product:  If you&#x27;ve never purchased this product, you&#x27;re probably satisfied.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed the fragrance, Amarige by Givenchy, for many years and previously purchased it through Macy&#x27;s or other major department stores. Because of the price, I purchased it through Amazon and...what a mistake!  It&#x27;s definitely not the same AND it cannot be returned. Better to pay more and receive the original product.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and thespeedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I loved the price and the perfume was just like I had gotten it from a major Department Store.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  Its an old fragrance that will live on.  Very spicy, great for any occassion, and the scent will last all day.</li>
    <li> Happy with the perfume and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was expecting and the price was great. I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product in stores for years and this was identical to my previous purchases.  I&#x27;ll continue to order from Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than we have found it other places. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and was very happy with the quick shipping..</li>
    <li> Thas item was a gift so I can not rate it. much more economicalthan if purchased local. It does smell good.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for!  Much better deal on Amazon then in department stores, and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> this was a gift from a boyfriend.  Very sensual fragrance, deep undertones of musk, yet sweet and sensual.</li>
    <li> I just love the fragrance of Amarige. I always get compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Even when I think the fragrance is gone, people still ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This is fake perfume! First of who ever believed this is real I want you to check the logo the AMARIGE real logo should be on the top of AMARIGE not in the bottom. It says in the box that the ingredients is Alcohol, Aqua water, Benzyl salicylate, ethylhexyl, methoxycinnamate, linalool, farnesol, coumarin, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, ethylhexyl, salicylate,hydroxycitronellal, bht, benzyl benzoate, eugenol, isoeugenol, methyl 2-octy-noate, geraniol,limonene, CI 19140(yellow5) CI 14700 ( red4) .05745M.&lt;br /&gt;It says in here that the ingredients: Note: Neroli,Mandarin,Violet leaves,Rosewood,Gardenia,Red fruits,Ylang-Ylang,Acacia Farnesiana,Tonka Bean,Woods,Ambergris. I wish amazon will check this product this is fake and let them customer to believed this is real and not fake. I am just curious because I just received my order an hour ago and when I tried it after at least 30 minutes the smells goes away come on now this is fake its too bad I can&#x27;t return the product.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume for my Wife!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Great price for the ounce amount</li>
    <li> All went Well and my friend loved it.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with other reviews citing that this is NOT the original Amarige. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all, just until I get out of the house. What a waste of money and I&#x27;m so disappointed. Next time will buy at Dilliards where I know I&#x27;m getting the real thing. No stars from me!</li>
    <li> good quality perfume with a lovely scent.  It isn&#x27;t too overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze!  Many fragrances bother my alergies, but this one is great.</li>
    <li> This perfume is extremely exquisite its smell is too provocative and charming. The best I&#x27;ve smelled.// Este perfume es sumamente esquisito su olor es demasiado provocador y encantador. El mejor que he olido.</li>
    <li> I plan to make another purchase soon.</li>
    <li> Great price and the item arrived quickly. wife was very happy. Beats going to the mall.</li>
    <li> Good reduced price on Amazon vs retail stores!&lt;br /&gt;Smells elegant and sexy, but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;Best perfume I have ever bought a significant other.</li>
    <li> Not the same perfume I remember buying years ago. Fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t even last.</li>
    <li> i lvoed it, I got it fast, its well pakaged and I adore this scent, always get stopped and asked what I am wearing! :)</li>
    <li> love  this perfume been wearing since i was in my 20 s now in my late 30s i still love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes i would recommend</li>
    <li> I have purchased these a few times on amazon and it has been great expect Amazon must have changed the company it purchases its fragrances as this was a cheap knock-off version of the actual eau de toilette. I cannot risk purchases these anymore through Amazon as the customer service rep could not even disclose the manufacture of these fragrances. I am back to buying Amariage on Macy&#x27;s even if it cost more money... at least i know it is the authentic brans.</li>
    <li> Smells great on my lady!</li>
    <li> I suffer from migraine and this perfume is the only type I can wear that does not trigger my migraine. Plus everyone compliments me when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is my wifes favorite perfume got it for her for Christmas no hassle shopping just get it in the mail instead how easy is that and the price was right.</li>
    <li> It was awesome my mother loves it and it smells great</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances on earth. Been wearing this since it was &amp;#34;born&amp;#34; 20+ yrs ago. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother&#x27;s birthday since she was running out and she loves it! The price is amazing too.</li>
    <li> Smell like spring time and romance… this is such a refreshing aroma and lasts at least 3 hours at a time depending on how much you use.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my daughter.  She loves it.  Fast delivery.  Perfect, new condition.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this gorgeous Amarige toilette spray for anyone.</li>
    <li> Half price of Dillard&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Shopped around and Amazon had the best price by FAR! Got it for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loves it! The scent is not over powering as some others are.</li>
    <li> Have worn this fragrance and always receive many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Amarige for 15 years. It is my signature scent. I always get compliments. It just smells great.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite.  I have been wearing it for years and still get compliments by men and women.  It was a great price and was delivered quickly.  It is amazing!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this one for years.  So glad that it still works for me.  Such a light scent, perfect.</li>
    <li> I have worn Amarige for over 10 years and was excited to find it on Amazon at such a great price.  Unfortunately, all that excitement went right out of the window with the first spray.  This smells nothing like Amarige!  Nor did the fragrance last any time after application, like the real Amarige.  This turned out to be a blessing as the perfume smelt so bad.  Totally disappointed, not to mention out $50 since it cannot be returned.  Ya know the old saying...if it seems like it&#x27;s too good to be true, it usually is.  This is definitely the case here.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature perfume, and she gets lots of compliments for wearing it. It is an ideal gift for her for any occasion.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent and Amazon has the best price as usual.</li>
    <li> Appears and smells like the real deal.</li>
    <li> this product Im using for 13 years&lt;br /&gt;This is excelent for my skinI will be purchesing this product for ever</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the original perfume that I brought for my wife before. I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> just received this just as I have said before the price is great for a product I have ordered from many other venders</li>
    <li> Does not have the scent of the original perfume</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend (I didn&#x27;t know she had just purchased the &#x27;same&#x27; perfume from the department store).  There is definitely a difference!  The department store version definitely lasts longer and smells better.  The version purchased from Amazon does not last as long or smell as strong.  Very disappointed!  If Amazon is NOT selling the authentic version, then it should be noted!</li>
    <li> The product is a knock off. It has a faint smell of the actual perfume. It is not the real Givenchy Amarige. Next time I will purchase from a retail store so I can be certain the product is authentic.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years and always get complimented on it&#x27;s great aroma - will re-order when I am out. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just love this perfume!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent 15 years ago and tis is the best price i can find. Thank you for making it affordable for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent Price and always delivered hassle free</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> good price and smells great.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Amarige and it smells wonderful on her.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this over 20 years ago and is still my favorite!!</li>
    <li> my wife used to buy this at EPCOT where she first discovered it.  I don&#x27;t which she loves more, this perfume or Disney.  Probably a draw.  I enjoy the scent as well and a better deal here than at EPCOT!</li>
    <li> Greatest perfume ever. Light floral scent. I get rave reviews from complete strangers frequently. My favorite was from one of the neighbor kids. She said when I had just spritzed on my way out the door, &amp;#34;Mmm, Mrs. M that smells like you. You have to always wear that.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent for a long time.  Was pleased to be able to get it on-line, with no shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Great price. Quick shipping. Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my purchase</li>
    <li> This material was not the same.  Compared what the original fragrance was and this: 1) fragrance was completely different, 2) color was different, and 3) did not spray as original.  Would not purchase again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> giving it as a gift - it is her favorite (did find it elsewhere for cheaper)</li>
    <li> Very floral  with a hint of musk . Surprisingly fresh and long lasting .</li>
    <li> This scent has been around for years and years but I still love it!</li>
    <li> Great delivery. I bought this item for someone else but she always buys this perfume and she loves it..</li>
    <li> My mom loves it.  What more can you say?!</li>
</ol>
