      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it , it does the job very well</li>
      <li>Stay safe CCDL carry on my friends</li>
      <li>A hone blade would be much better</li>
      <li>I love, love it.</li>
      <li>Not the top of the line product</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The build quality looks top notch</li>
      <li>Love this Razor I have a great Dovo straight</li>
      <li>First straight razor and I am impressed.</li>
      <li>Im sure the plastic would be fine, but having all metal looks better and is more comforting.</li>
      <li>I have a neatly groomed beard and keep my cheeks and neck very clean.</li>
      <li>This is a great shavette for professional barbers in NYS.</li>
      <li>The plastic razor holders hold your replaceable blades snug and make it easy to sterilize in-between customers.</li>
      <li>I had a box of Shark Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades and this razor fits them perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This razor is an excellent value given the nice quality and has a decent balance although a little more weight might be cool but having never tried a straight edge, this one was great.</li>
      <li>It has a plastic holder that the blades fit into that holds them and is easy to change.</li>
      <li>This is my first straight razor device and it seems to be a great way to learn.</li>
      <li>but for now while I am learning, with the grain is just fine.</li>
      <li>, I had heard that the shavette&#x27;s were a bit on the light side</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>Although I am sure that I will eventually look at better quality straight razors, this one satisfies for now and it is an inexpensive introduction and has the advantage of disposable blades.</li>
      <li>I do think a true straight razor would do better mostly because of the weight.</li>
      <li>but this is good for travel or when I dont have enough time for my routine</li>
      <li>and i guess thats true compared to a full blade</li>
      <li>But this is convenient and cool.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, well balanced, and a good replacement option for a conventional blade razor.</li>
      <li>No nicks on my first shave and what a smooth finish it can accomplish.</li>
      <li>By the fourth and fifth shaves, I feel very confident using it.</li>
      <li>This shavette is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
      <li>Overall I think if you&#x27;re insterest in straight razor shaving this is a good way to start.</li>
      <li>I started fresh out of a steamy shower by applying beard oil, then Kiss My Face shaving cream and that was it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>worth your money</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed with the straight edge is that you can cut a line so clean that it looks like a friggin laser beam did it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and the Derby blades are only about $.05</li>
      <li>The first time i used it a cut my self two or three time</li>
      <li>After you get the &amp;#34;hang of the thing&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be able to use a blade without a guard and if you order the other carriers available for the Dovo you&#x27;ll be able to shave with a variety of different blades available locally.</li>
      <li>Nicked myself pretty good on the first shave (first time in 15yrs!), took it a bit slower and more careful on the second and third shave.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite straight razor, my husband purchase as a gift after calling around to local barbers for research.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I have EVER shaved with a straight edge or anything besides a cartridge</li>
      <li>Have had other straight razors, but haven&#x27;t liked any of them.</li>
      <li>This is really a 5 star rating but if you are like me, you read the one star ratings first, so I figured I would save you some time.</li>
      <li>Blades are easy to change and can use different size blades.</li>
      <li>First day i received it it cut way better than any other straight razor</li>
      <li>I get a very close shave every time.</li>
      <li>I eventually might do the whole three pass method (with the grain, across and against)</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>but thats why I went with the stainless steel version</li>
      <li>The razor is comfortable in the hand, it takes the longer razors and short.</li>
      <li>with my little to no experience, I guess I wouldn&#x27;t know, but I would think that this is a very easy product to learn how to straight razor shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m brand new to straight shaving, so</li>
      <li>In addition, they included 2 double edged blades already split in half and 2 more longer blades if you are feeling lucky.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this razor if you are thinking of switching to straight razor or replacing your old straight razor.</li>
      <li>Not a bad single blade straight edge.</li>
      <li>This thing is super light and its hard to really gauge how much pressure you need to get a proper shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time straight blade user and I have to say I have read a ton of reviews about all the other straight blades</li>
      <li>It is easy to learn how to use it, just with a little practice and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
      <li>It has little disposable razors that fit into the handle.</li>
      <li>You can even shave the back of the neck like a straight razor</li>
      <li>The stainless steel body is definitely durable.</li>
      <li>some German is laughing the whole way to the bank selling these.</li>
      <li>I recommend Derby Professional</li>
      <li>I alternate the Dovo with a Parker straight razor.  </li>
      <li>The razor itself is fairly well made but as I&#x27;ve read online the blade holder is a bit difficult to work with.  </li>
      <li>It was fairly easy to put in the first time but hard to get back out.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it not only came with the coveted red insert</li>
      <li>B001GMTKCK Dovo Stainless Steel blade BLACK Handle Shavette Straight Razor Replaceable Blade]]</li>

      <li>In addition to the unbelievable precision, I also was blown away by how smooth my skin was with only one pass (with the grain)!</li>
      <li>I believe you should let the razor do the work and not really push or apply much pressure, but some pressure is required for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>got the Stainless version after reading other reviews about the plastic handled one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a regular Dovo straight razor in the past and had trouble getting a smooth shave out of it even with a hone and strop.  </li>
      <li>This is a little razor that resembles a straight razor.</li>

    <li> This is really a 5 star rating but if you are like me, you read the one star ratings first, so I figured I would save you some time. This razor is an excellent value given the nice quality and has a decent balance although a little more weight might be cool but having never tried a straight edge, this one was great. First of all, it not only came with the coveted red insert but they also sent 2 other inserts for longer blades. In addition, they included 2 double edged blades already split in half and 2 more longer blades if you are feeling lucky. This was the first time I have EVER shaved with a straight edge or anything besides a cartridge so I am truly a newby. I have a neatly groomed beard and keep my cheeks and neck very clean. My biggest complaint with a cartridge (Mach 5) is that you can&#x27;t see the line you are cutting because the cartridge is blocking your view. The first thing I noticed with the straight edge is that you can cut a line so clean that it looks like a friggin laser beam did it. In addition to the unbelievable precision, I also was blown away by how smooth my skin was with only one pass (with the grain)! I eventually might do the whole three pass method (with the grain, across and against) but for now while I am learning, with the grain is just fine. I started fresh out of a steamy shower by applying beard oil, then Kiss My Face shaving cream and that was it. I used small strokes and immediately felt when the blade was working. I also worked on small areas as to not allow my shaving cream to dry on my face. My barber told me that&#x27;s where the cuts and irritation can happen so keep it wet and slick. Take your time and enjoy the best shave ever!</li>
    <li> Thought the price ($40) was kind of steep...especially once I received it. Might be $2 in materials, labor, and packaging. Anywho, I snapped a standard size DE feather blade in half and got to it. Nicked myself pretty good on the first shave (first time in 15yrs!), took it a bit slower and more careful on the second and third shave. By the fourth and fifth shaves, I feel very confident using it. I am very happy with the quality of the product and the usefulness as well. It would&#x27;ve gotten five stars but geez...some German is laughing the whole way to the bank selling these.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor I have a great Dovo straight but this is good for travel or when I dont have enough time for my routine, I had heard that the shavette&#x27;s were a bit on the light side and i guess thats true compared to a full blade but thats why I went with the stainless steel version, I do how ever thing I&#x27;ll buy the green insert for a longer blade but thats my fault for not thinking ahead, oh well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I shave my head. This is a little razor that resembles a straight razor. You can even shave the back of the neck like a straight razor but it is not a replacement for one. Straight razors are always the best. But this is convenient and cool. It has little disposable razors that fit into the handle. You can shave the hard to get spots like behind the ears or wherever. But it is all in all a good product. Comes in different styles and colors too.</li>
    <li> I have been using electrics for years, but have been sporting a goatee for several months now.  Trimming it precisely has been a problem, so I started looking at straight razors and found out they were expensive!  This one cut right through tough chin hair like a breeze and the learning curve is short enough that I only nicked myself once.  Although I am sure that I will eventually look at better quality straight razors, this one satisfies for now and it is an inexpensive introduction and has the advantage of disposable blades.</li>
    <li> First day i received it it cut way better than any other straight razor and it came with 3 blades allready. It is easy to learn how to use it, just with a little practice and you&#x27;ll be set. The first time i used it a cut my self two or three time but then I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a regular Dovo straight razor in the past and had trouble getting a smooth shave out of it even with a hone and strop.  I decided to try out the disposable kind to see that how would work out and so I wouldn&#x27;t have to sharpen the blade.  The razor itself is fairly well made but as I&#x27;ve read online the blade holder is a bit difficult to work with.  You have to pull it out, put the blade between 2 pieces of plastic, then slide it back in to use it.  It was fairly easy to put in the first time but hard to get back out.  The blade that came with this was a Merkur which I understand is a noteable brand but it did cut up my face quite a bit.  This could be due to bad technique or since it was the first shave with it, I&#x27;m not sure.  I can always try out other blades which is another plus of the disposable version.  Overall I think if you&#x27;re insterest in straight razor shaving this is a good way to start.</li>
    <li> Husbank likes it, but hand is a bit shaky to use!  good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time straight blade user and I have to say I have read a ton of reviews about all the other straight blades this one looked good I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m happy with it , it does the job very well I get a very close shave every time. It comes with four blades I have shaved four times with the same blade, and it&#x27;s still surgically sharp. I have nothing bad to say about this straight blade it&#x27;s light and I didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money for that I gave it 5 stars it&#x27;s worth it. Stay safe CCDL carry on my friends</li>
    <li> First straight razor and I am impressed. No nicks on my first shave and what a smooth finish it can accomplish. I do think a true straight razor would do better mostly because of the weight.

Mine came with 3 blade holders and I know what the large black one and red one are for but the other black one with a comb like edge is unknown to me. I guess it may be for thinning out or something....?</li>
    <li> This is my first straight razor device and it seems to be a great way to learn. It&#x27;s very light and the Derby blades are only about $.05 each. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite straight razor, my husband purchase as a gift after calling around to local barbers for research. I love, love it. Blades are easy to change and can use different size blades. Have had other straight razors, but haven&#x27;t liked any of them. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
    <li> This shavette is exactly what I wanted!  I&#x27;m brand new to straight shaving, so with my little to no experience, I guess I wouldn&#x27;t know, but I would think that this is a very easy product to learn how to straight razor shave. I&#x27;d say it took me about 2 precarious shaves, two cuts, and about 3 nicks before I got to hang of it. Faster learning curve than I expected, and I think it&#x27;s b/c of the razor blade holder, it almost acts as a guide for you to get the correct angle on your blade for your cut. Hope that makes sense. Only thing I can say that I don&#x27;t like is that it came with some replacement blades. One blade type was about 2\\&quot; and another type was about 3\\&quot; long. Where can I get the 3\\&quot; blades? No name on them or anything?  I want more of them but I don&#x27;t can&#x27;t find them... That&#x27;s my only complaint.  I look forward to shaving again!</li>
    <li> I alternate the Dovo with a Parker straight razor.  The razor comes with a couple of carriers for the blade and one of them has a safety razor guard on it which means that it is virtually impossible to cut yourself while you are learning how to hold a straight razor.  That isn&#x27;t to say there won&#x27;t be blood but you&#x27;re not likely to have to go to the ER when you do nick yourself - and you will nick yourself.  After you get the &amp;#34;hang of the thing&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be able to use a blade without a guard and if you order the other carriers available for the Dovo you&#x27;ll be able to shave with a variety of different blades available locally.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I gave it a 4 just because of having to take it apart and dry it which is time consuming. The razor is comfortable in the hand, it takes the longer razors and short. I have to recommend this product. Great price, great deal.</li>
    <li> I had a different razor but the fact that when I changed blades it would have some surface rust always worried me.  Not with this razor! It has a plastic holder that the blades fit into that holds them and is easy to change. I had a box of Shark Super Stainless Straight Edge Barber Razor Blades and this razor fits them perfectly.  I highly recommend this razor if you are thinking of switching to straight razor or replacing your old straight razor.</li>
    <li> I use this shaving razor to line my facial hair. does great work. and ive used to to shave before no complains at all. worth your money</li>
    <li> This is a great shavette for professional barbers in NYS. It is easy to use, well balanced, and a good replacement option for a conventional blade razor. The stainless steel body is definitely durable. I purchased previously the shavette with the black plastic handle [[ASIN:B001GMTKCK Dovo Stainless Steel blade BLACK Handle Shavette Straight Razor Replaceable Blade]] and it broke after a month due to wear-&amp;-tear. The plastic razor holders hold your replaceable blades snug and make it easy to sterilize in-between customers. I recommend Derby Professional blades[[ASIN:B0014E94SU 100 \\&quot;Derby Professional\\&quot; Single Edge Razor Blades for straight razor]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side is trying to find feathering/shaping blades for texturizing hair; you have to purchase the DOVO brand blade, which is hard to find, and I haven&#x27;t found an economy replacement.</li>
    <li> nice price for the item and made well, g r e a t  i t e m , t hank you</li>
    <li> Not the top of the line product but you get a quality for the price. I got it as a gift for my beutician wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This razor has a plastic piece that helps reload the replacement blades. Although the razor is brand new, this plastic piece which is fragile and flimsy, looks like it is about to break. When it breaks, the razor will be rendered useless because it will be unable to load new blades. It is not possible to purchase replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;This is a chintzy,  inferior product.</li>
    <li> Not a bad single blade straight edge. But I think next time I will go with one that doesn&#x27;t have disposable blades. A hone blade would be much better</li>
