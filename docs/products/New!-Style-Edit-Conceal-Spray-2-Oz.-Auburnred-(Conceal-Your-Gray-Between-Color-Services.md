<ol>
    <li> This is a wonderful solution for covering roots and areas with thin hair.</li>
    <li> works well between colorings</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Covers up the gray easily.</li>
    <li> I gave Style Edit 5 stars!! The company delivered it on time and it&#x27;s all it says it is. I was spending so much money getting my hair colored so often b/c I can&#x27;t bear seeing roots. It was putting a big dent in my wallet and damaging my hair as well. Being a hairdresser myself, I can&#x27;t do my own color b/c I can&#x27;t see the back of my head!! I bought&amp;#34;Style Edit&amp;#34; twice so far and now can&#x27;t live without it!! It does exactly what it claims. Spray your roots and like magic it adjusts itself to your own hair color!! It will hold you over until whenever you&#x27;re ready to go to your salon!!! I love Style Edit, and believe me, I am picky!! It just works!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I usually color my regrowth every  2 1/2 to 3 weeks since I am red/brunette and grey really shows, especially where I part my hair. This will help so much.

    <li> My hair is very very thin on top.  This product has saved me.  The coverage is wonderful and the color is great.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not even red.  Kind of light brown!  It&#x27;s too shiny and it&#x27;s not like any other product which just covers grays.  I can not even use it! Waste of money</li>
    <li> Love love this product! I always receive it very fast from this seller!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s not cakey- don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there! I use auburn for my light/Med brown hair &amp; it&#x27;s perfect! My hair is not red at at all so font let the &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; scare you away! This product works too...good I&#x27;ve gotten really lazy about coloring my hair! 😉</li>
