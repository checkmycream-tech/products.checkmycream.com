<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I could go on &amp; on about this oil treatment! It is truly amazing &amp; I will never buy another oil treatment for my hair again. I love Loma hair products and how they have helped to repair my hair. It adds shine &amp; nourishes my dry and damaged hair, it smells amazing &amp; a little drop goes a long way which is great.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!! It&#x27;s the best oil treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used the expensive oils like Argon and Macadamia from beauty salons but this beats them all!! Not too oily or heavy. I have fine hair and only wash every other day. My hair stays smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and perfect for short curly hair</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me the first time I went to her. My hair normally feels pretty smooth, but this product made it so much more silky, and I love to run my fingers through it! When I first bought some, I couldn&#x27;t stand the consistency. On your fingers it feels sticky and plastic-y like hair gel. The smell is not so great either. But those go away on my hair when I apply it. I put this on after the shower when my hair is damp. I love the way it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  Not only is it organic, but it nourishes and protects your hair, giving it serious TLC, which I needed badly.  Pluse it smells yummy!  Thank you Loma Organics! *****</li>
    <li> Great for dry, frizzy hair. Makes it manageable without making it oily! Makes my hair shiny and much easier to straighten.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday drying and flat iron protection. I have normal hair and it makes it super soft and shiny. I go back and forth between using Moroccan Oil and Aveda serums, but this is my favorite and keeps my hair healthy.

    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> smells great not greasy in love with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Lovely smell. Not too heavy or greasy like some other oils. Dispenser gives you a conservative amount of product - not too little, not too much. I use it on Keratin-Express-treated hair and have found it extends the life of my treatments.</li>
    <li> This is great for taming frizzy, natural curly hair.  In my case, it is great to just barely use a little bit to help the bad tips of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The ingredients are all healthy, organic and natural,  It is a great deal too.  To buy it in a salon you would pay 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely nothing short of amazing.  My hair was so overly processed, dry, and breaking.  My hair was so bad that even after deep conditioning for hours I still couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair without it getting caught into hair and breaking.  I&#x27;m happy to say I have found my miracle  After using this product one time my hair was soft, shiny, and 110% better.  I have been using this product for over two weeks and I can honestly say I will never go a day without it.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily either.  I even used this on my 16 mth old daughter who has very baby fine whispy hair to see if it would make her hair oily and to my suprise it didn&#x27;t.  Oh and can I also say that this prouduct smells unbelievably clean!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re dealing with washed out, over processed hair that breaks and frizzed you NEED to get this.  You&#x27;ll be happy that you did.</li>
    <li> Loma Organics has changed my hair!  It used to be dry and coarse feeling, damaged from &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color.  But now my hair is so soft!  I use this as well as the Daily Shampoo and Moisturizing Treatment (conditioner).</li>
    <li> Loma organics oil works amazingly well. It leaves your hair looking smooth and shiny! It also smells great!! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing for really course naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product.  I&#x27;ve never had my hair feel so healthy, smooth and shiny.  I had never heard of it until my hairdresser recommended it and so I bought it at the salon and paid $23 for the 4.25 oz.  Now I see Amazon has it for $14 something.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite hair oil! It&#x27;s so soft and nourishing. I put on quite a bit on damp hair and it never looks greasy when dry. I then add more to dry hair. My hair looks and feels so good. I love the ingredients also. And the smell is heavenly!!! I use it in my 2 year olds hair for her curls and they look so pretty. Gets rid of her frizz and she has soft bouncy curls. I have shoulder length hair and use 1-2 pumps on wet hair. Love love this and will use it forever.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and smells like coconuts</li>
    <li> Just found out about this nourishing oil treatment from an expo and from the week or two that I have started using it, I can notice a difference! My hair is soft, does not frizz out when it is humid nor is it left feeling oily (or dry.) I also started using Loma&#x27;s Moisturing Shampoo and Conditioner and I am loving the effect it has on my hair. I have been using the &#x27;more&#x27; expensive brands recommended by my hair consultant but never ever has left the effect that I am seeing now! AND it is ORGANIC!</li>
    <li> I used to use their product called &amp;#34;pearatin&amp;#34; back when I would bleach my hair silver/white and it was the only thing that would make my hair feel, well, like hair - that was over a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;I recently lightened my hair and wanted to treat it nicely so I was going to buy pearatin again when I came across this and loma&#x27;s fortifying serum. I bought both. I use this one before blow drying &amp;/or flat ironing my hair. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m destroying it less. I use the other afterwards, mostly on the ends of my hair. This one smells like the chewable orange vitamins I had as a kid. I don&#x27;t love the smell as much as I love the fortifying serum smell (it smells like the pearatin), but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have normal to oily hair, so I&#x27;m very careful about conditioners (they often make my hair look oily), but this stuff is amazing. It makes my hair look healthy and soft. Shiny but not oily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it smells like an orangecicle. I just rub 2 pumps into my hands and work thru my hair. It helps hold the style and I can go a second day without wash if needed when I use it. I have many but thin hairs. it&#x27;s not too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> Seen such a change in my hair!  Its so silky and smooth and sleek which I love since my hair tends to friz and by puffy. I started to see changes immediately especially once I started using the shampoo and conditioner. I love this product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This makes my coarse hair so soft and it only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> I use this I. My hair daily and it is amazing.  It makes my hair so silky and less brittle.</li>
    <li> This is great to use just a small amount to add shine and lock in moisture.  I just wish there was more for the $</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and makes my hair so soft! I love this much more than Loma&#x27;s previous product, which was called Pearatin something-or-other oil. And the pump bottle is an awesome touch. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for colored  hair and leave it looking shiny as well as giving a bit of softness.  Perfect for hair that is dried daily and it isn&#x27;t oily at all</li>
    <li> I love this nourishing oil.  It not only makes my hair feel healthier but also smoothes the frizzy&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and makes my hair feel like silk! I mix it with my conditioner and leave in for a few minutes and i rinse, even though it is a leave in , i still rinse!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from my hairdresser.  She charged me $20!!! I decided to try to find it elsewhere and I did for $14.  Much better price.  I love the smell and it makes it much easier to  comb my hair.</li>
    <li> I have dry, frizzy, curly hair and this product gives some relaxed, smooth, glowing look to those qualities.  Love these products.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  Just a little on my damp hair and my over colored hair shines!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. I love it! It does wonders for my heat and color damaged hair. I even put it in my childrens hair. It does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I use a staightener on my hair everyday and this product helps keep my hair healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and is very light weight.  I was a user of Argan oil, but if I used a little too much it made my hair look  geasy.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Loma Nourishing Oil for years. I color my hair, I have loads of fine hair and even though I&#x27;m over 50 I still wear it somewhat long. This product makes my hair look like I am in my 30&#x27;s. I just changed hairdressers and got lots of blond highlights for the summer and she advised me to use a different product. Ohhh my, what a mistake! I had frizzy stiff hair that looked like I was back in the 70&#x27;s. I have to buy Loma online or travel 40 miles to get it. I made the 80 mile round-trip to get this oil immediately. Yes, now I am back in business with silky beautiful ends.  I drop small puddles of this onto a small nylon brush and comb it onto the mid area of the back and sides of my hair, combing it down to the ends. You can easily use your hands. (I don&#x27;t use products with my hands, just me) Then blowdry. It works fine with any shampoo or conditioner...even Suave. I rotate between Rusk and Pureology, and even Pantene.</li>
    <li> Is your hair dry?  Has it lost it&#x27;s sheen? Time to try this organic oil. one to two drops into your wet hair after you shampoo, and your hair is renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all the Loma hair products, and love them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, smells great and just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product when not compromised. the company i bought it from via Amazon thinned out the liquid. I have been using this product for some time and it has always been thick. Will be buying it from the salon from here on out unless the product&#x27;s company sells it via amazon.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, good for shine</li>
</ol>
