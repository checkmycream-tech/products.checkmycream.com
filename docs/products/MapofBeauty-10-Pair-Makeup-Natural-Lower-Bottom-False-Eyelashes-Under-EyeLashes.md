<li> ฅ(๑*д*๑)ฅ!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall long story short 5strats</li>
<li> took a long time to get them.</li>
<li> it dosent take long so stock up ladies</li>
<li> Just when i got them the box is indeed a little beat up from the outside maybe because of the shipment.</li>
<li> but They&#x27;re a little long for my eyes</li>
<li> As expected, thank you!</li>
<li> Cheap quality and very difficult to put on.</li>
<li> its a must buy, sellers are also a dream and extremely polite</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize these would be shorter and thiner than my regular eyelashes so that sucks</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;ll have to cut them a little bit.</li>
<li> Really thin would have to double up for one eye</li>
<li> Cheap the worst eye lashes I have ever seen</li>
<li> Poor quality and hard to apply</li>
<li> The false hairs are a bit together</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s difficult.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like it looks so fake</li>
<li> but i do not have that optionthey are horrible</li>

    <li> These are really nice!!! In a local Beauty Supply store, one pair ranges from 3 to 4 bucks! So this amount for the price is unbeatable! And the lags are actually nice!
