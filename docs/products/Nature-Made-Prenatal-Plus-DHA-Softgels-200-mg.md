      <li>It is very good for health.the price is good too</li>
      <li>These are great because I don&#x27;t have to take a separate DHA pill.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I liked about these is that Costco sells these vitamins!</li>
      <li>now all my levels are good.</li>
      <li>I really liked these pills, as they seemed to be helping, and they have everything I need…</li>
      <li>I liked these pills, as they were helping, and they have everything I need…</li>
      <li>I have a healthy happy baby, and I have strong nails :)</li>
      <li>They have a fishy smell--not good when you are pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I like the option of being able to also buy in a store, plus, I LOVE Costco</li>
      <li>Ok, probably the best thing I have ever done for myself is taking this daily.  </li>
      <li>I felt compelled to write a review after I saw how many were saying these tasted fishy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s huge and sometimes it tastes like fish, but anything for the baby.</li>
      <li>Overall great price and value.</li>
      <li>and I love it, but from this seller this product came with busted capsules making the whole bottle of pills covered in PUNGENTLY smelling fish oil.  </li>
      <li>,I like it very much</li>
      <li>Other than that, they seemed to be great, as far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>We had purchased this same brand in-store, at a retail store, and were pleased with the pills.  </li>
      <li>I keep my bottle in the fridge, because it when it got hot and humid, the capsules started to get fish oil on my hands.</li>
      <li>I do also take extra folic acid as my doctor recommended to me to take more than what was in this vitamin.</li>
      <li>I have been taking these for the last 8 months and love them.</li>
      <li>pill itself is on the large side, similar to most vitamins.  </li>
      <li>they are just a lot more powerful than any other stuff on the market...</li>
      <li>They are the only ones that I find easy to swallow that do not give me indigestion.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach like most other multivitamin supplements.</li>
      <li>I feel energetic, no pain, no cramping, just like any other day.</li>
      <li>but I was always able to keep these down.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These pills are not super huge, but still large.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking a prenatal for 5 years now, because that&#x27;s how long we&#x27;ve been trying to get  and stay pregnant.</li>
      <li>I have just received a brand new pack of 150 vitamins that are about to expire in 3 months from now.</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of different prenatal vitamins with my first child.</li>
      <li>I generally stick with Nature Made, so this really just fell in line with my expectations.</li>
      <li>Other prenatal vitamins that I found that had DHA in them were either really super pricy</li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t have this smell with the old ones, but this bottle says Fish Oil is the number 1 ingredient.  </li>
      <li>K Prenatal Complete</li>
      <li>The coating is slick which makes it easy to swallow.  </li>
      <li>They do have a slight sweet type of smell to them.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy them during my first trimester due to their size and slight smell, but I found that the other prenatals I tried were even more unpleasant and these were the most tolerable for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The red coating on the outside really helps with swallowing them.</li>
      <li>I believe is was second on the old bottle.</li>
      <li>I opened the bottle a few months after buying it because I didn&#x27;t need them right away, and now I cannot return them.</li>

<li> BUT my stomach was upset every single time I took them.</li>
<li> I bought these vitamins because they have DHA and folic acid, which can be somewhat harder to find.</li>
<li> I tried a couple other brands and ended up with Organix Naturals.</li>

<li> Most of which made me sick or were hard to swallow.</li>
<li> It washes off fine, but it&#x27;s annoying to have to wash my hands after taking my vitamins.&lt;br</li>
<li> My friend is a doctor and he told me not to waste my money on all of the over 50 hyped up vitamins, and just take the Prenatal instead.</li>
<li> Trying to get anything down during my morning sickness was ridiculous let along having to choke down a pill!</li>
<li> I gag on large pills sometimes, but these aren&#x27;t too bad at all.</li>
<li> Others complained about a fishy smell.</li>
<li> , so much less expensive here than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> BUT my stomach felt bad every single time I took them.</li>
<li> /&gt;In winter in the northern US, I did still test as deficient in vitamin D, even though this is 100% DV.</li>
<li> I still take them be because they were expensive.</li>
<li> No more terrible &#x27;time of the month&#x27; days for me.  </li>
<li> They are impossible to stomach.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately they gave me horrible stomach aches</li>
<li> This is an absurd!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My friend is a doctor and he told me not to waste my money on all of the over 50 hyped up vitamins, and just take the Prenatal instead. and I am a male, but didn&#x27;t make any difference what gender you are  . they are just a lot more powerful than any other stuff on the market...</li>
    <li> They have a fishy smell--not good when you are pregnant.  I had to end up taking them at night before bed, otherwise I&#x27;d throw up immediately afterwards. Other than that, they seemed to be great, as far as I can tell.  I&#x27;m still using them now that I&#x27;m breastfeeding.  I have a healthy happy baby, and I have strong nails :)</li>
    <li> In deciding on a prenatal vitamin I decided on these because I wanted a vitamin that included DHA and was once-a-day. Other prenatal vitamins that I found that had DHA in them were either really super pricy or I had to take them anywhere from 2-5 times a day! I wanted a vitamin that was simple and had everything I needed in 1 simple pill. Trying to get anything down during my morning sickness was ridiculous let along having to choke down a pill! Yes, these pills are slightly big but I was always able to keep these down. I don&#x27;t know if its because of the pill and what it&#x27;s made of or if it had to do with the time of day I took my vitamin. I always took my prenatal vitamin after dinner, sometimes I would need to eat a couple ritz crackers with them but they never came back up. Also, my morning sickness didn&#x27;t seem as severe in the evening for me. Another thing that I liked about these is that Costco sells these vitamins! If they are having a sale on them you can get them at a really great price!!! I like the option of being able to also buy in a store, plus, I LOVE Costco so it&#x27;s a definite win-win for me!</li>
    <li> The capsules are really big; much larger than I expected. but I haven&#x27;t gotten sick off of them at all, nor have they given me any kind of indigestion. I generally stick with Nature Made, so this really just fell in line with my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have just received a brand new pack of 150 vitamins that are about to expire in 3 months from now. This is an absurd!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and I love it, but from this seller this product came with busted capsules making the whole bottle of pills covered in PUNGENTLY smelling fish oil.  They are impossible to stomach.  I opened the bottle a few months after buying it because I didn&#x27;t need them right away, and now I cannot return them.</li>
    <li> I bought these vitamins because they have DHA and folic acid, which can be somewhat harder to find. Unfortunately they gave me horrible stomach aches so I&#x27;ll be returning them. I tried taking them before bed and with dinner, but they still gave me problems.</li>
    <li> I started these a couple of months pre-pregnancy. I am currently still taking them daily because my doctor recommended continuing prenatals while breastfeeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pills are not super huge, but still large. I gag on large pills sometimes, but these aren&#x27;t too bad at all. The red coating on the outside really helps with swallowing them. They do have a slight sweet type of smell to them. I didn&#x27;t enjoy them during my first trimester due to their size and slight smell, but I found that the other prenatals I tried were even more unpleasant and these were the most tolerable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these during breastfeeding and will definitely take these again for my next pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I felt compelled to write a review after I saw how many were saying these tasted fishy.  The pills should be sealed and all you taste is the non-flavored casing.  I never burp up any fishiness either.&lt;br /&gt;The pill itself is on the large side, similar to most vitamins.  The coating is slick which makes it easy to swallow.  I never get an upset stomach from these and I&#x27;ve been taking them for around 5 months. I do also take extra folic acid as my doctor recommended to me to take more than what was in this vitamin.</li>
    <li> Ok, probably the best thing I have ever done for myself is taking this daily.  No more terrible &#x27;time of the month&#x27; days for me.  I feel energetic, no pain, no cramping, just like any other day.</li>
    <li> I went through 5 brands before I tried these. They are the only ones that I find easy to swallow that do not give me indigestion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach like most other multivitamin supplements.</li>
    <li> I really liked these pills, as they seemed to be helping, and they have everything I need…BUT my stomach was upset every single time I took them. I tried a couple other brands and ended up with Organix Naturals. [[ASIN:B00XE53Y42 Prenatal One Once Daily Multivitamin for Pre and Post Pregnancy.]] No stomach issues at all, and I only have to take one small tablet a day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge and sometimes it tastes like fish, but anything for the baby. I keep my bottle in the fridge, because it when it got hot and humid, the capsules started to get fish oil on my hands. The refrigeration helped. It washes off fine, but it&#x27;s annoying to have to wash my hands after taking my vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking a prenatal for 5 years now, because that&#x27;s how long we&#x27;ve been trying to get  and stay pregnant. This is the one I&#x27;m going to stay with. I like that the DHA is in there. I also like the capsule vs. tablet, because at this size, they get tough to swallow and capsules seem more slippery, so easier to get down. I&#x27;ve never had any nausea/stomach upset with them, but I do almost always eat breakfast first.&lt;br /&gt;In winter in the northern US, I did still test as deficient in vitamin D, even though this is 100% DV. I&#x27;ve added the Nature Made 2000 IU (500% DV) Vitamin D, and now all my levels are good. I recommend not just trusting that if you take these you&#x27;ll get enough of everything you and the baby need.&lt;br /&gt;Also, so much less expensive here than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see the photos of the back of the bottle anymore, so I&#x27;ve added them, the bottle has an expiration of Dec. 2016 and was purchased April 2015.</li>
    <li> The value pack was on sale and these vitamins get the job done. The pill is large though, so for those who have a hard time taking larger pills I would recommend trying another brand.</li>
    <li> very good.I bought it for my friend.It is very good for health.the price is good too,I like it very much</li>
    <li> Delivered to my mailbox, a pill must have leaked because there is stuff all over the other pills. I still take them be because they were expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for the last 8 months and love them. I tried a lot of different prenatal vitamins with my first child. Most of which made me sick or were hard to swallow. These are great because I don&#x27;t have to take a separate DHA pill. They are on the larger side as far as pills go, but that is expected with all prenatal vitamins. Others complained about a fishy smell. I didn&#x27;t notice a fishy smell but I also don&#x27;t stick my nose in the bottle to smell them. Overall great price and value. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> We had purchased this same brand in-store, at a retail store, and were pleased with the pills.  When we ordered this larger quantity from Amazon, they had a horrid smell of fish!  We didn&#x27;t have this smell with the old ones, but this bottle says Fish Oil is the number 1 ingredient.  I believe is was second on the old bottle.</li>
    <li> I liked these pills, as they were helping, and they have everything I need…BUT my stomach felt bad every single time I took them. I tried a couple other kinds and ended up with Vita Naturals.
