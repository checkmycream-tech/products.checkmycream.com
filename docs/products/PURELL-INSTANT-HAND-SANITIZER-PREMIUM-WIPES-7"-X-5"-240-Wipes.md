      <li>unlike many others!</li>
      <li>Came in handy on trips oversees, on NYC subway, etc.</li>
      <li>They come in so handy at restaurants, gas stations or</li>
      <li>Like most great products, companies are always loking for ways to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it, which means making it cheaper and not as good as the original.</li>
      <li>Better than the gel and or liquid germ killer, this product can be carried in your pocket or purse or in a handy ziplock bag in the car for any and all uses.  </li>
      <li>It comes in handy to wipe before eating or after touching everything.</li>
      <li>My work puts me in situations where shaking hands and handling money is required, so I love having these great wipes to sanitize my hands during the day right where I work.</li>
      <li>The quality of these wipes is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly pay more to keep this one on the market.</li>
      <li>I bought this 8\\&quot; X 6\\&quot; Purell hand sanitizing wipes (case pk) and was absolutely satisfied with its size and quality.</li>
      <li>I just love them.</li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT EVEN MAKE THE 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot; ANY MORE.</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>There are many product packaged as wipes, but not with antibacterial.  </li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t make a better product and now.....</li>
      <li>I love using the Purell santizing wipes.</li>
      <li>C&#x27;mon guys, we all know you get what you pay for, and we&#x27;re ok with that.  </li>
      <li>Why can&#x27;t companies learn that they WILL make money by manufacturing a good, high quality product that they DON&#x27;T keep changing!?!?</li>
      <li>It works well for me as a diabetic to be able to clean my hands thoroughly before testing.  </li>
      <li>These are the best wipes ever and much less toxic than others on the market as they use alcohol for the disinfectant (which also won&#x27;t generate resistant bacteria like others may).</li>
      <li>What a fortunate purchase that was.  </li>
      <li>Well, these are fantastic..</li>
      <li>They are like the cheap airlines hand wipes they used to give you... or at some restaurants...</li>
      <li>Thanks for making such a great product!!</li>
      <li>Purell really made a mistake in stop making the best instant sanitizing wipe using alcohol</li>
      <li>I use these wipes to clean my hands.</li>
      <li>These things are great, and very useful in the third world combat zone where modern conveniences are, shall we say, not always readily available.  </li>
      <li>I will be writing to the manufacturer about their decision to discontinue these for a far inferior product, but in the meantime, I am so glad Amazon is offering the original size!</li>
      <li>I have been using the Purell wipes a few years now, and it&#x27;s very good to have</li>
      <li>The thinner ones are great for sanitizing telephones, remote controls, keyboards, etc.</li>
      <li>Do they really killl most germs.??</li>
      <li>This will leave your hands feeling super clean and there is almost no scent</li>
      <li>The size is right, the quality is the best, and we bought a box of the smaller ones nearly a year ago and we just can&#x27;t use them up...</li>
      <li>Stick a couple of packets in your pocket for quick clean-ups after shaking hands with scumbags that never wash theirs...</li>
      <li>But these individually packaged cloths are even better, and more versatile.  </li>
      <li>With dispenser packs, the wipes end up drying out if not used quickly, but not these.</li>
      <li>The individually wrapped packets are extremely handy.</li>
      <li>We like the fact that it has alcohol in it and just the right size for your pocket-car-etc &lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be losing several others!</li>
      <li>Purell offers consumers both a website and a toll free number so that you can contact the company.</li>
      <li>These are far better than the new ecomony Purell wipes, however, I keep a supply of both.</li>
      <li>They are right size, and really durable...</li>
      <li>so it really sanitizes while also a great hand cleaner due to the soft absorbing cloth-like material.</li>
      <li>Please go back to the original!</li>
      <li>The poignant question is-Why replace an outstanding product of high quality with this sort of cheapness?</li>
      <li>The size is great for large hands as well as wiping down areas when you are out in public.  </li>
      <li>These wipes may not be the cheapest but they large, very moist and made of a durable material.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not broken, why do you think you had a need to fix it?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Score a goal for Purell!le who want to keep their hands germ free while using public facilities.      </li>
      <li>Guess they are really out to make money at all cost and to the loss of their customers.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t agree more with the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for people who want to keep their hands germ free while using public facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>eventhough there are decent place to wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
      <li>given what a high quality product they are.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad the manufacturer has decided to continue making these wipes (after having decided last year to stop due to the higher cost of producing them.)  </li>
      <li>My husband has had a lung transplant and it is critical that he wipe his hands frequently when out in public, after shaking hands with people, touching surfaces, etc.</li>
      <li>Cant live without it.</li>
      <li>I am very conscious of all the diseases and germs that are out here.</li>
      <li>Excellant buy over prices paid locally and a definite health  requirement in my public contact job in the Greater NY  Metro area</li>
      <li>After checking half the stores in town without success, I still wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on them</li>
      <li>The paper packages dry up right away and are unusable.</li>
      <li>I discovered these in early 2006 at the PX at Camp</li>
      <li>THEY ARE NOT 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot;) AND THEY DRY OUT WAY TOO FAST!</li>
      <li>, NORMAL PROFIT APPARENTLY WILL SIMPLY NOT BE ENOUGH, THEY QUIT MAKING THE 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot; ONES ALL TOGETHER.  </li>
      <li>Sorry to hear this product is being discontinued and replaced with a smaller sized version, AND not as good of quality.  </li>
      <li>For a cheapie little throwaway towelette, these things are remarkably high quality and very durable.  </li>
      <li>We simply can not find the foil packages in stores where we live so we or several boxes from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The people responsible are making me extremely upset.</li>
      <li>I would rather spend a little more on a good quality product; the lesser quality wipes they also offer are no comparison (quite cheesy, to say the least!)  </li>
      <li>Other wipes leave a residue that affects the test (makes blood sugar levels look high).  </li>
      <li>They are easy to carry in my purse or pocket and do not leave the sticky residue that those gels leave behind.</li>

    <li> I love this product.  It works well for me as a diabetic to be able to clean my hands thoroughly before testing.  Other wipes leave a residue that affects the test (makes blood sugar levels look high).  I also use it for work (receptionist in a walk-in clinic while attending school to become a Rad Tech). I only wish they were continuing this size!</li>
    <li> They have discontinued these? Are they CRAZY???? These are the best thing that has come out since sliced bread!!! They go EVERYWHERE with me!!! They are easy to carry in my purse or pocket and do not leave the sticky residue that those gels leave behind. I think the company should seriously rethink this! All they would have to do is show one or to commercials on these and EVEYONE with KIDS who HATE being sick all winter would be snapping these up!!! The 5 x 7 size SUCKS they dry out w/in a nano second. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT STOP making this size!!!</li>
    <li> Stick a couple of packets in your pocket for quick clean-ups after shaking hands with scumbags that never wash theirs...</li>
    <li> THESE WIPES SUCK! THEY ARE TOO SMALL (CAUTION: THEY ARE NOT 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot;) AND THEY DRY OUT WAY TOO FAST! THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT EVEN MAKE THE 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot; ANY MORE. SO BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR CANNOT MAKE ANY OBCENE PROFIT, NORMAL PROFIT APPARENTLY WILL SIMPLY NOT BE ENOUGH, THEY QUIT MAKING THE 6\\&quot;X8\\&quot; ONES ALL TOGETHER.  SO i GUESS WE ARE STUCK WITH THESE 5\\&quot;X7\\&quot; ONES THAT TRULY SUCK!</li>
    <li> I discovered these in early 2006 at the PX at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, while on my way to Iraq.  What a fortunate purchase that was.  These things are great, and very useful in the third world combat zone where modern conveniences are, shall we say, not always readily available.  Me and my guys were already using the little bottles of Purell liquid hand sanitizer.  But these individually packaged cloths are even better, and more versatile.  For a cheapie little throwaway towelette, these things are remarkably high quality and very durable.  On the civilian side of things they are good to take on hiking trips, or to the range, or just to keep in the glove compartment of the Jeep.               Now that I will be going back (to Afghanistan this time) in 2008 I went to stock up on these, and to my chagrin I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  Very strange, I thought, given what a high quality product they are.  After checking half the stores in town without success, I still wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on them so I started looking online.  My search led me to Amazon, and to the explanation for why I couldn&#x27;t find them at the store.           I echo wholeheartedly the dismay of my fellow reviewers that the manufacturer would drop a good product rather than face a cost increase.  C&#x27;mon guys, we all know you get what you pay for, and we&#x27;re ok with that.  Whoever made the call to delete these from the inventory needs to reconsider his decision.  This is an outstanding product.  I&#x27;m not worried about the price, just give us good stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have always kept bottle of Purell around the house and at work.  But I was looking for something portable to stick in my pocket especially for travel.  These wipes may not be the cheapest but they large, very moist and made of a durable material.</li>
    <li> Adrian Monk would LOVE Purell Premium Hand Wipes!  I know I do!  I use them all the time!</li>
    <li> Use this item all the time good to have with you were ever you go.</li>
    <li> These hand wipes are the best available. The scent is minimal and not offensive in any way- unlike many others! With dispenser packs, the wipes end up drying out if not used quickly, but not these. They are always in perfect condition. These stash well in purses, auto glove boxes, gear boxes, hiking packs, etc. My work puts me in situations where shaking hands and handling money is required, so I love having these great wipes to sanitize my hands during the day right where I work. The fragrance is minimal, so  people do not automatically look to see what the smell is when I open a packet. These are far better than the new ecomony Purell wipes, however, I keep a supply of both. The thinner ones are great for sanitizing telephones, remote controls, keyboards, etc. in hotel rooms. I can&#x27;t say enough and am thankful that GoJo reversed the decision to cancel these wipes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Purell wipes a few years now, and it&#x27;s very good to have especially when you have kids drive around everywhere.  There are many product packaged as wipes, but not with antibacterial.  I always stuff these in my bag, in the car, kid&#x27;s backpack and lunch box.    I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping/spreading germs around everywhere eventhough there are decent place to wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Love it.Me ,my family and friends use this product all the time.Cant live without it.</li>
    <li> We like the fact that it has alcohol in it and just the right size for your pocket-car-etc &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ART</li>
    <li> Purell makes an excellent hand sanitizer wipe for any occasion when you need to clean and disinfect your hands but you just can&#x27;t get to a sink. Purell, therefore, is perfect for people who are on the go. It also works wonders for anyone who simply cannot stop to wash their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The open box can be used in an emergency room (which is how I found out about this product, unfortunately); they can be carried in a plastic bag like Ziploc, too. All you have to do then is rub your hands together rapidly for a few seconds with this wipe on your hands both front and back until they become dry again. This will leave your hands feeling super clean and there is almost no scent whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the secret? Purell does indeed kill 99.99% of common germs in as little as 15 seconds. It does this through its active ingredient alcohol. Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purell wipes also include aloe and Vitamin E in its formula. This should help your hands feel a bit softer after you use Purell. An excellent plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few caveats: wash this off your hands before eating; and supervise small children as they use Purell hand wipes. Purell may say that it&#x27;s hypoallergenic; but it does have a slight fragrance. Purell&#x27;s fragrance will not overwhelm you by any stretch of the imagination; but if you are allergic to scents then you may need to use another product. Ask your doctor about this issue if it concerns you. In addition, any liquid on the Purell wipe is flammable--I assume because of the alcohol content--so keep these wipes away from fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have further questions? Purell offers consumers both a website and a toll free number so that you can contact the company. Good PR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Purell hand wipes are one of the very best cleansers for your hands whenever you are on the go and you just can&#x27;t get to a sink to wash your hands. It helps in hospitals, too! Just as the company notes, this is great for cleaning your hand after changing diapers, too. I highly recommend this product for people who want to keep their hands germ free while using public facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score a goal for Purell!le who want to keep their hands germ free while using public facilities.      Score a goal for Purell!</li>
    <li> In my experience, Purell hand wipes are the best on the market! Purell beats the store brands \\&quot;hands-down\\&quot; (they don&#x27;t even contain the same ingredients). You can find the Purell gel in stores, but they won&#x27;t carry the Purell hand wipes, because the stores are pushing the store brand. Thank goodness for Amazon !!! I take them all over the world with me.  M.</li>
    <li> Excellant buy over prices paid locally and a definite health  requirement in my public contact job in the Greater NY  Metro area</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t agree more with the other reviewers. These are the best wipes ever and much less toxic than others on the market as they use alcohol for the disinfectant (which also won&#x27;t generate resistant bacteria like others may). The fact they are being discontinued is hugely disappointing. Every time a good product hits the market, it gets replaced. Why can&#x27;t companies learn that they WILL make money by manufacturing a good, high quality product that they DON&#x27;T keep changing!?!?</li>
    <li> Purell really made a mistake in stop making the best instant sanitizing wipe using alcohol so it really sanitizes while also a great hand cleaner due to the soft absorbing cloth-like material. The replacement version are terrible. If you want these you need to order them while the stock may still be around. Like most great products, companies are always loking for ways to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it, which means making it cheaper and not as good as the original. In this case Purell really hit the ball out of the park by taking a great product and replacing it with something that doesn&#x27;t work and is terrible but way cheaper to make. Trouble is the public won&#x27;t likely buy an inferior product very long. So buy this version while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I search for a long time to find this packaging again.  I can send these to Iraq and they won&#x27;t dry up before the soilders us them.  The paper packages dry up right away and are unusable.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  I prefer purell in the packets as they don&#x27;t go bad in the glove compartement of the car.</li>
    <li> Sorry to hear this product is being discontinued and replaced with a smaller sized version, AND not as good of quality.  These wipes are thick and large enough to split in two and share.  A friend got me hooked on these and I love them.  I have purchased what I can possibly use through late December 2007 -- that&#x27;s when the current stock indicates they will \\&quot;expire\\&quot;. I understand the \\&quot;jobber\\&quot; has increased the cost on these and so the supplier has opted to replace them with the newer version mentioned.  I perfer this version and do wish the supplier was keeping them.  I would gladly pay more to keep this one on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of its type and I am devastasted that it will no longer be manufactured. The people responsible are making me extremely upset. Shame on you.</li>
    <li> The quality of these wipes is outstanding.  I am so glad the manufacturer has decided to continue making these wipes (after having decided last year to stop due to the higher cost of producing them.)  I would rather spend a little more on a good quality product; the lesser quality wipes they also offer are no comparison (quite cheesy, to say the least!)  I like the fact that these wipes are not \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; but have the same ingredients as regular Purell, which is used by hospitals for germ fighting.  And, I like that these do not have an artificial scent; most that do are nauseating.  I know that when my kids use these wipes, they are not going to be tempted to lick their hands afterwards (as with some of the fruit scented wipes on the market.)  The individually wrapped packets are extremely handy.</li>
    <li> We use the Purell packaged wipes when we go out to eat.  We simply can not find the foil packages in stores where we live so we or several boxes from Amazon.  Would not go out to eat without them!</li>
    <li> Fits in my purse and I can take it everywhere on the go.  It comes in handy to wipe before eating or after touching everything.</li>
    <li> I am a university professor who has to write on the blackboard sometimes. I use these wipes to clean my hands. They are very good. I always carry a few with me in case I don&#x27;t have access to water to wash my hands.</li>
    <li> I believe this has been discontinued, perhaps not, but it works well, has a pleasant scent and towelettes are of an unusually good size.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market I have ever used for cleaning up and killing germs.  Better than the gel and or liquid germ killer, this product can be carried in your pocket or purse or in a handy ziplock bag in the car for any and all uses.  During cold season this product has been a life saver.  The size is great for large hands as well as wiping down areas when you are out in public.  The Vinamines A &amp; E and Aloe keep your skin from drying and the textured wipe is like a cloth that insures a cleaner feeling.  They just don&#x27;t make a better product and now..... I am informed by the manufacture GoJo Industries that they are replaceing this product with another.  Shame on them!!!!  I have tried their replacement and it is horrible!!!!  Why in the world would you get rid of something so wonderful?  Guess they are really out to make money at all cost and to the loss of their customers.</li>
    <li> I bought this 8\\&quot; X 6\\&quot; Purell hand sanitizing wipes (case pk) and was absolutely satisfied with its size and quality. However, I was also informed by the seller that it will be discontinued &amp; replaced with a smaller size! A sample of the replacement was included in my shipment, and I was instantly disappointed!It had a very rough texture and was so tiny that for a moment I stood in disbelief! The poignant question is-Why replace an outstanding product of high quality with this sort of cheapness? Shouldn&#x27;t the consumer at least have a say in this matter? Please, we are the ones who use the product and know what our likes and dislikes are and I can tell the Colby Co./manufacturers that this is utterly ridiculous and unacceptable! You&#x27;ve lost a customer and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be losing several others! Please go back to the original! If it&#x27;s not broken, why do you think you had a need to fix it? Bring it Back--It was the bessssst!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel, these Purell hand wipes keep you clean on the go.  Sturdier than the previous model.  Came in handy on trips oversees, on NYC subway, etc.</li>
    <li> Well, these are fantastic..They are right size, and really durable...Do they really killl most germs.?? How do I know..? But, .I did get lesss colds that I used to without them...</li>
    <li> My husband has had a lung transplant and it is critical that he wipe his hands frequently when out in public, after shaking hands with people, touching surfaces, etc. This is the ONLY wipe that does the job. The size is right, the quality is the best, and we bought a box of the smaller ones nearly a year ago and we just can&#x27;t use them up... They are like the cheap airlines hand wipes they used to give you... or at some restaurants... Horrible...  They are too small, rough to the skin, and dry out too fast. I will be writing to the manufacturer about their decision to discontinue these for a far inferior product, but in the meantime, I am so glad Amazon is offering the original size!</li>
    <li> I love using the Purell santizing wipes. I feel they do help control germs. I am very conscious of all the diseases and germs that are out here. I carry one around in my hand everywhere I need to open doors. I have the canisters for work and the packets for my purse. I have them with me at all times. I just love them.</li>
    <li> I purchase these wipes all of the time and I love them!! They come in so handy at restaurants, gas stations or anytime I touch a door handle. Thanks for making such a great product!!</li>
