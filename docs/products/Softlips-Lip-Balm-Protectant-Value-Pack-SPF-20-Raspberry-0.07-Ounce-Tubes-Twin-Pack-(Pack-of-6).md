    <li> I love soft lips. And this flavor is great. It can fix any lip damage</li>
    <li> This is the only chapstick I use any more.  Everything about it is just heaven for your lips.  I keep it stockpiled in a cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, though hard to find now.  Believe the company may have discontnued making it in this form.</li>
    <li> Great for my lips as it keeps them moist without shine!</li>
    <li> Never mind waxy Chapstick or lip gloss that comes right off.  This stuff is unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s not always carried in drug stores, so I was glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have a tube every where....in my purse. At my desk. By my bed. On the table near where I watch TV. Never without it. Feels great, not greasy or thick and gummy. And...you get soft lips....</li>
    <li> I love SoftLips and I am so glad I found this value pack. I love being able to have so many back-ups. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm that works for me. It leaves my lips soft and it&#x27;s not greasy or waxy. The price is excellent and now I never run out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Lip Balm!!  Keep them on hand all the time!!</li>
    <li> This time I did get my Raspberrys, all but once. They snuck in another strawberry, seems as if you order Raspberry, that is what you should get!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have recently had a hard time find the Raspberry flavor in stores near me so I decided to purchase it on Amazon. It is awesome you can set it up to ship automatically to you ever couple months too. Will be using this product for years to come. It smells and tastes delicious and it makes my lips feel super soft</li>
    <li> My favorite chap stick!!  The only kind I will use.  When I was deployed to Afghanistan my husband would send them to me all the time :) This is a must have for me!</li>
    <li> I love Softlips and even after trying many other brands I always come back. This price on Amazon was a really good deal and now I&#x27;m stocked up for a while. Great product, great service, great price.</li>
    <li> I heart Softlips! It&#x27;s a great lip moisturizer but difficult to find in my area.  Ordering on line in bulk is a cinch!</li>
    <li> I love this Chapstick, its my favorite although if the watermelon flavor came down in price I&#x27;d buy that tool. About five years ago you could buy this Chapstick anywhere and it came out with tons of flavors now I have to argue with the Walgreens people that it does exist and is hiding somewhere in their store. Did they go out of business, and we are just buying remnants? These chopsticks do make my lips soft with out feeling greasy, they smell good, and have SPF! My only problem is that I have to hide them or else my youngest son eats them!  My husband holds them up and says, &amp;#34;Liam got another one!&amp;#34; Ugh</li>
    <li> I have used Soft Lips for years. It is the only lip balm I use. It not only makes them soft and nice but it heals them up when they are chapped. It comes in a variety of flavors, it is a great value for the money and I just love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s softer and spreads on more smoothly than chap stik, it doesn&#x27;t start smelling bad like Blistex does after time, and it has a pleasant aroma and &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; The only issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s getting harder to find. My favorite is the raspberry. It keeps my lips soft and smooth and protects them from the sun and wind. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. It&#x27;s light not heavy like some of the other chap sticks and the flavor is nice. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do: moist my lips, keeps them soft and protects from sun burn. They have a lovely scent, too. I will add that some of the tubes allow me to retract the chapstick and some don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t understand why but this won&#x27;t stop me from using them or buying more.</li>
