    <li> My favorite for years - never get bored with the scent...</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my wife for Christmas and she was so excited about it because this is a fragrance she likes a lot ( and I like it on her) and hasn&#x27;t been able to find it locally.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in Europe but I was unable to find it in stores in the U.S., so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It smells just as expected, fresh and floral, a very good summer perfume.</li>
    <li> Feminine and super sexy! Balanced and soft. My fiance loves it on me. I have never liked any perfume so much. Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume ,</li>
    <li> Just such a pity that this is no longer being produced!</li>
    <li> Did not know it was so horribly sweet smelling.  I wish I could send it back but I didn&#x27;t even try.  I did try to give it away to a few different friends but they all hated the smell as well.  It is just sitting on a dresser now.</li>
    <li> Solid packed, no damages upon arrival. Just perfect, Arrived in time for Xmas and thats very good since it was a present :-)</li>
    <li> i bought this over 10 yrs ago for my wife and we couldnt find it anymore, this year i decided to look for it and found it , Thanks my wife loves it...</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this fragrance I go through it like water :) Thank you for delivering it me this so quickly and not selling me a &amp;#34;knock off.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> She was very happy with her gift</li>
    <li> Very feminine scent. People ask me all the time what fragrance I  use. I&#x27;ve been using Cerruti for over 16 years.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a female friend. It was just what I was looking for and wanted and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Darn.  Ever smell something wonderful on someone else only to find that it smells like bug spray on you?  Well that&#x27;s my experience with 1881.  I wanted to much to like it, but it was very cloying and really did smell like &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; bug spray.  I finally pronounced it a loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It is my go to perfume. Perfect for a working perofessional. Not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I make sure I never run out of this cologne.  It is good that I can order it before I run out!</li>
    <li> very nice scent ,not heavy ,last about 6 hours ,i have had the version for man and i liked that one as well ,and now this is my new favorite ,</li>
    <li> Great. I received this product quickly and I nie have my favorite cologne again</li>
    <li> My favorite since many years!!! Shipping took some time but when it arrived I was very pleased :)</li>
