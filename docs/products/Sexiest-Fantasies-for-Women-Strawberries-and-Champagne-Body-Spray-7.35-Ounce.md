      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>I love this line!</li>
      <li>Has kind of a chemical smell to it</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>Very strong chemical smell once you spray</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>just smells like a knock-off of VS Love</li>
      <li>I like the Love Struck and VavaVoom scents too.</li>
      <li>I would recommended this scent to anyone! :-) :-)</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the speed of shipping.  </li>
      <li>but as it settles in and smells very sophisticated like something a business woman would wear and also comes to be a more sweet smell as time passes.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>She has been using Va Va Voom for about a year now, which is more of a spicy scent than the Strawberries and Champagne.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite</li>
      <li>Strawberries and Champagne is my husband&#x27;s favorite on me.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance so I will order it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong, but not overwelming.</li>
      <li>Can be a bit strong.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear S&amp;C - too sweet, but I love Va Va Voom, but ....</li>
      <li>As a scent, it&#x27;s actually pretty nice, and the boy likes it, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.    </li>
      <li>I ordered two, (New) and 5 days later it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorta interested in Love Struck</li>
      <li>While it lasts it smells pretty sexy though.  </li>
      <li>, it really smells nothing like strawberries to me, but it has a nice clean, fresh, long-lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells much strong right away than any body mist or body spray</li>
      <li>I got this because my boyfriend liked my old shampoo that didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair but smelled like strawberries.  </li>
      <li>it is as good as the vs brand of the same scent...</li>
      <li>of these fragrances last a fair amount of time - the school day for my daughter, but she reapplies after school if she&#x27;s going out.</li>
      <li>Has a very clean crisp fresh smell, smells nothing like strawberries though</li>
      <li>They last all day and are very cheap :)</li>
      <li>Definitely a sweeter smell, but nice and light for spring/summer.</li>
      <li>Not too overpowering and smells pretty good, Would not use daily, just for special occasions with that special someone.</li>
      <li>Definitely a VS knock-off &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Fun</li>
      <li>Next time, I hope that the product is better.</li>
      <li>Hard to find this one in the stores, Love the smell :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this perfume was available to order, but I was dissappointed that the bottle had been used, not sealed, and perfume missing.</li>
      <li>good - scent is a big part of her daily before school regimin.</li>
      <li>Strawberries and Champagne is too sweet for either of us, but I&#x27;m hoping our 20 year old will like</li>
      <li>If your a teen, and don&#x27;t like sweet smells, this might be one that works for you!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The Strawberries and champagne body spray takes a few moments to warm up for the special scents to blend but could last longer.</li>
      <li>Like other comments, it does smell mostly like champagne instead of strawberries.</li>
      <li>Too me, it has a more mature- feminine characteristic to it, that&#x27;s also very fresh-like.</li>
      <li>Very long lasting and amazing smell.</li>
      <li>after about 3 hrs that strong scent fades quites almost completely with a slight lingering scent someone else probably can&#x27;t smell unless they&#x27;re like RIGHT on you or hugging you and have their face against your skin.</li>
      <li>I would recognize the scent anywhere on anyone, it&#x27;s very identifiable.</li>
      <li>It just seems to be more of a teen, or younger scent - if there is such a thing.</li>
      <li>Our 17 year old daughter always smells Sooooo</li>
      <li>Came fairly early-</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a faint fruity undertone that I can kind of detect, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like strawberry at all.  </li>
      <li>Only 4 strategically sprayed spritzes of the Champagne and Strawberries by Sexiest Fantasies simultaneously transports me to the ultimate destination for class: Atlantic City all the while revealing to interested parties that I am a woman to be desired and wooed even if I am sensibly dressed for a blizzard.</li>
      <li>I ordered four bottles, and they were obviously brand new bottles, they all had shrink wrapped plastic on the caps.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Not a fragrancy fanatic type of person, I rarely wear perfume or body sprays, but this I really like.</li>
      <li>like 2 or 3 sprays comes on a bit strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>but while it says on the bottle it&#x27;s a long lasting fragrance not so much ....</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s better than victorias secret same scent, so they won&#x27;t be getting my $ on this specific item!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Strawberries and Champagne is not really a scent (normally) for women over say ...</li>

<li> Although, I am but powerless in my attempts to change the Siberian-esque temperatures of a New England winter and furthermore powerless to find release from my obligation to dress like an androgynous Eskimo, I have discovered a way to share with the world a concept of the tenacious, feisty yet elegant and chic woman that I am.</li>
<li> It came before the expected shipping date the only thing that made me a little upset was it didn&#x27;t come with a cap</li>
<li> So be careful.</li>
<li> I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be delivered in my townhouse mailbox due to size (however it was)</li>
<li> The scent of strawberry is pretty faint to me ....</li>
<li> it&#x27;s like champagne+floral+with a slight fruity strawberry scent.</li>
<li> so it was a little embarrassing to give as a gift..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really into expensive scents, and this one, as you can tell is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it locally for her anymore.</li>
<li> Smells like Victoria Secret Strawberry And Champagne</li>
<li> Also the bottle is sort of embarrassing (\\&quot;sexiest fantasies\\&quot;?  WTF?).</li>
<li> Anyway, this scent disappointed on that front.  </li>
<li> very disappointed and will not buy again</li>
<li> I was very disappointed that It is a fragrance that I wouldn&#x27;t even use as an air freshener.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product smells great and lasts all day! Read about it in Glamour magazine and decided to give it a try. Definitely a sweeter smell, but nice and light for spring/summer.</li>
    <li> I love this line! Strawberries and Champagne is my husband&#x27;s favorite on me. I like the Love Struck and VavaVoom scents too. They last all day and are very cheap :)</li>
    <li> Very long lasting and amazing smell. I would buy it again. I would recommended this scent to anyone! :-) :-)</li>
    <li> Our 17 year old daughter always smells Sooooo good - scent is a big part of her daily before school regimin. She has been using Va Va Voom for about a year now, which is more of a spicy scent than the Strawberries and Champagne. Strawberries and Champagne is too sweet for either of us, but I&#x27;m hoping our 20 year old will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strawberries and Champagne is not really a scent (normally) for women over say ... 30. It just seems to be more of a teen, or younger scent - if there is such a thing. I don&#x27;t wear S&amp;C - too sweet, but I love Va Va Voom, but .... I&#x27;ll wear anything I smell that appeals to me. I&#x27;m not really into expensive scents, and this one, as you can tell is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these fragrances last a fair amount of time - the school day for my daughter, but she reapplies after school if she&#x27;s going out. If your a teen, and don&#x27;t like sweet smells, this might be one that works for you!</li>
    <li> It smells much strong right away than any body mist or body spray i&#x27;ve ever had .... like 2 or 3 sprays comes on a bit strong so a little goes a long way. The scent of strawberry is pretty faint to me .... w/e the smell this has overall it&#x27;s like champagne+floral+with a slight fruity strawberry scent. I like it A LOT though but while it says on the bottle it&#x27;s a long lasting fragrance not so much .... after about 3 hrs that strong scent fades quites almost completely with a slight lingering scent someone else probably can&#x27;t smell unless they&#x27;re like RIGHT on you or hugging you and have their face against your skin. While it lasts it smells pretty sexy though.  I&#x27;m sorta interested in Love Struck but i&#x27;ve read it just smells like a knock-off of VS Love Spell so I dunno about that yet.</li>
    <li> The Strawberries and champagne body spray takes a few moments to warm up for the special scents to blend but could last longer.</li>
    <li> Definitely a VS knock-off &amp; I LOVE it! Lasts ALL DAY LONG. Especially when layered with lotion. Can be a bit strong. So be careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this perfume was available to order, but I was dissappointed that the bottle had been used, not sealed, and perfume missing. I love this fragrance so I will order it again. Next time, I hope that the product is better.</li>
    <li> package arrived on time, It&#x27;s strawberries and champagne! , it&#x27;s better than victorias secret same scent, so they won&#x27;t be getting my $ on this specific item!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one I have tried and the smell is not there...very disappointed and will not buy again</li>
    <li> Definately strawberry and champaign. Nice and it does last</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but I do like it. Not too overpowering and smells pretty good, Would not use daily, just for special occasions with that special someone. Has kind of a chemical smell to it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Hard to find this one in the stores, Love the smell :)</li>
    <li> I got this because my boyfriend liked my old shampoo that didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair but smelled like strawberries.  Anyway, this scent disappointed on that front.  I would describe the smell as very \\&quot;generic perfume\\&quot; or \\&quot;champagne\\&quot;.  There&#x27;s a faint fruity undertone that I can kind of detect, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like strawberry at all.  As a scent, it&#x27;s actually pretty nice, and the boy likes it, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.    Also the bottle is sort of embarrassing (\\&quot;sexiest fantasies\\&quot;?  WTF?).</li>
    <li> I guess I was hoping that this would have the fragrance of strawberries. I was very disappointed that It is a fragrance that I wouldn&#x27;t even use as an air freshener.</li>
    <li> After a long lonely winter, I found myself huddled under the shelter that only a bulky down puffer jacket can provide. As one can imagine the drudgery of such layers reflected not my sensual, luscious and flirty self. Although, I am but powerless in my attempts to change the Siberian-esque temperatures of a New England winter and furthermore powerless to find release from my obligation to dress like an androgynous Eskimo, I have discovered a way to share with the world a concept of the tenacious, feisty yet elegant and chic woman that I am. Only 4 strategically sprayed spritzes of the Champagne and Strawberries by Sexiest Fantasies simultaneously transports me to the ultimate destination for class: Atlantic City all the while revealing to interested parties that I am a woman to be desired and wooed even if I am sensibly dressed for a blizzard. LOL. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it locally for her anymore. Amazon is GREAT !</li>
    <li> Smells like Victoria Secret Strawberry And Champagne</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I confess though, it really smells nothing like strawberries to me, but it has a nice clean, fresh, long-lasting scent.  I was pleased with the speed of shipping.  I ordered four bottles, and they were obviously brand new bottles, they all had shrink wrapped plastic on the caps.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It came before the expected shipping date the only thing that made me a little upset was it didn&#x27;t come with a cap so it was a little embarrassing to give as a gift..</li>
    <li> Love this! it is as good as the vs brand of the same scent...I have bought in drug stores but was having a heard time finding it.  This was great! will buy more, shipping was great too!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a wonderful, amazing fragrance when worn by the right person. I highly recommend it! aaaa ++ +</li>
    <li> I ordered two, (New) and 5 days later it arrived in perfect condition. Fun Fact: I&#x27;m Not a fragrancy fanatic type of person, I rarely wear perfume or body sprays, but this I really like. you don&#x27;t have to constantly shower yourself with this, because one spray pump is all you&#x27;ll need that will last you throughout the day. It&#x27;s strong, but not overwelming. Too me, it has a more mature- feminine characteristic to it, that&#x27;s also very fresh-like. I would recognize the scent anywhere on anyone, it&#x27;s very identifiable.</li>
    <li> Came fairly early- I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t be delivered in my townhouse mailbox due to size (however it was) and it smells wonderful! Like other comments, it does smell mostly like champagne instead of strawberries.</li>
    <li> i like the sent but its an aquired smell. you like it or you dont.</li>
    <li> Very strong chemical smell once you spray but as it settles in and smells very sophisticated like something a business woman would wear and also comes to be a more sweet smell as time passes. Has a very clean crisp fresh smell, smells nothing like strawberries though</li>
