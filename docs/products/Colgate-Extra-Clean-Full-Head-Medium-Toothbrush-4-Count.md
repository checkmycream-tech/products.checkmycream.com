### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you Colgate for putting out excellent products!</li>
      <li>and what a great value!</li>
      <li>As a travel model it was great - 4 brushes in 4 colors is perfect for a family trip.</li>
      <li>In addition, it is a great value here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>quality is not that great</li>
      <li>A bit firmer than what I&#x27;m used to in a medium, they do a great job.</li>
      <li>This is a four count so the value is great.</li>
      <li>Great deal on toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>My dentist will be happy with the cleaning job these toothbrushes do.</li>
      <li>But for the quality and functionality it is a great tooth brush for its price.</li>
      <li>This is  a great value.  </li>
      <li>really enjoyed the way I could feel it getting everywhere and working quite well!!</li>
      <li>Great price, and good product.</li>
      <li>This is a really good value for a set of four toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>and they fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>yes, Pinky, that could be a problem--a problem that is no match for my superior intellect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good experience with Colgate brand toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Either way a good choice for your toothbrush needs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Minus one star because they could be slightly more comfy in the hand and just a bit softer, these are still a great choice and one I&#x27;ll continue using.</li>
      <li>All in all, these brushes are of good quality at a good price and should satisfy most buyers.</li>
      <li>I love toothbrushes!</li>
      <li>They are a good value, as they don&#x27;t cost a lot, but they are still very good and higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are nice and have held up well.</li>
      <li>If we can disrupt the currency by injecting the market with the best toothbrushes at the cheapest prices, we can swoop in and control the whole economy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are also handy if you have a guest dropping by.</li>
      <li>I liked that these came in a four pack.</li>
      <li>and I liked it too.  </li>
      <li>The colors are nice and there are a variety of them for the family.</li>
      <li>It was time for new medium ones, so this four pack seems perfect.</li>
      <li>They are very inexpensive yet, they are very good toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Ideal for normal people.</li>
      <li>Well, no bells and whistles here, but this brush will do the trick just fine!  </li>
      <li>The handle is nice and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>happy with this toothbrush, I love the feel of it in my hand and it cleans my teeth very well.</li>
      <li>I just replace my brushes more frequently.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes though instead of replacing the toothbrush I might put it in the top shelf of the dishwasher to get it</li>
      <li>I am pleased with them.  </li>
      <li>I always love Colgate products and these are no exception.</li>
      <li>I find them just a tiny bit skinny to get a perfect grip on them</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re paying only about a dollar a piece for anexcellent excellent product&lt;</li>
      <li>I do like the head design and does feel like it gets between teeth better than some</li>
      <li>This may be better as a youth toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It did a better job</li>
      <li>And we&#x27;ll actually make them wonderful toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>but if I do I have three more as backups.</li>
      <li>How they can lose so many is beyond my imagination, but they do.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re really gripping anything substantial in your hand while brushing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>there is a toothbrush that is made that does the best job possible</li>
      <li>As such, it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable.</li>
      <li>The head is ideal, will fit most of the normal sized humans.</li>
      <li>These are a good price and nice to have around when you have company or someone needs a new toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>These toothbrushes are very basic, no frills, but the price is so very good that I can&#x27;t not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Think about more important things.</li>
      <li>The size of the head of the brush is perfect for their mouths, and the bristles aren&#x27;t too rough.  </li>
      <li>Besides feeling good in my hands it also brushes very well.</li>
      <li>Other than that, perfect !</li>
      <li>really enjoyed the clean feeling from these brushes.  </li>
      <li>starters, opening the package of the Colgate brushes is relatively easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These were so nice, getting the back really good.</li>
      <li>Sturdy strong.</li>
      <li>The size of the brush is not too big…and works for me just fine.  </li>
      <li>toothbrushes go, this one is a very good compromise between too much stiffness and too soft.</li>
      <li>They get the back teeth real clean real easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Egad Brain, that sounds so devious, but how will get people to buy the cheap toothbrushes?</li>
      <li>I felt like the plaque was removed and when I ran my tongue across my teeth they were smooth and clean-feeling.</li>
      <li>Both me and my spouse experienced some gum discomfort after starting to use these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Well, Pinky, we&#x27;re going to take over the world with cheap toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I felt like the plaque was removed and when I ran my tongue across my teeth they were smooth and clean-feeling.</li>
      <li>Good dental hygiene is important, so it&#x27;s makes sense to spend a little more for a product that does a better job.</li>
      <li>and it makes it very easy to remove it from the package without tearing the whole thing apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are full size heads and comfortable to brush with as well.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed that the toothbrush grip is comfortable and I have had no cases of the toothbrush slipping from my hand to fly across the room or fall to the floor.</li>
      <li>They leave my teeth feeling realy clean, while the soft-bristle brushes do not.</li>
      <li>My mouth felt entirely clean</li>
      <li>I like these medium bristles a bit better -- they just seem to not wear out as quickly, and I feel like the stimulate my gums better than the soft.  </li>
      <li>the full head is nice for brushing both adult teeth and the littler children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
      <li>However, if it&#x27;s important to you that the feel of the brush is substantial, that is has a good texture and grip for your hand (which can be important when the brush gets wet), and has flexibility and give in the brush head (which makes it not feel as abrasive against your gums/teeth), then you might want to consider an alternative</li>

      <li>The shape of the bristles makes sense for cleaning teeth, and four at this price is a really good deal, so I&#x27;d recommend them (especially on subscription).</li>
      <li>Medium is ideal as I feel like I am getting cleaned as well not being too harsh on my gums.</li>
      <li>These brushes are far more aggravating to my gums than any medium I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m not even sure &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is the right category for them.</li>
      <li>This has a head that unique in shape, made brilliantly to go around and inside your teeth in ways that other toothbrushes never have !!!</li>
      <li>Many people prefer stiffer bristles in their toothbrushes as they seem to last longer and clean better.</li>
      <li>A good grip and firm bristles make for easy and comfortable brushing.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it will live its full 4 weeks of life time.</li>
      <li>This Extra Clean model has a really nice balance in the bristles.</li>
      <li>Nothing special just a nice standard toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I like a solid toothbrush, with a good grip, but also with gentle bristles.  </li>
      <li>I think these would be great to keep on hand for sleep-overs for kids or unexpected house guests, but I don&#x27;t see myself seeking these out in the future.</li>
      <li>these medium toothbrushes I do like when I brush my teeth I feel the difference,extra clean,buying 4 for the price its worth it.</li>
      <li>Outside of an electric brush, these old-school brushes clean my teeth better than anything I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually love these Colgate Extra Clean brushes.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re away from a local store, it&#x27;s a good way to go for decent price.</li>
      <li>I found the medium bristles to be just right.</li>
      <li>medium stiffness is right for me and my teeth and $7 is a years supply.</li>
      <li>I like to alternate between a soft head toothbrush and a medium one, as I&#x27;ve never found a perfect one in the middle.</li>
      <li>The combined effect of those attributes leads to good cleaning while not wearing down your gums.  </li>
      <li>If you like medium to hard, then these will be great, but otherwise I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for 2 weeks and still works as it did on the first day.</li>
      <li>The first one still looks unused.</li>

    <li> &amp;#34;So Brain, what are we going to do tonight?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Well, Pinky, we&#x27;re going to take over the world with cheap toothbrushes. You see, the world&#x27;s economy is actually based on three things, the price of an egg, the price of a chicken, and the cost of a toothbrush. If we can disrupt the currency by injecting the market with the best toothbrushes at the cheapest prices, we can swoop in and control the whole economy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Egad Brain, that sounds so devious, but how will get people to buy the cheap toothbrushes? If they don&#x27;t cost much, won&#x27;t people just think they&#x27;re bad toothbrushes?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Why yes, Pinky, that could be a problem--a problem that is no match for my superior intellect. We will simply put them out under the Colgate brand name, a brand everyone trusts. And we&#x27;ll actually make them wonderful toothbrushes. They&#x27;ll cost about a dollar each in a multi-pack. Everyone will buy them up, nobody will buy expensive toothbrushes with silly features, and the whole nation will fall right into my hands! Bwa-ha-ha-ha, Bwaaa-ha!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Zorts Brain, you&#x27;re so smart!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Ideal for normal people. I am not a big fan of soft or hard tooth brushes. Medium is ideal as I feel like I am getting cleaned as well not being too harsh on my gums. The head is ideal, will fit most of the normal sized humans. Have been using it for 2 weeks and still works as it did on the first day. I am sure it will live its full 4 weeks of life time. Wish the handles had little bit more variation and colors, so that it is easily identifiable even in little light. But for the quality and functionality it is a great tooth brush for its price.</li>
    <li> Great price, and good product. If you&#x27;re away from a local store, it&#x27;s a good way to go for decent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had good experience with Colgate brand toothbrushes. Depending on where you purchase this value pack, it can be downright cheap (Amazon&#x27;s current price is nearly twice WalMart&#x27;s and is twice the current price listed at the KMart site). If used as directed - twice a day and replaced every three months - this value pack will last an individual user a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if they were more expensive I would prefer Colgate to a cheaper generic brand, for the simple reason that in my experience, cheap toothbrushes may be good for various tasks - cleaning around car battery posts, various household cleaning tasks, etc. - but are less than optimal for brushing teeth (because bristles fall out, they don&#x27;t last long, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate currently lists six different kinds of toothbrushes on their site of the kind that have standard handles (eight if we count a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; brush and a mini brush). Looking over toothbrush options in a store can get a bit confusing if not overwhelming, so to keep things simple I like to stick with something basic like this model.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush as far as the brush part goes. The bristles are nice and have held up well. However the handle of the toothbrush is skinnier than I would like. When it gets wet from being under the water or toothpaste drips down it gets slippery and is actually hard to grip. I&#x27;ve had it slip out of my hands multiple times.</li>
    <li> I love toothbrushes! My kids go through them like they are going out of style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were so nice, getting the back really good. Colgate always does a good job, I like when they have the bristles in the middle that have the extra firm! Thank you Colgate for putting out excellent products!</li>
    <li> I have a Sonicare at home, but I have these toothbrushes for my office. They are very inexpensive yet, they are very good toothbrushes. They are a good value, as they don&#x27;t cost a lot, but they are still very good and higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a nice well designed grip that holds well, even with wet hands.  These are full size heads and comfortable to brush with as well. I keep a few of these in the guest bath as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium stiffness is right for me and my teeth and $7 is a years supply. For a manual toothbrush, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> This is a steal value-wise. I nice big pack of toothbrushes at a price that devastates local retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, these are just dandy. A bit firmer than what I&#x27;m used to in a medium, they do a great job. I find them just a tiny bit skinny to get a perfect grip on them (I have had a few more comfortable brushes in my day), but for the price and overall ability to do the job well, I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because they could be slightly more comfy in the hand and just a bit softer, these are still a great choice and one I&#x27;ll continue using.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t need a new toothbrush? I love that these came in a convenient pack of four and that each of the brushes was a different color. There&#x27;s nothing worse than buying a multipack of toothbrushes and discovering that 75% of them have the same color handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually prefer the Colgate brushes that are made out of the clear plastic but these seem to work equally well. I have no complaints. I had my teeth cleaned after I started using these brushes and my dentist didn&#x27;t notice a change in my teeth or gums and Amazon&#x27;s price is far lower than any of my local stores. I hadn&#x27;t considered ordering toothbrushes from Amazon before but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;m going to consider in the future. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> For this review I compared this product to my regular daily-use toothbrush which is an Oral B (Clinical Pro Flex style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, opening the package of the Colgate brushes is relatively easy. There&#x27;s a perforation on the back directly behind the 3rd brush and it makes it very easy to remove it from the package without tearing the whole thing apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon removing the brush I was struck by how plastic and lightweight it felt. There is no texture on the plastic, only contours - which means there is nothing allowing your fingers to grip. The plastic is hard with no flexibility in either the brush head or the handle, and it&#x27;s very thin so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re really gripping anything substantial in your hand while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to many other products on the market, this lack of flexibility is really noticeable and does impact the feel of the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on to the brushing. One of the first things I noticed is that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam up nearly as well with this brush as compared to my other one. I tried it with the exact same toothpaste and amount, and the Oral-B brush created a significantly noticeable amount of foam, while the Colgate did not. The Colgate&#x27;s brushes are very stiff and this is again why it reminded me of a travel toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel toothbrushes to me are low quality, emergency use brushes that stay in your travel bag for long periods of time without use. They get hard and inflexible. That&#x27;s what the Colgate felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this particular model the &amp;#34;extra clean&amp;#34; seems to come from the elongated bristles which are the Yellow ones in the central part of the brush (surrounding the blue), and a couple of the white ones right at the tips. Generally I have seen elongated bristles on the outer edges of brushes, not the inner parts like this one. The location of the long bristles did not seem to make a difference in either of my tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes DID clean my teeth to a quality level I expected. I felt like the plaque was removed and when I ran my tongue across my teeth they were smooth and clean-feeling. And so the majority of my scoring has to do with everything else about the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an INEXPENSIVE pack of brushes that does the basic job of toothbrushing, there&#x27;s nothing standout-wrong with this product. However, if it&#x27;s important to you that the feel of the brush is substantial, that is has a good texture and grip for your hand (which can be important when the brush gets wet), and has flexibility and give in the brush head (which makes it not feel as abrasive against your gums/teeth), then you might want to consider an alternative product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars removed for the above mentioned issues.D clean my teeth to a quality level I expected.

    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to go wrong with the [[ASIN:B004ZN7YCK Colgate Extra Clean Full Head, Medium Toothbrush, 4 Count]]. As the product description says, it cleans my teeth. I have also noticed that the toothbrush grip is comfortable and I have had no cases of the toothbrush slipping from my hand to fly across the room or fall to the floor. The shape of the bristles makes sense for cleaning teeth, and four at this price is a really good deal, so I&#x27;d recommend them (especially on subscription).</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s difficult to NOT like a toothbrush, but I almost don&#x27;t like this one. The handle is a bit too small for my preference and the bristles seem super stiff for a medium-rated toothbrush, but other than those two issues the toothbrush has been fine. Both me and my spouse experienced some gum discomfort after starting to use these toothbrushes. We normally get the medium-rated brushes, too, so I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond my personal preference for the toothbrush, it works much like a toothbrush is intended to. I think these would be great to keep on hand for sleep-overs for kids or unexpected house guests, but I don&#x27;t see myself seeking these out in the future.</li>
    <li> I like a solid toothbrush, with a good grip, but also with gentle bristles.  The combined effect of those attributes leads to good cleaning while not wearing down your gums.  This brush scores on both counts!  In addition, it is a great value here on Amazon.  The size of the brush is not too big…and works for me just fine.  At the very least, it is worth a try.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I am a prolific toothbrush buyer. One word why: Grandchildren. How they can lose so many is beyond my imagination, but they do. Plus I&#x27;m always sending toothbrushes home with them. I liked that these came in a four pack. the full head is nice for brushing both adult teeth and the littler children&#x27;s teeth. I found the medium bristles to be just right. Not too hard for my aging gums and the kids young gums, but not too soft that you feel like the toothbrush didn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
    <li> These are a good price and nice to have around when you have company or someone needs a new toothbrush.  Nothing special just a nice standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty basic brush, your standard basic model without mush flash. As such, it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable. It&#x27;s lighter than a lot of brushes and the head is compact without being miniature. I felt like it did a decent job but I would never use it as my everyday brush. As a travel model it was great - 4 brushes in 4 colors is perfect for a family trip. If we lose one, no big deal as this is a pretty cheap brush as well.</li>
    <li> This is a really good value for a set of four toothbrushes. I liked the toothbrush just fine, they seem to work just as well as any other (save for a Sonicare or other electric toothbrush). I have a smaller mouth and found the size to be just right. These toothbrushes are very basic, no frills, but the price is so very good that I can&#x27;t not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite manual toothbrush was a rubber gum massaging addition on the back of the brush head, and I really like that addition. These brushes are very basic, but they do the job just fine and what a great value!</li>
    <li> I did not have high expectation when I ordered these. It seemed like a bargain for four of them. I have used Colgate toothbrushes before but none that made me a fan to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Sonic Care daily but sometimes when I am tired I like to use just a standard toothbrush. When I opened these I was shocked at how well they felt in my hand. They are very thin in the handle area. I have rather small hands and they fit perfectly. Some toothbrushes are too thick and I have a hard time holding them. Besides feeling good in my hands it also brushes very well. I have been using mine nightly for over a month now. The first one still looks unused. Sometimes though instead of replacing the toothbrush I might put it in the top shelf of the dishwasher to get it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this toothbrush, I love the feel of it in my hand and it cleans my teeth very well. I don’t think I will run out anytime soon but if I do I have three more as backups. They are also handy if you have a guest dropping by.</li>
    <li> these medium toothbrushes I do like when I brush my teeth I feel the difference,extra clean,buying 4 for the price its worth it.I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Got these for my 8 year old and 6 year old to use as the step up from &amp;#34;kiddie&amp;#34; toothbrushes.  The size of the head of the brush is perfect for their mouths, and the bristles aren&#x27;t too rough.  I wound up using one when I left my toothbrush (different brand, size, etc) at a hotel and I liked it too.  Good for small kid sized mouths and grown up ones too.</li>
    <li> This is  a great value.  Don&#x27;t waste mental energy wondering if you have a spare toothbrush stored.  Buy bulk.  Think about more important things.</li>
    <li> I like to alternate between a soft head toothbrush and a medium one, as I&#x27;ve never found a perfect one in the middle. It was time for new medium ones, so this four pack seems perfect. These brushes are far more aggravating to my gums than any medium I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m not even sure &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is the right category for them. If you like medium to hard, then these will be great, but otherwise I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great deal on toothbrushes. Go for it. Sturdy strong.</li>
    <li> Well, no bells and whistles here, but this brush will do the trick just fine!  It&#x27;s very similar to the ones my dentist gives out, so it must be good enough, right?  ;-) Actually, he gives out the soft head, but I like these medium bristles a bit better -- they just seem to not wear out as quickly, and I feel like the stimulate my gums better than the soft.  If you&#x27;re used to soft, however, it may take a little while for your gums to adjust.  I think they last long enough; some may last a bit longer, but you&#x27;d be paying 2 or 3 times as much, so it&#x27;s not worth it.  I&#x27;d rather pay less and replace my brush with a fresh new one more often!  (Also, with these I don&#x27;t feel as bad when I inevitably leave one in a hotel or someone&#x27;s house on vacation...and I like to keep an extra pack on hand to give to guests who inevitably forget THEIR toothbrush when they come to stay at my house!)</li>
    <li> Finally, a toothbrush with stiff bristles!  It is almost impossible to find medium-bristle toothbrushes in the stores, so I was happy to find them here.  They leave my teeth feeling realy clean, while the soft-bristle brushes do not.</li>
    <li> What  does one say about a toothbrush???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems so very simple they&#x27;re all pretty much alike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Colgate toothbrush is not like all the rest. This has a head that unique in shape, made brilliantly to go around and inside your teeth in ways that other toothbrushes never have !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptic that I am I thought it was all hype and then I used the toothbrush. It touched the upper inner portion of my teeth, the side of my teeth and portions of my gums ,as well as in between my teeth,  as I brushed.&lt;br /&gt;It got my entire teeth and gum area better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before  I was shocked in a pleasant manner!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a toothbrush that is made that does the best job possible I believe it is this Colgate Extra Clean Full Head Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the way I could feel it getting everywhere and working quite well!! My mouth felt entirely clean and I don&#x27;t believe I missed a spot using this brush! It did a better job then I had  been doing brushing my teeth, going around 2 to 3 times  This did it all in one brushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is be sure to get the brush in soft. Soft is what my dentist always recommends. But using the medium I just brushed more lightly and it was like I was using a soft brush–as I said it did the job quite well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a definite five star review .I could not find anything wrong with this brush. I could only find it to be superior to all the other ones I have ever tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead and give it a try if you don&#x27;t like it you have not spent very much which is another plus to this tooth brush pack--- you&#x27;re paying only about a dollar a piece for anexcellent excellent product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this  helped and answered any questions you might have !</li>
    <li> As I have a small mouth for an adult woman, I find these toothbrushes to be just the right size and the the rubber thumb grip keeps me from jamming the toothbrush into my mouth accidentally.  I like the heads, not too soft, not too hard.  They are tapered heads and get reach the molars in the back of the mouth.  I am pleased with them.  If you have a large mouth, they might be too small for you.  Medium is the stiffness of the brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t want them any softer or harder.</li>
    <li> After having reviewed another fancier Colgate toothbrush, I find these to be a bit disappointing. The handle is very narrow and slippery. You do get four toothbrushes in four different colors, and that&#x27;s nice, but they don&#x27;t have the coverage or the maneuverability of other choices out there. This may be better as a youth toothbrush. Good dental hygiene is important, so it&#x27;s makes sense to spend a little more for a product that does a better job.</li>
    <li> We use electric toothbrushes at our house for the most part, but I have found it wise to have some regular brushes around for those times when they are needed (like travel, or when you&#x27;re coming down sick. Replacing a $20 Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush head every few days because you have a wicked flu is not...practical.) I actually love these Colgate Extra Clean brushes. Outside of an electric brush, these old-school brushes clean my teeth better than anything I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; heads are not too stiff; I bleed easily and found these brushes to be just fine for my sometimes-sensitive mouth. You can use them all at once (the colors are different) for your fam, or hoard them all for yourself, I won&#x27;t judge you. Either way a good choice for your toothbrush needs. They remove plaque like the dickens. There&#x27;s no more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: A</li>
    <li> We have been using an older version of the Colgate brush. It has harder bristles. My wife prefers this, but the hard bristles can irritate the gums. This Extra Clean model has a really nice balance in the bristles. They are firm enough to get between teeth and stimulate the gums, but not so stiff to scratch or irritate. The handle is a bit shorter than the model we had before. This makes it easier for her, but I prefer the longer one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As toothbrushes go, this one is a very good compromise between too much stiffness and too soft. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the Colgate Extra Clean Full Head (Medium) toothbrush, but I wasn&#x27;t thinking that the bristles would be that hard. I am use to a soft and this is a medium.  My teeth did feel super clean, but I noticed that I irritated my gums because of the hard bristles.  Other than that, perfect !</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes clean teeth quite well, the price is relatively inexpensive, their slightly smaller size makes them easy to pack or carry with you in a purse or backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic of the brush does not feel particularly sturdy so the question arises how long the brush will last. As it is recommended that a toothbrush be replaced every three months, their sturdiness may not be a real factor in their quality. The brush bristles are labelled as medium but I found they were on the stiff side. Many people prefer stiffer bristles in their toothbrushes as they seem to last longer and clean better. I happen to prefer softer bristles because I don&#x27;t want to scratch my gums. I just replace my brushes more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent so if someone is looking for a less expensive toothbrush, these brushes certainly fit the bill. All in all, these brushes are of good quality at a good price and should satisfy most buyers.</li>
    <li> I always love Colgate products and these are no exception. The colors are nice and there are a variety of them for the family. This is a four count so the value is great. The handle is nice and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> It is your everyday average toothbrush...what do you want for something you change every 30 days (or atleast I would hope you do).  I do like the head design and does feel like it gets between teeth better than some but you still have to floss.</li>
    <li> The first difference I noticed in these brushes are they are a smaller handle made with less plastic.  A good grip and firm bristles make for easy and comfortable brushing.  It took a little getting used to since it is smaller, but it was still a good clean.  The smaller brush does allow for easier brushing of the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the clean feeling from these brushes.  I also like the use of less plastic in this product.</li>
    <li> quality is not that great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t quite like the tip of the brush</li>
    <li> My dentist will be happy with the cleaning job these toothbrushes do. They get the back teeth real clean real easy. The brush is just as I expected.</li>
