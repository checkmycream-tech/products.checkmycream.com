<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!!! Delivery was very quick, the container was filled to the top unlike most products and the mask left my face so smooth and clear. I love it!!!  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It has cleared my face alot. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It being my first time trying any type of face mask I was a bit skeptical but this stuff is amazing!! My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt even couple days after 1 use. I have incredibly sensitive skin so it says a lot when a product doesn&#x27;t make me break out in rashes/pimples/etc. Also, probably one of the best customer services I&#x27;ve experienced. I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I  received this product yesterday and first thing this morning was to try it out. Surprisingly my initial thought was that this mud mask was going to have an awful scent but to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t smell at all. The mud mask is not thick so it goes on super thin on the skin; so i would suggest going over the first application. It took about 5-8 minutes to dry because i only applied 1 thin layer. I first tried removing the mask with cold water as the water warmed but found that removal was easiest and faster with the water warmed. Before application I remember the pores on my nose were black and after the first use my pores were greatly cleared. So this product is great for clearing up your pores. This product suggest using it once a week so if I experience any additional benefits or effects during the next few weeks I will certainly update my review.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide whether I like this mask or not. First of all, when I received the mask, the seal was attached to the cap. Not cover the mask part. At first I was skeptical about if I should use it but I wanted to try it out so I did. Second, I really like the consistency of the mask. It&#x27;s not thick or clumpy but not too watery. That I do like which is unique to this mask. However, when the mask started to dry, my skin started to itch. It was really uncomfortable. It stopped itching a while after I took the mask off. I do like that it dried quickly though. Third, it made my skin really soft after I used it. My skin felt clean and clear of everything. Lastly, the mask didn&#x27;t have a scent so that was good. Still confused on what I think of it and if I would use it again. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again but will give the mask another chance.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using the Dead Sea Mud Mask. It feels tingly and fresh. I have used lots of masks and many leave my skin feeling and looking great. However, this one seems to have a little something extra!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love love it!</li>
    <li> oh i am so in love!!! this is exactly what my face needed. love from a far away sea.&lt;br /&gt;the appeal of the dead sea is the fact that it can draw out the toxins and dirt from the face, and put back in the minerals and vitamins that the skin needs. in other words: bad stuff comes out, good stuff goes in. and how soft and vibrant it left my face! i&#x27;m used to a harsher mask, a mint julep that i THOUGHT i liked, but i&#x27;m no longer going to buy that! dead sea mud all the way, baby.&lt;br /&gt;this tub is an ENTIRE POUND. filled to the brim, too! they&#x27;re not messing around! and you really only need a tiny bit. i know, in the movies they show women wearing masks of goop caked on, scaring little kids. there&#x27;s no reason to pile it on. a thin layer to go on, let dry, and then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;hear that? RINSE off. not scrub. you&#x27;re not going to need a brillo pad to remove it, only to discover later that you missed some. it&#x27;s mud! it washes off.&lt;br /&gt;some of the reviews reported that the mud had a bit of a smell to it. i did not experience this, but if you find that you don&#x27;t like the smell, you can always add a drop or two of essential oil to it, before application.&lt;br /&gt;check out the pictures! i even got my husband in on the fun, and smeared it all over his face. you can see the difference with the two pictures of me - one right after application, and one when it was almost all dry. the color changes completely.&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for free for my true and honest review. all experiences and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this dead sea mud mask! The jar is huge and will last a very long time. It feels so cool and refreshing when you put it on, and my skin feels amazing once I take it off! My skin is so smooth and soft after using the Natural eSCENTials Dead Sea Mud Mask!</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times, I do have sensitive skin and it seems to work at the time being, but doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts or doesn&#x27;t seem to make your skin more clear. It is very refreshing! Maybe it&#x27;s not the product for me.</li>
    <li> I love it soo much it&#x27;s really workd on the acnes and , after I wash it I feel my face clean and fresh</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t as happy as I hoped to be. Years ago I bought Dead Sea Mud Mask directly from Israel. It was much thicker. I feel the product I most recently bought had been watered down, so that was a disappointment. It still worked but it was pretty runny in my opionion.</li>
    <li> Love the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  It is pleasant to use and does wonders for my skin. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Is to soon to tell, but so far I like it. After each use my face is soft and clean. Hopefully with time it made a different. So far so good so I will recommended.</li>
    <li> My  daughter tried this product at a party and was quite happy with it so i decided to give it a  shot.  I think it is great. Your skin feels so smooth and refreshed after use. I won&#x27;t go so far as to say it takes many years off, however it does give you a glow and seems to help smooth things out. I am a baby boomer and appreciate all the help i can get after years of sun and fun. If you  are looking for something easy to use and enjoyable , give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mud mask. It is easy to apply and wash off and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin like some other mud masks I have experienced. It cleaned my face up extremely well and helped with black heads as well. My face feels softer and smoother. It isn&#x27;t as red and I haven&#x27;t had breakouts since I have used this 3 days ago. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. My skin is softer and my pores are cleaner. And the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> like the product didn&#x27;t really see a difference just yet since I started now using it but will continue to see will be giving a update soon.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it once a week followed by a few drops of jojoba or emu oil . My skin is glowing and I am getting compliments.</li>
    <li> Crazy amazing!!!! It stars to itch if I leave it on for more than 10 minutes, it must be the product taking all the toxins out of my skin. I use it everyday and will be buying for the rest of my life !!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a high quality mask! The container it comes in is huge and a little goes a long way so it will definitely last a long time and it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients I really like the fact that I actually know what&#x27;s in this mud mask. I use it once a week I apply a thin layer on my skin  and let it dry for about 15 minutes I noticed a different after the first time I used this mud mask my pores looked a little bit smaller, skin felt soft, smooth and looked brighter. I have combination skin so this mask is great for oily and dry skin, the mask is uncomfortable when it starts to dry and  you can feel it tightening your skin, it&#x27;s easy to rinse off. You shouldn&#x27;t leave the mask on longer than you are supposed because the mask can actually start to draw moisture from your skin which can cause irritation, If you have really sensitive skin or have never used a mud mask before and you&#x27;re afraid that it might irritate your skin you should probably apply a small amount on your hand or wrist just so you can tested out.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product a lot because it made me break out, but I have very sensitive skin with acne.  It may work better for others that dont have sensitive skin and acne.  The only good thing about it is that it did clear out my pores, but like I said it dried out my skin (I have really bad sensitive skin/acne).</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best mask I have ever used. Some of the other reviews had made small complaints about it smelling but I haven&#x27;t experienced that. This is defiantly a heavy duty mud mask so I only use it once a week or maybe once every two weeks I do make sure to use a nice lotion for my face afterwards sense the mask does pull some moisture from the face. I plan on buy more of this whenever I run out which I don&#x27;t see happening anytime soon, huge container. I would also love to check out more of their products due to my absolute love for this first one.</li>
    <li> Product is very drying, so I would moisturize after use.  It also seems to do a good job pulling pimples out.. Like when you notice that a pimple is coming up I just put a little dab on the pimple and it takes care of the rest. It didn&#x27;t make my skin soft as others have said but it definitely made my skin feel clean.</li>
    <li> This deep sea mud mask is a MUST for everyone&#x27;s bathroom essentials. Not only is this a HUGE bottle, but it comes at a great price and will last for months! It smells amazing and goes on very smoothly. I has improved my skin and makes it smoother and firmer with every application. I use this about two to three times a week and I plan on never stopping. I know this doesn&#x27;t really matter but the color is beautiful and you&#x27;re able to tell if you miss any spots. It also doesn&#x27;t stain which is a plus, (my girls are a little messy). I love this product and would recommend this. I received this item in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. In the past, I had used Mary Kay facial mask; however, I  have not been able to find it (perhaps it was discontinued ). After the second time I used Dead Sea Mud Mask, I could see a noticeable improvement in my complexion.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally found one with which I am absolutely pleased. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with sever acne for my entire life! I always wake up even at the age of 38 to new breakouts. I had a chance to purchase this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion and I can honestly say that I woke up today with NO new breakouts! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I am so happy to report that not only has my face not broken out in the last three days with only three days using this but also that my dry patches are no longer dry and my oily spots were not too oily! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this specific Dead Sea Mud Mask! I highly recommend this to anyone dealing with the acne like I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product will buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this face mask... its great. I use it once a week. It has no bad smell. This helps clear up my black heads. My skin feels clean and bright after using it!!! I would reccomend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I have only used it three times (once a week) and I love it! I can already see my face cleaner and brighter. I mix it with a couple drops of lavender essential oil and it is amazing!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> The dead sea mask made my skin feel like silk right away.  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the desired results.  I did find the mud itched while it was drying.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I use it weekly for my body and it&#x27;s just great. It leaves my skin so soft. The customer service is also a plus as they checked in to see if I was satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Love it, my face feels so clean and smooth after I apply it. My skin looks so clear too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very fast shipping! Thankyou!</li>
    <li> This mask goes on smoothly and my skin looks refreshed after taking it off. I have very sensitive skin and have not found this to be too drying, and it does not burn while it&#x27;s on. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This 100% natural Dead sea mud mask is amazing! My daughter and I had a spa night last night and we got to try this for the first time and we loved the way it made our face look and feel after we washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First  of all it is a mud clay type mask. It goes on dark and when it dries it&#x27;s a lighter grey in color. When you wash it off with a washcloth all the impurities in your skin literally wash away with it, and you are left with a fresh, bright, nourished looking face! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering a huge allergy attack and it totally messed with my face and neck after a food allergy. So I decided that I needed to look for a mask type product to help pull out the toxins, and I found this great promotional offer and knew I needed to test it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I made the choice to go with this one from Natural Escentials, it is definitely an essential part of my skin care routine!&lt;br /&gt;This product also has a money back guarantee, so no risk, just great skin!</li>
    <li> This is a very hefty sized container, which means that if you follow their directions to use one time a week, this jar will last a very long time. The consistency was that of pudding and the appearance was a light chocolate brown color. It did not feel like mud at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the results of using it - I was really excited to use it once I received it. I covered my face in it and waited around 10-15 minutes, portions of the mask had dried but since I didn&#x27;t evenly spread it, some parts were still slightly wet. After cleansing my face of the mud mask, I noticed that my skin felt noticeably more silkier. I had also let my parents use it as well, my mother (almost 50)  commented on how her skin felt smoother, my dad didn&#x27;t really comment on it since he does not really care or notice his appearance that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that this mud mask does contain Vitamin E oil (although it is the last ingredient listed which means there isn&#x27;t that much anyways) which some people may not like to use on their face. Other than that, I do think this is a good mask to give to someone who wants to have their own spa day in the comfort of their own home. Would be a great Mother&#x27;s Day gift or a nice gift to your significant other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free to try in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a really great mud mask.  I was amazed by how big the jar was when I first received it.  They really packed a lot of mud into this thing.  You don&#x27;t realize how much a pound of mud is until you hold it in your hand.  This mud was imported from the dead sea and it is so rich in nutrients and minerals...it&#x27;s so good for your skin.  I&#x27;m not surprised that it made my skin look and feel amazing.  I have used it twice weekly since receiving it (so that is about 4 times so far), and I am really impressed.  It feels really good on my skin...gives me a nice tingling feeling and I find that very relaxing.  I usually put this on and then relax in the tub for about 15 minutes.  After I rinse it off completely I use my toner and my skin is good to go.  I have very oily skin with large pores and this has helped a lot.  I am very impressed with this mask and highly recommend it if you want that spa treatment without actually going to the spa.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products to keep my skin happy and healthy, so I was happy to have a chance to order this through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.  I&#x27;ve used a number of different facial masks, including several dead sea mud masks, and can attest that this one is a great quality!  Some of the others I&#x27;ve used have a mineral type scent that can be unpleasant while the mask is on your skin, so I was really happy to find that this mask has no significant scent at all!  The texture is thick and creamy - really feels good and is easy to evenly spread onto your face.  As the mask dries on your skin, it feels pleasantly tight, like the dirt is being pulled out as the mud dries!  I also like how easy it is to rinse off with warm water on a soft cloth - not like some products where I&#x27;ve really had to scrub to get the last bits off.  Most importantly though, it leaves me skin feeling so clean, soft, and smooth!  My pores definitely look minimized as well.  Really happy with this - I will definitely continue to use for some time to come!</li>
    <li> The mud mask is wonderful. Left my skin feeling clean and soft.  I no longer have blackheads around my nose. Extra note... wonderful customer service from this company! Very impressed!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mask.  It moisturizes and tightness my skin just right!</li>
    <li> Great mud mask!   It goes a long way!  My husband and I are both using it.  It hasn&#x27;t helped me a lot with my breakouts but I do love how my skin feels after using it.  It has defiantly helped tighten up my skin therefor making me look a bit younger!!! We will be doing our 4th application tonight!</li>
    <li> Really good  I love it</li>
    <li> makes my skin very soft</li>
    <li> Did not work that well.  It itched like crazy and left my skin irritated and red.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of masks in my time. Some have worked really well and others haven’t. This mask though I think may be my new favorite. It is cleaner than a lot that I have used. What I mean by that is once I applied it to my face and went to wash my hands the mask was easily cleaned off. That is big for me since my nails are long and I have had to scrub the mask from under my nails. This was not the case with the dead sea mud and that won it points before I even let the mask dry. When I placed the mask on my skin the smell was different. There was no chemical smell to it. It was a clean scent and actually reminded me of my beach days and not in an altered chemical way that a lot of products have now. When the mask was first on my face there was a slight tingling sensation. Not in a bad way but in a way that made me really think this is different than what I normally encounter. It dried a little faster than the container said but that may be due to the heat in my house is drying. Now the test really began once I rinsed the mask off I found my skin to be soft. It was easily removed and after my face felt fresh, clean, and softer than usual. I will say that this is a winner and I am glad I got the chance to share my opinion on this product. If you are looking for something natural that will do a better job than store bought, chemically enhanced masks this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> I was given this product free for review. I have only tried a few face masks over the years and havent noticed much results.&lt;br /&gt;I was suprised how much i liked this product. It smelled alittle funky, but man did i like how it made my skin look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;My face looked bright and felt very smooth. I will definitely continue to use this mask and recommend it to others. I was also&lt;br /&gt;super impressed with how quickly it arrived and how well it was packaged.</li>
