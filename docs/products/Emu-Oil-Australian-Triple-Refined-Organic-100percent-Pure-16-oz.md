    <li> Very effective, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> A very high quality emu oil. I use it as a carrier oil for my wonderful Doterra essential oils.  Your body obsorbs it so quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great for me! Have used it for about 3 months and have seen great results. For those of you who believe that Emu Oil can clog pores I have researched it and it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But since it is oil, won’t it clog my pores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not emu oil. The Department of Dermatology, at University of Texas Medical School, showed that emu oil in concentrations of up to 100% is non-comedogenic (will not clog pores). This is one reason it is so popular in cosmetic applications.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product for tendonitis. Very fresh, sweet-smelling oil.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I love how soft the oil makes my skin feel! Not greasy, just smooth with a great glow. I will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin moisturizer I have ever ever ever EVER used. Getting used to the fact that it is the fat from an animal might take several applications to get used to, but when you do you will be astonished at how incredibly soft and supple your skin will be. To be honest I do not think I will ever go back to conventional moisturizers, because this is my holy grail oil! I use the EMU OIL by H&amp;B OILS CENTER and it is non greasy and sinks into the skin in minutes. It also helps hyperpigmentation which is amazing. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I just this product and it STINKS. Meaning smell. It&#x27;s a fishy or maybe emu smell. I read a review stating if it has a smell it means it is bad. Also there is no link to contact company. Would rate higher if it didn&#x27;t stink. None of the issue&#x27;s were addresses. How do you contact H&amp;B oil center. Sense the products must be out dated because of the horrible odor do I get a refund or product replacement.</li>
    <li> Hair growth amazing and a large bottle very happy</li>
    <li> This emu oil by H&amp;B OILS CENTER is wonderful i am using for my eczema and it has now almost cleared up after trying so many different products that either make the problem worse and or do nothing , I wont use anything else now as this works!!!</li>
    <li> First time user of emu oil, but so far, so great! Super moisturizing for the skin, however a slight warning. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Absorb well and is smooth and  silky</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found for dry skin &amp; I &#x27;ve wasted $$$ on many.  Use as face moisturizer &amp;  body oil.  Absrbs well in short time.  Worth THR price,</li>
    <li> Excellent....my skin was so dry and now it is silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I used this oil mixed with neem oil to help prevent acne breakouts on my scalp. My hair type is 4c kinky coily. This oil keeps my hair really soft and is excellent in detangling the hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first bottle of emu oil 2 years ago. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday, it&#x27;s not heavy and absorbs completely, leaving your skin feeling baby soft. It didn&#x27;t clog my pores at all either. It&#x27;s such a healing oil, I&#x27;ve used it on post op scars and an area of skin that was having a difficult time healing. It did not irritate my skin in any way, not once. It&#x27;s very soothing. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more bottles since and have been out for awhile and just remembered I need some more! That&#x27;s never been my experience with any other skin care product, they&#x27;re almost always a let down. This is a great H&amp;B OILS CENTER company to deal with. The shipping is fast and the products arrive in perfect condition. If you have any questions, the response is prompt and friendly. 100% all the way.</li>
    <li> works just fine for me</li>
