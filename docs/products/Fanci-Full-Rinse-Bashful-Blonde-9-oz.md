      <li>baby-fine hair sometimes comes out too gold and too brash,even when the salon takes special care to add the needed ash tones to the formula.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter liked it but felt the color wasn&#x27;t strong.</li>
      <li>It also works well if the color treatment turns out to light or not quite right.</li>
      <li>I like the color and received the merchandise quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is great for toning down coloring mistakes.</li>
      <li>Whats interesting though is that the handful of greys come out golden and actually gives the impression of extremely fine natural highlights.</li>
      <li>I have used this color rinse for years and like it very much.  </li>

      <li>Why is it only available online?</li>
      <li>After reading all the reviews, we were prepared to be &amp;#34;awed&amp;#34;, but after using this hair color, we couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product and recommend it highly.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>so much follow thru to get it to me</li>
      <li>Wife says - thanks-</li>
      <li>If you have dark hair you must use more.</li>
      <li>I have tried several types of hair color, permanent, semi-permanent, and ones good for a few washes.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have gray hair, but when i wash my blonde hair, ends become too white, so i use this to &#x27;darken&#x27; them and make the hair color more even.</li>
      <li>It is highly recommended for those persons not wanting to dye their hair permanently.</li>
      <li>Gives my once blonde hair just the right hilights.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s new.</li>
      <li>It will stain surfaces and clothing, so be careful about application and clean spills promptly.</li>
      <li>I am glad to have this product as only black is sold on Kauai.</li>
      <li>I have only a couple of gray hairs that should be easy to cover next to the blonde.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural medium blonde but am beginning to get a lot of gray and this product works really well.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so old</li>
      <li>Application leaves your hair soft and supple like a rinse should be.</li>
      <li>Her hair is naturally a medium brown.</li>
      <li>I tried this because my mom uses it and was surprised how well it works.  </li>
      <li>It gives me the coverage I need to blend a soft color from my roots to the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>and it makes your hair soft, doesn&#x27;t flatten it.</li>
      <li>It is the stuff that your grandma put in her beehive &#x27;do, and if she used too much, it would turn blue.</li>
      <li>I am a brunette who wants to go blonde for Halloween and hates wigs.</li>
      <li>Had my hair professionally highlighted, but came out lighter than I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The deal is this: Roux has separate lines for the professional vs the consumer lines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old</li>
      <li>I found this in a couple of shades at my local Rite Aid and really like it.  </li>
      <li>After a few washings it may not be needed any more until the next time.</li>
      <li>No odd colors happened to my hair after using this color.</li>
      <li>The product also leaves my thick, but fine hair, feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>This product helps me to keep just enough color in my hair between new color treatments.  </li>
      <li>I use this on a fairly consistent basis - helps tone down stubborn white hair.</li>
      <li>It can weigh your hair down if you put too much in though.</li>
      <li>This ash blonde color takes the brassy out of grey and gives a soft luminous color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an end run around the shelves of pretty boxes of hair dye that just last a few weeks and then need re-application.  </li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t have gray hair, but when i wash my blonde hair, ends become too white, so i use this to &#x27;darken&#x27; them and make the hair color more even.</li>
    <li> Do not put your hopes up, it will not do anything, not harm not waiting effect. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work !! Ughh</li>
    <li> The Roux Fancif-full Temporary Hair Color - Bashful Blonde is easy to use and covers gray hair very well. The Sweet Cream is excellent also. It shampoos out the next time you shampoo.  I really like this product and recommend it highly.[[ASIN:B001O5MNUK Fanci-Full Temporary Hair Color - 56 Bashful Blonde: 9 OZ]]</li>
    <li> Discovers and covers!</li>
    <li> I tried this because my mom uses it and was surprised how well it works.  I don&#x27;t have to have my hair highlighted as often using this product.</li>
    <li> my hair is dirty blonde/light brown.  I have only a couple of gray hairs that should be easy to cover next to the blonde.  I rubbed the product on with my fingers, as instructed, but didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> It is highly recommended for those persons not wanting to dye their hair permanently. It covers some white hair and it makes hair softer like a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I found this in a couple of shades at my local Rite Aid and really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t change my hair color but rather simply enhances it. I have &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; blond hair and this product brings out the highlights.  Whats interesting though is that the handful of greys come out golden and actually gives the impression of extremely fine natural highlights. It&#x27;s not tacky or brassy at all. It works so well that I may not color my hair anymore since the only reason I color it is to bring out the blond. Note also that Amazons price is a couple of dollars less than the store purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it tones down brassiness which can happen in the summer sunshine.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product was returned due to a ups problem, I have never had a company go to so much follow thru to get it to me,reminds me of customer service of years ago.thank you Michael.&lt;br /&gt;This is an old product but still works on going grey hair and less trouble than the actual dye ones.</li>
    <li> Came on time, no leaking</li>
    <li> It beats having to touch up your roots every 6 wks and it makes your hair soft, doesn&#x27;t flatten it. I like it pretty well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and I feel really fortunate that among all of my friends I&#x27;m the only one who doesn&#x27;t have to color my entire head.  I inherited that from my father.  Alas my mom went entirely gray by 40.  I used to dye her hair in the basement and between coloring I&#x27;d put this magic potion on her hair.  Now all these years later I went out looking for this product for me and my gray tinged hair that is around my sideburns.  I didn&#x27;t want a permanent dye.  Could not find it anywhere, I thought that it wasn&#x27;t made anymore until I decided to try Amazon.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product helps me to keep just enough color in my hair between new color treatments.  It also works well if the color treatment turns out to light or not quite right.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to tone down a highlight ,from a professional hairdresser, gone bad! I would reccommend this product to anyone who need to tone down the &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; tones.</li>
    <li> I use this on a fairly consistent basis - helps tone down stubborn white hair. Fanci-Full is a cheap alternative to the salon. Please note that it tones down, does not entirely cover white hair.</li>
    <li> Wife says - thanks- this was not to be bought on this account - but it works and the grey is gone- i never say the grey but she says it was there and this gives her 2 more extra weeks between color..</li>
    <li> I am a brunette who wants to go blonde for Halloween and hates wigs. Does this work on hair that isn&#x27;t already blonde?</li>
    <li> This is the very best product ever for covering gray hair with results that leave in your natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Just towel dry after washing and work a little in each wash.&lt;br /&gt;If you want your gray back, then just wash it out and don&#x27;t add any after washing.&lt;br /&gt;A really great product, that doesn&#x27;t get into your hair or scalp.</li>
    <li> Wife could not find her color locally.  She is happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 30 years, no matter what shape or color the bottle is...it is still the same great Fanci-Full Hair Color.  I am very very disappointed that it it not available in the stores.  Karmen</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t buy this color in stores anymore. I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It is just what I need to tone any brassiness after coloring. It is safe and even helps with fly-aways. It can weigh your hair down if you put too much in though. I have gotten so many comments on how nice my hair color looks after using the bashful blonde. I&#x27;m confused. Why is it only available online?</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years. i usually buy from same dealer when possible. this one has always been good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I put it in a little spray bottle and spray it on gray roots in the part and hairline. Allows me to postpose coloring. Xfusion also works for this purpose. Both excellent products.</li>
    <li> Had my hair professionally highlighted, but came out lighter than I wanted.  This product tones it down nicely.</li>
    <li> I am glad to have this product as only black is sold on Kauai.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair with a little bit of gray. I was looking to cover up the dark roots in-between professional colorings at a salon. This product did nothing. Used as instructed but saw no root coverage. What a waste of money! Maybe it works for people with 100% gray hair? If so - it should be included in the product description.</li>
    <li> Im 43 with no gray. I abuse my hair by coloring.  I abuse it with the hair dryer, the flat iron and the curling iron.  I used to use this to tone down the brassiness in my 20s and 30s.  I have no idea why I ever stopped using it. I started using it 2 weeks ago because of brassiness in the blonde hair coloring. It totally removes it, gives me a beautiful color.  What I did not expect was the condition it left my hair.  It has removed the frizz. It looks so healthy. I almost can&#x27;t believe it. Before, after I would blow dry, my hair was frizzy and looked angry. When I put this in it, it is noticeably less frizzy after blow drying and has cut my flat ironing time in HALF, at least!  I have no idea what kind of conditioners are in this, but I will not stop using this ever again!!  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good and healthy in years!</li>
    <li> Really easy to use and covers just the sections of my hair that need color the most. One bottle lasts quite a while. Gives some blonde color to gray hair.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This works nicely for me.  The product also leaves my thick, but fine hair, feeling soft.  No odd colors happened to my hair after using this color.</li>
    <li> I have used this color rinse for years and like it very much.  I especially like being able to order on-line and have it delivered to my home!!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter liked it but felt the color wasn&#x27;t strong. It worked best on the parts of her hair that were already lightened to a degree. My opinion is that her &#x27;highlights&#x27; were a little too gold/brassy. This lightener didn&#x27;t rectify that. Her hair is naturally a medium brown.</li>
    <li> lighter than expected, unable to color gray hair completely</li>
    <li> This stuff is so old it&#x27;s new. It is the stuff that your grandma put in her beehive &#x27;do, and if she used too much, it would turn blue. That said, I&#x27;m a guy who discovered this stuff by accident and find it very easy to apply and useful. I&#x27;m using the #56.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look on the manufacturer Roux&#x27;s website, it seems they&#x27;ve cut back on the color selection, but this is not true. The deal is this: Roux has separate lines for the professional vs the consumer lines. The consumer line, displayed online, is rather limited. You will need to go to a beauty supply to see all the available colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made to blend in partial gray and tone colors. I am a blond with about 30% gray. I just squirt a couple nickle-sized blobs into my hand, rub it into my hair, then rinse my hands and style (that means comb) my hair. It makes the gray look blond. My hair is fine, and this stuff also works as a light styling lotion that makes my hair look more finished (if I don&#x27;t try hard enough, I have hair that sticks up and out, a lot like Alton Brown&#x27;s. When I use it over a period of time, it seems to condition my hair. It is a bit more smelly than I&#x27;d like, but not enough to bug anybody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this stuff IS and IS NOT:  It is not a hair dye. It will only tone and blend in color. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use permanent hair color. If you have dark hair you must use more. You need to choose the color properly - it is best to find a color that is near the color of your hair currently. It will not drastically change the color of your hair. It is great for toning down coloring mistakes. It will stain surfaces and clothing, so be careful about application and clean spills promptly.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.....  It&#x27;s perfect..... :)  I prefer this size to the 15.2 size &amp; next time will order only this one.....  Great color for my hair &amp; covers my gray........</li>
    <li> Amazon to the rescue again -- I have used this product for years and couldn&#x27;t find a refill anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby-fine hair sometimes comes out too gold and too brash,even when the salon takes special care to add the needed ash tones to the formula. I use this wash-right-out rinse the first time I shampoo just after dying my hair. It tones down gold tones nicely. After a few washings it may not be needed any more until the next time.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  I am so disappointed the stores don&#x27;t stock it anymore in this color! Why is that?  I hope they are not going to totally eliminate it. Gives my once blonde hair just the right hilights.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, we were prepared to be &amp;#34;awed&amp;#34;, but after using this hair color, we couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference.  Well.....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Gives a very nice medium blonde color.  It lasts through about 3 washings, and is very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Fanci-Full is perfect for me.  It gives me the coverage I need to blend a soft color from my roots to the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like the color and received the merchandise quickly.  This color cannot be found in local stores. I would recommend this to anyone needing this color.</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of hair color, permanent, semi-permanent, and ones good for a few washes.  I like this one the best.  Simply put it on after you have washed and towel dried your hair.  It gives it subtle color, never brassy, and gives your hair body also.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> used it for years when it was MUCH cheaper but it is worth it</li>
    <li> love this product, it was just what I needed</li>
    <li> This is so good, gives your hair a little body and shine with each application.  Washes out, must use each hair wash, but, healthier than using  permanent colors.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why no one carries this shade in any of the Fort Smith Wal-Marts or Walgreen or Target.  You can only get frivolous fawn.  Someone recommended that I try your site and was glad I did.  This product works very well at hiding gray.  I am a natural medium blonde but am beginning to get a lot of gray and this product works really well.</li>
    <li> This temporary color squirts on to give a little personality to your dull, grey hair. This ash blonde color takes the brassy out of grey and gives a soft luminous color. Cheap like borscht, have used it for years. It&#x27;s an end run around the shelves of pretty boxes of hair dye that just last a few weeks and then need re-application.  Application leaves your hair soft and supple like a rinse should be. Doesn&#x27;t change the quality of your hair at all. I love this product and this color.</li>
