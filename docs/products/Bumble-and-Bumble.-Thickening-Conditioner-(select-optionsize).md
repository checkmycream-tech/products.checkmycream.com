      <li>Awesome for oily fine hair</li>
      <li>bought this because i loved sample.  </li>
      <li>but I do use color and used this because it was supposed to be good for treated hair.  </li>
      <li>so I thought this would be good.  </li>

      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I have found a product that I will use FOREVER- the conditioner is light, and perfect for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner because I had used the shampoo and liked the smell.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was not as speedy as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Buy this kind of item in a store</li>
      <li>and I liked what it did with my hair</li>
      <li>Yes, it smells nice, but like another reviewer mentioned, I prefer a product that does what it says.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, medium length hair.  </li>
      <li>It worked great the first 2 days I used it.  </li>
      <li>I have thinning, very fine hair and using the thickening conditioner with a volumizing shampoo has made me feel better about my hair and</li>
      <li>This is one of the better conditioners</li>
      <li>I got better results from John Frieda....</li>
      <li>I have used these products for many years as they help my hair retain its&#x27; body.</li>
      <li>and I have tried most of the volume products out there.  </li>
      <li>I even tried using more of it – still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>so I am just going to get on with it and return to my favorite Biolage detangling solution.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love the B&amp;B thickening shampoo</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have used it a couple of times and it seems to be OK.</li>
      <li>I Love this product because it helps keep my hair conditioned and not so fly away and also helps with the thickness and the feel of thicker hair, THank you, would highly recommend both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice and full.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than all of the other conditioners - best if used with the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair healthy, full of volume and the smell is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>My hair is on the fine side and colored...</li>
      <li>and you will have smooth manageable hair.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner for its lovely fragrance and its softening properties, and when I rinse it from my hair, my hair feels feather-light (and residue-less) right away.</li>
      <li>The only positive side that I can think of is that it has a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>By far, this is the best conditioner I have found for my limp hair.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair.</li>
      <li>Not this one, for me it is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>conditioner does not leave my hair greasy and it makes it more manageable and soft</li>
      <li>all right.  </li>
      <li>I go back to this conditioner, and Bam, my beautiful hair is back.</li>
      <li>Makes hair thick and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>Given my experience, you shouldn&#x27;t judge any product upon first use.</li>
      <li>When I started using this conditioner, along with the coordinating shampoo, they really did make my hair feel thicker.</li>
      <li>at a much lower price.  </li>
      <li>It really softens the hair, but not too much.</li>
      <li>I expected much more from Bumble Bumble.</li>
      <li>really doesn&#x27;t moisten as well as I was told it would.</li>
      <li>now i&#x27;m wondering if this is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>However, if you need an arsenal of products to get you through the day, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find very satisfactory results using this particular conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like someone filled up their empty bottle with another brand of conditioner.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my new</li>
      <li>This new formula doesn&#x27;t work one bit.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>The products I use are somewhat heavy and the more I use, the more my hair loses the volume that the conditioner gave it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, shoulder length, this is only good if you want to look good in pictures, it works but the texture it leaves on my hair is gummy, stiff and awful.</li>
      <li>I still see volume when I only use one (or two very) lightweight product(s), but after that it goes downhill.    </li>
      <li>Either the product is old or it has been repackaged.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and processed but this conditioner makes it feel like silk and also it thickens your hair</li>
      <li>And this product just makes it completely unmanageable.  </li>
      <li>As a woman with very thin and fine hair, I will do anything for my hair to look like I have more than I do and not lay flat on my head showing my scalp.  </li>
      <li>It smells different, is a different color, much thicker than REAL Bumble conditioner, totally different.  </li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble Super Rich conditioner provided much better results, but I can get the same results with other, much less expensive products.</li>
      <li>I have thick, but fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair and because it needs lots of moisture and conditioning, it tends to be weighed down a lot and hence not very voluminous.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, straight hair that is prone to split ends due to frequent use of a blowdrier - this conditioner has really helped cut down on the split ends...</li>
      <li>They are expensive, but honestly, the only ones I have found that give me volume...</li>
      <li>The other product was truyly amazing, but this new formula they have does not do anything to my hair and it smells pretty bad too.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair</li>
      <li>In short, if you have low-maintence hair that simply happens to be flat, and you want thick, soft, fluffy hair, I would strongly recommend this conditioner to you.</li>

<li> If I do not use any products on my hair after conditioning, my mane becomes surprisingly soft, poofy and thick, even when only air-dried (I haven&#x27;t tried blow-drying yet, but it would probably give me an afro!).</li>
<li> and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to give me volume without weighing my hair down.</li>
<li> Usually the color is very white and this had a yellow tinge to it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I started using this conditioner, along with the coordinating shampoo, they really did make my hair feel thicker. But lately, not so much....</li>
    <li> Makes hair thick and beautiful. Love this product! Hair feels like just done at a salon.  Def recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> bought this because i loved sample.  now i&#x27;m wondering if this is the real thing.  Results not the same, will give another&lt;br /&gt;try.  Maybe left on too long?  hair is almost flat.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair and because it needs lots of moisture and conditioning, it tends to be weighed down a lot and hence not very voluminous. I bought this conditioner for its lovely fragrance and its softening properties, and when I rinse it from my hair, my hair feels feather-light (and residue-less) right away. If I do not use any products on my hair after conditioning, my mane becomes surprisingly soft, poofy and thick, even when only air-dried (I haven&#x27;t tried blow-drying yet, but it would probably give me an afro!). However, this may be a con for some people (including myself) because I need to use other products to control my curls. The products I use are somewhat heavy and the more I use, the more my hair loses the volume that the conditioner gave it. I still see volume when I only use one (or two very) lightweight product(s), but after that it goes downhill.    In short, if you have low-maintence hair that simply happens to be flat, and you want thick, soft, fluffy hair, I would strongly recommend this conditioner to you. However, if you need an arsenal of products to get you through the day, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find very satisfactory results using this particular conditioner.</li>
    <li> By far, this is the best conditioner I have found for my limp hair.  Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s conditioner does not leave my hair greasy and it makes it more manageable and soft yet my hair had body too.  Usually conditioners weigh my hair down.  Not this one, for me it is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a timely manner, as promised, and I PAYED LESS!  I will continue to use this vendor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now. I have previously purchased it at beauty salons. I thought I would get it from Amazon to save a little money since B&amp;B is so expensive. I believe that I was sold a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; B&amp;B Thickening Condition. It&#x27;s like someone filled up their empty bottle with another brand of conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, the texture isn&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;m still using it because I have it, but I will NEVER again buy a product that can be refilled on Amazon. Be very wary. Buy this kind of item in a store so you know what you are getting. I believe I was scammed.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have thin hair, and this product really did give my hair a thicker feeling, and my hair seems to look healthier every time I use it.  I would recommend it to anyone that has very thin and fine hair like me.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product all the time before 2011, but then I got a bottle online that didn&#x27;t smell or look the same texture, so I thought it was fake, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I went into Salons that are validated by Bumble and Bumble site in Houston and saw that it was the same type of product that I had just gotten at home, so they changed the formula! This new formula doesn&#x27;t work one bit. The other product was truyly amazing, but this new formula they have does not do anything to my hair and it smells pretty bad too.  I am so disappointed at this brand and product- that never again will I buy from them.</li>
    <li> I bought this because they ran out of my usual Biolage product in the store.  So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I thought for the price, it&#x27;s gotta be doing something.      Given my experience, you shouldn&#x27;t judge any product upon first use. So I gave Bumble and Bumble thickening conditioner a week.  Now I can say for certain that I absolutely am not impressed by it.  In fact, I hate the way it makes my hair feel.  I have never truly understood the meaning of \\&quot;fly away hair\\&quot; until this week.  Yes with this conditioner my hair is flying everywhere all right.  I have thick hair shaft but slightly thinning hair (big hair strand but not a lot of it, if you know what I mean).  And this product just makes it completely unmanageable.  It does not create any volume, it make my hair hard to hold style.  The only positive side that I can think of is that it has a pleasant smell.  But it is not a top priority to me when it comes to hair products-- I want GOOD hair, not just PLEASANTLY PERFUMED hair.       I wish I could return this useless, expensive bottle of goo.  But I can&#x27;t, so I am just going to get on with it and return to my favorite Biolage detangling solution.</li>
    <li> B&amp;B is all I use for my hair...Great stuff but pricey!</li>
    <li> I love the B&amp;B thickening shampoo so I thought this would be good.  Guess not for me.  Made my hair harder to deal with.</li>
    <li> Increased the volume of my hair and detangled it. I love it and it&#x27;s my new have to hAve it.</li>
    <li> Great product to use with the thickening shampoo. Very moisturizing to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I like it better than all of the other conditioners - best if used with the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo. Delivery was not as speedy as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found that actually makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> For the price I expected at least some amount of noticeable difference in my fine,limp hair after using this product.  Instead, I could not see that it helped at all.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> The bumble and bumble conditioner is the worst conditioner I have ever used. It smells great &amp; looks great but does not condition your hair at all. Very difficult to get a comb through it no matter how long you let it sit on your hair. I even tried using more of it – still didn&#x27;t work. Regret buying it &amp; would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is NOT  Bumble &amp; Bumble product.  I have used the Thickening conditioner for 6 months now, usually purchased from a salon, but for convenience I purchased it online.  It smells different, is a different color, much thicker than REAL Bumble conditioner, totally different.  I suspect it&#x27;s been repackaged.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I have been using it for years.  I have tried other brands, to save money, always with the same results:  Greasy Hair, pimply neck, yucky texture.  I go back to this conditioner, and Bam, my beautiful hair is back.</li>
    <li> These thickening products are terrible. I have used the shampoo and conditioner together on and off months now, so I&#x27;m leaving this review for both products.  Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair. There is NO way to comb through my hair after using these products (without ripping it all out) unless I use yet another twenty dollar Bumble and Bumble product (the Prep spray). And even then, as the day wears on my ends get all ratty and knotty.  This does not happen with any other hair care product that I have ever used. I have very fine, medium length hair.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great hair conditioner.  My hair is on the fine side and colored...so I need to thicken while treating it with care.  I love this conditioner.  It leaves my hair healthy, full of volume and the smell is fantastic!  It is expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product just dried out my hair, leaving me with fly-away frizzes that had to be managed with other products. It didn&#x27;t seem to provide any noticeable thickening qualities. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Bumble and Bumble Super Rich conditioner provided much better results, but I can get the same results with other, much less expensive products.</li>
    <li> My thin hair feels oily and heavy.</li>
    <li> I have found a product that I will use FOREVER- the conditioner is light, and perfect for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist turned me onto B&amp;B Thickening products. As a woman with very thin and fine hair, I will do anything for my hair to look like I have more than I do and not lay flat on my head showing my scalp.  This line of products do just that.  They are expensive, but honestly, the only ones I have found that give me volume...and I have tried most of the volume products out there.  Try the mouse too...I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to give me volume without weighing my hair down. The shampoo that goes with it works awesome too. Smell is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> I would never purchase this again. It appears to leave a residue on each hair shaft. Makes your hair feel like &amp;#34;doll&#x27;s hair&amp;#34;. If you want hair that feels like a wig, you probably would like it...</li>
    <li> This is one of the better conditioners/detanglers I&#x27;ve ever come across. I have fine, thin, straight hair that is prone to split ends due to frequent use of a blowdrier - this conditioner has really helped cut down on the split ends...</li>
    <li> really doesn&#x27;t moisten as well as I was told it would. Leaves my hair feeling a bit dry and brittle as well as hard to style.</li>
    <li> great price for 2 bottles of conditioner - glad that I found this price online cause this conditioner is so darn expensive.</li>
    <li> I Love this product because it helps keep my hair conditioned and not so fly away and also helps with the thickness and the feel of thicker hair, THank you, would highly recommend both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The conditioner is great. It does exactly what it claims to do. Fragrance is on the light side but it works perfect.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this in her shop and I liked what it did with my hair&lt;br /&gt;so I bought it.  It really softens the hair, but not too much.</li>
    <li> I have used B&amp;B conditioner for years. When I received this I immediately noticed the color was off. Usually the color is very white and this had a yellow tinge to it. When I opened the bottle it didn&#x27;t have the same smell. Either the product is old or it has been repackaged. I have used it a couple of times and it seems to be OK.</li>
    <li> The Thickening Conditioner leaves my hair weighed down and impossible to deal with.  When I use this product, then style my hair, it always looks like it needs to be washed.</li>
    <li> Smells good and leaves my hair soft.  The shampoo and conditioner combo seems to be working for my thin hair.  It does appear thicker!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner from a salon.  It worked great the first 2 days I used it.  Then the longer I used it, the worse it felt.  My ends got dry and split and I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through it.  After a couple of weeks of using it I am going out today to buy something else.  I wish I did not have a giant bottle of this.  I expected much more from Bumble Bumble.</li>
    <li> I have thick, but fine hair.  I have used these products for many years as they help my hair retain its&#x27; body.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I can understand, but a cream rinse? I don&#x27;t think that this one is any different from an ordinary product. Silly to pay the extra.</li>
    <li> Ended up not liking this product at all. It made my hair really dry and not really that thick at all.</li>
    <li> Great to keep your hair shiny and still have lift. I have used this product for over five years and plan to continue. This seller&#x27;s price was great too.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I had used the shampoo and liked the smell.  Usually conditioners are life savers, they create a manageable soft head of hair rather than a tangled  mess.  This conditioner, however, did not deliver.  After using it, my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it.  Yes, it smells nice, but like another reviewer mentioned, I prefer a product that does what it says.  My hair is not fine but I do use color and used this because it was supposed to be good for treated hair.  No thanks.  I got better results from John Frieda....at a much lower price.  These BB products are way overpriced for the quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best.  No matter how damaged or tangled your hair is, one application and you will have smooth manageable hair.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  My hair is naturally curly and processed but this conditioner makes it feel like silk and also it thickens your hair so it&#x27;s nice and full.  Never greasy.  I love it !!</li>
    <li> its good if you like your hair to feel like straw. I hate this product. dont waste your money. I have fine hair, shoulder length, this is only good if you want to look good in pictures, it works but the texture it leaves on my hair is gummy, stiff and awful.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have thinning, very fine hair and using the thickening conditioner with a volumizing shampoo has made me feel better about my hair and the way it looks.  I was happy to find the product through Amazon so I didn&#x27;t have to go from salon to salon to find it.</li>
    <li> Awesome for oily fine hair</li>
