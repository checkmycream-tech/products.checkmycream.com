      <li>Received product with instructions and found it easy to assemble with no problems...excited about it being compact on wheels with many compartments and easy to conceal draws to the compartments, so it&#x27;s out of view when clients are being served.</li>
      <li>I love it and can lock it up if needed to keep items secure.</li>
      <li>The drawers slide in easily, but will also slide ALL the way out easily too.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who just finished Cosmo school and starting her first job as a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;She is vary happy with it, and it is just what she needed according to her.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy so dad is happy.</li>
    <li> I love this item! It&#x27;s perfect for storing all makeup and beauty essentials! The only problem I encountered was one of the drawers were cracked when I received the item, but I put a little super glue on the crack and it fixed it right up!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who recently got her cosmitology license.  She uses it at home to keep the supplies she uses for her own hair as well as when she is working with family members.  It is small enough that is doesn&#x27;t take up too much room and the wheels allow for easy repositioning.</li>
    <li> Taranto rollabout trolley is compact and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> took awhile to receive my trolley but im extremely satisfied now that i have it!! i would order again! Thank you amazon!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this trolley.  It was super easy to put together.  It is a few inches taller than the other trolleys and this is good for me because I am a tall girl.  Great product and great price. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 trolleys. After almost 2 weeks I received 1 trolley. I immediately emailed the company and they were nice and emailed me back that night. They sent out the 2nd trolley. My boyfriend put them together for me. They look nice and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Set up easy. Sturdy, rolls easily.  Was a gift for my daughter.  She was so excited. Can&#x27;t wait for her first customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item last year, so its been over 6 months.  It is well made and durable.  I&#x27;ve had no issues. It is amazing the amount of things it can hold.  The compartments are great.  I don&#x27;t have visible clutter in my dresser or bathroom cabinets anymore.  All my make-up and hairstyling products are in this rollabout holder.  It is compact enough to store inside my closet and I just roll it out when I need to.  It&#x27;s a great tool.  Everything I need is in one place. I would purchase again if I EVER need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality.. Just ok</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know that I could find better quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Received product with instructions and found it easy to assemble with no problems...excited about it being compact on wheels with many compartments and easy to conceal draws to the compartments, so it&#x27;s out of view when clients are being served.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and sturdy. Just what I needed for a great price!</li>
    <li> I chose this product based on some of the reviews as well as the price and lockable feature.  The product arrived at my door in two days.  Everything was wrapped in bubble wrap and nothing was broken or missing.  I was able to put this together in about 20 minutes without any problems.  Everything fit together like it should.  I am only giving this four stars at the moment because it hasn&#x27;t been used yet and I want to give it some time for a proper evaluation.</li>
    <li> The material sucks, don&#x27;t worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for worse came with a drawer and other broken parts..........for the same price i got another one at sallys.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed this, i recived it in a timnley manner but i guess threw the mailing, it was broken. i was able to glue the pice back on and not had any problems with it. i would come back and get the same products from you</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was for a hairstylist so she could keep her equipment and products in this at home. So far it seems to be made of a good hard plastic. It is nice to have it come with 4 trays to put in the cart. The side compartments hold many things too. Very pratical for everyone even just for storage!</li>
    <li> This is really nice...easy to put together and a real asset...I love that it has places to put my curling iron and blow dryer..love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when we opened the box, not only did we find that a few of the bolts and screws included for assembly were the wrong size, a few of the drawers were broken. Not small cracks/scratches broken, I mean that the entire bottom of the tray was in shambles. In addition, we had to go purchase replacement screws, and figure out how to make them work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I ordered this as a gift for my hair stylist mother, it should be obvious that I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed. She&#x27;s decided to keep it anyway-she doesn&#x27;t feel like waiting for a replacement/refund after all the work already put in-but I caution you to avoid this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was just the tray, I&#x27;d blame FedEx for terrible treatment during shipping, but the box didn&#x27;t even include enough correct screws. That can only be the seller&#x27;s doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth your time or money, you&#x27;d be better looking somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I had all my things in different drawers, in the bathroom, in a basket, uuggghhh, all over the place. Now everything is conveniently put away. Enough room for all my things. It was easy to put together, it took about 15-20 minutes. I love it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love these!!! They ce super fast and easy to put together. I actually bought 5 then came back and bought more!</li>
    <li> It was a big hit as a gift for my step-daughter.  She loves it. all of her stuff fits in it and loves the fact that it locks. Looks great!!</li>
    <li> Not a cosmetologist here--just a Mom that has lots of make-up/hair stuff and no space in her bathroom. This is a great space saver for those of you that are just looking to organize your bathroom and don&#x27;t have any storage cabinets/drawers like me. It keeps everything off of the countertop (including my blow dryer and flat iron) and at least everything is put away and neat looking when I leave in the morning. It has caster wheels so when we have company--rather than leave it in the bathroom for the occasional house tour-I just wheel it into my closet for hiding. I also like the lock capability to keep my young daughters from playing in Mommy&#x27;s make-up...Didn&#x27;t we all do this when we were younger? I bet my Mom wished she would have had one of these to lock up her make-up when I was little :)</li>
    <li> Difficult to put together, came damaged, hard to slide doors closed. Would not recommend. Will be sening the item back.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for and more, very roomy and very sturdy!! Great storage for any teenagers room! :)</li>
    <li> This cart was great for the price.  I liked how easy it was to put together, and it has been a good cart in my at-home salon.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> We have 15 at my salon</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife.  It freed up a lot of space on my side of the vainity.  Win win ;0)</li>
    <li> It first didn&#x27;t come with a lock then i had called them back to send me a new one they did but the rollabout has two locks one on top and one on the bottom but when they sent me new ones they only sent me one lock</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, works great. No issues and fast delivery. Would recommend to anyone. Very lightweight, so be careful how much cargo you pile in.</li>
    <li> My rolling beaty salon; keeps my bathroom from getting cluttered.  Conviently stores makeup, toiletries and hair products. I love it and can lock it up if needed to keep items secure.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product for the price. It was a bit smaller that I thought it would be (should have looked at the measurements) but for the most part it works for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to better organize myself in a small bathroom area. I saw a few complaints but took a leap and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;All parts came in tact, instructions were pretty easy to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I had is putting it together without breaking anything. I got lucky and didn&#x27;t but I had to take it out of my husbands hands and do it myself. If you as I call it &amp;#34;man-handle it&amp;#34; while putting it together you WILL break it. Once it&#x27;s together your golden though. Other con is that it was more petite than I would like, drawers are not deep at all so if you have a ton of stuff be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to woman with small areas that just want to get organized and to college kids for their small dorm rooms.</li>
    <li> Great rollabout really sturdy easy to assemble ... Has a lot of room to put ure&lt;br /&gt;Product !!!! N a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law owns and operates a salon and absolutely loved this rolling trolley. She really liked the appliance holder and the lockable feature.</li>
    <li> The cart was easy to ensemble and the space to keep hair salon appliances&lt;br /&gt;and implements is enough. The appliances holders on the side come very handy&lt;br /&gt;and accessible during clients procedures.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very Helpul in organizing items for 2 daughters.  For being made of plastic, it went together easily, and seems well made for a plastic trolley.  Bottles of hairspray fit on the exterior bottom racks, so if you have those really tall ones that some people love to use, they should fit.  I took out the curved tray on the side, and just left the side insert, because it has a bottom shelf at the spot where it curves down towards the side, and it is another place to store styling aids.  The drawers slide in easily, but will also slide ALL the way out easily too.  There is a gap between slots for drawers, so items in the drawers do not need to fit exactly inside because of this extra room.  I am using one drawer for headbands, and they want to mound up in the drawer but this is not a problem since the drawers do not touch.&lt;br /&gt;  My only complaint is that this only comes with 4 drawers and I can&#x27;t seem to find a source for any more drawers.  This trolley could fit 6 drawers, but comes with 4 drawers.  This is not something that is a huge problem, since without the two extra drawers there is room to store a box, or bulkier item.  I plan to look for 2 more drawers or look for a suitable alternative to the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, this seems like it will function well, and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and as described.</li>
    <li> My hair stylits love this trolley. I already purchase 3 and will be changing the other ones from the salon.</li>
    <li> Product Was exactly what I ordered. I  love that it locks, easy to put together, and wheels move easily around</li>
    <li> I was very impressed.... Nice and sturdy.. Was easy to assemble  I would buy again and I am very picky!!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product for the money. It is just the right size to keep all my hair supplies in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only challenge is with the \\&quot;snap on\\&quot; side compartments, they just don&#x27;t stay on like they should so I had to reinforce them with glue.</li>
    <li> I am not a stylist, but I do have a lot of makeup and hair products that used to clutter up my vanity. I also have a lot of heat tools for my hair and I never knew how to keep them organized and neat. Enter Taranto Rollabout Trolley. I received and assembled it two days ago but i has already revolutionized my daily routine. I was concerned that I would get a broken piece after reading the negative reviews but everything came intact! I did order it with prime two day shipping through the Salon Guys so maybe the faster shipping speed prevented any wear and tear along the way. Assembly is a bit tricky, but not too hard. I love the spots with metal inserts to safely put all my heat tools and the metal ring that can go on either side, which I use to hold my hair dryer. The locks are a great feature too, to keep little ones from getting into makeup or other potentially toxic items. The rolling feature will also be very useful for me on days I want to get ready in the bathroom instead of sitting at the vanity in my room. Great buy. I would buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this years ago for someone and had to assemble it. The instructions were not clear enough and the product felt like was made of cheap plastic. To add to ordeal, I was a few screws short. I ended up thinking outside the box and enhanced the product as best as I could.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with high hopes, and I was SO wrong! I am a hairstylist and in need of a trolley like this one, for tomorrow - I am in a COMPETITION! The idea is a great one, but very cheaply constructed. I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and everything is fitting together pretty well - but TWO of the FOUR bolts that hold the thing together (are located on the top tray) do not work. And TWO of the FOUR wheels do not work. Which makes it impossible to \\&quot;ROLL-ABOUT\\&quot; - duh! Also, one of the side compartments do not fit flush with the bottom piece. Total disaster. If it were better made, it would have been perfect. I highly recommend ordering from somewhere else. I called the company today to tell them what was going on, and the representative \\&quot;Erica\\&quot; told me to fax her a copy of the instruction sheet - cirlce what was wrong - and they would send me out new parts. Another week of waiting. She seemed monotone when she told me this , like it happens often! I would like my money back honestly, because I am going to have to purchase another rollabout. It does me no good if I can&#x27;t move it around my client, as I move around to work on them. And I can&#x27;t even carry it to the salon - because the top shelf is not attached - thus, everything else is loose. Bummed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because mainly the price and it&#x27;s practicality for what I needed. It looks nicer in person but if you are looking for something super sturdy &#x27;body&#x27; wise then get something else like wood.  I needed this more for storage and a top to hold my color bowls while doing services. The only issues I had with this is one wheel didn&#x27;t screw in properly, like the threads were stripped. I took the bottom apart and reversed the nut and it worked perfect!! The other was the locking system with the top section. It has two notches on the locking bar that make it hard to open the when unlocked. So I took them off. Now the whole thing works perfect. Yes, I would recommend this but you may need a Macgyver! ;)</li>
    <li> Had this product for 1 month and the wheel broke off causing it to completely fall over. Dealing with company and will have to try to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> very good for tools that one doesn&#x27;t want others to know what is in this roll about. Two LOCKABLE compartments on wheels...AH</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife who recently became a certified esthetician. It&#x27;s perfect for her home practicing when she&#x27;s not working at a salon. She loves the product and it stores all of her supplies perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this review 4 stars, only because the product came with a defected part.&lt;br /&gt;To counter that, the company was quick with a response and shipped me a new part right away at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly recommend this for someone who is just starting out with a home practice, or for the casual person wanting to organize small items.</li>
    <li> I bought this for personal use to organize all of my styling tools and products. I love it! My bathrooms is so much more organized and the wheels are awesome so I can move around wherever I want!</li>
    <li> This trolley is very sturdy and handy to have.  Lots of storage space and durable.  I&#x27;m very happy I ordered this.</li>
    <li> I bought this even though the reviews said some pieces came cracked. I hoped I would be lucky, but I wasnt. 2 out of 4 drawers and a side compartment were cracked. I have contacted the seller, so just waiting on the response. I hope they can just replace the pieces. I don&#x27;t want to have to return the whole thing!&lt;br /&gt;  Its really nice otherwise. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
    <li> Perfect. I use to lock and store my makeup and hair products from my little ones. Very nice especially for price. very convienent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who always left her straightener on the carpet floor and I was afraid she would one day burn down the house, and she loved it!  She was able to put her blow dryer, straightener and curling iron in the sockets and has plenty of storage for her nail polish, hair accessories, fragrances...etc...</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever .I&#x27;m very please with the order and  everything in the box  are intact non broken or missing and for the price,this seem like a very good buy.Those negative reviews ,seem they ordered from a bad seller.I got mine from &amp;#34;The Salon Guys &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Very professional,and quality shipment.Will buy again.Thanks</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and the product works great. I have no trouble with it and the price was reasonable when i brought it.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. My co-workers want to get it too.  It was easy to make it.I can&#x27;t believe this price, very cheap for very good material.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend to hair stylist. I love my new trolley.</li>
    <li> There were so many pieces of broken plastic parts inside, I assembled the best I could because I needed it NOW.  But buyer beware.</li>
    <li> If any of you have teenage daughters that have a hard time keeping all of their hair and beauty supplies organized, you should really consider getting something like this.  My daughter absolutely loves it, and so do I!  How often do we gripe at them to keep all of their stuff organized?  But how can they do that without a way or actually organize it?  That is where I decided to get her this.  She enjoys it because her grandma is a hair stylist and now she gets to use something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes a very thoughtful gift and a practical addition to any teenage girl&#x27;s bedroom!</li>
    <li> Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You guys outdid yourselves.  This cart was packed perfectly.  I assembled it myself.  Yay.  My co-worker got the some cart.  You are my first choice in future purchases.  Thank you so much.  This is very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it worked okay but upon receiving the rollabout in the mail, it was already broken. Got sent new pieces for free. Made of plastic, broke within a couple months. Not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the trolley looking cheap and tacky, but it looks pretty good! Super easy to assemble, as long as you can read directions.</li>
    <li> Cart is perfect. Exactly what I needed. Is very durable, lots of space. Comes with holders for your appliances. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Very useful in my barbershop for my equipment and products!!! I Definitely love the storage space and the fact that you can lock it up while you not there!!! So I&#x27;m definitely suggesting Taranto if that is what you need for those thing!!!</li>
    <li> Love this trolley! The only thing wrong is on the top where it screws into the base, two of them would not screw in so I can not lift it from the top. Also one of the drawers cracked.</li>
    <li> This product works great for the price.  it did have a few issues like in other reviews of the drawers not sliding closed well and the door that comes down to lock is a little flimsy but all in all it serves the purpose.  I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter who attends tech school and is in the hairdressing program and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Finally the trolley arrived after (very slow shipping) 15 days. I found that the base and one of the drawers are cracked. Though they are still usable I find that it is probably easier to deal with the cracked items then to pay for shipping and then have them take a few more weeks to send it back and I don&#x27;t even have faith in them that the new item won&#x27;t be cracked either. All in all I could have spent the eighty dollars making one that is perfect for my needs and is much more durable and has more room. By the way it is very small. The only thing good about it is that it takes away some of the clutter that was on my main stand and makes my main stand look more neat and organized because I have somewhere to put the other things I don&#x27;t use that often onto.</li>
    <li> The cart was a gift for my cosmetology student daughter. She and her class loved all the features of the cart. Son-in-law said it was easy to put together. Delivery time was fabulous. Other students wanted order info, so I got back on Amazon, and lo and behold!!!! the price was dropped by 20 bucks!</li>
    <li> perfect for my art supplies this is such a great container!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to build and very useful.</li>
    <li> The Taranto Lockable Rollabout Trolley is not as cheap as other trolleys.  The only thing that is an inconvenience is the wire bars that hold product on the side of the trolleys did not quite fit the hold, had to improvise.</li>
    <li> Came in great. No cracks or damages. Easy to assemble. Very durable.</li>
    <li> I love this cart!  It was exactly what I needed for storing all of my hair care items.  I live in a townhome where every bit of storage space is precious.  All of my hair care items were spread throughout the two bathroom vanities upstairs.  I hated having to dig through either of them to find things, so I ordered this cart.  It is the perfect size to hold everything, and was very easy to put together.  It sits on the wall next to my bathroom door, and can be easily moved to ino the bathroom when needed.  I love that everything is centrally located now.  If I were to make any changes to the cart, it would be to have a power strip attached, or at least some way provided for one to be attached.  It&#x27;s not a really big issue, but would be convenient.</li>
