<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not that great of quality, you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good and really soft. Blends both cream and liquid foundations very well. Great product. Five star was not given because I received one of the brushes with the top of it off but nothing my glue gun couldn&#x27;t fix. I am satisfied with the performance of these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes very good quality brushes very similar to my 60$ Mac brushes I would order again LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably soft. Smells funky when you first open the packaging but it&#x27;s not unbearable- and washes out. Not sigma dupes, these brushes are less dense..but honestly, for the price, this deal is great! I love the round top brush the most- the flat top is nice too, but a little flimsy when blending foundation out. I like the tapered brush for highlighting, that one is my second favorite. Overall, very great quality brushes- esp. if you don&#x27;t want to spend loads of money for makeup brushes! i had no problem with shedding (so far) and they look sleek.</li>
    <li> These brushes are spectacular!  They rival any high end brand brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and having worked in a store with all the brands, I have tried them all!!  Truly soft and beautiful brushes that give you beautiful make up coverage without waste or fallout.  Got them super fast as well!!</li>
    <li> Brushes glides make-up on smooth.... For a brush set of this quality, you usually would spend oh so much more. Amazing buy, great product, extremely happy!</li>
    <li> The brushes came apart within 5 months of use.  The gold from the black broke apart as the glue came apart.  It&#x27;s great for the price; however, do not expect it to last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I AM BLOWN AWAY. These. These are amazing! Seriously.. when I read the reviews I was excited to order and now that I have them in my hands I am EVEN MORE excited to write this review. These brushes are exactly what I have been looking for. They are AMAZING quality -- for $10.00. I can&#x27;t even believe these are $10.00. I hope I don&#x27;t run into any flaws with these because I am beyond happy with my purchase. Thank you for such a great product! :)</li>
    <li> I really loved these brushes. They apply make up extremely well and they&#x27;re all individually packaged to keep the brushes neat while they&#x27;re being shipped. I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I had my old brushes for many years, and just finally decided to replace them. I&#x27;m so happy I did, because these brushes are awesome!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes and most work very well (haven&#x27;t tried all yet).  My only complaint is that when you use the foundation brush, it leaves the make-up very streaky on your face.  I had to use a different brush to blend it all out properly so be careful (maybe it was something I did or didn&#x27;t do).  Overall, they are great brushes and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. Wash first to get the funky smell off but they ate wonderful. I use them everyday</li>
    <li> they shade bad and they not as big as the picture make it look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle and soft on skin, it blends my makeup perfectly.</li>
    <li> Brushes came way earlier than expected, and are excellent quality. My favorite kabuki brush set so far, and I&#x27;ve had many. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! Great quality for a low price. I must admit, they work better than the brushes I got from Mac. Unlike those brushes, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face. It also blends my eye shadow wonderfully. I would most definitely recommend this product without hesitation. I&#x27;m thinking of buying a set for my sisters..as they are big-time make-up junkies, and I&#x27;m sure they will appreciate it even though they already have those expensive ones. I think they just might like these more! I am so happy and impressed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> AWESOME quality brushes! So soft and nice quality.  Good deal for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Definitely a worth while perchance they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed, I&#x27;m so glad I bought these!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!These are high quality brushes and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes in the mail. They are very soft but have a stronh chemical smell. I can deal with that. I will give them a good wash. Anyway they are cut quite choppy. It looks like there are chunks taken out of the hairs. I tried a few and they seen to apply powder products very well. All in all Im not 100% satisfied with my purchase and would recommend paying a little extra for some jessup brushes similar to these. They aren&#x27;t terrible but you can tell by the way they are cut they aren&#x27;t made very well. I will use them for now until I decide to purchase a more well known brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! All 8 came in and are so soft and amazing to use! Definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Love this brushes ..they on fleek</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and easy to clean. 3 of the handles have already broken off.  I&#x27;ve used them twice.  I&#x27;ll be gluing them together again.  But really that should NOT be necessary.</li>
    <li> Amazing absolutely amazing couldn&#x27;t be the price and they apply make-up so well. They are so so so soft a bit smelly but I&#x27;m sure after I wash them a couple times it will be ok but I am super happy!</li>
    <li> i love make up and these brushes are a lifesaver with so many purposes my only concern is that there is a minimal loss of hairs but thats usually typical with any brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing Brushes for a damn good Price !</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Wish I was able to pick the ones I wanted because I only use three of them.</li>
    <li> I just received my package today ,so I haven&#x27;t tried them on my face yet , but I also own the sigma brushes and just by feeling the bristles on these new brushes I can&#x27;t compare them to the sigma brushes . These are much less dense , but they are super soft . They seem like any regular makeup brush to me , so I guess they are good enough.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great to apply makeup, goes on smooth. unfortunately I had a few of the brushes break from the handle.</li>
    <li> Love them.  Very soft, and quite well made.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. They apply my makeup excellently and smoothly. I&#x27;ll totally recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are a great value for the price. I love the variety of brushes and the variety of brush sizes. There is a brush for various make up applications.</li>
    <li> Great deal on make up brushes! Nice brushes</li>
    <li> 2 of my brushes were broken</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty good, not as dense as I thought they would be. They get the job done though.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes a lot, looks just like the picture. I just wish the bristles were stronger.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! Just as good as Sigma brushes</li>
    <li> To my surprise, these brushes arrived fairly quickly. I absolutely LOVE these brushes! I have been looking for some good foundation buffing brushes that were inexpensive and I decided to give these a try. These brushes are perfect for blending and controuring! I highly recommend. I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few weeks now, so far so good!!</li>
    <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t really what I expected. I have been using them for the last few weeks and the only brush that hasn&#x27;t broke or had an issue with it, is the flat top which I use to apply my foundation. One of the brushes came apart in the package so when I opened it, it was already in 2 pieces. I guess you get what you pay for, I will be buying new brushes soon. Oh, I also emailed the seller to tell them about the broken brush when I received the package, and haven&#x27;t heard back</li>
    <li> Ordered these a few days ago &amp; already received them. Super soft, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet. I wish the brushes were labeled. I also didn&#x27;t receive them in a bag like I read other people did.</li>
    <li> Love it so much just what i needed for my foundation ♡♡♡ fast shipping</li>
    <li> The eye brushes have lased but I only have 1 of the face brushes left because the rest broke :(</li>
    <li> Got hairs all over my face first time I used these! The bristles were not connected tightly and came out onto my face with each stroke!! Very annoying!</li>
    <li> Amazing at blending out liquid and mineral foundation evenly across your face. They are amazing brushes and synthetic so they dont soak up product (: they do shed but all brushes shed even my really expensive ones but dont let that stop you from buying this product they are truly worth it and have many uses (:</li>
    <li> Brushes broken when i opened the package</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes.  I do not have as much use for the small brushes, but was a great buy.  These brushes will get lot&#x27;s of use!</li>
    <li> It works just grate, really soft! Lovre them</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup brushes. Thick and high quality. Really suggest buying these instead of the ones at the stores</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes today, and I LOVE them! They are so soft and very heavy duty! They apply great to your face! The only bad thing I have to say it... They smell really bad when you get them, but I washed them right away.. And thy don&#x27;t smell bad anymore! I own some Mac brushes and I have to say there are just the same, maybe even better!! Great price! I will be buying more for my friends!!</li>
    <li> Lasted for about 2 months before the kabuki flat top and slanted broke off the handle, otherwise the quality of brush was great!!!</li>
    <li> The handles fell off within the first week of using them I was highly aggravated with the quality in these brushes</li>
    <li> Great brushes! They don&#x27;t shed!!!!  Great price !!! So happy I ordered these... put away all my other brushes from Mac  etc... I hated how all my other brushes would shed all the time! These brushes were a great find!</li>
    <li> The brushes were nice and the packaging was cute but I was looking for more eyeshadow brushes and these were too big!</li>
    <li> nice brushes for the money</li>
    <li> The brush broke away from the handle let than 2 weeks after using.</li>
    <li> These brushes were a surprise. They are soft &amp; feel similar to some of my Sigma brushes. This is a great beginner set.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t bad bad brushes... They work well. However one of the brushes was broken when I received it... The others are holding up okay so  far..</li>
    <li> These brushes will do, but they are not the best quality. They are good for basic makeup and soft enough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes</li>
    <li> Great deal! I always wanted makeup brushes, but not spend a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes came early, and I must say they feel great on the skin. Also, for me I really like the smell for some odd reason and which im not bothered by it.</li>
    <li> It works so perfect. I had ordered a Mary Kay brush but this kit works better.I love it plus its cheap for its quality.</li>
    <li> I initially bought these until I could afford the Tom Ford brushes I&#x27;d been eyeing, but now I no longer feel the need. I&#x27;ve owned high end to low end brushes, and these definitely do first class job. I&#x27;ve owned them for 2 months and they&#x27;ve not shed more than a hair or two each. The ferrule feels somewhat cheap &amp; gaudy but that&#x27;s not important to me personally, as I use them only on myself and teen daughters. Note: the bristles on the larger brushes are  too stiffly packed for my tastes, which I think is important because good makeup application requires a light hand. However, the bristles are soft to touch. The pointed larger brush is my favorite as it really allows for a more defined contour. In a rush I also shade the sides of my nose with it and it works well. I use the thinner brushes for eye makeup, specifically to blend the transition color. I&#x27;d highly recommend these for beginner to advanced alike.</li>
    <li> These brushes are overall really good. For the price they&#x27;re worth the buy. They&#x27;re very soft and some have multiple uses in one brush. Plus the shipping is pretty fast , arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes omggg !!!  I love them</li>
    <li> amazing brushes. just by looking at the package i thought they would shed but no. it applies makeup very well and for the price? can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start using brushes for applying my makeup instead of winging it as I&#x27;ve always done. I didn&#x27;t want to fork out serious cash though, buying better makeup does that by itself. So I set out for a middle ground starter set. This fit the bill nicely. It wasn&#x27;t a huge investment or anything, but they are quality in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t had any break yet, nor do the bristles fall out. They are sturdy and feel heavy in the hand. The bristles are soft too, perhaps not as soft as much more pricey brushes but they apply my makeup great.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they&#x27;re pretty much the exact same brushes as the RC Cosmetics ones but way less money. These brushes are also Very similar to a set on BH Cosmetics, only the BH cosmetic ones have a additional kabuki brush and the BH flat top kabuki brush has longer hairs. I have the BH cosmetics set as well as the RC Cosmetics set. If you do not have either I would get this one because the price is right and BH and RC Cosmetics are not exspensive brands what so ever but this set is cheaper than those sets.</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING quality for the price. I use them every single day. They wash well, hold their form and apply makeup nicely. No shedding!</li>
    <li> I use these brushes just about everyday. The quality is great. They&#x27;re very dense and great for blending. You can complete a full face of makeup with these as well. Very impressed with these brushes!</li>
    <li> I would have prefered the 10 set brushes to this 8 set.but its good anyway.cant wait to receive this order</li>
    <li> This is awesome, doea the job, but they brake easily.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  One of the handles have become loose, but other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes I was a bit scared to get a bad set of brushes luckily I didn&#x27;t the bristles are so soft haven&#x27;t give them a try because I they did had a really strong smell when I open the plastic bag I&#x27;m sure is the glue they use to stick all the bristle together, but other than that I am happy with my set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes promptly. I used them today and they work really well, blending the foundation and eye makeup beautifully. Thank you for your prompt service! Cheers!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but the metal end and brush separates from the wooden handle after a while.</li>
    <li> Came faster than I thought love them thanks!</li>
    <li> You get a lot of different brushes for a great price! They work great and are good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes! I am by no means a makeup artist nor do I even have much experience with makeup, I have been trying to get a little better with it and one thing a person needs to do that is brushes! I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend so much on a brush when I only really have to do my makeup a few times a week, so these really do the trick for $10. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now with no issues.</li>
    <li> These are nice and soft.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes they work very well i think its a great produt for the price and great at blending powderd foundation just wish they came with a case!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited at first bc brushes look nice and are really soft and full. Three broke and they don&#x27;t hold pigment that well. Tried ELF definitely much better quality</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and they&#x27;re great, very soft, brand new.</li>
    <li> Not even 1 week and the brushes and their wood handles have become unglued. Cheap pricing got me cheap handles on my brushes. The actual bristles are soft, but would I repurchase these? No.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about buying these brushes because they look too good to be true. I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for big fluffy brushes for foundation and powder makeup, but all the other ones i bought online just weren&#x27;t right. The brushes were not full and packed. When i got these brushes (on the first date of estimated delivery) i couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! They were the most perfect brushes that i could ask for. They are very full, and fluffy, the handle is made of wood so it&#x27;s very sturdy. They apply makeup so wonderfully and flawlessly. These brushes are perfect for everything you want from highlighting to contouring. I am so glad I got these; they are definitely worth the money. I totally recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love them! They were exactly as promised!</li>
    <li> The gold part and the handle came apart a week after I got them. So I gorilla glued them back together and I LOVE the brushes. The are super soft, but firm. They are perfect really other than the handles</li>
    <li> These are good brushes. They don&#x27;t shed. They are thick and we made.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> These are cheap brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for about half a year now using them quite and this is what I can say about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the big brushes are good at buffing product that is already there, not great at setting product down though. They pick up a lot of product. They soak it up and transfer not quite as much to the skin, but somehow they still transfer too much. They&#x27;re difficult. When cleaning them, it takes quite a bit of work to clean out all of the product, then a whole lot more work to wash the soap back out because it soaks that up as well, and it takes them multiple days to dry. I imagine mold could easily grow in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t terribly sturdy. Out of eight brushes, three have broken in half and several others are wiggly so that&#x27;s pretty not cool. Once they broke, I could see that the bristles were held together with the same glue that the brushes were so they might also start falling out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price, they are fine I suppose. If you want some to sort of practice with brushes then these are fine, but if you plan on  getting serious about makeup, I&#x27;d invest in something better</li>
    <li> Very pleased, fast shipping, and got two extra brushes (one big and one small)</li>
    <li> Only had them for 3 and half months and 4 brushes have broken already.  One the most important one! ( foundation brush). I take these brushes are not for everyday use</li>
    <li> I give it a 3 star because I&#x27;m learning to used brushes and the type of brush was not label on it.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed with these brushes! For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much. I was very impressed! They need to be washed to get rid of the packaging smell but that&#x27;s with all brushes. They are very soft and don&#x27;t shed. They work great I keep them in my professional make up kit as I work on lots of film sets and everyone says how nice they feel!</li>
    <li> Brushes broke off handle within 2 uses. Cheap glue</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for pro muas and someone just starting out. Just make sure you clean them monthly!</li>
    <li> ** SEE END FOR UPDATE** This is a surprisingly gorgeous and quality set, given it&#x27;s a cheap set off Amazon. The reviews are pretty true.They are crazy soft and pretty dense. I have Coastal Scents brushes, and these are softer and more dense. They do arrive with a strong chemical odor, but I rinsed them and aired them out overnight and now they are fine. They dry very fast! The handles are very sturdy and a perfect medium weight. I would say just slightly heavier than my CS brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only note to the seller would be to package them in a longer box. The shadow brushes get smooshed and even after washing, I don&#x27;t know that I can get the kinks out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 10/14** Alright, after daily use (it is now December but these started to go downhill months ago)- several brush heads have broken off from their handles and the brushes shed so bad I tossed them after getting tired of bristles in my eye. For $10, what can you expect, but I won&#x27;t repurchase. I&#x27;ve had my Coastal Scents brushes for going on 4 years and one head is starting to come loose so I just prefer something that is cheap but will still last!</li>
    <li> Love all of my brushes!!!....Have not had any issues with them and they put on makeup perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes,they don&#x27;t shed and they are great at evening out your foundation smoothly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They blend really well &amp; are so soft. It helps that they&#x27;re so pretty too. :)</li>
    <li> The brushes work really good the silver comes apart and needs to be re-glued</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have ever gotten. Please trust me.</li>
    <li> i love it put my makeup set up well the brush are not like other that make the brush like it pots you&#x27;re chest and face up when you puting ur makeup love it thanks</li>
    <li> Everything about this brush collection is amazing. The design of the brushes is super cute &amp; I love everything about it! Quality is so amazing, I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a month now &amp; I&#x27;ve cleaned them at least twice, not once has a brush shed! The brushes are so soft and do the job well! Highly recommend these, I&#x27;ve heard that these are just as good as the sigma brushes. Definitely a dupe!</li>
    <li> The handle came off right away before you can even enjoy it, it is not durable.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Quality brushes for a good price</li>
    <li> Great brushes, but the handles all separated from the brush within a week.</li>
    <li> I am still building my makeup collection. I want what I purchase to be practical and great quality. I have found that with these brushes that is honestly not too much to ask for. They are both! If you are thinking about getting them, I would! They cost me less than what would be a price of merely 1 brush of another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not too good to be true. I will purchase these again as gifts.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive brushes!!</li>
    <li> Cutest brushes and so soft, bristles don&#x27;t fall out. loveeeeee.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes on time, the quality of the brushes are great, applies flawlessly. I am happy with my purchase :-)</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! I really like these to apply makeup!</li>
    <li> It came quicker than I excpected! I haven&#x27;t used them yet with makeup but they are SO soft, I love them so far!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes so soft!!!</li>
    <li> High quality brushes!! Work excellent!</li>
    <li> Bought these for myself and friend and I love them. Very nice, durable, soft. Has held up through many washes.</li>
    <li> There were beautiful when I first bought them; however, they are now beginning to break and separate.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price. I&#x27;ve had no problems with bristles falling out, and i&#x27;ve cleaned them several times.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM! strongly recommend, they are exactly like the picture and if you know how to use them they are great!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft feels like great quality! It&#x27;s so cheap and affordable</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever !!love them!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They blend my contouring powders well and feels very great quality considering the price point! Works very well! Please click the link below if this review has been helpful :)</li>
    <li> I love them! So happy with this product the only thing is that they smelled but i washed other than that im happy with this product!</li>
    <li> WOW! I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this type of quality from these brushes. People are NOT lying when they say that they feel like high end brushes. My biggest goals when looking for new brushes was that they had to be affordable and they had to be soft. And these brushes are affordable, soft, they pick up product well, have no odor, and blend amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;As an example, I&#x27;ve been using my FitMe foundation for years and towards the end of the day, my makeup would completely come off and I&#x27;d use my elf foundation brush. But with a little bit of primer and the flat top brush, my foundation stayed on for 9 hours! My skin looked flawless.&lt;br /&gt;1 thing I have to mention is that the flat top eyeshadow brush was delivered to me broken. HOWEVER, nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t fix! These brushes are too amazing for me to care about that little hiccup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super impressed by the quality of these brushes. Cheap enough that if you lose one just buy more!</li>
    <li> So soft, no shedding, great price quick shipping</li>
    <li> So very soft and so far no bristles lost!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  I love them.  Perfect for concealers and liquid foundations.</li>
    <li> Freakin&#x27; cheap, looks cheap (the gold finish sucks) &amp; stinks like a gas station. However the bristles are very soft once the odor abates. Only use 2 of the brushes, donated the rest.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE these brushes. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this exact set (got some for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day after I fell in love with mine) I do wedding/prom/ special events makeup and had been using Sedona Lace and Sigma brushes. While I do love those brushes, these match right up with them! Would recommend to anyone, also would recommend washing them before use as they smell a little funky when you first get them</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!!! For the cost, these are great brushes. There was a slight smell to them, but other than that, they are perfect, and I will be purchasing a few more sets.</li>
    <li> Not great quality - returned them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes. I&#x27;ve washed and use them everyday since I received them in the mail. They hold up well no ell or shedding. They came in a cute pink draw string bag this perfect to travel with.</li>
    <li> Great product, great quality, and super soft and a good size</li>
    <li> Ok brushes for the price. They aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like and sometimes hurt as I use them to apply my makeup. They get the job done though and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> definitely worth it! Ive had these for a while now and they have stood up - no shedding and the brush heads are in tact. nice brushes - definitely worth the great price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes. No shedding and feels soft against skin. Does the job flawlessly</li>
    <li> I purchased the brushes, and when I first got them out of the packaging, they looked nice. When I took each brush out of the sleeve to wash off the chemical smell, 2 of the brush heads were loose, and another brush head fell completely off! I&#x27;ll need to use a hot glue gun to make sure they don&#x27;t fall off while actually applying makeup. One of the brushes has a few stray hairs that are out of place, but I can easily snip them. Overall, the set is inexpensive, the brushes are soft, and if I don&#x27;t use them, I won&#x27;t feel like I wasted too much money.</li>
    <li> A good doupe off sigma brushes, they apply my makeup just as good! Definitely would buy more.</li>
    <li> The wooden handles come out of the metal part a lot, but for the price they&#x27;re great and a little krazy glue puts them good as new.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft the bristles are.</li>
    <li> These brushes were more than I expected them to be. They are soft and make-up application is easy with them, love the large and small angled brushes. Worth my money!</li>
    <li> Im just a little bit annoyed, I ordered these brushes and they&#x27;re nice but they came all scratched up. As a freelance artist I can&#x27;t include ugly dinged up brushes in my kit. So, won&#x27;t get much use of these and big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality brushes very soft &amp; shipping came earlier than expected(: very much worth the purchase !</li>
    <li> They were great. Loved it</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re unsure, absolutely try these. I was skeptical but they&#x27;re awesome. You can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes! I have everything from ELF brushes to MAC brushes, and I cannot believe that these are my go to brushes now. I actually washed and packaged my older brushes to give away. My face is so easy to cover and blend and contour and all of those things that we want to do with makeup brushes. They are soooooo worth the small amount of money.</li>
    <li> I really liked these, when I ordered them I was really skeptical because they were so cheap and cheap brushes usually aren&#x27;t too great but they are so so SO soft and I don&#x27;t really have any problem with shedding with the big ones, a little bit of shedding for the smaller ones, but I don&#x27;t really find it to be a problem, I definitely reccomend these.</li>
    <li> They came apart but their really soft ☺️</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.They made it to my house just in time for me to use them to apply my makeup for work and oh my gosh,I am in love.They are super soft,but actually hold powder and they blend very well too.I have had brushes in the past from expensive name brand makeup stores that cannot hold a candle to these brushes And I&#x27;ve only used them once!!Wonderful makeup brushes for a wonderful price!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! They dont shred, dont smell, are sooo affordable,got here in less than 2 weeks, and they grab just enough makeup so it doesnt get tacky on your face! I love the airbrush finish when applying my liquid base. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I am never the one to write a review, but I am sitting here shopping on Amazon and came across these guys again. They are my best makeup brushes and I needed to stop and give them a great review. No falling apart. Extremely soft. Great application. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my buy. Makeup brushes are hard to buy without touching them,  I know, but these did not let me down.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic.  Soft and very little shedding.  Just as good as some of the high priced ones.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes,they work really well. They were also very soft, but however some broke apart when I first tried them. Fix that and u get 5 whole stars:)</li>
    <li> A few of my brushes broke the others are nice. Good if you need blending and buffing brushes. Nice price for what you get.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, especially at the price! I use them all the time, and has all the brush types you need.</li>
    <li> These brushes are an amazing value for the price!  They are very comparable to my Sigma brushes, even a dupe for Sigma, but much more affordable.  If you&#x27;re on the fence if you should purchase this set or have wanted to try Sigma brushes, I would absolutely recommend purchasing these.</li>
    <li> They came in quickly. I love the feel of each brush. Very happ with my product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect! They are soft, sturdy, and apply makeup evenly! Very pleased with the brushes and also the seller!</li>
    <li> Very soft and perfect for applying make-up.</li>
    <li> Omg i liket so much is very nice</li>
    <li> It was great but one of the brushes broke the third time I used them.</li>
    <li> Five star quality. I wear BB cream, with these brushes my makeup looks flawless.</li>
    <li> Honestly amazing for the price  can&#x27;t even believe it. Now I get to use a clean brush every day. Just by them you won&#x27;t be sorry. They are great to have around. I find the pointed kabuki useful for a quick under eye concealer routine. I&#x27;m not saying these brushes are the best quality. But I definitely get more bang for my buck in comparison with the expensive sephora brushes I have purchased in the past. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding yet, although the metal on one of the brushes is a bit wobbly. A+ deal</li>
    <li> Great brush set, good fibers.</li>
    <li> So fluffy , so far i like but at the begining it had a weird smell ,i suggest you wash them first .</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!!! Pretty much the same as the mac brushes, less dense but it makes my makeup flawless like an expensive brush would. Definitely one of the best dupes out there</li>
    <li> Came on time, very soft brushes, they pick up on products pretty well, but I notice that when it came to applying the products on my face, the brushes did not let it go as well. Other than that I liked these brushes a lot. They&#x27;re supper cute and again super soft.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so nice even if one was broken nothing that some glue can&#x27;t fix I mean it was a good price for many so I&#x27;m not being picky really nice quality in all happy with this purchase really great 💖 Shipped really fast too , great present to myself lol</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after my sister told me how much she loved them. They are affordable for all budgets and so far I love them too! I use them to apply my foundation, concealer, cream contour and eye shadows and they work as well as any brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. Definitely worth the money (cheaper doesn&#x27;t always mean lesser quality especially with these brushes) would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> nice products. they shed a little but it does not go on your face</li>
    <li> Incredibly soft. Got really excited to see them arrive. Although they do smell weird when you first open them. Make sure to wash them first that&#x27;s what I did. They&#x27;re amazing and they&#x27;re easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush and good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and so far no bristles are falling out.  Love all the choices. good price.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes and my golly! why do they smell like gasoline. But all in all, they are pretty and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got them sooner then expected...&lt;br /&gt;Im very impressed with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love... Thank yoi</li>
    <li> These brushes are literally the softest brushes I have ever put on my face! My mom used one and didn&#x27;t believe the price I paid. These brushes are great and if you are looking for good quality brushes you should definitely try these before you buy higher end more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> My second official makeup brush set! And I completely love it! I now use them all the time. They came neatly packaged, ❤️they did have a weird smell so I washed them as you always should do but they are a great product and is worth the investment ! http://youtu.be/ti5lcDnIrXE Here&#x27;s a YouTube video where I did a review on the brushes!</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!!! LOVE HOW THE HAIRS DONT FALL OUT AND HOW THICK THE BRUSHES ARE.DEFINETLY GOOD QUALITY</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The bristles are soft and appropriately dense, and they apply makeup wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the handles have come off of many of the larger face makeup brushes. I actually don&#x27;t mind because I use them for contouring and it gives me more control. The long-handled eyeshadow brushes are all intact, and the ones that have come apart could easily be glued.</li>
    <li> These are comparable to my high quality MAC brushes. no lie!, I love to use them with both powders and creams!! The Seller is awesome, and followed up with a personal email to make sure I received the product in a promptly manner. They were genuine  and really nice, I can&#x27;t wait to order more from the seller. I will be going to a makeup seminar soon ONO beauty school with pricilla ono and i will def be taking these brushes with me</li>
    <li> Smell was intense but after washing its fine, I use these brushes everyday! The cone tipped brush for your face though is unusable its very rough and firm, doesn&#x27;t feel good on the skin.</li>
    <li> When they are opened they have a very strong factory smell. I haven&#x27;t used them yet because the smell is so strong. I washed them but the smell is still consistent. Hope to use them soon</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I don&#x27;t really care for the smaller ones but the larger ones are what I use every single day.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a present for my sister, and she loves them. She uses them every day. I would highly recommend them as a gift, or if your a women then buy them for yourself.</li>
    <li> My flat top was shedding the first time I used it, like chunks of hair is coming out. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I do like the eyeshadow brushes, works well for blending in creases.</li>
    <li> Brushes stink at first but not all crazy. Brushes are so soft I love them. Must buy.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the brushes..great value :-)</li>
    <li> A lot of brush for a little money.</li>
    <li> Great price for the these.</li>
    <li> These brushes did not last very long. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Supplies all my makeup needs, yes they had a weird smell. I washed them and they were fine, love these well made.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3 these brushes - great deal and great quality</li>
    <li> The flat top doesn&#x27;t blend the liquid foundation like I like. Also the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t blend the eye shadows either. but they are not so bad. wish the brushes were labeled with what they are for</li>
    <li> They shed. That was disappointing. Not good for contouring. Tips are too soft and loose. I use one or two for loose powder. They are pretty brushes though. And very big for easy handling.</li>
    <li> soft and applies my makeup well. leaves a flawless look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I reccommend  these to clients who want good quality without the prices of others. Compares well to sigma.</li>
    <li> Amazing, love these !!!!!! Better than my expensive brushes !</li>
    <li> Great brushes! So firm yet soft! Best makeup brushes over ever had!!! Definitely worth buying, do not hesitate!!! At first I had the 10 piece brush in my cart then added these 8 piece brush set to my cart because the price was cheaper but I did not realize the 2 piece difference (thought it wa sa 10piece but I should&#x27;ve read closer, the pictures look almost exactly the same). Very nice size brushes (my hand is big), order came in 2 days</li>
    <li> Very quality brush set...can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are very dense and soft. I used most of them every day.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality . There soft and don&#x27;t fall out. But the wood Handel that glued to the metal falls right off after a couple of usage. So it&#x27;s defective that way.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and great price&lt;br /&gt;So soft and feel amazingly against my skin&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> The texture feels so soft on my face while applying make up, so it makes it easier for me to blend different shades of colors. It got every type of make up brush that I need and definitely a great buy for its price.</li>
    <li> The brushes are perfect.! My only complaint is that they come unglued from the base rather easily.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, they&#x27;re very soft and dense. The don&#x27;t shed either, not even after several washes. I love how they look as well. Some say they&#x27;re duplicates to the Sigma brushes and I could agree. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> Overall, I like the quality of the brush. My only problem was that they did not last very long. The brush separated from the handle very quick.</li>
    <li> I received these set in only 2 days! The brushes did have a slight scent- they smelled like brand new shoes so I actually adore the scent. They came neatly individually wrapped in one plastic bag. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, which is why I doing give a 5star rating. But right out of the packaging they are great! Very soft bristles &amp; firm head. The gold embellishments are more of a copper color. Excited to use!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them as there is a good deal of a terrible smell. I washed them in a container with a bit of soap, brush side down, soaked them over night then air dryed them for another full day &amp; night. I like the two tone color. They are very soft. This weekend I will try them then give an updated review.</li>
    <li> I just got my makeup brush, the shipping was fast, the brush was soft and easy to blend. watch-out for this guys, they will be the next Mac. I love it, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, I think they work just as good as the more expensive ones and I highly recommend. They don&#x27;t shed and work great for blending in foundation or applying eye shadow.</li>
    <li> The moment I open the package I was in love they are so soft and so nice and when I first tried it I must say best brushes I&#x27;ve tried thank you so much</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing,  I&#x27;m am totally in love with them!</li>
    <li> I waited a long to write a review because I wanted to try it out so I can say honestly how I feel about it. When I got it it had a really strong smell of plastic or something. The packaging was good it came in a pink cute tote , and then in a plastic bag and all of them came individually separated in another bag. They are super soft to the hand and the face. The apply really good the product. After I used i clean them up with Mary Kay brush cleaner and the lost just a few hair and that may happen sometimes when the brushes are being clean for the first time. If you want a cheap set of brushes because you are a beginner or even just because you want to use extra brushes you should totally get it.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes with a heavy chemical odor when they arrived. Took days and few washings to get the smell to go away.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brush sets I own!</li>
    <li> Really great brushes! Inexpensive and we&#x27;ll worth ordering.</li>
    <li> Where is the pink bag that&#x27;s pictured? The brushes are nice quality (there are 2 that I love but I could do without the rest). The small brushes are way too big to be eyeshadow brushes so I&#x27;m not really sure what to use them for. It&#x27;s not really a good deal considering that I only get use out if 2 brushes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them! Plus cheap 🙌 👌</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every day,and for the price you can not beat that price, they are very soft, and glides well on face good for liquid foundation, and mineral foundation.</li>
</ol>
