      <li>Great product,better shave.</li>
      <li>King of Shaves is the best shaving product I&#x27;ve tried, but my latest tube has a sticker added to it that it contains an ingredient known to cause cancer.  </li>

      <li>It was really an amazing experience shaving with this.</li>
      <li>Fantastic gel, I have used King of shaves for 10+ years now and this newer gel shave gel is great,</li>
      <li>You can see where you shave and it feels nice.</li>
      <li>The lemon scent sounded nice but in reality you end up smelling like Lysol.</li>
      <li>Feels and smells nice, have been using it for a while.</li>
      <li>Plus it smells nice.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the blue formula, which is the best gel ever.</li>
      <li>I love gel over</li>
      <li>However, I love the way it feels on my skin and the way it helps shave.  </li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>The feeling after shaving is refreshing.  </li>
      <li>This is because the aloe penetrates the skin&#x27;s layers, and as you shed those outer layer cells, newer and better protected/hydrated cells will take their place.  </li>
      <li>and I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it, for the price try it</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth shave use this.  </li>
      <li>Refreshing, love the citrus smell.</li>
      <li>Love this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Alpha Get&amp;#34;products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not anything special in my opinion in getting a better shave, but it&#x27;s because of how it goes on that makes it nice.</li>
      <li>scent of it is very citrus-like, and it&#x27;s really pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try if you want something that smells nice and provides very decent razor glide.</li>
      <li>I tried the other superges as well and had excellent success.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>First time I used this particular one; nice citrus aroma.  </li>
      <li>you have any issues with razor burn, or just want a good clear shave gel, I highly suggest this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I shave in the shower, so I first chose it strictly for the packaging.</li>
      <li>The exact cancer-causing ingredient is not disclosed, but now I&#x27;m hesitant to use it.</li>
      <li>Plus, it goes on clear, so you can shave as precisely as needed without having to worry about foam or suds being in your line of sight</li>
      <li>Like most gels, it will offer better lubrication than a shave cream, but not better protection.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different fragrances and all are pleasant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find here in the states for some reason, but with my sensitive skin this works great.</li>
      <li>Works really well, but not as well as the alphagel.</li>
      <li>The citrus yellow gel goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
      <li>They do not foam, a very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It goes fairly fast.  </li>
      <li>I have used the King of Shaves product for over 2 years (although this particular scent I&#x27;ve used for a little more than 4 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very precisely trimmed beard that requires some rough re-shaping every so often, but this gel has done wonders with protecting my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of citrus scented items, and this definitely delivers with its clean and fresh</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t/haven&#x27;t used anything else apart from trying their new line.</li>
      <li>My husband has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>You can see the area directly that you are shaving.  </li>
      <li>I used a n electric for almost twenty plus years and had no trouble switching over to the blade by using this brand.</li>
      <li>After the 3rd or 4th shave you will really notice the difference.</li>
      <li>There is one that smells like black pepper, sounds odd but is nice.</li>
      <li>I normally get the mentholated alphagel, and I will in the future.</li>
      <li>No other gel comes close to King of Shaves Alpha Gel.</li>
      <li>I used to get razor burn at least 3 or 4 times a month, but now I can go many months without ever having a single instance.</li>
      <li>Very slick and smooth.</li>

    <li> Great Shaving Cream, I like the smell of this one.  I use three different smells, this citrus one, the orange and black pepper and the blue for sensitive skin.  It goes fairly fast.  However, I love the way it feels on my skin and the way it helps shave.  The feeling after shaving is refreshing.  I love gel over cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this brand while stationed overseas and I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, love the citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Love this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Alpha Get&amp;#34;products.  Best shave &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; products.  They do not foam, a very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; (razor glides over you skin) and reduce the number of nicks and cuts.  First time I used this particular one; nice citrus aroma.  I have used the regular and menthol for years.  Target sold it at one time.  Now, can only find it on Amazon and other internet retailers.  No other gel comes close to King of Shaves Alpha Gel.</li>
    <li> I like this shave gel a lot. It&#x27;s not anything special in my opinion in getting a better shave, but it&#x27;s because of how it goes on that makes it nice. The citrus yellow gel goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t foam. You can see where you shave and it feels nice. Plus it smells nice. I bought this for while I&#x27;m backpacking around the world, and it&#x27;s lasted me a while. However once it&#x27;s done,  I may just buy a cheaper version that works just the same.</li>
    <li> I normally get the mentholated alphagel, and I will in the future. I prefer it to this lemon scent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic gel, I have used King of shaves for 10+ years now and this newer gel shave gel is great, wouldn&#x27;t/haven&#x27;t used anything else apart from trying their new line.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but not as well as the alphagel. It&#x27;s hard to find here in the states for some reason, but with my sensitive skin this works great.</li>

    <li> Love it, for the price try it I think you&#x27;ll like it.  Nice and smooth shave use this.  I tried the other superges as well and had excellent success.  I used a n electric for almost twenty plus years and had no trouble switching over to the blade by using this brand.</li>
    <li> The best shaving gel out there!</li>
    <li> Great product,better shave.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream made, period. Fast shipping. Thank You A+++++</li>
    <li> Not as good as the blue formula, which is the best gel ever.</li>
    <li> This shave gel is but I prefer the green menthol Remington shave gel over this.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin. This is the best shaving gel out there. He loves it. I use it for my legs and the close shave is amazing. No drying out the skin and no bumps. Worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> smells great, good gel, nice feel, keeps skin from drying out.  good product</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower, so I first chose it strictly for the packaging. It was rust proof. Before this I shaved with typical white cream that hides your face. It was really an amazing experience shaving with this. Very slick and smooth. My razors stay sharp longer. I never cut myself. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. The fragrance is light and clean. I&#x27;ve tried several different fragrances and all are pleasant. There is one that smells like black pepper, sounds odd but is nice.</li>
    <li> The lemon scent sounded nice but in reality you end up smelling like Lysol.I have used king of shaves alpha gel for years and I love it but supergel is a not nearly as smooth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Ever since I started using it, I have only had one instance of razor burn (because I didn&#x27;t apply enough of the gel).  I used to get razor burn at least 3 or 4 times a month, but now I can go many months without ever having a single instance. I have used the King of Shaves product for over 2 years (although this particular scent I&#x27;ve used for a little more than 4 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very precisely trimmed beard that requires some rough re-shaping every so often, but this gel has done wonders with protecting my skin.  Plus, it goes on clear, so you can shave as precisely as needed without having to worry about foam or suds being in your line of sight while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of it is very citrus-like, and it&#x27;s really pleasant.  I&#x27;m a big fan of citrus scented items, and this definitely delivers with its clean and fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any issues with razor burn, or just want a good clear shave gel, I highly suggest this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - you need to give the shave gel a couple of shaves to work.  This is because the aloe penetrates the skin&#x27;s layers, and as you shed those outer layer cells, newer and better protected/hydrated cells will take their place.  After the 3rd or 4th shave you will really notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this from my local supermarket and have used it for a week.  It isn&#x27;t anything that blows me away, but it gets the job done.  I like the fact that it is a low foam gel that dispenses from a tube (as opposed to the goo that comes out of a pressurized aerosol can).  You can see the area directly that you are shaving.  It does have a pleasant fragrance which will help stimulate your senses each morning.  My one criticism is that I have nicked myself a couple times when using this.  Like most gels, it will offer better lubrication than a shave cream, but not better protection.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try if you want something that smells nice and provides very decent razor glide.</li>
