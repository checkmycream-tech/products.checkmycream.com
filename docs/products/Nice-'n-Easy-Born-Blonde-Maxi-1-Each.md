      <li>I had read elsewhere that it&#x27;s best not to, so you can protect your scalp from the bleaching.  </li>

      <li>The texture was soft and perfect.</li>

      <li>I also bought a toner, though, so it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>This will help most of you out there-</li>
      <li>It showed up much sooner than I thought it was going to and in great shape.</li>
      <li>I have been highlighting and bleaching most of my life.</li>
      <li>OK so I bought this product and was hoping to have hair that looked like o did on the box</li>
      <li>(ie: if you have colored before, and ends are more porous).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
      <li>Most hair home hair color systems leave you with a orangish/blonde.  </li>
      <li>About 50 minutes into the process, I began applying more mixture on my hair and looking for spots I missed.    </li>
      <li>So I love Amazon.</li>
      <li>Make sure you leave it on the full time too!</li>
      <li>the brush was indispensable in spreading the bleach around on my hair more evenly.</li>

      <li>The order of ammonia was so strong that I had could not breathe and had to hold my breath or step out the bathroom.</li>
      <li>My hair is really dark and this blondes it up perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Clairol Nice &#x27;Nice Easy Born Blonde Hair Color Maxi is the only product on&lt;br /&gt;the market that really works to make your hair looking perfect each time.</li>
      <li>White Out hair bleach is great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out, thanks!</li>
      <li>Take a look at the original Nice n&#x27; Easy Borne Blonde.</li>
      <li>You must definitely use this in a room with a good exhaust fan.  </li>
      <li>I love this bleach kit, my hair is normally very resistant.</li>
      <li>Well, yes, it is w/ Nice n&#x27; Easy Born Blonde Maxi.  </li>
      <li>Now take a look at the hair clolor on the Nice n&#x27; Easy Borne Blonde Maxi</li>
      <li>It dries too quickly which stops the developing process.</li>
      <li>My hair was bright yellow on top bright white on the roots spotty brownish red on the sides.</li>
      <li>It really is that easy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought less harmful and more effective products than this garbage.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s way more cost effective than a salon, but if you truly want to go blonde save your money and get it done by a professional.</li>
      <li>If not, looks like I&#x27;ll be spending more money going to a professional to have it done.</li>
      <li>They do include a nice hair conditioning with the package that has multiple uses in it.</li>
      <li>This got my roots nice and white.</li>
      <li>If you have dark hair and want the color on the cover, then buy more than one box, as you will probably have to use the product more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>well, like many people apparently, I tried to dye my friends hair with this</li>
      <li>is a good product to use to achieve lightening of dark hair.</li>
      <li>My hair outlining my face is WHITE, the top of my head and the roots are bright YELLOW, and the rest is a natural ORANGE color...</li>
      <li>The final, bleached color ranged from a light blonde to light brown, for most (including myself), the roots get lighter then the tips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im glad I didnt put this all over my head as the smell is aweful and has the potential to burn the living lights out of you.</li>
      <li>like it was the first time I used it, but to my surprise</li>
      <li>They are able to get that whitish/blonde because the powder is blue.</li>
      <li>If you can get help to do this, I would recommend it, if it is your first time.</li>
      <li>Btw, this is not my first time using an at home color kit.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping !</li>
      <li>If you have colored black hair and think that one application of this over roots to ends will lift you to a platinum blonde, you are incredibly mislead.</li>
      <li>Could finding the right color blonde truly be easy?    </li>
      <li>A bleach strong enough to do that to your hair would most likely cause you hair to fall out.  </li>
      <li>(Keep in mind-when using this stuff, color of hair will look a bit darker because it&#x27;s wet, &amp; will be even more bright after rinsed &amp; dried.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t do your whole head without doing a strand test first</li>
      <li>The fumes are quite intense at first, then they seem to go away.  </li>
      <li>First off, I use this for highlighting, I would never bleach my whole head without going to a salon.</li>
      <li>It really does a great job with dying dark hair to Blonde.</li>
      <li>Have real difficulty finding this in a store much less at such a great price.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on hair but doesn&#x27;t give u the blond color on the box cover .</li>
      <li>and that was after forty whole minutes of waiting for it too.</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product Is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>There exists no product that is capable of doing that.  </li>
      <li>Whole Purchase Experience Very Favorable .</li>
      <li>there is just so much of it.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an easy job lightening at home, &amp; I recommend a salon, but if you do your research, know your &amp;#34;level&amp;#34;, have patience, realistic expectations, &amp; the proper equipment to work with, then you can do it.</li>
      <li>And therefore, leave you with very light hair some places, and orange hair in other places.</li>
      <li>the ends would be more porous, &amp; absorb color quicker than the other part of the hair.</li>
      <li>I recomend testing a strand first to see how far it will take your hair, as well as seeing how much you can stand the smell.</li>
      <li>I would recommend bleaching at least twice, probably 3 times, and definitely use a good toner and, most importantly, a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>blonde at the tips and roots but bright red in the middle.</li>
      <li>First off, figure out what &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; color your natural hair is.</li>
      <li>It takes months of toning, conditioning, coloring, and patience to get a healthy and toned platinum or ash effect from dark brown or black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(This will slightly change the color for you, (lighter) because you are using a higher vol developer, but keep in mind, the higher vol developer, the more potential damage to hair-</li>
      <li>--her hair color is more of the white blonde.</li>
      <li>I also bought and used a sulfate-free shampoo for color treated hair to use instead of my normal shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a do-it-yourself hair color that is the right color of blonde forever.  </li>
      <li>Track the price and if you feel it&#x27;s right , then make a big order.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product hoping that it would turn my dark brown hair blonde, but it didn&#x27;t. I let this crap sit on my head for 90 minutes and it turned my hair every color EXCEPT for blonde. My hair outlining my face is WHITE, the top of my head and the roots are bright YELLOW, and the rest is a natural ORANGE color... I couldn&#x27;t be any more unsatisfied! Please don&#x27;t do your whole head without doing a strand test first, I made the mistake of not doing it and I recommend you don&#x27;t make the mistake either. You will regret buying this!</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I bought mine at the Dollar General for $10.00!</li>
    <li> Clairol Nice &#x27;Nice Easy Born Blonde Hair Color Maxi is the only product on&lt;br /&gt;the market that really works to make your hair looking perfect each time.</li>
    <li> Finally!!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a do-it-yourself hair color that is the right color of blonde forever.  I&#x27;ve tried I think every other brand, then I tried Clairol. I knew Clairol made good hair color products, but Nice n&#x27; Easy? Could finding the right color blonde truly be easy?    Well, yes, it is w/ Nice n&#x27; Easy Born Blonde Maxi.  Most hair home hair color systems leave you with a orangish/blonde.  Take a look at the original Nice n&#x27; Easy Borne Blonde. On the box her color is like an orangish Blonde. Now take a look at the hair clolor on the Nice n&#x27; Easy Borne Blonde Maxi--her hair color is more of the white blonde. They are able to get that whitish/blonde because the powder is blue. If you want whitish hair, then you want a blue powder. Ultra also is blue, but it only has 1 thing of blue powder, while Maxi has 2 things.    So, if you want saloon looking whitish/blonde hair, use this product. It really is that easy. BTW, now I just do my roots, and it always comes out looking great.</li>
    <li> This will definitely lighten your hair drastically.  I used it to go from black to white/blonde hair.  My only complaint is that the packaging is very misleading.  This product WILL NOT turn dark hair blonde in one application.  There exists no product that is capable of doing that.  A bleach strong enough to do that to your hair would most likely cause you hair to fall out.  Going from dark brown/black to platinum blonde is a slow process.  You will need to bleach your hair multiple times over the coarse of several months.  You&#x27;re going to be stuck with orange or bright yellow hair for awhile, so buy some cute hats!  If you&#x27;ve ever colored your hair a darker color (dyed it black or dark brown) then it will take even longer for the color to lift.  You might have to beach your hair 3 or 4 times before even you start to get close the platinum-blonde color your going for.  Also, the color of the lady&#x27;s hair in the picture on the box does not reflect the actual results of bleaching your hair.  After you bleach your hair will it be orange or yellow, so you&#x27;ll need to use a blonde toner on your hair.  This lightening kit does not come with a toner.</li>
    <li> I got this product because of its \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; claim that it could lighten my blue black hair (that hasnt been re-dyed in 4 months) to a sandy blonde or lighter shade. Its a Lie. I fallowed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; in fear that my hair would turn into a brassy broken mess. Instead it did next to nothing, only slightly lightening my test strand to a orangey dark brown after 2 HOURS. Im glad I didnt put this all over my head as the smell is aweful and has the potential to burn the living lights out of you. I recomend testing a strand first to see how far it will take your hair, as well as seeing how much you can stand the smell. White Out hair bleach is great if you want to go Platinum, it took my black hair to white without too much hair distuction just stay away from born blonde its bad news.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this bleach twice now. The first time, I got chemical burns and only managed to get my hair to the orange stage before I had to wash it out. In Clairols defense though, that happened because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions. The second time I used it I got my hair to the yellow color before I reached the 90 minute mark and had to wash it out. I was worried that this last time my hair would be totally fried like it was the first time I used it, but to my surprise it&#x27;s still completely soft, but I did put the conditioner that came with it in my hair without washing it out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this brand again, I&#x27;m going to try ferias bleach kit next time. This got my roots nice and white.</li>
    <li> If you have dark brown hair or darker don&#x27;t waste your money. It claims it will work on dark hair but it lies. I left it on for 60 min. because it said not to exceed that time and my hair came out yellow at my roots and orangish,reddish brown every where else. It didn&#x27;t even get close to blonde. I&#x27;m so mad. I was trying to save money and ended up wasting money. I bought two kits just in case one was not enough since I have a lot of hair but I only used one and I&#x27;m glad I did because now I&#x27;ll have to use the 2nd one to re do my hair hoping it will at least make it one uniform color. If not, looks like I&#x27;ll be spending more money going to a professional to have it done. Thanks for the false advertisement clairol. Btw, this is not my first time using an at home color kit. I have done several and this is the only one that has turned out this bad!</li>
    <li> My hair is really dark and this blondes it up perfectly.  And it&#x27;s great Amazon has it, I used to get it at Walmart and they quit carrying it.  So I love Amazon.</li>
    <li> It may work for others, but I assure you, do NOT use this if you have any red tone to your hair. It will turn out brassy. It dries too quickly which stops the developing process. I know it&#x27;s way more cost effective than a salon, but if you truly want to go blonde save your money and get it done by a professional. This stuff also dries the heck out of your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this bleach kit, my hair is normally very resistant. This is one of the few kits that actually works for me. It showed up much sooner than I thought it was going to and in great shape. I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out, thanks!</li>
    <li> This will get your hair LIGHT, but not the color on the box at least for me! Be  very careful. I accidentally left on my eyebrows a few too long and they are the same color as my hair (completely my fault, but I&#x27;m still freaking out). Also, I am dark blonde (roots) to light blonde (tips) and I have a lot of red here. I also bought a toner, though, so it&#x27;s okay I hope. They do include a nice hair conditioning with the package that has multiple uses in it. Hopefully it stays in awhile, unlike Garnier Fruictesse color that leaves within a few washes!</li>
    <li> I have never had my hair bleached professionally or otherwise.  I bought this based on the extensive directions and the reviews of the other products and the perceived gentleness of this product.  I have very dark black hair that hair stylists call thick.  My hair isn&#x27;t thick stranded there is just so much of it.      Before I bleached it: Four days prior: I prepared by working a little [[ASIN:B0000535TD Jason Natural Cosmetics Pure Beauty Oil, 5,000 IU Vitamin E Oil - 4 fl oz]] into my hair before bedtime and washed my hair like usual the next morning. Three days prior: I again put the Jason oil into my hair sparingly, then the next morning I didn&#x27;t try to get all the oil out.  Two - One day prior: I did not wash my hair.  I had read elsewhere that it&#x27;s best not to, so you can protect your scalp from the bleaching.  I followed all the directions for mixing and performed the strand test before I started.      My hair came out similar to my strand test, which was not completely light blond.  The strand still had streaks of hair that were dark brown, so did my hair.  I applied the bleach creme to the roots about halfway through.  Still the ends were darker than the roots.  I realized a bit too late that I should have pinned the ends to the roots or put on some sort of cap, as the heat from my scalp turned the roots to the light blonde color I wanted to get.  My ends are a reddish-orange blonde, while the roots are a light blonde.  According to the package I must wait 24 hours before I try again.  I actually like the color on the ends, but I am going after a punky color look, so maybe another time.    Although I left it on for the maximum time (90 minutes), I did not suffer breakage.  Until I started to prepare for this, my hair was becoming drier (not sure why, meds or age induced).  Afterwards the bleached ends were a little drier than the rest of my hair, but not as dry as before I started the pre-bleach prep conditioner 4 days before.  I also bought and used a sulfate-free shampoo for color treated hair to use instead of my normal shampoo.  I used the conditioner provided in the package as well as conditioner for color treated hair.    You must definitely use this in a room with a good exhaust fan.  The fumes are quite intense at first, then they seem to go away.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because the initial reaction has off-gassed from mixing the chemical cocktail, or it was because I got used to it.  If you can get help to do this, I would recommend it, if it is your first time. The back can be very hard to navigate (especially when using two mirrors).  Also I could not manage dividing my hair into 1/4\\&quot; strands so I did the best I could by feel (with gloved hands).    I purchased a number of other items from other stores that came in handy.  (1) a bowl and hair color brush applicator kit - the brush was indispensable in spreading the bleach around on my hair more evenly. (2) a short cape - nothing covering the arms, (3) plastic clips with a spring - used about 7-8 of them. (4) A small mirror on a moveable stand - handy for the back.    Also I used Vaseline as recommended elsewhere on my face, ears, and neck.  The bleach mixture did start to burn a little towards the end on my ears and some parts of my scalp where I added more of the bleach mixture later.  I used up all the bleach mixture on 1/4 of my shoulder length hair.  About 50 minutes into the process, I began applying more mixture on my hair and looking for spots I missed.    I will try again in a week to see if I can lighten up the reddish orange ends to my desired color.  Since I only used this on 1/4 of my hair (bottom left half), I think I will try the [[ASIN:B002GENWU8 Manic Panic Flash Lightning Hair Bleach Kit 40 Volume]] on the other side.  I will stick to this kit on this side to lighten it up further.  BTW: I am dyeing the bottom half of my hair, vice the top, so I can stave off the need to touch up my black roots until much later.</li>
    <li> i use this bleach like 3 times on black hair and it just stays an orange color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;being dyeing my hair for 7 years and  this is the worst bleach!</li>
    <li> It is gentle on hair but doesn&#x27;t give u the blond color on the box cover . It is pumpkin orange after 30 min . I was afraid to leave it more on my hair .</li>
    <li> Have real difficulty finding this in a store much less at such a great price.</li>
    <li> It works asexpected but the price changes from one day to another. Track the price and if you feel it&#x27;s right , then make a big order.</li>
    <li> OK so I bought this product and was hoping to have hair that looked like o did on the box (it never does) THANK GOD I did this on a weekend I didn&#x27;t have to work. Upon putting he product in my hair it instantly turned my hair to a hay texture. After leaving it on for the reccomended time my hair was so damaged I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through it&lt;br /&gt;After washing it out I was beyond horrified!! My hair was bright yellow on top bright white on the roots spotty brownish red on the sides. I cried that I might have to go to work like this. I panicked and grabbed a box of hair dye I had laying around that was deep red and thank god it covered it and it undamaged my hair somehow. I will never try to dye my hair blonde again go to a salon because it is a process that takes more than one time. Yes its more expensive but its worth someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing to do your hair!</li>
    <li> This is a double-powder blue bleach formula with a high lift developer. If you have colored black hair and think that one application of this over roots to ends will lift you to a platinum blonde, you are incredibly mislead. There exists no product that does the aforementioned act. None. Even the best of the best salons would not be able to perform this feat in one sitting. It takes months of toning, conditioning, coloring, and patience to get a healthy and toned platinum or ash effect from dark brown or black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair is a very, very dark brown with natural red tones. I use this, from time to time, when I&#x27;m out of bleach or can&#x27;t justify a trip to the salon. The application bottle actually is helpful in the first round of lightening- it&#x27;s easier to apply than using a bowl and brush if you are relying on your own two hands and a hand mirror. After lightening my roots, I use a high-lift ash blonde and then, every other time, I use an ash blonde lavender toner. THAT, is how you achieve a true platinum effect from dark brown/black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to all other bottle blondes out there!</li>
    <li> I used the MAXI Blonde color on my son&#x27;s dark brown hair that had never been color treated.  The box indicates that even BLACK hair will turn BLONDE.  This was not the case at all.  The instructions indicate that it should be left on UP TO 90 minutes, checking for the desired color.  At 90 minutes it was still orange.  I waited another 30 minutes...still orange.  I waited yet another 30 minutes (yes, a total of 2.5 hours) and finally rinsed it out as it was burning my son&#x27;s skin.  His hair has some light blonde at the roots, some yellowish brown all over, and that awful orange hue everywhere.  I was not impressed at all.  I will stick with WHITE OUT brand and not use this brand again.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK FOR BROWN TO BLACK HAIR!!! WILL LEAVE YOUR HAIR RED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product claims to be for people with dark brown to black hair... it says keep it in until there are no \\&quot;red tones\\&quot; and to not exceed 90 minutes.... well, like many people apparently, I tried to dye my friends hair with this and it left her hair red.... blonde at the tips and roots but bright red in the middle. Apparently in the bleaching process your hair color goes from brown to red to orange to yellow to blonde. I heard from others that with this product you will need to bleach your hair 4-6 times if you want blonde hair. BS. Save money and get Splat Lightening Kit. It&#x27;s for people who want to dye their hair crazy colors like blue and purple, but the bleach you need to use before hand WORKS in ONE go. And if you just get the lightening kit bam there is your bleach and no color (and if they are out of the kit, just buy the color and throw away the color. Better than spending money on 4-6 bleaching kits....)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0076OFKXK Splat Rebellious Colors Lightening Bleach]]</li>
    <li> Product is good and affordable</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that for most people it&#x27;s impossible to go from black to blonde in one bleach. That said, this product has been the only product I could find to lighten my (dyed) black hair, and I&#x27;ve tried several, including bleaching kits from beauty supply stores. The final, bleached color ranged from a light blonde to light brown, for most (including myself), the roots get lighter then the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to leave it in for 20 minutes, and no longer then 90, I only needed 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to go from black to blonde I would recommend bleaching at least twice, probably 3 times, and definitely use a good toner and, most importantly, a deep conditioner. Any bleaching you do to your hair will damage it, a lot, so don&#x27;t bleach more then once in one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the conditioner that came with this kit, I wish I could get it in a big bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This works great..</li>
    <li> Literally the best bleach i have ever used! One application on my dark blonde hair and I was ready for toning to white. I have used manic panic before and had to bleach 3 times with 40 vol to get it to the stage that this does in one application! My hair is still in awesome condition and love it! I will never use another kind! I use the Ultra Blue formula on my root regrowth and it works great too! Love it! I can imagine if you have dark hair you may have to use it twice, but it rocks! Make sure you leave it on the full time too! It may look like you have white hair after about 45 min but when you rinse it out it will still be yellow! I typically rinse a strand out to see my color before I rinse my whole head because it can be misleading since it turns purple!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! just what I wanted! thank you.</li>
    <li> This thing cost me fourteen bucks in the beauty supply and it is garbage. I knew that other clairol color was bad but I thought this product would be different. It didn&#x27;t even get my roots. I have 3 toned hair! I feel so cheated. I&#x27;ve bought less harmful and more effective products than this garbage. The order of ammonia was so strong that I had could not breathe and had to hold my breath or step out the bathroom. It said nothing about being that harmful on the eyes and nose. I had trouble applying, but when you pay 14$ for something you use it. It never even tingled or itched my scalp and that was after forty whole minutes of waiting for it too. I had black dark brown hair and now have yellow brown and copper hair. Bleaches the darkest of hair my ass. This thing suxxxx.  I should&#x27;ve never been unfaithful to my l&#x27;oreal. The only thing that can save me is going black and I really wanted to be blonde:(</li>
    <li> This will help most of you out there- here is what you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product to use to achieve lightening of dark hair. I have been highlighting and bleaching most of my life. But there are simple rules you must know if your going to attempt this process at home. First off, I use this for highlighting, I would never bleach my whole head without going to a salon. Because; there is such a high chance that the hair will develop in different color stages throughout the process due to prior damage (ie: if you have colored before, and ends are more porous). And therefore, leave you with very light hair some places, and orange hair in other places. So please use this with caution.&lt;br /&gt;  First off, figure out what &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; color your natural hair is. (If you have colored hair anywhere-then figure out what current level that hair is also.) Ex: dark black is a level 1, with platinum blonde being a level 10. Keep in mind, trying to go more than 4 levels will usually require a double process-this means lightening twice. Also- get a toner (from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply). Wella Color Charm is what I use, &amp; very popular. (Toner should be used with a 10vol. Developer). And toner will only work once hair is NO LONGER orange! Must be a pale yellow to white blonde for toner to do anything. Toner is just that-used to change ONLY the &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; of the color achieved. If you just couldn&#x27;t get past the orange-bright yellow color using Born Blonde, then get Wella Color Charm dye. 12A Frosty Ash is a good one. Use 20 or 30 developer with the dye! (This will slightly change the color for you, (lighter) because you are using a higher vol developer, but keep in mind, the higher vol developer, the more potential damage to hair- this is the rule). And this would be a &amp;#34;double process&amp;#34;. You could use any boxed dye in place of 12A, but I find that boxes don&#x27;t often tell you what vol the developer is inside. Always do roots last, as they will develop faster do toheat from your scalp, always do ends last as well, (if hair is damaged even somewhat from previous coloring)- the ends would be more porous, &amp; absorb color quicker than the other part of the hair. Your goal is to have the whole strand one color, and for that color not to be orange, canary yellow, or terribly damaged. I&#x27;ve been there, and yes, even happened at a salon years ago- So I did my research and learned that hair must go through stages of color, those being brown-red, red, orangey-red, orange, orangey-yellow, canary yellow, pale yellow, banana yellow, blond w/yellow undertones, then blonde. All hair has undertones, and must pass through these stages. If you watch when you color with Born Blonde, you will see it go thru these colors, don&#x27;t worry. You WILL need either toner or dye WITH developer if your going to use this box, (unless your already blonde). So have it before you begin. After you rinse out Born Blonde, then towel dry, &amp; apply the toner OR dye to damp hair. Keep an eye on the color developing, then rinse, &amp; condition well. (Keep in mind-when using this stuff, color of hair will look a bit darker because it&#x27;s wet, &amp; will be even more bright after rinsed &amp; dried. -It&#x27;s still really hard for me to tell color when wet, I have to take some off a strand to see actual color, then I reference a bit lighter than what I actually see). It&#x27;s not an easy job lightening at home, &amp; I recommend a salon, but if you do your research, know your &amp;#34;level&amp;#34;, have patience, realistic expectations, &amp; the proper equipment to work with, then you can do it.</li>
    <li> I have medium-dark brown hair, no gray. I used this product two years ago as a bleach. It turned my hair a splotchy, dirty blonde. I didn&#x27;t mind, as I had intended to dye it red, and it lightened the hair enough that the red worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then dyed my hair dark brown, and, last summer, decided to go red again. I used the same product as bleach, and my hair turned a totally natural-looking dirty blonde complete with highlights and lowlights. The texture was soft and perfect. It in no way resembled the artificial blonde on the cover. I wish I&#x27;d kept that color, but decided to go with red again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo...I recommend the product with caveats: It is unpredictable--splotchy first year, gorgeous second year, neither time the color on the box or behind the box. If you have dark hair and want the color on the cover, then buy more than one box, as you will probably have to use the product more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing is that it did NOT damage my hair either time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--WARNING: hair is unpredictable! I don&#x27;t know how it will affect your hair; it is bleach, after all.</li>
    <li> This product Is very deceiving. It can not turn dark hair into blonde. It took me 4 bleaching sessions in order for it to get dresired blonde. But it was not damaging to my hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this bleaching product to dye my dark brown hair for 5 years &amp; I get compliments on my hair every day! I&#x27;m somewhat bummed that I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s great Subscribe &amp; Save program &amp; the product is always out of stock! What&#x27;s up w that Amazon?!!</li>
    <li> Great Price  Fast Shipping  Whole Purchase Experience Very Favorable .</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly. It really does a great job with dying dark hair to Blonde. It worked for me and my hair is very dark brown. The conditioner that comes with it is excellent, too.</li>
