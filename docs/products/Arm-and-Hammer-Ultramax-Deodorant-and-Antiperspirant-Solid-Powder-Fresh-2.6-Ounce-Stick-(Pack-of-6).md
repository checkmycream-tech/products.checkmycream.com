      <li>but we can use each others, its great i love it.</li>
      <li>Good moisture prevention which is nice.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and hope they continue making it!</li>
      <li>But who has that kind of time in the morning??</li>
      <li>So I am kind of stuck.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than in the store, and buying in bulk is nice.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m 100% sure that everybody have their own demands according to their perspiration and preferences.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Our local stores stopped carrying it and this is the best kind in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I should be OK.</li>
      <li>I love Arm &amp; Hammer Ultramax Deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Since I met Arm &amp; Hammer Deodorants, it has been my favorite.</li>
      <li>- gotta love it.</li>
      <li>I love the product.  </li>
      <li>It smelled slightly better but didn&#x27;t work much better.</li>
      <li>what more could you want?</li>
      <li>So I was glad to use this and have it work so well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one that works for me, Amazon has the best price and buying in a pack</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found this online.</li>
      <li>The performance is at parity with top competitors, but the price is much more competitive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most anti-perspirants but not this one</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>trust and have used A&amp;H products for many years.</li>
      <li>my favorite deodorant</li>
      <li>I do not care for strong smelling deodorants, can&#x27;t have \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; scents on me when handling wildlife.  </li>
      <li>The stink of talcum was just too strong.</li>
      <li>smells great and WORKS like no other deodorant ive ever used.  </li>
      <li>this product is fantastic</li>
      <li>Prime membership - free shipping no matter the $ amt.</li>
      <li>Arm and hammer will work, but it&#x27;s far from superior.</li>
      <li>They do not object/react to this deodorant, so this might be good for highly sensitive people as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>only downside of this is that I am a man and the scent is on the girly side, so if Arm and Hammer can make a men&#x27;s scent that is as strong as powder fresh, then that would be great.</li>
      <li>Happy to find it here on Amazon at a decent price point no less.</li>
      <li>If you wear undershirts or are good at preventing the white marks it can leave go with this</li>
      <li>And the stores by me no longer carry powder fresh</li>
      <li>I recently bought this deodorant in search of an effective antiperspirant and deodorant combination.</li>
      <li>Price isn&#x27;t worth returning and going through that hassle.</li>
      <li>and I really like the clean smell of the Powder Fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It took me many many tries to find the right deodorant as I tend to have a fairly strong underarm smell naturally, even after showering.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price, and boy did it ship fast!</li>
      <li>I started using A&amp;H powder fresh and after a long day of work, I still smelled pretty fresh!!!</li>
      <li>The Powder fresh is my favorite presentation, leaving a really really fresh and soft odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 years old and regarding deodorants, this is still my first choice!</li>
      <li>Removal of the top UPC revealed the same UPC but without the word &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This is a first.</li>
      <li>Prompt deliver, exact item.  </li>
      <li>It smelled funny and didn&#x27;t work that well after awhile.</li>
      <li>one, however, is able to eliminate my odor and keep me smelling nice for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the powder fresh scent remains even when I wake up the next morning, so they really mean it when they say that this provides all day</li>
      <li>The arm and hammer lasts a long time, the powder fresh actually smells good not like sport soap or gym soap.</li>
      <li>I received exactly what I ordered and in a very timely fashion.  </li>
      <li>This is going straight into the trash, because I smell exactly like a diaper.</li>
      <li>The gel I felt was good but did not last long, if I put it on in the morning by the afternoon</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s smart always having one on hand.</li>
      <li>Due to skin sensitivity, I need to shop around to find a suitable product.  </li>
      <li>The latest shipment was returned (minus one opened, used stick) for refund.</li>
      <li>To much of a hassle to return so my spouse will have to use it.</li>
      <li>night, undressing, I noticed in the mirror that both underarms were VERY reddened, and sore.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I put on too much, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wore and it didnt really come out even in the wash.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and last 24 hours.</li>
      <li>It contains smell VERY well.</li>
      <li>It seems to work okay as an antiperspirant, so I&#x27;ll probably try some other scent of theirs.</li>
      <li>This has such a pleasant scent, is long lasting, and works reliably even during hot flashes.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different deodorants and have always come back to this one.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Pls go back to the kind that doesnt burn your skin when wet!</li>
      <li>Will go back to Ban Powder Fresh because of this.</li>
      <li>For some reason, no matter how much antiperspirant I put under my right arm pit, at least a little bit of sweat still comes out, so that is more of a unique biological problem with me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this is my favorite, because the invisible solid stick keeps you really dry.</li>
      <li>I think it works by gluing up my pores, which just sounds like a bad thing to me if that is a natural way for the body to eliminate toxins (through sweat).&lt;br /&gt;Smell is okay, but not as great as the roll-on that recently disappeared.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant ever by far, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients have changed very much from the prior product.</li>
      <li>I go to the gym every single day, and at the most, I only receive about a few drops of sweat under my right arm pit.</li>
      <li>The lot numbers were different and the ingredients were VERY</li>
      <li>The only draw back is the white marks it leaves when you put on a shirt, but the drawback is well worth over clear gel in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So... if I wait until I am dry, and I dont put on too much, and I let it absorb</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent perspiration completely, but when applied at night, it does just as well as or better than the clinicals and costs half as much or less.</li>
      <li>This is the only deodorant that our household uses, and the only scent is powder fresh, it helps to keep you dry and smelling like a baby..</li>
      <li>I am switching back to old spice, even though they have trashy commercials and advertising.</li>
      <li>I tried the men&#x27;s version of the cool blast scent, but that only temporarily shielded my underarm odor for about a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had the same experience as Andrew, I noticed if you apply when you are still wet like after a shower, it burns like you just put Icy Hot on your under arms.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exceeelent!  Somehow had a hard time pressing the 5th star, and it falsely came out one.  I love the product.  Sorry I failed to take it with me on my latest sojourn into middle east....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product.  Just prior to this I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine which didn&#x27;t work at all.  So I was glad to use this and have it work so well.  Smells good, I stay dry...what more could you want?</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the smell of talcum powder.  The stench of talc makes me queasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a gift and passed it on.  The stink of talcum was just too strong.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different deodorants and have always come back to this one. It goes on smooth and last 24 hours. Beleive me I have tried it just to see if it would last as long as the packageing states. Good job Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant ever made. I have been using this for years and wouldnt use anything else. Its getting hard to find in stores now for some reason so I otder it here.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that our household uses, and the only scent is powder fresh, it helps to keep you dry and smelling like a baby.. this product is fantastic</li>
    <li> I recently bought this deodorant in search of an effective antiperspirant and deodorant combination. Unfortunately, it is a mediocre antiperspirant and a poor deodorant. I usually use Old Spice High Endurance White stick which actually has only 17% of an almost identical active ingredient while the arm and hammer brand has 19%. I am switching back to old spice, even though they have trashy commercials and advertising. Arm and hammer will work, but it&#x27;s far from superior.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I have ever bought. Will never go back to my previous one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She said that it does the job and does it well</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot and have tried manu different types of deodorants. I have tried the spray, gel stick, and the white style stick. The spray was never enough nor did I feel it helped with the smell. The gel I felt was good but did not last long, if I put it on in the morning by the afternoon I felt I had no deodorant on. The arm and hammer lasts a long time, the powder fresh actually smells good not like sport soap or gym soap. The only draw back is the white marks it leaves when you put on a shirt, but the drawback is well worth over clear gel in my opinion. It contains smell VERY well.It is more expensive that the white stick comparables at cosco but I still feel those do not smell/last like this one. If you wear undershirts or are good at preventing the white marks it can leave go with this you won&#x27;t be disappointed. NOTE: its hard to find at stores, in my area at least, and it is somewhat expensive.</li>
    <li> Tired of sweating so much, I decided to try Secret Clinical. It smelled funny and didn&#x27;t work that well after awhile. And when I sweat, it smelled gross. I tried Degree Clinical. It smelled slightly better but didn&#x27;t work much better. And both were very expensive for OTC deodorant. Enter Arm &amp; Hammer.    I read about this on someone else&#x27;s review of one of the clinical deodorants. I checked it out and saw that it has the same amount of active ingredient as the clinicals but costs the same as ordinary deodorant. I got it, tried it, and loved it. I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a year. It doesn&#x27;t prevent perspiration completely, but when applied at night, it does just as well as or better than the clinicals and costs half as much or less. Excellent.</li>
    <li> The picture and description of the product says its &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; Arm &amp; Hammer and what I received was not. When I looked at the UPC it had invisible in the description but I noticed it was placed over another UPC. Removal of the top UPC revealed the same UPC but without the word &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34; Nice trick! To much of a hassle to return so my spouse will have to use it.</li>
    <li> Been using for years but can&#x27;t find in stores so ordered because i do like.... sent doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies</li>
    <li> my favorite deodorant</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same 6-pack product several times from Amazon in the past. The latest shipment was returned (minus one opened, used stick) for refund. The lot numbers were different and the ingredients were VERY different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon application of the product to my underarms, within minutes it felt as if I had applied BenGay or Icy Hot ... a very unpleasant warm/hot feeling began. I initially ignored it. It did subside after a couple of hours. I thought nothing of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, undressing, I noticed in the mirror that both underarms were VERY reddened, and sore. The soreness and redness lasted two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted A&amp;H through its website and received no response. Twice. I then went to their Facebook page and made similar comments, only to receive a reply to ... contact their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust and have used A&amp;H products for many years. I have never in the past using their products had any issues. This is a first. The ingredients have changed very much from the prior product. Whatever they added has caused me to be burned. I will not use this product again unless and/or until it is corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at your ow risk.</li>
    <li> Another item I&#x27;m having a hard time finding locally in stores.  I&#x27;m allergic to most anti-perspirants but not this one and I really like the clean smell of the Powder Fresh scent.</li>
    <li> This is incredibly thick and sticky like roll-on glue, hard to remove in the shower with 2 soapings. I think it works by gluing up my pores, which just sounds like a bad thing to me if that is a natural way for the body to eliminate toxins (through sweat).&lt;br /&gt;Smell is okay, but not as great as the roll-on that recently disappeared. Purchased 1 tube, never again.</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered this product because it said it was the \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; brand- says so on label, too (having troubles finding invisible in stores).  The product they sent was NOT invisible version and doesn&#x27;t look like the photo.  So we are stuck w/6 of the wrong product.  Price isn&#x27;t worth returning and going through that hassle. Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this online. Our local stores stopped carrying it and this is the best kind in my opinion.</li>
    <li> it is one of the only deoderants that my wife and i can use.  found it on amazon, hard to find at stores in my area so i order bulk here.</li>
    <li> Great value product. The performance is at parity with top competitors, but the price is much more competitive.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for awhile.  Works very well.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores sometimes so we buy it here.  Prime membership - free shipping no matter the $ amt. - gotta love it.</li>
    <li> Due to skin sensitivity, I need to shop around to find a suitable product.  THIS fills the bill quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checked ALL retail locations in my area...no luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucked into this!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Works great!  My mister and I both use it.  And I&#x27;ve got to put in enough words to make the minimum, so I&#x27;m just gonna say, &#x27;yeah&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great product that I can no longer buy locally at a fair price.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. I almost ran out and can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores locally. Happy to find it here on Amazon at a decent price point no less.</li>
    <li> i was using degree for men (Im a woman) and I realized that after a while, I would smell like musty flowers. I work in a fast-paced environment and I sweat a lot. I started using A&amp;H powder fresh and after a long day of work, I still smelled pretty fresh!!!</li>
    <li> Local stores stopped carrying this brand.  I&#x27;m alkergc to traditional deodorant, so this is the only stuff that works.  Worth the price, and boy did it ship fast!</li>
    <li> Not the best fragrance in my opinion. Good moisture prevention which is nice. Would not purchase this again. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the perfect deodorant for me.  It&#x27;s unscented, so there is no oder after taking your shirt off.  I shall be reordering soon just so i have a stockpile.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works great for me and it is so affordable I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the roll-on.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as Andrew, I noticed if you apply when you are still wet like after a shower, it burns like you just put Icy Hot on your under arms. Very unpleasant. I never experienced this from the A&amp;H powder fresh I bought in drug stores. And the stores by me no longer carry powder fresh (why oh why!). So I am kind of stuck. I also noticed it stained a black shirt I wore and it didnt really come out even in the wash. Maybe I put on too much, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... if I wait until I am dry, and I dont put on too much, and I let it absorb I should be OK. But who has that kind of time in the morning?? Would not order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why A&amp;H, why the two formulas? Pls go back to the kind that doesnt burn your skin when wet!</li>
    <li> I use this deodorant all the time. It&#x27;s the only one that works for me, Amazon has the best price and buying in a pack it&#x27;s smart always having one on hand.</li>
    <li> I tried the men&#x27;s version of the cool blast scent, but that only temporarily shielded my underarm odor for about a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, however, is able to eliminate my odor and keep me smelling nice for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the powder fresh scent remains even when I wake up the next morning, so they really mean it when they say that this provides all day protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antiperspirant works wonderfully. I go to the gym every single day, and at the most, I only receive about a few drops of sweat under my right arm pit. For some reason, no matter how much antiperspirant I put under my right arm pit, at least a little bit of sweat still comes out, so that is more of a unique biological problem with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this is that I am a man and the scent is on the girly side, so if Arm and Hammer can make a men&#x27;s scent that is as strong as powder fresh, then that would be great.</li>
    <li> Prompt deliver, exact item.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m the only one who likes this smell.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in the store, and buying in bulk is nice.</li>
    <li> smells great and WORKS like no other deodorant ive ever used.  24 hours later, it still seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Why on earth local stores no longer carry this brand is beyond me.  This has such a pleasant scent, is long lasting, and works reliably even during hot flashes.  My favorite deodorant ever by far, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands.  I do not care for strong smelling deodorants, can&#x27;t have \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; scents on me when handling wildlife.  They do not object/react to this deodorant, so this might be good for highly sensitive people as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Since I met Arm &amp; Hammer Deodorants, it has been my favorite. It feels perfect for my body. However, I&#x27;m 100% sure that everybody have their own demands according to their perspiration and preferences.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brand at least for 10 years, alternating with others like Ban and Dry Idea. But this is my favorite, because the invisible solid stick keeps you really dry. The Powder fresh is my favorite presentation, leaving a really really fresh and soft odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 years old and regarding deodorants, this is still my first choice!</li>
    <li> I had problems finding this product in my regular stores so I ventured to the web.  I found the deodorant and ordered it.  I received exactly what I ordered and in a very timely fashion.  Overall, this was a A+ experience for an A+ product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t knoiw what happened, but either I received a bad batch or Arm &amp; Hammer has changed something because it smells spoiled/flat and basically smells rotten.  Will go back to Ban Powder Fresh because of this.</li>
    <li> Very very good Deodorant, My Family and I love the Arm &amp; Hammer Products, great deal</li>
    <li> Its very good My wife and i have been using this for years, she like the cented ones and i like the uncented but we can use each others, its great i love it.</li>
    <li> I love Arm &amp; Hammer Ultramax Deodorant.  It took me many many tries to find the right deodorant as I tend to have a fairly strong underarm smell naturally, even after showering.  About 12 years ago I found Arm &amp; Hammer and haven&#x27;t changed since then.  About 8 or 9 years ago my grocery store stopped carrying the women&#x27;s deodorant (though they still have Arm &amp; Hammer for men), so I&#x27;ve been buying my deodorant from Amazon for years.  I love this stuff and hope they continue making it!</li>
    <li> This is going straight into the trash, because I smell exactly like a diaper. It seems to work okay as an antiperspirant, so I&#x27;ll probably try some other scent of theirs.</li>
    <li> Living in our rural area means being an hour and over $10.00  (one way) away from the savings of bulk buying at Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club.  With Amazon Prime, we can have the savings of bulk buying without spending half a day and $20.00.</li>
    <li> For me this is the best deodorant on the market. Have been using it for the last ten years</li>
