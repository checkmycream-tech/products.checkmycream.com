      <li>It has the consistency of Vaseline, but if you can deal with that, it is well worth the $10.00 in a store and $5.00 here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can say so far I love it.</li>
      <li>but I guess since I am so big at this point the saran wrap just kind of bunched together underneath my workout belt instead of staying in place the whole workout.</li>
      <li>I also love the short ingredients list!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> didnt do what i read so many ohter say...I dont sweat at all.....</li>
    <li> I have been using  this product for  about  a month  and half and i am pleased  with the results. I like how it makes my skin feel and it  removes all my makeup. I bought orginally because  it  has a good and long reputation.</li>
    <li> I came across this product because I was looking into using waist trainers and fat reducing cream, but my research turned into using this stuff on acne prone skin. I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought about using this thick, oily substance on my face, if I hadn&#x27;t tried the oil cleansing method before and whoa it&#x27;s a miracle in a jar! I&#x27;m not going to say that it&#x27;s cured my acne (I&#x27;ve had awful skin for about 20 years now, but I refuse accutane), but it&#x27;s done amazing things for my skin in just a week&#x27;s time! I also love the short ingredients list!  I put it on my skin, let it sit, then wipe off with a hot, damp microfiber cloth. I don&#x27;t use a cleanser after it, like I&#x27;ve read some people do. My skin immediately responded and calmed down after using it once. I also rub it on my skin, let it sit, then scrape it off with a business card, like it says to do on the albolene website. I scraped out so much gunk! At least half of my clogged up pores (clogged with hardened plugs/grits and blackheads) have been cleared! I could see them slippping out each time I scraped!!! This is amazing stuff and I hope it continues to do amazing things for my very acne prone skin.  Update: I still love this stuff, but now I double cleanse because my skin started getting more oily than usual. I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; with albolene, then cleanse again with dr bronner&#x27;s fragrance free Castile soap, mixed with essential oils. I then use a tiny bit of albolene on the skin around my eyes, as an eye cream and moisturize my face with whatever moisturizer I&#x27;m using at the moment.   I have a feeling this will also play a role in moisturizing when my retain-a arrives in the mail, from all day chemist.   **i try to update my acne related reviews in case someone researching a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, like myself isn&#x27;t misled.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is the best eye makeup remover ever!!!!  Been using since I was 13 years old.</li>
    <li> Great product all around</li>
    <li> Great light moisturizer that wiped clean leaving behind a light non greasy feel</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my face. I have senistive, dry skin and it was leaving my skin really greasy, even after multiple washing. Now I know that is what it&#x27;s suppose to do, moisturing cleanser. I used it only to pull off my makeup and not for daily cleansing. I believe it caused some breakouts on my face I&#x27;m not sure but I don&#x27;t get pimples unless it&#x27;s my time of the month. On the upside I heard that you could use it for slimming down your waist like SweetSweat, so I will have a use for it!</li>
    <li> I have Used this product for over 30 years (shows my age) to remove eye make up.  It leaves not residue, no smell, no greasy feel.  I also use it to remove foundation make up when I wear it.  Compared to expesive designed eye makeup removers, there is no comparison.  This is the only one to use and the best. Thanks Amazon for carrying it.  Lots of local stores don&#x27;t know what it is.</li>
    <li> Use it for my face and stomach.  It&#x27;s really great for exercising</li>
    <li> I use it under waist trainer and it causes me to sweat more. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed clearer smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product to increase body temp and sweat more during my workouts-- elimintating excess water, fast.  It&#x27;s a WHOLE lot cheaper than products like Sweet Sweat that claim to do the same thing.  I learned this while training as an amateur kickboxer/boxer on an MMA team.  This is a secret of all the pros for cutting weight for fights and competitions.  You can slather it on just your upper body, or your entire body.  I usually put it on my entire body, except for my face (ironically), but you can also \\&quot;target\\&quot; areas like your abs, arms, etc. You can also combine this with sauna suits and extra layers of clothes for an even more intense effect--but be careful b/c if you are not used to this type of training or workout in the extreme heat, then you can OVERHEAT and incur serious illness/death. SO USE WITH CAUTION and make sure you are well hydrated.  I have no idea how it works as a makeup remover, it seems rather greasy so I have never wanted it NEAR my face.</li>
    <li> I love it..I put a small amount my tummy area with my waist trimmer belt from Sweet Sweat and the sweating begins with my workout. When I take off the belt, you wanna see sweat.. Its great and also great for the skin!!</li>
    <li> Item was dirty and partially damaged. When I opened the box some of the cleanser spilled forming a ring the size of the container inside the box. The outside of the container was also dirty.</li>
    <li> I love Albolene,been using it for years in place of lotion. I have sensitive skin, it works wonders. And my feet is so smooth &amp; soft. Not using Albolene is like going without food.</li>
    <li> This product is impossible to find on the shelf anymore. I LOVE it. No other make up remover is nearly as good. I just hope Amazon continues to  stock it. I always order one extra to keep on hand although one jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!! I wish I would&#x27;ve known about it sooner but better late than never!</li>
    <li> Not happy with the packaging at all. The cream is unsealed and its spliting out all over the container. I don&#x27;t know if I should use it or not. I mean are we even suppose to use unsealed items like cream?</li>
    <li> So after reading a couple reviews, I was sold. Once this item arrived, I applied some on my stomach, love handles, ankles, arms and thighs and then went to the gym. Boy boy boy when I tell you I though I was wearing a sauna suit. My arms &amp; stomach were dripping from sweat. This is a MUST BUY!!</li>
    <li> Great for make up but not on body it causes cancer I learned to be very careful with it</li>
    <li> Put this all over my body before a work out and I sweat like pig! Especially when I pair it with my waist trainer! Def recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Albolene, I use it to remove makeup, but the container I have at home and can only buy near my home is large, I was thrilled when I found this smaller container to take on vacation with me.  Thank you. It arrive when it wa supposed to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Much better than the more expensive cleansing creams.  Takes makeup off quickly without drying the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for when you want to make a certain body part sweat especially the stomach.</li>
    <li> Lost about 8 inches total around my hips and waist using this under my neoprene sauna vest!</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this product because I was told it would help me sweat, I applied this thick, greasy gook onto parts of my body I wanted to sweat out (stomach), then wrapped the area of which I applied the stuff with plastic clear wrap follow by applying my sweat belt for my stomach, some people called it ti8ngling I call it itching. The heck with this stuff, not for me. I don&#x27;t doubt it works but I couldn&#x27;t deal with the itchiness I was experiencing</li>
    <li> I bought this only because of the postitive reviews but unfortunately its not for me. After just two days of use I broke out on my forehead, chin and sides of face. It also burned my eyes and made my face feel super greasy. I am going back to using tea tree face wash. Its thick enough to use as a moisturizer on rough skin like elbows and feet so maybe i will try that. I ultimately bought it to remove face makeup (mac) and it failed.</li>
    <li> I use this for my belly. I mix it with a cellulite reducer and rub it on my belly with a waist trimmer before I go work out or clean, And I sweat like mad!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews of how good the product is for removing makeup. Since then I  purchased it I discovered it is excellent for taking inches off your waist. Who knew? I would recommend this product--leaves your face soft and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience. My product came before the estimated delivery date and it was packaged perfectly so there was no way the container could be damaged. This was my first time using this particular cream. It made my skin feel extra smooth and healthy unlike other products I have used in the past. I would defiantly buy this product again and recommend it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Victoria ruano</li>
    <li> I received my order two days late with is being previously opened, the container looked used and I can tell someone swiped their nasty finger on my product before it got to me</li>
    <li> I give this item, Albolene a rating of 5 stars...Id recommend this product to anyone who loves to feel soft skin bcuz basically this item makes ur skin feel soft....another good advantage is if anyone wants to sweat off access weight its best to apply some albolene to your body before exercising, it will make you sweat more...</li>
    <li> This stuff is just magical.</li>
    <li> Really makes you sweat if you are looking to loose weight!!! Just apply it wherever you want to sweat and then wrap it with serane wrap!! Be prepared to sweat lol</li>
    <li> This is what the Broadway performers use to remove their makeup and it is a phenomenal anti-aging product. It has the consistency of Vaseline, but if you can deal with that, it is well worth the $10.00 in a store and $5.00 here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is very greasy and some people don&#x27;t want that effect, I am willing to deal with that aspect for the anti-aging benefits. If you remember when our Grandmothers used Ponds cold cream, think of it in that aspect. It does remove make-up, but it does so through the process of slathering it on and removing the make-up with a tissue. It isn&#x27;t a soap product such as what we are accustomed to in today&#x27;s market. I use this as more of a moisturizer, than a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps someone.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for removing makeup, even waterproof mascara.  It is very moisturizing if you use according to package instructions, which you apply and then tissue off without rinsing.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the protective film it leaves behind, so I usually follow with a warm washcloth to remove additional residue.  Great for cleansing your face in the winter months.</li>
    <li> This is the best make up remover!!!!!!!!!!! It is way better than many highly priced cleansing products. Removes makeup quickly without drying the skin. I like the texture as well and highly recommend it. It is indeed a keeper!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent makeup remover. I also used it before working out. I slabbed a small amount on my belly, wrapped myself with some plastic wrap, wore a girdle, got on the treadmill for 20 minutes. When i unwrapped myself i was drenched with water.  It was so motivating because i have never sweated this much water. It was more than sweat, it was water !</li>
    <li> very nice fast shipping</li>
    <li> Definitely makes you sweat more when you apply to your stomach and put a workout belt over it. I heard about the saran wrap idea (where you apply albolene then the saran wrap on top then the workout belt as it is supposed to increase your sweating during your workout increasingly so) but I guess since I am so big at this point the saran wrap just kind of bunched together underneath my workout belt instead of staying in place the whole workout. (waist: 40 inches)</li>
    <li> THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF OUT THERE AND THIS IS A GOODNIGHT CLEANSER</li>
    <li> I use this product to help me sweat in my midsection while working out! It works and helps me out a lot!</li>
    <li> excellent for dry skin</li>
    <li> I love it...I used it on my daughter&#x27;s Halloween party makeup. The makeup came off so effortless, even removed the stubborn mascara with no problem. It leaves my face felling so refreshed, I think it works better than the name brands I used to buy.</li>
    <li> cant tell a difference</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Leaves your face feeling very smooth and not greasy. Really works on taking ALL eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described and received very quickly!</li>
    <li> i love love love it! using it as we speak and it really helps when u work out and to make your skin feel beautiful</li>
    <li> I have been using my Albolene for the past week and I can say so far I love it. No scent as advertised which was a real plus for me. Also besides using as a make up removed it&#x27;s great for making me sweat when I workout. So it goes great with my waist training journey that I am taking as well! Would order again!</li>
    <li> Using in conjunction with waist trainer...makes you sweat!  Love product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it to take off makeup and to sweat in the sauna. I will be buying more...</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was described as a \\&quot;Moisturizing Cleanser\\&quot; which opens pores.  This product is simply a mix of mineral oil and Vaseline.  The label shows the first two contents as mineral oil and petrolatum.  Once you have it on your skin it does not wash off with water.  I attempted to wash my hands and the water just beaded up and rolled off the skin.  It leaves the skin looking and feeling greasy because it&#x27;s literally coated with petroleum jelly. Just buy Vaseline at the store and you&#x27;ll have essentially the same product.  Again this is NOT a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this as a personal lubricant not as a face cream or makeup cleanser, it works great. It does remove halloween makeup nicely too.</li>
    <li> I use this along with my workout belt, it helps to sweat off those extra inches!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are people who like this consistency but I am not one of them. I purchased this based on reviewers who recommended this product since I could not find the original formula of Pond&#x27;s cold cream. This is glorified petroleum jelly. If you want something creamy this is not it. I did try it for a week and it leaves my face greasy as well as my pillow cases. I&#x27;ve started using it on my heels to soften them so I at least have one use for it.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a moisturizing cream for my entire body. It works wonders. It is a miracle product for dry and/or cracking feet or heels. I  absolutely love the results I get from using this product. However, I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff removes my makeup without a lot of tugging. Leaves my face feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes red and irritated.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover ever.</li>
    <li> I received this product and I must say it&#x27;s awesome!!!!!!! It really makes me sweat in the areas i apply it to.</li>
    <li> Well I used it like all the other users instructed but didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have used Albolene as a make up remover for two decades. It cleans makeup all off, even mascara. It leaves skin soft. One large jar will last a year or more. I highly recommend it for normal or dry skin.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this product was a waste of money and has no affect on me.</li>
    <li> So delighted to get my hands on this time honored favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it to sweat off inches from my tummy I apply a generous amount, then wrap myself with saran wrap and I am soaked after my workout.</li>
    <li> Heard about this for cutting water weight and it worked! No complaints! I would give this product 5 stars except it took almost an extra week to ship than advertised. Great product though.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product, but I does encourage sweating.</li>
    <li> This cream made me break out in a rash all over my back and stomach while using with a waist trainer.  It went away a couple weeks after I stopped using the cream, but continued using the waist trainer so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the cream.</li>
    <li> I understand that people love it, frankly as smooth &amp; creamy it is, I can understand why.  It really feels great on my face.  It protects from cold, blustery, winter days or anytime my skin feels dry.  I have paid a ton more for other products, which left my skin drier than before use. Albolene is very moisturizing.  However without directions, I&#x27;m wondering if I am using it correctly.  I&#x27;m using it to take my makeup off, then I wash with my regular cleanser, and wash off with warm water and/or warm towel. Finally, I put more Albolene on to seal in the moisture. So far it&#x27;s working well as a moisturizer makeup remover but am I using it correctly? Maybe after a search on YouTube for more information, I will have the guidance I need.</li>
    <li> Using this product for the Albolene YouTube challenge ! Look it up ! It&#x27;s great for make up as well</li>
    <li> Works for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> great product it makes you sweat alot. i used it before and i will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I like this for my skin and working out only issue I have is that it itches when I use under my wrap other than that its pretty good for moisturizing and helping you sweat more</li>
    <li> Great product I use it to work out</li>
    <li> Just as described,  good product.</li>
    <li> Did a poor job of cleaning skin.</li>
    <li> Bought it to use with my waist trainer as I worked out. It helped me sweat just a little more then my usual workout. My only issue was it started to itch after a few but most likely due to my sensitive skin. Overall great. It is unscented which is a plus but very greasy!</li>
    <li> I had no idea this was used for spot fat reducing, I only use this for removing makeup. It does that well, but it leaves a super greasy feel, so I have to use a cleanser afterward.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders... Lost a while inch around my belly from using this while exercising!</li>
    <li> My wife needed a fragrance free moisturizer that would help soothe her eczema.  This product meets both of those requirements.</li>
    <li> I use it during workouts with a waist trimmer belt and it definitely makes you sweat! Invest in this product if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight!</li>
    <li> everyone loves this stuff it is great !!</li>
    <li> I love it.my skin feel good</li>
    <li> Very rich moisturizing cleanser.  Great for the cold weather.  reduces dryness.</li>
    <li> First off I ordered the blue unscientific one but received the red scented one not only that but it was broken on the bottom of the jar disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this moisturizing cleanser.</li>
    <li> works great with my sweat belt. no complaints</li>
    <li> When Mary Kay discontinued their Extra Emollient cleanser, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, NO!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d been relying on that for over 20 years. Then I saw that someone recommended this as a replacement. YAY!!!!!  It works just as well, and it&#x27;s cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may say this is too heavy or greasy. I LOVE it. It&#x27;s richness is the key to really getting your skin clean and getting makeup off. And it&#x27;s the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave traces of mascara and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry as the Sahara. If you have dry skin like I do, this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  delivery was very fast</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good price. Good product.</li>
