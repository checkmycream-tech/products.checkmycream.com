      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>This is the best sleep aid I’ve ever found.</li>
      <li>This thing is marvelous.</li>
      <li>What a great job it does!</li>
      <li>Based on their excellent customer service I am raising the company to 3 stars.</li>
      <li>The eye mask can be adjusted to your perfect</li>
      <li>The idea for the product is great: it is supposed to allow you to sleep on the side while your ears are blocked from noise.</li>
      <li>Great and relaxing sleep.  </li>
      <li>It has proven very effective for me.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t block out the noise at all, but if you use it with earplugs you get the perfect combination for a better sleep</li>
      <li>It is time for de Cordova to lose his monopoly over devices to enable people to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
      <li>It looks like one good night of tossing and turning would rip it apart.  </li>
      <li>This sleep mask with pillow and sound muffler is a wonderful design.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t block sound very good.</li>
      <li>received this product at a discount for my unbiased review and am happy I can sincerely recommend it to all of you.</li>
      <li>It works for me amazingly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update on 12-27-2012 I was contacted by the company and had a nice conversation on the use and capabilities of the product.</li>
      <li>was offered this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of it.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the designer of this great product!</li>
      <li>I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for my honest review</li>
      <li>I’m a very light sleeper and after years of living with noisy children and a spouse who doesn’t sleep, I finally able to get some peace and good nights sleep.</li>
      <li>I thought this product would do a good job of blocking out sound, but it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>Compare for example with this good mask: it doesn&#x27;t press on eyes and blocks the light well:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
      <li>Also, am able to watch TV, and take it to camping trips.</li>
      <li>He got the idea in a dream for free!  </li>
      <li>The velcro I was able to move around somewhat</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was ok.  </li>
      <li>The Nap-Star is an amazing mutlifunction design of a Sleep Mask / Sound Muffling and Portable Pillow.</li>
      <li>He got the idea in a dream for free!  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Just ok.</li>
      <li>I tend to be very sensitive to light and sound while trying to go to sleep, so this works perfect in reducing excess distractions.  </li>
      <li>This mask might be nice while on a flight but more so for dimming out the light, it won&#x27;t stop much sound.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and soft, and combined with the ear plugs, did a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The product is comfortable to wear, and it is effective in light control.  </li>
      <li>This mask perfectly cushions your neck/ears and provides an extra sound barrier without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>The material was soft and comfortable and did a great job blocking the light; it was also pretty good at muffling the sound too!</li>
      <li>I have a ski headband I got for free that works better.  </li>
      <li>The company offered to exchange the Nap Star for their DreamHelmut which is proported to have better sound control.</li>
      <li>An added bonus I&#x27;ve found with this mask is that it keeps my hair in place, and is much more comfortable than a ponytail holder/clips.</li>
      <li>The front piece is nice, soft felt that does a good job of blocking light.</li>
      <li>However, I found it to be comfortable and to do its advertised job of blocking out light and providing more comfortable travel</li>
      <li>but the ear covers do not block out any sound at all.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit well and did not block out the noise.  </li>
      <li>The drop in sound level was so miniscule as to be undedectible.&lt;br /&gt;Rereading</li>
      <li>It did appear, however, that the mask would block out light effectively.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t block the sound.</li>
      <li>The mask is not blocking the light well, doesn&#x27;t hold shape, wrinkles and presses on eyes.</li>
      <li>The information on this product says it does not block 100% of all sound.  </li>
      <li>Plus, the straps do not hold it comfortably in place - you have to tighten them to the point of causing a headache.</li>
      <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t block the sound.</li>
      <li>I could just as well wrapped an old T-shirt around my head for all the good it did.  </li>
      <li>Cheap version (original?) of the helmet I originally saw advertised.</li>
      <li>at least I can make it fit perfectly for sleeping in the airplane.</li>
      <li>Normal sound blocking headphones block the sound way better.</li>
      <li>Good masks are made in such a way that they have special hills to avoid pressing on eyes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if your initial impression is you don&#x27;t like wearing a mask, don&#x27;t despair as it takes a couple of nights to get used to it and have the benefits of a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch,</li>
      <li>For me, it was easy to get the mask to fit well and stay in place, although I didn&#x27;t see much need for the chin strap and haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
      <li>They add stickers you can stick on that say &#x27;wake me up for refreshments&#x27; or &#x27;do not disturb&#x27; as messages to the steward(esse)s, pretty cool!</li>
      <li>I recommend it very highly - 10 stars - for anyone who neeeds to block out light and sound.</li>
      <li>It arrived today, and I quickly tried it out.  </li>
      <li>Sound deadening is a problem which is why I bought the product in the first place.  </li>
      <li>The first night I got this mask, I sleep like the proverbial baby!</li>
      <li>Given the price, it might be worth a try for some people.  </li>
      <li>It blocks sound and light and allows me to relax naturally.</li>
      <li>Just play around with the adjustments to get the right confortable fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It serves him right to lose it.</li>
      <li>It does block out the light, but I find all the wrapping to be a little too warm for my taste, so I just used the mask.</li>
      <li>would be the main reason for keeping out any sound, the cushioned siding on this mask really does not do much for sound blocking, not as much as I had hoped!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I recently got a Napstar, a sleeping mask that has brought me back to feeling rested  and happy again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the sound of positioning the velcro, and of pulling the velcro apart, is so loud that it literally hurts my ears.</li>
      <li>The retinas of their eyes continue to process light, even coming through the eye lids, and never get complete rest.  </li>
      <li>the one review that was available at the time I ordered,it leads me to wonder if that review was a plant by the company it was so far off the mark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am forever searching for ways to be able to sleep during the day, as I work a second shift.  </li>
      <li>Blocks out light and diminishes noice to barely audible levels.</li>
      <li>This is more important to America and the human race, than his personal profits.&lt;br</li>
      <li>his \\&quot;inventor&#x27;s true story\\&quot; how he developed the idea.  </li>
      <li>his \\&quot;inventor&#x27;s true story\\&quot; how he developed the idea.  </li>
      <li>I REALLY REGRET TO GET IT</li>
      <li>DeCordova seems very pround of his patent.  </li>
      <li>NapStar is a smaller version of the DreamHelmet and easily fit in a carry on luggage for use on a flight.</li>
      <li>design is simple and comfortable, it cushions your head</li>
      <li>It helps me get that much needed nap when travelling on a busnisess trip.</li>
      <li>The cost of the NapStar is $19.95 which is very affordable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t very cushiony like I hoped.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my head is too big, but it does not cover my ears well at all, it leaves gaps all over that let sound in.</li>
      <li>I really, really tried to use this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>If you use it with the earplugs and find a way to push it tighter against your head, it does reduce ambient sound, and the band keeps the earplugs from falling out in the middle of the night.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the 2nd generation of the original DreamHelmet which I still have and use it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does help some, but not tremendously in and of itself (again, as others have mentioned, it would be nice if it could provide an alternative to wearing ear plugs (which, if you don&#x27;t know, 2 soft ear plugs come along with the mask).</li>
      <li>the blindfold works decently.</li>
      <li>Some how the model makes it look attractive, but in real life it is impossible not to laugh at the helmet ear cushion eye covered phenomenon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it is superior to the generic masks I used in the past</li>
      <li>The normal blocking headphones go around the ear.</li>
      <li>Other eye masks are not as comfortable because they have elastic bands that go around my head.</li>
      <li>It is not small, it covers a lot of your face and neck.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>
    <li> This one is made pretty shoddy and there is nothing in it that would muffle sound.  It looks like one good night of tossing and turning would rip it apart.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> DeCordova seems very pround of his patent.  But how does such a patent serve the public interest?  A patent should enable a company to do the research and development to develop a product.  But how much R&amp;D had to go into such a simple product?  It hasn&#x27;t changed or improved in over 10 years.  It is time for de Cordova to lose his monopoly over devices to enable people to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  This is more important to America and the human race, than his personal profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of people are living and working at less than their full potential by being awakened during the night, by lights and sounds.  They do not remember them, because they go back to sleep.  But in the morning they feel groggy and may not know why.  The retinas of their eyes continue to process light, even coming through the eye lids, and never get complete rest.  So their sight diminishes with age.  For reasons of national health and productivity, De Cordova should lose his patent and it should be public domain for the welfare of American citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeCordova describes in his \\&quot;inventor&#x27;s true story\\&quot; how he developed the idea.  He got the idea in a dream for free!  So that was his R&amp;D that he needs  $1 million compensation for?  I look forward to the expiration of his patent in a few years, so I can buy from his competition.diminishes with age.  For reasons of national health and productivity, De Cordova should lose his patent immediately and it should be public domain for the welfare of American citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeCordova describes in his \\&quot;inventor&#x27;s true story\\&quot; how he developed the idea.  He got the idea in a dream for free!  So that was his R&amp;D that he needs $1 million compensation for?  Jim De Cordova is a disgusting, greedy, jerk.  I would never buy anything from him.  I look forward to the expiration of his patent in a few years, so I can buy from his competition.  It serves him right to lose it.</li>
    <li> Pros: The idea for the product is great: it is supposed to allow you to sleep on the side while your ears are blocked from noise. Noise blocking headphones don&#x27;t allow sleeping on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it performs poorly. The mask is not blocking the light well, doesn&#x27;t hold shape, wrinkles and presses on eyes. Good masks are made in such a way that they have special hills to avoid pressing on eyes. Compare for example with this good mask: it doesn&#x27;t press on eyes and blocks the light well:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000CCI4YU Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same problem with noise blocking. The product doesn&#x27;t block the sound. The normal blocking headphones go around the ear. This thing does not. It almost doesn&#x27;t block the sound. It is useless in blocking the sound. Normal sound blocking headphones block the sound way better. I compared them side by side.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t block out the noise at all, but if you use it with earplugs you get the perfect combination for a better sleep</li>
    <li> This is a different sleep mask so takes some getting used to. However, I found it to be comfortable and to do its advertised job of blocking out light and providing more comfortable travel well. It is much better than the sweatshirts that I usually try to use as a pillow when flying! For me, it was easy to get the mask to fit well and stay in place, although I didn&#x27;t see much need for the chin strap and haven&#x27;t used it. Where I do agree with some others that it falls short, is at blocking sounds. It does help some, but not tremendously in and of itself (again, as others have mentioned, it would be nice if it could provide an alternative to wearing ear plugs (which, if you don&#x27;t know, 2 soft ear plugs come along with the mask). My purposes are comfort and light-blocking so it worked well for me despite this. Also, it really tends to bother me having a fan on at night in the summer, even though it&#x27;s necessary, because my hair blows around in my face. An added bonus I&#x27;ve found with this mask is that it keeps my hair in place, and is much more comfortable than a ponytail holder/clips. Sometimes I wear it just for this reason. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T MEET MY EXPECTATION AT ALL. IT HAS VERY BAD MATERIAL BESIDE IT IS NOT COMFORTABLE AS IT IS OBVIOUS IN THE PICTURE. I REALLY REGRET TO GET IT</li>
    <li> I am forever searching for ways to be able to sleep during the day, as I work a second shift.  After years of a normal 9-5 schedule, I am finding it difficult to sleep when the sun is shining, so I am trying a variety of methods to block the light and sound so I can sleep.  I had the opportunity to try this sleep mask system and I bought it.  It takes some getting used to, I think.  It is not small, it covers a lot of your face and neck.  It includes ear plugs so you can have no noise.  It does block out the light, but I find all the wrapping to be a little too warm for my taste, so I just used the mask. It is comfortable and soft, and combined with the ear plugs, did a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of it.</li>
    <li> the blindfold works decently. but the ear covers do not block out any sound at all.</li>
    <li> Unconformable.  It didn&#x27;t fit well and did not block out the noise.  Could not get all of he pieces in place at one time.</li>
    <li> This mask might be nice while on a flight but more so for dimming out the light, it won&#x27;t stop much sound. The mask comes with (bad quality) earplugs, and the earplugs (if they were better quality) would be the main reason for keeping out any sound, the cushioned siding on this mask really does not do much for sound blocking, not as much as I had hoped! I like that the mask is adjustable so at least I can make it fit perfectly for sleeping in the airplane. They add stickers you can stick on that say &#x27;wake me up for refreshments&#x27; or &#x27;do not disturb&#x27; as messages to the steward(esse)s, pretty cool!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get my wife to use it!</li>
    <li> This mask is not sound proof, very uncomfortable to sleep with!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit my husband and I laughed for a full 90 seconds followed by half an hour of partial laughing when I first received this game changing sleep mask. I think it is the chinstrap. Some how the model makes it look attractive, but in real life it is impossible not to laugh at the helmet ear cushion eye covered phenomenon. But the chin strap is optional. I don&#x27;t wear it, but my husband likes it (yes he now wears it when he sleeps during the day) because it keeps the mask in place while he moves around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping in downtown Chicago a few blocks away from one of the biggest best trauma centers in the country is not as hard as I imagined, but not easy. It never gets dark. Even with the windows closed and 19 floors above street level you can hear ambulances and medleys of honking horns. This mask perfectly cushions your neck/ears and provides an extra sound barrier without being overpowering. The eye mask can be adjusted to your perfect position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review and am happy I can sincerely recommend it to all of you. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t block sound very good.</li>
    <li> It is not works like describes.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is not sound muffling as the advertisement pretends</li>
    <li> I like that it is made in the USA, but there&#x27;s a couple of things I don&#x27;t like.  One is light can filter under the mask unless you pull it way down.  It&#x27;s also very thin - not very cushiony.  I also don&#x27;t like how the velcro on the side cushions can rub against your face if you don&#x27;t align it properly against the face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to China - so will see how it works on the plane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Used it on my China trip.  It just wasn&#x27;t very cushiony like I hoped.  The velcro I was able to move around somewhat so it wasn&#x27;t moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was ok.  Just ok.</li>
    <li> Since I have trouble sleeping, I bought this. It has proven very effective for me. It does block out the sound and even though it looks uncomfortable, you can barely feel it. It&#x27;s very comfortable and I even use it when I travel.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with falling asleep and staying asleep. My husband is a &#x27;nightowl&#x27; that likes to watch ESPN for 3 and 4 hours in the middle of the night. The first night I got this mask, I sleep like the proverbial baby! The material was soft and comfortable and did a great job blocking the light; it was also pretty good at muffling the sound too! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> The Nap-Star is an amazing mutlifunction design of a Sleep Mask / Sound Muffling and Portable Pillow. It&#x27;s the 2nd generation of the original DreamHelmet which I still have and use it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NapStar is a smaller version of the DreamHelmet and easily fit in a carry on luggage for use on a flight. It helps me get that much needed nap when travelling on a busnisess trip. The cost of the NapStar is $19.95 which is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your initial impression is you don&#x27;t like wearing a mask, don&#x27;t despair as it takes a couple of nights to get used to it and have the benefits of a good night&#x27;s sleep. Just play around with the adjustments to get the right confortable fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is superior to the generic masks I used in the past and now I don&#x27;t travel without my NapStar.Thanks to the designer of this great product!</li>
    <li> No stars!!! Horrible just horrible!! (One stars only because it doesn&#x27;t allow putting none)  it&#x27;s just horrible dont waste money on it !</li>
    <li> Because i hear ecerything still i didnt kno it was just a cloth covering my eyes and ears was very disappointed</li>
    <li> This sleep mask with pillow and sound muffler is a wonderful design. It allows you to sleep anywhere, with out being disturbed.You can use this four different ways: with or without mask, pillow, or chin strap. No matter how you sleep, if you toss and turn or lay still it will not fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for my honest review</li>
    <li> I really, really tried to use this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I use a cpap machine, and the sound of the air wooshing in my face drives me crazy. I do not want to sleep every night with earplugs, so I shopped around looking for an alternative. I thought this product would do a good job of blocking out sound, but it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. Maybe my head is too big, but it does not cover my ears well at all, it leaves gaps all over that let sound in. The front piece is nice, soft felt that does a good job of blocking light. HOWEVER, the sound of positioning the velcro, and of pulling the velcro apart, is so loud that it literally hurts my ears. Ridiculous, right? And trust me, you do not want to get your hair caught in this velcro. Plus, the straps do not hold it comfortably in place - you have to tighten them to the point of causing a headache.</li>
    <li> It arrived today, and I quickly tried it out.  I could just as well wrapped an old T-shirt around my head for all the good it did.  The drop in sound level was so miniscule as to be undedectible.&lt;br /&gt;Rereading the one review that was available at the time I ordered,it leads me to wonder if that review was a plant by the company it was so far off the mark.&lt;br /&gt;I have, as we all have, bought things that have not measured up to our expectations, but this thing is utterly useless with regard to sound.  It did appear, however, that the mask would block out light effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 12-27-2012 I was contacted by the company and had a nice conversation on the use and capabilities of the product. The product is comfortable to wear, and it is effective in light control.  Sound deadening is a problem which is why I bought the product in the first place.  The company offered to exchange the Nap Star for their DreamHelmut which is proported to have better sound control. Based on their excellent customer service I am raising the company to 3 stars. I will report on the DreanHelmut when I get it.</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to sleep when the moon is full or I need a nap and it is sunny outside, and the mask helps me. Other eye masks are not as comfortable because they have elastic bands that go around my head. It muffles sounds too, so that I am less sensitive to sound. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The information on this product says it does not block 100% of all sound.  According to my ears it blocks no sound at all.  It&#x27;s also very difficult to fit with the velcro attachments between the eye mask and pillow portion.  I have a ski headband I got for free that works better.  This thing is really useless to me and in my view does not come close to delivering on its promises.  I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon for brokering sales of this thing.  I&#x27;d give it zero stars if that were an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED on 24 June 2013: Due to the avid responsiveness of the company founder I am raising my rating on this to three stars (\\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot;).  If you use it with the earplugs and find a way to push it tighter against your head, it does reduce ambient sound, and the band keeps the earplugs from falling out in the middle of the night.  Given the price, it might be worth a try for some people.  Just don&#x27;t expect miracles, but then again it doesn&#x27;t promise them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as described.</li>
    <li> Was referred to this product by a mutual friend.  Great and relaxing sleep.  Never leave home without it while on the road.  I tend to be very sensitive to light and sound while trying to go to sleep, so this works perfect in reducing excess distractions.  Half the cost of Brookstone.  I&#x27;m buying one for my wife.</li>
    <li> I am a retired 65-year old woman who for the last year, has been having insomnia problems.  I didn&#x27;t even look forward to going to bed anymore.&lt;br /&gt;However, I recently got a Napstar, a sleeping mask that has brought me back to feeling rested  and happy again.&lt;br /&gt;The design is simple and comfortable, it cushions your head but it does it is not constricting.  It blocks sound and light and allows me to relax naturally. Also, am able to watch TV, and take it to camping trips. It has brought back the needed energy to do the things I want to do.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.  It works for me amazingly.</li>
    <li> missing part when delivered, not what it looks like on net , not a very good product overall rubbish</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and that&#x27;s basically all there is to say. The fact that you get ear plugs with it confirms this! Didn&#x27;t want to give it 1 star buy review can&#x27;t be submitted without selecting a star.</li>
    <li> WOW! Thank God! I’m a very light sleeper and after years of living with noisy children and a spouse who doesn’t sleep, I finally able to get some peace and good nights sleep.This thing is marvelous. What a great job it does! Blocks out light and diminishes noice to barely audible levels. This is the best sleep aid I’ve ever found. I recommend it very highly - 10 stars - for anyone who neeeds to block out light and sound.</li>
    <li> Cheap version (original?) of the helmet I originally saw advertised.</li>
