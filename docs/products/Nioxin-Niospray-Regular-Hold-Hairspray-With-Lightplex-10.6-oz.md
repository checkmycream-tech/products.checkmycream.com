    <li> Loving it. It arrived on time also.</li>
    <li> I like the product since I use the shampoo and conditioner I saw the hair spray and decided it would round out the treatments for hair.  I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My wife starting using Nioxin products about two years ago when she changed her hair stylist.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier that she did.  She uses only Nioxin products now and her hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> Very light and brushes out easily.</li>
    <li> Great for anyone who wants a light hsirspray</li>
    <li> Love this..... it smells so GOOD!</li>
    <li> Much better than the Extra Firm formula!!</li>
    <li> I love all the Nioxin products I have brought and continue to use them but NOT this one!!!  Would not hold at all!!!  About like using water.  Did not like the regular hold at all.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray great hold</li>
    <li> Even though I have thick hair I LOVE this product.  It is so light yet holds very well and the smell is very light also.  LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. No problems&amp;#62; Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> This nor the Nioxin shampoo &amp; conditioner were worth the expense.  Very harsh, removed hair color. Not worth the cost</li>
    <li> Tried this and was not pleased. It does not hold your hair and I cannot use other products or my scalp will itch and my hair will fall out. I really had high hopes for this product but it did not happen.</li>
    <li> Yes! This product is great. It holds well and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to have any hold.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the root lifter but a lot less expensive so I bought the lifter</li>
    <li> I rarely use hairspray, but when I do -- I only use Nioxin.  A hairdresser recommended it 10+ years ago when I lived in heavy humidity (Florida) -- my New Mexico hairdresser (no humidity) also highly recommended it.  It is not a heavy hairspray, but just gives light body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best holding hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. It also keeps my soft and manageable enough I can run my fingers through it or a comb anytime and it not get ruined.</li>
    <li> formerly Nioxin offered a styling spray that I preferred.  This is second best for the use i needed.</li>
    <li> It seems the company has changed their formula.  It makes my hair sticky and hard to comb thru it. I have used Regular Hold for a long time and loved it , but it did not have &amp;#34;lightplex&amp;#34; in it.  I am not sure what that is. I wrote to the company that is,  and what does it do to your hair, and they never answered me.  I am very disappointed in this hairspray. I guess I will have to locate a different one that washes out.  This leaves a film on my hair and the only way I can get it off is use Baking Soda in warm water.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray because you can wash it out very easy. and it hold your hair really good w/o a lot of spray.</li>

    <li> This hairspray is light, does not break my neck out, and does not flatten or sticky my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND. MAKE MY HAIR STAY AS I SET UP WHILE LOOK NATURAL, LIGHT AND SOFT.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed the way Nioxin takes care of my hair.</li>
    <li> Just as described! TY</li>
    <li> Nioxin Hairspray is wonderful. It has the right amount of hold without any sticky or &amp;#34;hard as a brick&amp;#34; feel. Even if your hair gets wet, when it drys, you can brush it as if the hairspray were never there. I love Nioxin hairspray.</li>
