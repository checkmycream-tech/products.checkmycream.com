      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>The fiber itself is great for this kind of thing.</li>
      <li>It is a great product that works well and is economical</li>
      <li>The manufacturer showed have allowed for the known stretching characteristics of sisal and compensated with more material.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it and have two extras just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel like it does a better job than a loofah.  </li>
      <li>Really good back scrubber...feels good and makes me feel &#x27;cleaner&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I use it every time I shower--don&#x27;t feel clean unless I do!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful find - it can be used either wet or dry - it is very effective!</li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin so the fact that he found it not too abrasive is remarkable</li>
      <li>However, they all had a strong odor of sisal.</li>
      <li>and I don;t notice a strong smell, as mentioned by others.</li>
      <li>It works great, my back has never been cleaner!</li>
      <li>What a great back scratcher!  </li>
      <li>But it works great for football shoulders and long arms.</li>
      <li>Good scrub surface and easy to rinse clean and hang to dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something to scrub my back for a long while, and this has been the best answer.</li>
      <li>Maybe okay to use on the bottoms of your feet, but to scrub on sensitive parts of your body??</li>
      <li>It feels so good to finally scrub your back and know that it&#x27;s clean!  </li>
      <li>Just wet it really good in hot water, rub your soap on it or pour your bath gel on it and</li>
      <li>Initially it was  quite effective and very stimulating.</li>
      <li>Now my back is left squeaky clean and looking very healthy.  </li>
      <li>If you plan on using them as gifts in any way, consider first washing them thoroughly.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S OK , NOT MADE TO LAST !</li>
      <li>I did notice a smell on first opening the package and using it the first time, but it faded away and there&#x27;s no odor now.  </li>
      <li>One of the handles broke the first time I held it.</li>
      <li>This sisal back strap works much better than the type with a handle.  </li>
      <li>This product does the job, but it is very light weight and not made for long use.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 star only because the space between knots are kind of too far and that make it not too much practical.</li>
      <li>voila, you&#x27;re ready.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and easier to come by than hiring a bath attendant.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because the sisal fibers cling to the skin and help to remove skin cells very efficiently.  </li>
      <li>you can get your back and backside clean.  </li>
      <li>Finally - a clean back!</li>
      <li>I bought it to replace one I had used for many years that was getting stretched and a bit thin, but it is still superior to this new one.</li>
      <li>I never use this one anymore, though it is a decent product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Had it been somewhat wider initially and even shorter, I believe it would be more serviceable long term.</li>
      <li>But for the cost, I think you&#x27;ll find few things better.</li>
      <li>Most of the scrubbers I&#x27;ve found are too gentle, which is fine if you have delicate skin, but not when you need to scrub down to the bone.</li>
      <li>it is now very much like a piece of rope when  moistened and  is now only moderately effective as it covers far less back</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve Found so far!</li>
      <li>I also rinsed it in VERY hot water before I used it, to get rid of the smell and loose fibers.  </li>
      <li>Even after washing briefly in the sink and a couple of uses in the shower, I still found it very noticeable.</li>
      <li>I like it better than similar more expensive back straps.  </li>
      <li>but I was too busy</li>
      <li>The odor and flakes soon disappear and the back scrubber really does the job.  </li>
      <li>The other posters are correct in that it does have a &#x27;earthy&#x27; odor when first opened (Smells like bailing twine), and it does shed fibers quite a bit.</li>
      <li>I previously used a back brush, but the get moldy rather quick.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a replacement for my old sisal bath back strap that was simply falling apart.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiance and he loves it.  It is just rough enough to slough off the dead skin but not so harsh as to be uncomfortable.  He has very sensitive skin so the fact that he found it not too abrasive is remarkable and I can attest to the fact that his skin feels smoother as a result of his using this regularly. A wonderful product I would happily buy for anyone who wanted something like this for themselves.</li>
    <li> This sisal back strap works much better than the type with a handle.  It is easier to use, and is virtually indestructible.  I use it every time I shower--don&#x27;t feel clean unless I do!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and a synthetic version with two different sides at the same time.  I never use this one anymore, though it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these items, one for personal use and two as gifts. They are as described and work well. However, they all had a strong odor of sisal. Even after washing briefly in the sink and a couple of uses in the shower, I still found it very noticeable. If you plan on using them as gifts in any way, consider first washing them thoroughly. On the plus side, they are great backscratchers!</li>
    <li> Im amaze about the great job this scrubber does...a great shower/bath tool.  I use it in my back and feet bottom....very invigorating.</li>
    <li> I guess that is the smell of sisal.  The fiber itself is great for this kind of thing. I bought two of them.</li>
    <li> This product is great for back-scrubbing.  I like it better than similar more expensive back straps.  In my experience this product has held up well to hard use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased five of these back scrubbers for $20, giving two away as gifts.  As others have stated, there is an initial funky odor to it which I attribute to the material from whence it comes.  Not unlike the loofah sponge, it leaves little flakes in the bath tub.  The odor and flakes soon disappear and the back scrubber really does the job.  Just wet it really good in hot water, rub your soap on it or pour your bath gel on it and voila, you&#x27;re ready. It stretches and no matter your size or girth you can get your back and backside clean.  It feels so good to finally scrub your back and know that it&#x27;s clean!  I love it and have two extras just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-22-12:  I use a dry one each night on my back before retiring.  Wow!  What a great back scratcher!  Don&#x27;t scratch your back in bed or you&#x27;ll wonder where the crumbs came from.</li>
    <li> It is a great product that works well and is economical</li>
    <li> After at least a year now of using it 2x per week, it still hasn&#x27;t ripped. Good scrub surface and easy to rinse clean and hang to dry.</li>

    <li> Initially it was  quite effective and very stimulating. Unfortunately  it immediately stretched to 48&amp;#34; long and narrowed to about 2+&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It it is now very much like a piece of rope when  moistened and  is now only moderately effective as it covers far less back area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it been somewhat wider initially and even shorter, I believe it would be more serviceable long term. The manufacturer showed have allowed for the known stretching characteristics of sisal and compensated with more material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be remaining intact after five uses but I would not recommend it unless the buyer is acceptable to this  transformation.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get something like this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scrub, a massage, and a back-scratch all at once. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and easier to come by than hiring a bath attendant.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This product does the job, but it is very light weight and not made for long use.  One of the handles failed immediately and had to be repaired.  I bought it to replace one I had used for many years that was getting stretched and a bit thin, but it is still superior to this new one.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my old sisal bath back strap that was simply falling apart.

I also rinsed it in VERY hot water before I used it, to get rid of the smell and loose fibers.  It works great, my back has never been cleaner!</li>
    <li> Best Scrubber I&#x27;ve Found so far! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to scrub my back for a long while, and this has been the best answer. Most of the scrubbers I&#x27;ve found are too gentle, which is fine if you have delicate skin, but not when you need to scrub down to the bone. This will do the trick. The other posters are correct in that it does have a &#x27;earthy&#x27; odor when first opened (Smells like bailing twine), and it does shed fibers quite a bit. But for the cost, I think you&#x27;ll find few things better.</li>
    <li> One of the handles broke the first time I held it. I should have sent it back but I was too busy</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 star only because the space between knots are kind of too far and that make it not too much practical. other than that it&#x27;s as the seller described it</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the sisal fibers cling to the skin and help to remove skin cells very efficiently.  I&#x27;ve tried other skin cell removing products but none of them worked as efficiently as sisal fibers.  Now my back is left squeaky clean and looking very healthy.  I truly like this product.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts.  Maybe okay to use on the bottoms of your feet, but to scrub on sensitive parts of your body?? Ow[...]</li>
    <li> Finally - a clean back! This is a wonderful find - it can be used either wet or dry - it is very effective!</li>
    <li> Really good back scrubber...feels good and makes me feel &#x27;cleaner&#x27;.  I like that I can use either side.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I do like this scrubber, but it is really long.  Can see that it might be unwieldly for a petite person. But it works great for football shoulders and long arms. I feel like it does a better job than a loofah.  One other problem - it sheds.  If you don&#x27;t already have a hair trap in your tub/shower, you&#x27;ll need one!</li>
