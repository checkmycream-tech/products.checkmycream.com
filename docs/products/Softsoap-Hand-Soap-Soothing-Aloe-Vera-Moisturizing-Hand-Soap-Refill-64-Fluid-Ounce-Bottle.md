      <li>We have used this brand from Softsoap for many years.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these 2 large bottles of hand soap.  </li>
      <li>True  </li>
      <li>One container came 2/3 full</li>
      <li>This size is good to have on hand for refilling smaller dispensers.  </li>
      <li>We have tried other, cheaper alternatives, but have not been happy.  </li>
      <li>, aloe is super soothing to skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great stuff it is all you need in soap.</li>
    <li> We really like this soap.  It is at a very good price for the amount.</li>
    <li> Reviews are great hope it works. My hands are wSy tooooo dry living on AZ</li>
    <li> This was a rip-off I found out after I bought it.  I found it in a couple of stores a whole lot cheaper.  Will never buy it again, since my husband tells me it is that, that is clogging up the sink I use it in.</li>
    <li> Perfect, inexpensive, does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product because I suffer from Eczema. Hoping that this is a &amp;#34;weaker&amp;#34; hand soap, it dries up the hands rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Best hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  True  This smells good, it feels good and it makes my hands softer and smoother</li>
    <li> It is called ease of operation and convenience. I stock three of these huge long lasting refills and then pour them in as needed into the small dispensers on my sinks all over the house. The soap itself is soothing, non irritating and a pleasure to wash with. I recommend keeping a few refills on hand so you do not run out. A truly high quality product and also effective in removing typical dirt and grime on your hands. Remember that hand washing is a must today when coming in from the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay R Adler</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the soap. It is a great value for the money and is from a brand that I trust. Most importantly, it is easy to get the soap into my dispenser without making a mess. The soap came out easily and didn&#x27;t get everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is our go-to hand soap. Buying at this quantity really gives an excellent value on an excellent product. Sexy Gramma has, of course, found beautiful dispensers that match the bathroom. It keeps my hands and face clean and soft. Most recommended.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as good as if like</li>
    <li> My hands are now clean AND soft.</li>
    <li> Package came with broken product container with product leaved out all over the box.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. It is easy on his hands, especially during the winter, and reasonably priced. If shipping was added on, the price might go up too much.</li>
    <li> Great soap, Great price, great service</li>
    <li> the item arrived as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I would get it again though I will also alternate for variety.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price. Wish the Aloe Vera scent was stronger.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Regular Softsoap was too thick for my dispensers so I was hoping this would be not as thick. It work&#x27;s great in my dispensers and I love the Aloe Vera.</li>
    <li> Softsoap is an excellent produce. It arrived with one bottle mashed or compresses and leaking. However after a quick bath in the sink to rid the outside of soap, it is fine.</li>
    <li> This soap smells incredible but unfortunately one of the bottles seems to have exploded in shipping! It looks like the cap either came off in shipping or was never properly attached. I have re-ordered since this is such a great deal so fingers crossed that it comes without damage.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this hand soap and it cleans well. I use it to refill my Lysol No-Touch hand soap containers. My only problem with this soap is that it&#x27;s runny, not as thick as what comes in the original containers. I really wish Lysol would sell their original soap in gallon containers, but I guess they want you to buy their brand and not another.</li>
    <li> I  will always  order this soap.</li>
    <li> Keeps hands soft even during dry winters.</li>
    <li> I  use this product to refill my bathroom soap dispensers, i.e. I use it for its intended purpose. One day, however, I ran out of shampoo and tried this stuff on my hair. It cleaned well ( there was no gummy feeling ) and it is  economical, to boot.  Now I use it as my sole shamoo.</li>
    <li> We have used this brand from Softsoap for many years.  We have tried other, cheaper alternatives, but have not been happy.  This particular brand from this manufacturer does not cause redness and irritation, like some of the other scents. We wash our hands a lot, because we have a lot of pets, so we need something that is mild and hopefully has a nice scent.  This brand and this scent fits the bill just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can likely get a better deal by shopping around. A recent price for a Softsoap refill at Target (on sale) is $4.15 for 56 oz. If you use your Target Redcard that is another 5% off, or $3.94.  Comparing the storebrand at Walmart, I found that it was not any cheaper--$3.97 for 56 oz.  So, waiting for the product on sale at Target, for example, seems to be a good strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an interesting tidbit about Aloe Vera:  Thousands of years ago, the ancient Egyptians called Aloe Vera the \\&quot;plant of immortality\\&quot;. They held the plant in such high regard, that they honored their deceased pharaohs with a burial gift of this!  (Aloe vera, I mean, not Softsoap!)  Well, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really the \\&quot;plant of immortality,\\&quot; but we like it for our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, the manufacturer lists these ingredients. Probably not actually much aloe vera, since it&#x27;s way down the list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Water&lt;br /&gt;* Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate&lt;br /&gt;* Laureth-3&lt;br /&gt;* Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;* Glycol Stearate&lt;br /&gt;* Sodium Chloride&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* Polyquaternium-7&lt;br /&gt;* DMDM Hydantoin&lt;br /&gt;* Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice&lt;br /&gt;* Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;* Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;* Poloxamer 124&lt;br /&gt;* Hydrolyzed Silk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in other liquid soap products with Aloe Vera, you might try these, but some are much more expensive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002AMUI8A Nature&#x27;s Gate Aloe Vera Velvet Moisture Liquid Soap, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005302X Dial  Liquid Hand Soap With Moisturizer, Aloe, 7.5-Oz.

Plus, our hands like it.  We will continue to buy, but I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be burying any of it with anyone soon.</li>
    <li> We have a hand soap dispenser on the kitchen sink. This is a great product to fill it with. Cleans well, easy on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit a year later:: I&#x27;ve purchased this product again. When I ran out of the first order of this SoftSoap, I tried another soap. I did not like it. So I purchased this product again and I&#x27;m glad to have it back.</li>
    <li> Some refills seem like they are barely bigger than the actual dispenser, but these are the big size that I am used to.  I also like the soap itself.  I wash my hands a lot and I feel like this soap keeps them from being as dry as they are with other soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s soft and it has nice smell</li>
    <li> Great product.  No problems with delivery.</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hands 20-30 times a day at work and every other soap leaves me too dry. The antibacterial soaps lead to bacterial resistance. This is just the best hand soap there is.</li>
    <li> leaves hand soft and healthy feeling</li>
    <li> Great soap we go through a lot of it, aloe is super soothing to skin so it helps with dry skin. It also doesn&#x27;t have triclosan in it so its healthier soap. It smells good too. I have it at all my sinks and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great scene and gentle with your skin</li>
    <li> Great item, price and quality.</li>
    <li> Effective and helps reduce skin drying, particularly in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried lots of different hand soaps to find one that is both effective at cleaning while not drying the skin. This soap is the best combination of performance and price we&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s now in all the hand soaps dispensers in the house and the effect on our hands is noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for hand lotion, especially in winter when the house humidity tends to be very low, but it is extremely gentle while still being fully effective in cleaning (even car engine dirt and oil).</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to put in your hand dispenser.  It is gentle to the hands and easy to refill dispensers.</li>
    <li> Cheap good soap, bought it for work, shipped quick.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this soft-soap. The aloe vera variety is a bit thicker than softsoap&#x27;s other types of liquid soap. I I think thats great, it cleans my hands, leaves them smelling nice (and the smell is very light, not overpowering like other brands) Additionally it works great in my electronic soap dispensers, which is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Could find my regular Softsoap refill so I purchased this stuff.  Didn&#x27;t work in my bottles.  I&#x27;ve used Softsoap refills for years but this stuff is too thick and will not dilute down with water so that it foams better.  Add water and it will separate in less than a day.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price</li>
    <li> Soap was spilled all over in the package</li>
    <li> Much too expensive and not a good value.  Your local super store has this for half price and probably sold as singles instead of a double.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Easier to have it delivered than to have to hand-schlep it. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> product works great but was shipped with tops that don&#x27;t have an internal seal.  So it leaked a little bit.</li>
    <li> Hands don&#x27;t get all dried out like with other soaps.</li>
    <li> One container came 2/3 full</li>
    <li> What a surprise!  A great value!!</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged and leaking.</li>
    <li> This product was a great choice for my office.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  VERY CONVENIENT TO BUY IN BULK.  IT IS GENTLE FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. YEP!</li>
    <li> This item is reasonably priced, arrived when promised, and was well packaged. It has a pleasant aroma, and gets your hands clean.</li>
    <li> I will be buying more...They are just what a large family needs. This was indeed a deal of great quality and value.</li>
    <li> Gentle and kind to the hands. My young grandkids seem to get irritated skin and rashes in the winter with regular soap and this is much more gentle, eliminating the problem.</li>
    <li> Great product at an excellent price.  I have filled up my empty dispensers at least 5 times (I have 2) and I still have a lot left in the big dispensers.  When my supply needs more soap, I will be looking on Amazon for another deal like I got on this one. It beats having to run to the dollar store for more hand soap refills so often.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of soft soap, which is perfect for refilling the soap dispensers at our synagogue.  This soap has a nice smell and a good feel when you are using it. It&#x27;s not antibacterial, but I like the smell of this soap much better. My only complaint is that even though you get two large bottles, the price is still a bit high for what you receive.</li>
    <li> I love this soap as it isn&#x27;t harsh on your hands - aloe thank you! I have used this soap for years and usually buy it at the store but I broke my hip and couldn&#x27;t get out - AMAZON to the rescue</li>
    <li> Love this to refill my bathroom containers, keeps hands soft.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of it sooner. Great price, great product, fast delivery. Saved myself a trip and the hassle of dealing with my local big-box store during the holidays.</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  This size is good to have on hand for refilling smaller dispensers.  I didn&#x27;t want anti-bacterial hand soap, so this product appealed to me.  It cleans well.</li>
    <li> There is no seal on the bottle. One of the screw got loose and leaked some in the package. The soap appears thinner than the brand I get from BJ&#x27;s. I hope they do not refill these bottle. The bubbles inside the bottles and the thinness make me wonder if this is mixed with water.</li>
    <li> Prior to ordering this from Amazon, I was already using this brand at home. It was just that the refills in the store were smaller and didn&#x27;t last as long. You get plenty with these refill bottles. Colgate Palmolive makes high quality product and this is an excellent brand. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great soap!! It smells so good. I find myself smelling my hands after using it to get a whiff of it LOL. I felt it was a good buy and great quality soap on top of it. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> We use this and soap because it is moisturizing and is not perfuming (even men don&#x27;t mind using it!)  I have beautiful soap dispensers so getting in bulk is convenient to just refill the dispensers and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Horrible soap all over box poorly shipped</li>
    <li> Bought this for my coffee shop. Seems great to me!</li>
    <li> descent price.. rather buy from amazon then dragging a bunch of these thru costco</li>
    <li> Worth the money to refill liquid soap dispensers you have in your home. Value price and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> honest and clean with a mild fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these 2 large bottles of hand soap.  They pour easily into my decorative dispensers in the kitchen and bathroom, and I always have a handy supply when refills are needed.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, for a very good price.</li>
