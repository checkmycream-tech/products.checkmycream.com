      <li>For now, this is my top choice.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve tried many toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>then most toothpaste..</li>
      <li>Came packaged well and will continue to buy :)</li>
      <li>Price listed was excellent and cheaper than our local stores.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brand and product line for years and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the size and price of this Toothpast.</li>
      <li>What more could a person ask?</li>
      <li>This tooth paste is very strong but it does not burn your mouth just has a strong smell.</li>
      <li>It was a pretty good value, too.</li>
      <li>I think this product is great, the mint is a nice flavour, it really freshens the breath and helps keep my teeth white.</li>
      <li>Our favorite toothpaste and delivered right to our door.</li>
      <li>Not that I have halitosis or anything, but sometimes, especially in the morning :) my breath can be kickin!!  </li>
      <li>It is very minty and very strong cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>I have used this toothpaste for a long time and am so happy that I can order it through subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>and she said she likes the total whitening kind better so</li>
      <li>What more can I really ask for?</li>
      <li>It definitely cleans and freshens my breath really good.</li>
      <li>My whole family fell in love with the fresh taste, and</li>
      <li>Keeps your teeth fresh and clean and will leave your mouth with that minty fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>got this colgate max fresh toothpaste for a friend</li>
      <li>Tastes better then most other toothpaste out there</li>
      <li>small tube for the price but great tooth paste</li>
      <li>Love the fresh minty smell n keeps my mouth clean longer than any other tooth paste</li>
      <li>Colgate Total contained Triclosan (which is included as an anti-gingivitis agent), a substance most toothpastes have dropped and</li>
      <li>My teeth certainly did not get any &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; after 3 months of use.</li>
      <li>Really convenient since we always forget to pick it up until we run out.</li>
      <li>( incl my old faveCrest with scope) tends to be mint-less right after brushing.  </li>
      <li>A good regular toothpaste (non-premium, conventional).</li>
      <li>We recently started checking price for everyday use products on amazon and this was one of the products where we found amazon is offering a good price.</li>
      <li>But on the bright side, I guess this tube&#x27;s cap uses less plastic and it will be easier to squeeze out every last bit of toothpaste out of it than with my old stand-up tube.</li>
      <li>Well no they are not all the same this tooth paste leaves your mouth feeling minty fresh.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was looking for a new toothpaste, after learning my old standby</li>
      <li>This stuff clearly lasts with you,  </li>
      <li>Back then, you didn&#x27;t really notice it.  </li>
      <li>I use a sensitive toothpaste for myself, but the rest of my family loves this.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully this will help maintain my natural teeth.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, this toothpaste has a mint flavor which results in a fresh breath feeling.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have Triclosan (only \\&quot;Total\\&quot; does), and had a better combination of price and EWG \\&quot;skindeep\\&quot; human toxicity rating than other mainstream</li>
      <li>&quot; is the new standard toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I feeling fresh every times, it little bit stronger with peppermint for some people that not use too.</li>
      <li>The larger flip-type cap on the end of my old tube</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve walked down the oral hygiene aisle in the store lately, you&#x27;ve probably noticed that there&#x27;s pretty much no such thing as a standard tube of toothpaste any more.  </li>
      <li>The little strips dissolve while brushing and has a long lasting fresh minty taste that&#x27;s stronger</li>

<li> If makes me want to say ahhh every second and drink cold water and take a breath of cool air.</li>
<li> toothpaste is blue, tastes minty, and has little square \\&quot;mini breath strips\\&quot; init.  </li>
<li> The cap on the tube is one of those little flip-type caps which can also screw on and off.  </li>
<li> Now I am using natural since I am very afraid.</li>
<li> Combined with daily toothpick/flossing, and mouthwash twice a day, this stuff will help fight those bad breath demons we sometimes all get.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste like those toothpaste that contains baking soda.  </li>
<li> My mouth was peeling and I started to get weird soars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent seller...All very good!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but can irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> I had that just brushed feeling for hours and hours after I brush my teeth. If makes me want to say ahhh every second and drink cold water and take a breath of cool air. Nothing beats that feeling</li>
    <li> small tube for the price but great tooth paste</li>
    <li> My mouth was peeling and I started to get weird soars. This is not normal. Read OK there reviews, they are correct about the topicality of the toothpaste. Now I am using natural since I am very afraid.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for a long time and am so happy that I can order it through subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I just love the flavor of this paste, and the refreashing way it makes my mouth feel.  The price is right, and the convienence of having it delivered is priceless</li>
    <li> I know what your thinking how can anyone rate tooth paste, they are all the same. Well no they are not all the same this tooth paste leaves your mouth feeling minty fresh. It does not  leave that gritty feeling on your teeth and mouth. This tooth paste is very strong but it does not burn your mouth just has a strong smell. Makes you feel like your getting the job done.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve walked down the oral hygiene aisle in the store lately, you&#x27;ve probably noticed that there&#x27;s pretty much no such thing as a standard tube of toothpaste any more.  \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; is the new standard toothpaste.  All you have to do to see why is to watch an 80&#x27;s or earlier movie and pay attention to everyone&#x27;s \\&quot;realistically yellow\\&quot; teeth.  Back then, you didn&#x27;t really notice it.  But now...yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is blue, tastes minty, and has little square \\&quot;mini breath strips\\&quot; init.  The cap on the tube is one of those little flip-type caps which can also screw on and off.  Every time I have a tube with that style cap, the cap breaks at the joint.  The larger flip-type cap on the end of my old tube let me stand the toothpaste tube up on its end.  But on the bright side, I guess this tube&#x27;s cap uses less plastic and it will be easier to squeeze out every last bit of toothpaste out of it than with my old stand-up tube.</li>
    <li> It is what it&#x27;s supposed to be, came when it was supposed to, and the price was good. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Same product I have to drive 32 miles to get delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> got this colgate max fresh toothpaste for a friend and she said she likes the total whitening kind better so</li>
    <li> Same rating and review.  The toothpaste creates a gel foam which enhances its usage.  Hopefully this will help maintain my natural teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth certainly did not get any &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; after 3 months of use. However, it did get more sensitvie. Avoid whitening toothpaste at all cost!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is awesome!! Have never seen in stores here and thought I&#x27;d try.. Best toothpaste!! And I&#x27;ve bought several now.. The little strips dissolve while brushing and has a long lasting fresh minty taste that&#x27;s stronger then most toothpaste.. Came packaged well and will continue to buy :)</li>
    <li> Not that I have halitosis or anything, but sometimes, especially in the morning :) my breath can be kickin!!  This stuff is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried where I can actually still taste the minty-ness long after I&#x27;m finished brushing.  Everything else ( incl my old faveCrest with scope) tends to be mint-less right after brushing.  This stuff clearly lasts with you,  My dad is a dentist and i&#x27;ve tried many toothpastes.  For now, this is my top choice.  Combined with daily toothpick/flossing, and mouthwash twice a day, this stuff will help fight those bad breath demons we sometimes all get.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I found out this toothpaste with subscribe and save program. My whole family fell in love with the fresh taste, and \\&quot;after taste\\&quot; of this blue gel style toothpaste!. Definitely will order it again.  Btw, yes, it is very blue! As some other reviewers mentioned, I am just wondering if it will make my teeth blue? lol</li>
    <li> Love the size and price of this Toothpast. Will order again soon. Once I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh minty smell n keeps my mouth clean longer than any other tooth paste</li>
    <li> Very good and easy on my teeth. Will buy more when it is needed. Tastes better then most other toothpaste out there</li>
    <li> The size is good but the price is the best. And if you order in the auto ship you get an even better price. What more could a person ask? Well good (non-expired product) and you get that. Along with free-shipping and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I use a sensitive toothpaste for myself, but the rest of my family loves this.  They all think it tastes great.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It definitely cleans and freshens my breath really good. I like the mini breath strips it has.</li>
    <li> We recently started checking price for everyday use products on amazon and this was one of the products where we found amazon is offering a good price. Toothpaste it self is very good and I have been using it for as long as I can remember.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great, the mint is a nice flavour, it really freshens the breath and helps keep my teeth white.</li>
    <li> A good regular toothpaste (non-premium, conventional). It works well on my OralB electric toothbrushes (spinning head) and foams up traditionally. Non-foaming toothpastes like Toms of Maine feel strange on an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new toothpaste, after learning my old standby Colgate Total contained Triclosan (which is included as an anti-gingivitis agent), a substance most toothpastes have dropped and the EU is moving to ban in human cosmetic products. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have Triclosan (only \\&quot;Total\\&quot; does), and had a better combination of price and EWG \\&quot;skindeep\\&quot; human toxicity rating than other mainstream brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the surprisingly low price here, especially with Subscribe&amp;Save, recommended.</li>
    <li> I like that it is minty and has cooling effect during teeth brushing time. It is very minty and very strong cooling sensation. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste like those toothpaste that contains baking soda.  I have used this brand and product line for years and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy a few tubes since the price was a bit cheaper than we normally get at Target or other stores. Our favorite toothpaste and delivered right to our door. Really convenient since we always forget to pick it up until we run out.</li>
    <li> It cleans my teeth and tastes great. What more can I really ask for? It was a pretty good value, too.</li>
    <li> After brush my tooth I feeling fresh every times, it little bit stronger with peppermint for some people that not use too.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Keeps your teeth fresh and clean and will leave your mouth with that minty fresh feeling.  Price listed was excellent and cheaper than our local stores.  Cavity free because of it!!</li>
    <li> I love the strips, flavor is great.  Made in Mexico, so 4 stars instead of 5 stars for this product.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, this toothpaste has a mint flavor which results in a fresh breath feeling. The cap does get a bit clogged at times, but so what.</li>
