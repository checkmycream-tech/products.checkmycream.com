    <li> For the past year I have been trying to locate \\&quot;Camphor Spirits\\&quot; to no avail.  Every pharmacy I contacted told me that it was no longer available.  A friend suggested that I try Amazon (since I had purchased items previously from Amazon) and the item came up on the first try. Mr. Medical sent my order out immediately.  It arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!  Thank you, Mr. Medical!  Anything I need in the future, I will check with you first!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  I have used it for years-since the 50&#x27;s some products have declined in the production&lt;br /&gt;of their formula or ingredients but this is high grade camphor.  It is good to know some products are still great!</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product but one of the bottles completely leaked and the bad was filled with the product....other 2 bottles were fine.</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find in the stores. My mother has used this for years. The pharmacies no longer carry it.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to find camphor spirit well here it is and its not as easy to find as it use to be.. Worked for what I wanted it for..</li>
    <li> saler sand me only one battle</li>
    <li> Bought this for my self and others and we like it for our cold sores</li>
    <li> good delivery time exactly what I ordered and wanted. will buy again</li>
    <li> Great price great protuct</li>
    <li> Camphor spirit or spirit of camphor the best for anything you need sore muscles aches . Thanks amazon and yes marble medical the best as always . 😊</li>
    <li> It was what I ordered and what I needed. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Camphor spirit really is the only thing that dries up my cold sores and prevents them from getting huge. However, this product is labled as TOXIC and if ingested, poison.  It took the finish off a wood table in my house.  I put it on my lip. It gets into my mouth via the side corners of my lips.   Could that possibly be SAFE??</li>
    <li> Camphor spirits are impossible to find at drug or health stores.  I use camphor spirits to shrink moles and other skin tags/non-bleeding sores.  The spirits dry up the skin problems in about a week or two.  Also, camphor spirits are good when used for headaches.  My grandmother used camphor sticks for headaches, and swore by them.  She tried the camphor spirits and liked them even better.  Low price for such a versatile product. UPDATE:  I just purchased camphor spirits again for headaches and muscle aches. I rub it across my forehead and temples, and sometimes my neck.  Headache is GONE in minutes.  This also works on restless leg syndrome.  Apply on legs, and in minutes that horrible feeling of restless leg syndrome vanishes.  I will never be without camphor spirits. This is a high quality product that was delivered quickly.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for healing fever blisters.  There is an error in this advertisement though.  The purchase was for 1 bottle, not 3.  Vendor promptly responded to my inquiry, stated the error, and offered me a refund.  I appreciated the offer, but didn&#x27;t accept.  I felt the price was fair for 1 bottle.  3 bottles for that price seemed incredible to me at the get go.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the time it took to get the product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent treatment to dry up cold sores and you can&#x27;t purchase this product at any local drug store.</li>
    <li> Awesome for cold sores/fever blisters.  Apply with a q-tip and don&#x27;t make your bottle &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; by applying and then dipping it in again.  It will dry the sore out so that it does not spread. I find the salves/creams/ointments sold create the ideal moist environment for the sore to grow in.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 bottles, one had a loose cap and leaked much of the contents. They replaced it right away with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Looked for it everywhere found it here, Good!!</li>
    <li> Okay price, Very Quick delivery</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Can not find in local stores.  Thanks for having it 😀</li>
    <li> I am not able to purchase here so was very glad to see this.  I use this for cold sores and other things.  It arrived in excellent condition and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> So hard to find this in the pharmacy anymore. My dad loves this for cold sores. He&#x27;s very happy I found it for him.</li>
    <li> Love it. Make my own topical with 3 parts olive oil to 1 part camphor, at a &amp;#34;fraction&amp;#34; of the price. :)</li>
