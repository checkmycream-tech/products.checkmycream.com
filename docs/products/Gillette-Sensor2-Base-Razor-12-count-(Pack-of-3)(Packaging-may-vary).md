      <li>Their liberal and free return policy is 100% flawless.  </li>
      <li>I refused to spend a lot of money on razors when these perfectly good dual-blade, disposable razors do the job just as well.</li>
      <li>but nothing else works as good for me.</li>
      <li>It works well, is a good value for the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m set and good to go for the rest of the year now.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as razor I used to get at Costco.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all you need for a good shave.</li>
      <li>the Good News Razor is, is a Gillette Trac II in a plastic throw away version.</li>
      <li>I have always loved Good News and these were no exception.</li>
      <li>Good disposable razor for a good price.</li>
      <li>So, I think that is a good value.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best and economical painless result!</li>
      <li>I was glad to see Amazon now sells them at a great price.</li>
      <li>Love these razors!  </li>
      <li>Have used this product for years that is why I continue to use it, just glad for the availability via internet!</li>
      <li>We love Amazon!</li>
      <li>(two more words!)</li>
      <li>As prices continue to climb Good News represnts a consistent price for a very good razor.</li>
      <li>Just search at popular US stores.</li>
      <li>The 2-blade was ok (not as good as the 4-blade) but</li>
      <li>iam very happy with this seller.came packed very well unopened.other brands without the soap bar cut</li>
      <li>So I understand why Gillette is good, since I nicked my legs using Bic many years ago.</li>
      <li>I like to use my own soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and they probably have hazardous chemicals too.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased to find these at a good price.</li>
      <li>This a great razor, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>after the recession was considered over all that ended but the Good News stayed with strong sales.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>The best option is to buy DSC blades directly from their supplier (Dorco) in bulk.  </li>
      <li>Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade</li>
      <li>They are a good price and work well, giving a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>, I used this one my wedding day and got razor burn on my cheek which showed up in all the picturs of course, thanks alot Good News!</li>
      <li>I just need a good clean razor without all the bells and whistles designed by the marketing department.  </li>
      <li>I have used the good news razors for years, as clean up after using an electric razor, to get the spots it wouldn&#x27;t get.  </li>
      <li>It is a close and very comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>These are very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>has a good price with quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Razor manufacturers pump out the next greatest razor ever made about every six to twelve months.  </li>
      <li>These are great razors at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>That may happen if they increase the prices too:-)  </li>
      <li>I shave with each razor twice and then throw it out, although I could probably get more use if I wanted</li>
      <li>These razor brands keep inventing more razors, who needs them?</li>
      <li>These do not nick or cut and provide a great close shave at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more of these, you can&#x27;t find them in stores any more.</li>
      <li>use them to shave my legs and find they are much better for the job than any ladies razors.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;they do the job, and I get many uses out of each razor.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
      <li>Now that he is on auto ship, I am pleased with the price</li>
      <li>Your face will let you know:).</li>
      <li>I have used these razors for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aesthetics: 3 stars.</li>
      <li>I have used these razors for many years.  </li>
      <li>A razor simple and elegant in that it does perfectly what it is designed to do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to go to electric razors from Braun and Norelco, using both foils, and circle blades, but I like these Gillette disposables better.  </li>
      <li>The price was excellent but the payoff comes in saving many hours of futile searching through personal care sections of grocery stores over a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>mostly use an electric, but as with most guys that doesn&#x27;t catch everything everywhere.  </li>
      <li>many years.  </li>
      <li>I will be looking for more bargains online, along these types of products ...</li>
      <li>My favorite for many years .</li>
      <li>I love the way his face looks and feels when he shaves.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Durability: 3 stars.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love these razors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are very cheaply made. Be sure to look at the blades for imperfections prior to shaving with them. I will not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Everything that I purchase from Amazon is the best. Their liberal and free return policy is 100% flawless.  Amazon is win-win !!!</li>
    <li> Completely eliminated my chin&lt;br /&gt;whiskers</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at Wal-mart, but they replaced it with the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; version which has the lubrication strip.  I hate those gluey strips and they probably have hazardous chemicals too.  I&#x27;m happy I can get these plain razors on Amazon.  I had no trouble with the order.  They are a good price and work well, giving a smooth shave.  I use each razor for about 8 shaves.  I&#x27;ve tried to go to electric razors from Braun and Norelco, using both foils, and circle blades, but I like these Gillette disposables better.  They give me a closer, simpler, faster shave with less irritation.</li>
    <li> Razor manufacturers pump out the next greatest razor ever made about every six to twelve months.  The shelves are full of razors that rotate, vibrate, lubricate, illuminate, wiggle, jiggle, wobble, play MP3&#x27;s, text your girlfriend, trim your nose hairs, record voice memo&#x27;s, and open your mail.  How many blades are the new guys up to now? Six or seven?  Ridiculous. Good News razors set the standard that others try to imitate, but have yet to surpass, despite the bells and whistles and baubles and bangles that they dangle from their new fangled shaving implements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want a twin blade razor that gives a smooth shave without leaving garden slug slime on my face.  These razors have been getting the job done for me for over twenty years.  You may try the next greatest razor, but you&#x27;ll always come back to the original Good News razor.  No pivot, no slime, and skin as smooth as a bowling ball.</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor. Simple.  No lube strip.  Close shave.  I store it in a cup of rubbing alcohol; the razor stays sharp for weeks on end.</li>
    <li> These are my husbands favorite razors and hard to find locally.  Now that he is on auto ship, I am pleased with the price and he is happy to have them onhand.</li>
    <li> love these razors but have to order online as they are next to impossible to find in any store around!</li>
    <li> What a predicament Gillette must feel with their razors.  Every good marketer knows that new product introduction is the lifeblood of a category.  So Gillette continues to introduce razors with seven blades, swivel handles, a new formulation of \\&quot;slime\\&quot; or skin irritant (that they call lubricant)on the head, and other useless and unwanted features to keep a fresh product in the market.  All the while, they have this tried and true, absolutely tested and proven product that they have never been able to improve in the last (30+?) many years.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this great product available to someone who thinks that European stubble is in poor taste and who still shaves everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor for everyday use, but it has no advantages over its twin blade knock-off imitators. You can get exactly the same shave out of any disposable twin blade. One note of disatisfaction with this razor, I used this one my wedding day and got razor burn on my cheek which showed up in all the picturs of course, thanks alot Good News!</li>
    <li> Received the pacages of 13 razors in less than one week. Each package also features one Mach 3 disposable as well as 12 Good News razors. As prices continue to climb Good News represnts a consistent price for a very good razor.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor.  Two blades, no pivot, no slimy yuck strip.  5 stars, with no hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, more blades than 2 are unnecessary to get a good shave, pivots reduce the control I have over angle, and slime strips don&#x27;t help anything and require me to spend more time washing slimy goo off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I had a hard time finding this exact model in my usual stores, so I ordered a bunch on Amazon and keep a supply in the hall closet.  I was glad to see that our local supermarket is carrying them again, too.</li>
    <li> These were not the razors that I use or were previously purchased. I had to use two daily to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> best I&#x27;ve used in years for a sharp clean trim with a full beard/stash. get&#x27;em while you can! (two more words!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 50-year-old guy with a lot of experience shaving both my entire face and trimming around a beard. I&#x27;ve used just about every method there is and nothing beats these blades for my face and facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About half the year I go clean-shaven and use an electric razor for my entire face, using a blade razor just for the back of my neck. The other half of the year I grow out and maintain a full beard and I use a blade razor to shave my cheeks and neck. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and blade types but I always come back to the plain Gillette Good News. I don&#x27;t want a lube strip, a swiveling head, vibrating blades, three blades (or more, or only one), or any of the other modern bells and whistles. I want a simple double-blade razor that goes where I want it (without swiveling or vibrating) and which I can get a decent number of shaves from before throwing it away for a fresh, sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment with others but be sure to at least try these before settling for some expensive toy.</li>
    <li> I hate razors with slime strips.  This product is impossible for me to find in stores locally.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried compares to the simplicity and ease of use.  These are the best.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered three packs of these babies. Not good. Then I got the real thing: Schick Xtreme 3 Disposable Razors. I cheerfully junked the Gillettes.</li>
    <li> Great basic razor.  I really like them.</li>
    <li> excellent blade for price  my son loves them due to the fact there is no pivot and  because it takes him a while to shave his face, like most men.  as for us females with our legs, arms and parts.. this delivers a   very nice close shave with some caution..just keep it at a slower pace  girls and find your correct angle with some pressure applied.</li>
    <li> Love them and they are available for $8.00. Just search at popular US stores.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal on razor&#x27;s that I can hardly find in store&#x27;s anymore..  I&#x27;m set and good to go for the rest of the year now.  Thank you Amazon !!</li>
    <li> Very happy great price I use to buy from walmart but now I get them in my subcribe and save order.</li>
    <li> These are basically the disposable version of the Gillette Sensor Excel razors but with duller blades. Each razor has two blades and a pivoting head.    I&#x27;ve gone through about six of the razors so far and they are noticeably duller than the original \\&quot;replacement head-only\\&quot; Sensor Excel. I seem to cut myself with these disposable ones every other time and I wish I didn&#x27;t buy them. I dont like the new 3/4/5 blade razors either.    I will stick with the original Sensor Excel (2 bladed) razors. They have  higher quality and shaper blades.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.  I don&#x27;t understand why the rest of the retail world insists on carry every variety under the sun except for a simple razor without the lube strip.  I have used this razor for years and there&#x27;s no comparison to the closeness of shave.  I recently had to buy the one&#x27;s with the lube strip and they&#x27;re damned near useless.  By 5 pm, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved in the morning.  I&#x27;m going to buy like 100 of these, just in case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not into the whole fancy shavers thing. I just want a simple razor that gives me a comfortable shave at a reasonable price. For the money, these double blades are very good. They last me 3-4 shaves each. I wind up getting a year&#x27;s worth of shaves for about $20. I used to buy the Good News blades, but actually didn&#x27;t like the gel strip. My skin is fairly sensitive, and these blades are just fine.</li>
    <li> I hope I can get the same deal in the future. Do you have other deals with the same great discounts?</li>
    <li> These razor brands keep inventing more razors, who needs them? These worked great for years for me, now they took them off the market, I guess to charge more for something new.  I&#x27;ll buy more of these, you can&#x27;t find them in stores any more.</li>
    <li> These razors are great, they are the only brand that we use.</li>
    <li> No moisturizing strip :(.  Finding it next to impossible to find a 2 razor disposable blade that has the strips.</li>
    <li> shipped quick- 4 people here use this razor- no one at our home likes the lube strip- causes skin reactions when we do use the razor with the strip.</li>
    <li> I have been looking or these for quite sometime, I was happy to run across them here, Since I am allergic to the strips that they put on them now, You can not find them anywhere in the stores with out one.</li>
    <li> May they never stop selling these.  Old stand-by and works as great as ever.</li>
    <li> I rarely use disposable razors. Why? They just feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;. When I&#x27;m at home, I like to shave with something that feels like it&#x27;s built to last. After all, you don&#x27;t drive a Power Wheels toy to work. HOWEVER, sometimes the need arises for a disposable razor...and when that time comes, consider reaching for a Gillette Good News razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 3 stars. There certainly isn&#x27;t anything to look at on this razor. Lately, many of the big names (Fusion, Quattro) have been marketed in special colors and designs. This is plain razor with a plastic blue handle. The end. Yet, in its understated styling, it still has good features for a cheap disposable: pivoting head (non-pivot style available), lubrastrip, good blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 4 stars. Yep, this thing ranks right up there with the big boys. It is a close and very comfortable shave. If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin (like me), the Good News performs quite nicely. It&#x27;s a close shave without ripping a layer of skin off. Cuts are highly unlikely (unless the blade is dull, of course). The lubrastrip provides a small level of glide, but a good shaving cream/gel is recommended with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 3 stars. I&#x27;ve had disposables that lasted just one shave, others that last a week or more. This one is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack with regard to durability. I typically get three shaves out of a Good News razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Good shave, ideal for people with sensitive skin. They don&#x27;t last long, but the upside is that they are among the lowest-priced disposables on the market. Recommended.</li>
    <li> If they ever get here. These are the only razors that my husband will use and they are hard to find.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best razors I have used.  It is difficult to find razors that lack the lube strip.  These do not nick or cut and provide a great close shave at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Ruminator said it best: \\&quot;These razors have been getting the job done for me for over twenty years. You may try the next greatest razor, but you&#x27;ll always come back to the original Good News razor. No pivot, no slime, and skin as smooth as a bowling ball.\\&quot;  (And without the knicks &amp; cuts that the old original single-blade re-useables give me.)</li>
    <li> I have used these razors for 15 years or more. I have been unable to find these without the lubricating strips. I was glad to see Amazon now sells them at a great price. Amazon delivered quickly as they always do.</li>
    <li> I bought three packs of these razors because they are reliable. This should last me the rest of this year and then some</li>
    <li> Great... Do not like that stupid strip... blades last longer with out strips...&lt;br /&gt;Old Good News is the Best</li>
    <li> Consistently sharp and snag free blades, and no slimy lubricating strip makes this disposable razor my go to for easy and trouble free shaving.  It doesn&#x27;t get the same results as a double edge safety razor, but no disposable could compare.  The price on Amazon is fantastic so I buy these in bulk.</li>
    <li> The picture show the razors are 3 blade and they sent the cheaper 2 blade razors.  The picture also shows 13 razors per pack, they sent 12.</li>
    <li> A razor simple and elegant in that it does perfectly what it is designed to do.  After trying other razors, these prove to be the best of any.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love these razors. I can only find them at the grocery store and they are too expensive there. This is the best way to get them. We love Amazon!</li>
    <li> The Good News first came out in 1976 at the peak of the then Recession of the 70&#x27;s (or what we called the Rich Man&#x27;s Recession, the Poor Man&#x27;s Depression...much like now:) and was considered \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; for us working class guys and others strapped for cash and needed personal grooming items that we could afford.  Remember that back then the minimum wage was between $2.55 - $3.25 and hour and gas was going for over $4.00 a gallon and the cost of milk tripled, as did everything else...anything made affordable was &#x27;good news&#x27; to us back then and the market was there for it: double digit unemployment like now.  It also created a lot of consumer loyalty that has lasted for years. It continued with other products until the economy improved like shampoo and conditioner, shaving cream (a cheaper version of Foamy)but after the recession was considered over all that ended but the Good News stayed with strong sales.&lt;br /&gt;What the Good News Razor is, is a Gillette Trac II in a plastic throw away version. Gillette invented this kind of marketing and it is pure genius: Sell the razor handle and blades for about 3 - 7 years, make a new razor and replace the old one.  Now, make one, turn it into a disposable and make a new more expensive one. I was shocked when I went to my local CVS and saw every Gillette made in a disposable version!  EVEN THE FUSION PROGLIDE IS A DISPOSABLE RAZOR NOW!!! WTF??? They come in a pack of two and cost about $3.25 each which is too expensive for a disposable to me but they are there! I think they are hoping for the Mach3 to be their main disposable but for that to happen they need to bring the price way, way down to compete with the excellent Schick Extreme 3 disposables that are the only disposable razor I know of that is as good as the original and priced competitively for the disposable market. It is the only competition the Good News has in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;In short; the Good News has a very interesting history that is directly tied to American economic history as a proactive response to a consumer need well met and has had very little quality competition over the years including now. The variations of it with the Custom Plus, Pivot, ect reflect the other changes made to cartridge razors by the company over the years so you can pick the variations you like the best.&lt;br /&gt;My bet is once the infatuation with 3,4,5,6,7 blade,and on to further lunacy in razors is over the Good News and other twin blade disposables will still be standing strong in the consumer market and if I owned Schick I&#x27;d bring back the Schick Super Two and start marketing the Schick Slim Twin Disposable more aggressively...but alas the company has decided to stop making the Slim Twin disposable as of last year. Buy that excellent twin blade disposable alternative to the Good News while you can. The only real competition the Good News had in the twin blade market as the Atra Cartridge blades got to big to shave under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Good News Razor is the same great shaving, inexpensive little razor today that it was 36 years ago. The only ones that might be better are the Schick Slim Twin disposable or the Schick Extreme 3 disposable or one of the Good News variants (Gillette pivot, custom). Your face will let you know:).onomic history as a proactive response to a consumer need well met and has had very little quality competition over the years including now.

    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the gel strips on razors; even the hypoallergenic ones make me itch.  These aren&#x27;t available locally any more, and they are the only gel-free double-bladed razors I can find. I like them a lot.  They are lightweight for travel, and they last a long time for me (though I&#x27;m not a guy and don&#x27;t have to deal with a heavy beard.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of Razors for a number of years,&lt;br /&gt;they do the job, and I get many uses out of each razor. No&lt;br /&gt;reason to change when something works very well.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re expensive in stores, and not exactly cheap on here, but definitely worth it.  I have never liked electric shavers and always have preferred blades.  I have never cut myself using any of Gillette&#x27;s products.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of other non-Gillette blades and most of them are not sharp enough.  I never use shaving gel with these; you don&#x27;t need it.  I used to use the Gillette Sensor cartridges and those were expensive, great though they are.  These disposable razors are about 95% as good and give a very close shave.  I&#x27;m a connoisseur of Gillette products - I&#x27;ve also used the deodorants for about 20 years now, since my teen years.</li>
    <li> The item received was not the specific product listed. It was similar but was a cheaper version. I ordered the Gillette Good News razor and received Gillette 2 razors. I was not satisfied and was refunded part of the purchase price and was able to keep the item.</li>
    <li> It is VERY hard to find razors these days that DOES NOT have the &#x27;slimy stuff&#x27; on them (which my skin is allergic to). These do not and are just a simple razor that stay sharp for quite a while.</li>
    <li> these razors without the soap bar are very hard to find. iam very happy with this seller.came packed very well unopened.other brands without the soap bar cut .these by gellettte do not cut you.thanks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to buy a three-pack but I went ahead because I can&#x27;t find these in stores any more.&lt;br /&gt;I use them to shave my legs and find they are much better for the job than any ladies razors.  I like the double razor, I don&#x27;t see any point in having 3 or 4 blades.  I like that it does not have the lotion slimy strip.  I like to use my own soap.&lt;br /&gt;I like the easy to hold handle, it does not slip out of my hand even when soapy. And the angle is exactly how I like it, better than Schick or Bic angles.  I&#x27;ve read that other people find them to go dull rather quickly, I use each one for about 3 months.  These will last me a good long time.  I just hope they still make them when I do run out.</li>
    <li> got enough for a year!</li>
    <li> I can use one of these for a week. So, I think that is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;No fancy gizmo&#x27;s that twist and slide or vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;Just a simple shave with cream and it&#x27;s all done.</li>
    <li> Been using these since they first came on market. If you don&#x27;t rinse the razor  while/after shaving, the blades stay sharp and you can get 2,3 or more shaves from each razor (at least I can).</li>
    <li> Using these razors for years with combination w/electric shaver and never have been disappointed. Electric shaver does basic and finial &amp;#34;tuning&amp;#34; the Gillette razors. One razor usually good enough for couple of weeks. Best and economical painless result!</li>
    <li> Husband loves these.  Best deal through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Simple and effective, love these.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Good News and these were no exception.</li>
    <li> Simple twin-blade razors with no lubra-strips or pivoting heads. It&#x27;s all you need for a good shave. I&#x27;ve been using these forever and it&#x27;s the same great quality.</li>
    <li> These work great and are difficult to find. Costco used to carry them, but have gone to a four blade  model which don&#x27;t work as well Thanks for carrying these.</li>
    <li> Abandon your other devices and many-blade contraptions for the best shave on a normal face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some of those and found this to yield the best control over the varied landscape&lt;br /&gt;that confronts you in the morning and others during the day.</li>
    <li> Not as good as razor I used to get at Costco.</li>
    <li> My husband ONLY uses these.  The store in town stopped carrying them, I found them on here.  So I put in an order about every 3 months.  Yes, he loves them, and the ONLY ones he will use.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hubby!  Costs less than walmart.</li>
    <li> Very good product - at a fabulous price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years!  I&#x27;ve used other&#x27;s but nothing else works as good for me. I don&#x27;t need to reinvent the wheel and will stick with what I like.  Get about a month from each razor and Amazon has a good price with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Wonderful if you find the slime pads disgusting and see no need for 12 blades...</li>
    <li> WORKS BUT NO BETTER THAN THE RALLY CHEAP DOUBLE BLADES YOU CAN GET AT WALMART - BEATS STANDING IN LINE FOR THE SAME PRICE AND NO SALES TAX OR FREIGHT</li>
    <li> I refused to spend a lot of money on razors when these perfectly good dual-blade, disposable razors do the job just as well.</li>
    <li> Used his razors for years. Exactly the type of razor to use.</li>
    <li> My standard... Just not the most economical :-)</li>
    <li> I was beginning to think these razors were a thing of the past. Big Box One no longer carried them, and then Big Box Two didn&#x27;t have any.  I am a female who loves these simple razors! Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!  My husband did not like these razors at all and complained about the way the blades cut his face and could only be used a couple of times before they were dull.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> If you travel, these are the perfect choice.  Got used to using these disposables 25 years ago and still  prefer them.  Adding blades does not necessarily make for a better shave.  Being able to toss out a dull razor because its cheap does result in a better and closer shave.  An expensive 3-4-5 blade razor is harder to do, so you wind up using them even if they&#x27;re getting dull.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. All they sell here in Sacramento area are the ones with the lubricant strip.Don&#x27;t like those.</li>
    <li> If you have wire-brush whiskers like me, the ones with the slime on them really suck, and these are getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> Best razors IMO, out there.</li>
    <li> as advertized - good combination; they are exactly as adversized.  What can be said about the product?  It works well, is a good value for the product.</li>
    <li> This a great razor, it does a pretty good job.  Lately, it&#x27;s been hard to find this product in the stores.</li>
    <li> I use an Edwin jagger double edge razor. But, if im in a hurry or going on vacation, I use these. These razors are the ONLY disposables I will use. I have tried every single disposable out there. The bic single blade, bic twin blade, and the bic 3 blade. Then I tried the schick twin blade, triple blade, and the Quattro. Then I tried the Gillette sensor 3, the mach 3, and the fusion. I did not like ANY of them. The worst razor I used was the schick Quattro and the Gillette sensor 3. It was like running sandpaper across my face. And I don&#x27;t like the other good news razors with the lube strip. What is the purpose of a lube strip if the shaving cream already lubes your face?????</li>
    <li> It is impossible to get a decent shave as the product was already dull right out of the packet. I should have paid more attention to some review(s) that complained of the same issue. I tried another one thinking maybe it was just one bad apple but nada. My hair is soft and I tend to shave (head) every 2 days. Other gillette products have worked well for me but this one is completely useless. Now I m stuck with 34 razors that are unusable and I will be calling amazon customer service to complain.</li>
    <li> These are the best disposable razors. No point wasting money on 6-blade contraptions. These do the job.</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years . I have a tough beard and&lt;br /&gt;shave in all directions with no problems . I&#x27;ve tried the&lt;br /&gt;expensive razors and have an electric . The Gillette Sensor 2 is light and long lasting and beats that &amp;#34;safety&lt;br /&gt;razor&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> Love these razors!  Was unable to find them in stores. Finally located these and couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. The price was very good as was the immediate shipping.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I cannot use any razor with goop on the strips.  These last a lot longer and work just as well as the multi blades</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; razor for shaving. I agree with some of the other reviewers who hate the &amp;#34;pivot&amp;#34; heads and especially loathe the slimy strips that leave a weird coating on your face. My only wish for Gillette was that they would bring back a razor they made several years ago called the Micro Track. It was similar to the Good News ,now apparently called Sensor 2, and both were available then but the Micro Track had a slimmer head. It was great for trimming around mustaches and goatees. They seem to have discontinued it and the standard razor feels clumsy by comparison.</li>
    <li> This review is primarily about promptness of receipt of merchandise, and not about the razors themselves. You can find the review about the razor elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great deal, hard to find razors.</li>
    <li> Normally what I buy at the store. This quantity makes them convenient at home.</li>
    <li> We used to buy these at a big-box, which stopped carrying them. I generally get one good shave if I&#x27;m in a hurry (no cream, sometimes even dry) and three if I use shaving cream or gel.  Amazingly, no nicks or razor burn in either usage.</li>
    <li> I typically use a Gillette Mach 3 razor for most shaving but it&#x27;s too bulky to properly shave sideburns and mustache area.  So when it&#x27;s time to handle these areas, I switch to the Gillette 2 blade, fixed head type razor.  When I only use it for mustache, sideburns and touch-ups, I can easily get 4 shaves or so with one razor before I throw it away.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and models of basic disposable razors and I like this one the best.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, these razors are great as is. No need for the bells and whistles of the newer razor product. Why reinvent the wheel?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Gillette listen to your customers!...\\&quot; I&#x27;m a Gillette user too (Venus). So I understand why Gillette is good, since I nicked my legs using Bic many years ago. Sometimes these Good News Regulars are hard to find. So it&#x27;s a great idea to stock up. My boyfriend does not like the strip as others have said as well.. I love the way his face looks and feels when he shaves. This is his exclusive brand. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years that is why I continue to use it, just glad for the availability via internet!</li>
    <li> Best razors ever for rough beard. Nothing else like it. Use this with Barbasol.</li>
    <li> outstanding shaver that is very difficult to find in stores. For those that do not want or like the pre lubricated version this plain double edged shaver is just what you need. Comes in 3 sealing packages of 12 per pack and is not a cheap copy of the original, it is the EXACT same type that Gillette makes as I had some of the original ones left and compared these against the ones I had left over and there is no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that there are some of these razors on the market that are duplicates and yes much cheaper but you get what you pay for. These have very sturdy, grip handles without the swivel head. Also, as far as pricing goes if you can find in a store these cost on average about two to three dollars less per pack.</li>
    <li> These razors aren&#x27;t very good.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, as they are cheap disposable blades.  Prior to purchasing them, I had a Dollar Shave Club subscription.  I used their 4-blade razor for about 9 months, and then downgraded to their 2-blade entry level offering to cut costs.  The 2-blade was ok (not as good as the 4-blade) but the handles for both blades kept breaking.  DSC will comp you with new handles usually, but it&#x27;s a hassle and the handles are cheap even for cheap.  The best option is to buy DSC blades directly from their supplier (Dorco) in bulk.  I use DSC&#x27;s Shave Butter, which is great because it&#x27;s clear, goes on easily without creating a mess before or after shaving, and has some decent ingredients and moisturizing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Goodnews! razors for a little over a month.  They don&#x27;t shave very close.  Afterward, I can still feel rough stubble on my face, whereas the DSC blades and even my electric razor from aeons ago left a smooth finish.  They get clogged up easily, too.  If you&#x27;re a careful, methodical shaver who goes one pass at a time, this will be less of an issue, but if you prefer to zoom through shaving you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed.  I shave with each razor twice and then throw it out, although I could probably get more use if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that the razor is sturdy, not that it matters when you&#x27;re using each one for such a brief period of time.  There is no gel strip which apparently some people like based on reviews, but I don&#x27;t care either way.  Beyond that, there are no real advantages other than cheap cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try out other brands or order from Dorco directly and provide a comparison when that happens.  Shaving is not much of a ritual for me like it is for others - in fact, I view it as a chore.  I don&#x27;t grow very good facial hair, so I just need to shave down to a baby face every couple of days.  I&#x27;d prefer to do it as quickly and cheaplyas possible.</li>
    <li> I have used the good news razors for years, as clean up after using an electric razor, to get the spots it wouldn&#x27;t get.  But, recently, with design changes to my favorite electric razors (I wish when they get a good design that they&#x27;d just leave them alone), I &#x27;&#x27;ve decided to not use electric any longer, except to trim around my ears.  I would say that I have a medium beard and that I like an extremely close shave.  The goo d news disposables are undoubtedly the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Now, with prices going up, I&#x27;m looking at ways to make my blades last longer like leaving the razor in a cup of alcohol after using, or another idea to get longer life out of a blade is to spray the razor with arm and hammer&#x27;s clean shower after finishing.  Will edit review after experimenting for a month or two.</li>
    <li> Gillette has gone on to make expensive triple bladed versions that I hate.  Amazon still offers these great simple razors unlike Costco and many other stores.</li>
    <li> They work like razors.  Hard to find these in the stores anymore since almost all of them have a lubricating strip.  Thankfully you can get them here.  Razors are so expensive why?</li>
    <li> Nice basic old-school razor without the gross slime strip (does anyone remember asking for that &#x27;feature&#x27;?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use an electric, but as with most guys that doesn&#x27;t catch everything everywhere.  Bought them in bulk so I could give some to my sons.  The price was excellent but the payoff comes in saving many hours of futile searching through personal care sections of grocery stores over a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI ladies - you can use these too, there&#x27;s no need to pay double or triple for curvy pink handles - at the business end they&#x27;re the same.</li>
    <li> Shaves my face without issues.</li>
    <li> Great to deal with!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find these razors without the slimy moisturizing strip on them.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> Have tried all the other comparable brands but keep coming back to these. It&#x27;s the only disposable that doesn&#x27;t start taking a layer of skin with it on the second use. Love these cost effective little buggers!</li>
    <li> Good disposable razor for a good price.</li>
    <li> I have used these razors for many years.  It was getting harder to find them in retail stores.  All they want to sell now are the slime strip, bobble head, vibrating, multi-multi blade monstrosities.  I just need a good clean razor without all the bells and whistles designed by the marketing department.  These razors give me the best results and I have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> My husband only wants the Good News Razors without the swivel head and without the lubrication strip, and they are impossible to find in local stores.  These are great razors at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every single kind of shaving system on the market, from expensive european double edged safety razors to various 5,4 and 3 blade disposables.  These razors are the best for my skin. Sometimes you don&#x27;t have to pay a lot for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I like these razors because they are cheap and don&#x27;t have lubricating strips.</li>
    <li> Great product Great price</li>
    <li> I dislike Good News razors with the teflon strip but this is all that can be found in local stores. I am pleased to find these at a good price. This is my third order.</li>
    <li> I have used these razors for many years.  They have been impossible to find at stores and I had to settle for other types.  I am glad to have found them on Amazon and will be buying them on a regular basis.  The best razor out there for the price.</li>
    <li> Thought these had the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; strip on them.  But, they do work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this razor because it works. It will not nick, I can use one of these disposable razors for 3 months!  Just as fast as electric shaver and better results!</li>
    <li> in 1981 as a result of a nicked up battered face resulting from Bic and other terrible razors, a friend recommended GoodNews. I have never left. They are trying to leave us though, with all those new crazy razors with all that pastee stuff all over them.  I have decided when/if they finally abandon the regular GoodNews razors, I will just grow a beard.  That may happen if they increase the prices too:-)  This was a great bargain actually.  I will be looking for more bargains online, along these types of products ...things I would otherwise have to go out and purchase.</li>
    <li> Can Beat the Price &amp; I Get then Sended out every 3 Months,</li>
    <li> We have been using these razors for years.  Find this a most economical way to purchase and have on hand.</li>
    <li> I use these regularly and shave with them often.  Depending on your beard and how often you shave, they will last from 3-10 days, much longer if you don&#x27;t use them at all, in which case you wouldn&#x27;t want to take advantage of their disposable nature.  A great gift idea and the subscription price makes them affordable enough to use daily and discard with abandon.  Great deal.</li>
