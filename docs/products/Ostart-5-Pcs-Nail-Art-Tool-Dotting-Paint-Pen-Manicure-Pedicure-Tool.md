    <li> I used these for perhaps an unexpected use - creating stars in the ceiling of my bedroom.  I bought a small bottle of flourescent paint, squeezed some onto a paper plate, then used the various pens to create dots on the ceiling.  For constellations, I printed the design onto a piece of paper, punched out and trimmed the holes for the major stars, taped the corners to the ceiling, then used the dot pen through the cutouts.  Falling stars are a dot-and-drag.  Unlike the paper stars that stick on, the flourescent paint is invisible -- until the room is dark. The whole ceiling looks great - like staring into the night sky just before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them all the time for nail art. One of the tips did fall out during shipment, but that is understandable - I just put a little glue in and it is just like new</li>
    <li> Great I&#x27;m having fun creating nail designs</li>
    <li> These are great for what there intended but break very easily. As soon as I took the blue one out the dotting end broke and over two months so have the others. But its nothing glue or some clear nail polish can&#x27;t fix :)</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.  Took a little while to receive them, but they work great.</li>
    <li> It took a month but worth the wait it&#x27;s so nice love the colors got it earlier before shipping date was. Good quality love it I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like all the different sizes...also like that its different colors helps to remember which is what size. The price can be lower.</li>
    <li> I love the varied sizes and how each is a different color for easy identification. The quality is fair given the low price. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves them!!!She puts them to good use n has been asking for some of these. She&#x27;s super happy</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. No complaints other than it took a while for me to actually receive the package. Also, it&#x27;s good that they are different colors.. It helps you keep track of the different sized endings.</li>
    <li> The ends haven&#x27;t broke off on my sister. I bought these for her to practice doing designs on her nails and so that she doesnt have to wait on me to do her nails anymore. She has a fun time experimenting with the different shapes.</li>
    <li> Shipping took quite a while, but the product is perfect and the customer service was polite. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nails, just gotta wait forever to get it!:( other than tht perfect !</li>
    <li> I received these a couple of days ago and have used them once and I absolutely love them!!! So far I have only figured out how to do the dotting am uncertain if there is any other designs I can learn but I will surely figure it out! Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I like these. The are well built and not flimsy. They come with all the sizes you will need.</li>
    <li> Different sizss and color came in perfet conditions</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece for her birthday.  She thought they were awesome.  They are a fun easy to use nail tool.  Wasn&#x27;t 2 day delivery but we ordered the day after Thanksgiving and got it a couple of days after Christmas.  The price made then worth the wait!</li>
    <li> It worked really good.</li>
    <li> For this price and variation of sizes you can&#x27;t beat the price. However I am giving the product for stars because my package did come late and one of the dotting tool heads was detached when I received it. Nothing a little superglue won&#x27;t do, but still. Over I think it was a smart buy.</li>
    <li> Great tool, good price</li>
    <li> CHEAP! After once use I was cleaning one of the dotting pencils and the tip came completely off in my hand.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
