      <li>This stuff is almost like a custard but works great!!!</li>
      <li>Very pleased!</li>
      <li>It worked great - hair looks great after drying/brush out, and holds the style.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not waxy at all, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>This was the best price I&#x27;ve ever gotten it for.&lt;br /&gt;Though I have and would pay more.</li>
      <li>and, even though I never used a Biolage product, I knew it was a good brand.</li>
      <li>I immediately loved the stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Styles nicely, without making hair gummy,</li>
      <li>good texture, doesn&#x27;t harden like some products, makes styling easy and holds well throughout the day</li>
      <li>My hair looks more shiny and healthy than before!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use this to texturize and separate a short layered bob cut - it has a medium hold at best</li>
      <li>love this item wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
      <li>Love this souffle.  </li>
      <li>The reason why I say this is that it provided just a tad more hold, which my hair always needs.  </li>
      <li>I also love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Great for extra fine hair.</li>
      <li>I used to use something similar which was discontinued, and this works great for holding my style in my hair.</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase with amazon, and it was incredibly easy!  </li>
      <li>I looked everywhere for the discontinued product called Biolage Shaping Creme Wax without success!</li>
      <li>glad i could get it from amazon, i really like this product!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite styling product!</li>
      <li>and it is just as good, and even a little but better than the shaping creme.</li>
      <li>I used a competitor product for years, but then they &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; it, and I wanted something that did the job with a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Super product.  </li>
      <li>It works great for creating natural, soft curls.</li>
      <li>If you are a guy, and want your hair to look better than natural with some control and volume, buy this stuff immediately.  </li>
      <li>(I have curly hair, but frizzy hair naturally, so this acts more like a de-frizzer for me).</li>
      <li>he likes the Matrix Biolage Molding Souffle very much.</li>
      <li>Also, it received stellar reviews from many different users on a bunch of websites.  </li>
      <li>Not sticky at all but keeps hair cute and under control in humid weather especially and smooths.</li>
      <li>My local beauty supply store has stopped carrying it, so it&#x27;s easy to buy on line.</li>
      <li>I use this product each time I wash my hair and it puts just enough body in my baby fine hair to hold a style all day.</li>
      <li>The price keeps going up over time and seems more and more difficult to find, but I love it and keep coming back to it!</li>
      <li>Holds my hair just right, with a soft feel.</li>
      <li>So many other products are too gooey or way too sticky or like wax.</li>
      <li>Light, and yet molds hair damp or dry with texture or shape.</li>
      <li>Now, the only time I use the Citrus mint is when I want the matte push back look or even more control.</li>
      <li>It made my hair pliable but without the greasy or wet look, and it smelled fantastic.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and limp and this really helps to add some body.  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>I have very short hair, and it is great to use on the roots and to piece/separate for the edgy short hairstyles.  </li>
      <li>I have hair that is not straight enough to lay flat or curly enough to look good without products.</li>
      <li>This is a very easy to use product and you only need a small amount to get results.</li>
      <li>It simply looked healthy and a little bit thicker which inspired me to grow my hair even longer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft but holds.</li>
      <li>A natural look is what you get</li>
      <li>have tried numerous other hair products and nothing can come close to this fantastic molding souffle.</li>
      <li>Was so excited to find it on Amazon and have ordered it a few times.  </li>
      <li>The stuff simply never failed no matter how long or short my hair was and no matter how i styled it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a thick or &amp;#34;gluey&amp;#34;-like paste like some other products I have tried</li>

<li> I have never been disappointed with anything from Biolage - everything smells so good, and works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> like to put this in my hair when it&#x27;s still very wet - directly after my shower - then I let my hair air dry.</li>
<li> A little dab of this in the palm of your hand and work it into your hair after it is dry, tames it right down and allows you to add a little texturing to your style and not look like such a bubble head!  </li>
<li> as long as you blow dry; can&#x27;t let air dry.  </li>
<li> It goes a long way!</li>
<li> Exactly as expected and as described on the site.</li>
<li> Arrived when expected, also.</li>
<li> and I would highly recommend it for thin hair to give it body and lift.</li>
<li> I will order again when needed I find other items I need-Thanks</li>
<li> The product doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all either.</li>
<li> But even then I will still mix in a little molding souffle.  </li>
<li> I use this as well as my grandson as we both have very thick and coarse hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  </li>
<li> A product that is hard to find in my area.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, getting harder to find.  </li>
<li> That is why I was annoyed that it was being discontinued.  </li>
<li> I moved to Arizona and have been unable to find it..</li>
<li> Used to buy from JCPenney, who still carries lots of Biolage products, just not this one, anymore.  :(</li>
<li> Smells bad (which was a surprise for Biolage!) and doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> glad i could get it from amazon, i really like this product!</li>
    <li> A product that is hard to find in my area. It works well as a &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; for men, not leaving your hair matted or stickey. A natural look is what you get</li>
    <li> the product I have been looking for for several years,  just what I needed to help style my hair!</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use product and you only need a small amount to get results. It&#x27;s not a thick or &amp;#34;gluey&amp;#34;-like paste like some other products I have tried and I would highly recommend it for thin hair to give it body and lift.</li>
    <li> I use this to texturize and separate a short layered bob cut - it has a medium hold at best so it won&#x27;t work well for spiking hair. It&#x27;s not waxy at all, and smells great.  The product doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all either.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for the discontinued product called Biolage Shaping Creme Wax without success! This product is exactly the same. It is just a different name. Very pleased! Light, and yet molds hair damp or dry with texture or shape. Not sticky at all but keeps hair cute and under control in humid weather especially and smooths. My hair looks more shiny and healthy than before!</li>
    <li> Having used Matrix Biolage Shampoo, Conditioner, and the Matrix Biolage Molding Souffle for years, was so bummed the company discontinued this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous other hair products and nothing can come close to this fantastic molding souffle. Was so excited to find it on Amazon and have ordered it a few times.  It offers the perfect consistency without weighing the hair down and does not leave that horrible sticky feeling. I have very short hair, and it is great to use on the roots and to piece/separate for the edgy short hairstyles.  It only takes a drop to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the product and the seller, as prompt delivery and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I used to use something similar which was discontinued, and this works great for holding my style in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair sucks..plain and simple. I have hair that is not straight enough to lay flat or curly enough to look good without products. It just \\&quot;puffs\\&quot; out from my head unless it is cut short (1/2-3/4 inches). I need  hair products if I want to grow my hair any longer than that.  One day I ran out of my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; paste (American Crew Citrus Mint) and saw a sales ad for a discontinued product call Biolage Shaping Creme.  It figured what the hell since it was %75 off and, even though I never used a Biolage product, I knew it was a good brand. Also, it received stellar reviews from many different users on a bunch of websites.  I immediately loved the stuff.  It made my hair pliable but without the greasy or wet look, and it smelled fantastic. It simply looked healthy and a little bit thicker which inspired me to grow my hair even longer.  The stuff simply never failed no matter how long or short my hair was and no matter how i styled it.  That is why I was annoyed that it was being discontinued.  However, I found out that Biolage replaced the shaping creme with something called Molding Souffle.  SO, I bought the stuff and it is just as good, and even a little but better than the shaping creme. The reason why I say this is that it provided just a tad more hold, which my hair always needs.  Now, the only time I use the Citrus mint is when I want the matte push back look or even more control. But even then I will still mix in a little molding souffle.  If you are a guy, and want your hair to look better than natural with some control and volume, buy this stuff immediately.  I got mine on Ebay or about $12 including shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this souffle.  Styles nicely, without making hair gummy, as long as you blow dry; can&#x27;t let air dry.  Unfortunately, getting harder to find.  Used to buy from JCPenney, who still carries lots of Biolage products, just not this one, anymore.  :(</li>
    <li> The molding soufflé is used by my husband to help control his hair.  He likes his hair to look well groomed and&lt;br /&gt;so he likes the Matrix Biolage Molding Souffle very much.</li>
    <li> The price keeps going up over time and seems more and more difficult to find, but I love it and keep coming back to it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. So many other products are too gooey or way too sticky or like wax. This stuff is almost like a custard but works great!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> love this item wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
    <li> Oh yes... This is the very best product.  I moved to Arizona and have been unable to find it..&lt;br /&gt;So thank goodness for Amazon.. and Ebay..  This was the best price I&#x27;ve ever gotten it for.&lt;br /&gt;Though I have and would pay more.</li>
    <li> good texture, doesn&#x27;t harden like some products, makes styling easy and holds well throughout the day</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and as described on the site. Arrived when expected, also. Used by both my daughters on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I use this as well as my grandson as we both have very thick and coarse hair.  A little dab of this in the palm of your hand and work it into your hair after it is dry, tames it right down and allows you to add a little texturing to your style and not look like such a bubble head!  Thank you Biolage.</li>
    <li> Smells bad (which was a surprise for Biolage!) and doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase with amazon, and it was incredibly easy!  I will order again when needed I find other items I need-Thanks</li>
    <li> I also love this stuff.  My hair is fine and limp and this really helps to add some body.  Works best on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product each time I wash my hair and it puts just enough body in my baby fine hair to hold a style all day.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s soft but holds. I like not feeling product in my hair. It goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite styling product! I have never been disappointed with anything from Biolage - everything smells so good, and works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put this in my hair when it&#x27;s still very wet - directly after my shower - then I let my hair air dry. It works great for creating natural, soft curls. (I have curly hair, but frizzy hair naturally, so this acts more like a de-frizzer for me).</li>
    <li> Great for extra fine hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this locally, so once again Amazon comes through. Holds my hair just right, with a soft feel.</li>
    <li> I used a competitor product for years, but then they &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; it, and I wanted something that did the job with a clean, fresh scent.  I was already using Matrix Biolage hair shampoo and conditioner, so I saw this and decided to give it a try.  It worked great - hair looks great after drying/brush out, and holds the style.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  Super product.  My local beauty supply store has stopped carrying it, so it&#x27;s easy to buy on line.</li>
