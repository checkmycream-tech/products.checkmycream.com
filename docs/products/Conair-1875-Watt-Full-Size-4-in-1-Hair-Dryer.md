      <li>Light weight.</li>
      <li>did I mention that it was really light?</li>

      <li>The hot air option could be a bit hotter, otherwise perfect...and really light, too.</li>
      <li>Love it makes my hair so soft and lots of body.</li>
      <li>a while ago when I had short hair and liked it then.  </li>
      <li>This one is good for that but not as much as I expected.</li>
      <li>So I ended up using my own brush to dry my hair.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for-</li>
      <li>(I prefer air drying), so I probably didn&#x27;t use this hair dryer more than 15-20 times total.  </li>
      <li>It works quickly and gives my hair the same smooth shine that the straightening irons</li>
      <li>It is so long between my hair dryer purchases that I can&#x27;t compare to many others except to say that it seems comparable to a 1500 watt unit.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair quickly and I like how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this dryer to any one</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s light-weight, well-balanced, not too noisy, doesn&#x27;t have rocker switches, dries fast, leaves hair shiny, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>I like it so much I even bought another one to keep in reserve.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer last week and was so excited.</li>
      <li>ok, no little hair sticking out after I blow dry.</li>
      <li>Blow dry the hair fast..gives fine hair alot of body.</li>
      <li>Then I put the straightener on, turn the dryer on Hot with Low fan and comb my hair out first to avoid tangles.  </li>
      <li>Works as needed with no complaint or issue.</li>
      <li>I love the comb attachment and it is not too heavy</li>
      <li>I have very thin hair and the meduim heat is a great tool for this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Strong enough to dry my long hair quickly.</li>
      <li>I have long but fine Northern European hair.  </li>
      <li>This is lighter weight that my old one ..</li>
      <li>(the attachment has a metal rod inside that is essentially ironing your hair straight).  </li>
      <li>a busy person</li>
      <li>Very lightweight but not cheap quality, doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
      <li>I am using my refund to get a Yellow Bird which came highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly when I need it but also has several other settings.</li>
      <li>This little dryer is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
      <li>The hair dryer worked as expected but on high it screamed.  </li>
      <li>It has never been dropped and I have since tried plugging it into several different outlets and pushed the reset button no less than 20 times.  </li>
      <li>It dries my thick, shoulder-length hair quickly and leaves it shiny.  </li>

<li> I kept pushing them down thinking I was attaching it wrong, but they just didn&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
<li> I rarely dry my hair</li>
<li> Why unhappy?  Very large and heavy, but particularly, rocker switches on the front of the handle that any minor adjustment of my hand position while drying would cause a change in my settings.  </li>
<li> I tried to dry my hair the other night, used it for about 30 seconds and it just shut off.  </li>
<li> Unacceptable and a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> I will only be using this a few times a year</li>
<li> and i have thick natural hair.</li>
<li> you have thick or African American hair and order this for the attachments, don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
<li> I just blow dry my hair till it is slightly damp.  </li>
<li> I only use a small amount of heat on my hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had narrowed down my choice between this one and another one that costs $75.  </li>
<li> It is not too heavy either.</li>
<li> but quite heavy compares to this.</li>
<li> I bought this in November of 2014 and it broke a few days ago.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, I packed this thing up and and shipping it back to the manufacturer as we</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just broken....</li>
<li> so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when blowing drying my hair</li>
<li> I looked very carefully at all the hair dryers on Amazon before deciding on this one to replace the one I had that I was very unhappy with.  </li>
<li> Hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed again.</li>
<li> I tried straighteners and found it annoying to deal with a separate styling tool.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the placement of the various powers, levels of heat, air, etc.</li>
    <li> I wish the air flow was stronger but it does a good job. The attachments are great.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer and it also comes with several accessories. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Light weight. Blow dry the hair fast..gives fine hair alot of body.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer and it works great! I just love it and will use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I learned about this hair dyer from my Mom. I stayed at her house and used this stuff and I loved it. So, I ordered one for myself even though my hair dryer is still working well but quite heavy compares to this. I absolutely love it. Good heat and light. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> The hair dryer worked as expected but on high it screamed.  I wish I had purchased the travel hair dryer as I know it to be quiet.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair quickly and I like how soft it makes my hair feel. It seems to give my hair more volume.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer from the color to how lightweight it is.  Works great - couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk.  I bought this in November of 2014 and it broke a few days ago.  I rarely dry my hair (I prefer air drying), so I probably didn&#x27;t use this hair dryer more than 15-20 times total.  I tried to dry my hair the other night, used it for about 30 seconds and it just shut off.  It has never been dropped and I have since tried plugging it into several different outlets and pushed the reset button no less than 20 times.  It&#x27;s just broken....and of course the return date for this item has passed.  I will say the hair dryer worked beautifully before it broke.  Unacceptable and a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I only use a small amount of heat on my hair. I am African american and i have thick natural hair. I like that this blow dryer came with 4 attachments.  used this with the comb attachment to do a blow out and it worked well. I look forward to using the diffuser attachment.  I will only be using this a few times a year so It works for me.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for- a hair dryer that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do ;)</li>
    <li> Very lightweight but not cheap quality, doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Strong enough to dry my long hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this hair dryer. Dries quickly when I need it but also has several other settings. It is not too heavy either.</li>
    <li> All the different attachments are really great. The speed is really great also. Love this product.</li>

    <li> This thing is awesome...</li>
    <li> This is lighter weight that my old one ..I really like it.</li>
    <li> Light weight and strong! I love the comb attachment and it is not too heavy so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when blowing drying my hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big, not for travel. Works ok, no little hair sticking out after I blow dry. Just feeling the words so it will submit, kkj  jujhyttgfgf ghbhvbcvcgcfcg ygyvgvgvgvg hgvvgvg.</li>
    <li> light, powerful with nice accessories for the missus. did I mention that it was really light? it is also compact enough to take on a trip, if needed.</li>
    <li> I like a lot of air power. This one is good for that but not as much as I expected. It is so long between my hair dryer purchases that I can&#x27;t compare to many others except to say that it seems comparable to a 1500 watt unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer a while ago when I had short hair and liked it then.  But now my hair is longer and can be poofy after blow drying.  I tried straighteners and found it annoying to deal with a separate styling tool.  Then I remembered the straightening comb attachment that this came with and gave it a try.  It is easy to use and I am soooo happy with it.  I just blow dry my hair till it is slightly damp.  Then I put the straightener on, turn the dryer on Hot with Low fan and comb my hair out first to avoid tangles.  Then I comb it through with this (the attachment has a metal rod inside that is essentially ironing your hair straight).  It works quickly and gives my hair the same smooth shine that the straightening irons do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy person so I find this quick all in one tool a huge help!</li>
    <li> Easy and light weight and styles my hair super fast with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had narrowed down my choice between this one and another one that costs $75.  I have long but fine Northern European hair.  This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my hair so soft and lots of body. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this dryer. I really recommend this dryer to any one</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer last week and was so excited. I read all of the reviews and was eager to use it. It arrived just as Amazon said and all was fine on that end. However, when I unwrapped it and tried to use it that is when the honeymoon was over. It only has two settings, and for my thick hair it just didn&#x27;t get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a selling point for this dryer are the four attachments, that&#x27;s if those things stay on during use. I tried to use the brush and comb attachment and they kept falling off. its as if the attachments were not even made for the hair dryer. I kept pushing them down thinking I was attaching it wrong, but they just didn&#x27;t fit properly. So I ended up using my own brush to dry my hair. Needless to say, I packed this thing up and and shipping it back to the manufacturer as we speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick or African American hair and order this for the attachments, don&#x27;t be fooled. I am using my refund to get a Yellow Bird which came highly recommended. Hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed again.</li>
    <li> Works as needed with no complaint or issue.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer so far, and my daughter loves the color.  It has plenty of power, and the control are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I looked very carefully at all the hair dryers on Amazon before deciding on this one to replace the one I had that I was very unhappy with.  Why unhappy?  Very large and heavy, but particularly, rocker switches on the front of the handle that any minor adjustment of my hand position while drying would cause a change in my settings.  This seems to be a popular option with many dryers so people must like this, but I find this type of set-up exasperating!  This little dryer is lightweight and powerful.  It dries my thick, shoulder-length hair quickly and leaves it shiny.  It&#x27;s not overly noisy, although that&#x27;s not something that bothers me (I expect a hair dryer to be noisy).  But the best part, what I&#x27;m most happy about, is the slide switches.  There is no way to accidentally change your settings while drying your hair.  So it&#x27;s light-weight, well-balanced, not too noisy, doesn&#x27;t have rocker switches, dries fast, leaves hair shiny, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  It&#x27;s the perfect hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and the meduim heat is a great tool for this hair dryer.  Very nice item.</li>
