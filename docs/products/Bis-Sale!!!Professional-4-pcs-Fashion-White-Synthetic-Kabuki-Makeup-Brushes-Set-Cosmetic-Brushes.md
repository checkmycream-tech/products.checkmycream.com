    <li> Good for the price! not too durable though...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great quality of brush set. Brush hairs feel dense yet extremely soft against face. A must have for anyone who loves makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice but it would have been great if they were labeled usages. I had to figure out what each one was used for</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice! Fast shipping. Ordered on a Friday, arrived the following Tuesday.  I previously purchase a black and silver set from RC Cosmetics which are also nice, but I wanted a white set to use with my clear applications, i.e. moisturizes, primers and things of the like.  These white brushes fit bill perfectly and at a very reasonable price, plus free shipping.  The bristles are dense and the handles are easy to hold, not too thick and not too slim.  I washed them the same day I received them, no shedding at all! Will probably order another set for a friend for her birthday.</li>
    <li> No shedding from these brushes. They worked perfectly even after I washed them there was still no shedding :) great</li>
    <li> :-) I&#x27;ve received it sooner than I expected, love my set of make-up kabuki brushes, they are just what I need, soft for the face skin and easy to clean it!  and Yes, I would recomend it to a friend. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> The flat top brush was the reason I wanted to order this ... but I ended up using them all equally! they are so soft yet sturdy for being so cheap! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I loved these so much I ordered a second set. These are very good brushes. I am a professional makeup artist and these are better then the set I paid over 150 dollars for. They are soft don&#x27;t shed easy to clean. Even though they are soft to the touch they glide on firm. I absolutely recommend this set. If your novice or a professional these make a excellent addition to  your makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Great shipping, that&#x27;s definitely a plus!&lt;br /&gt;The item came in a lot faster than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend said the brushes have a scent, sooo... I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;He has it, so I still need to go get it. xD&lt;br /&gt;But I will definitely try it out and see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep on update on this! (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping this a 4 for now.</li>
    <li> it similar to sigma may be smoother !! dense and soft &amp;#62;&amp;#62; love love love them ,, also trustful buyer good packige recommend to u to buy them rather than sigma .. really a good deal</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I seen the price..thought it was too good to be true. I&#x27;ve heard great things about them (the stipple brushes) so I figured why not give them a try. I bought the 4 pack of these which was 18$ I think plus free shipping ( it was a sale) and they even came earlier than I expected. When they came I opened them right away, washed my face and gave them a try LOL literally...I was soo amazed. They were soo soft, blended amazingly and my foundation/blush/bronzer stayed right on the tip (where it should) unlike other brushes your makeup ends ups more in* the brush than on* it.. Im guessing its also the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; style of it which helps.&lt;br /&gt;I love these more than my mac brushes which is crazy lol but its really not. I would recommend these to everyone!! They are cheap, excellent quality and seriously you will LOVE them!! So give them a try, you wont be disappointed! I PROMISE!</li>
    <li> These brushes are a waste of money.  From the day I received them they were shedding! Don NOT waste your time and money on these cheap brushes!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.. I Totally Love These Brushes, They Are Super Amazing no doubt about it.. This is A Must Have!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I prefer to use then instead of high end ones. No shedding. Great application.</li>
    <li> I have 2 sets. One for myself and one for my clients. They are well made and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes especially for the price, I purchased 2 sets of brushes a white set along with a black set and I am really impressed with how well the brushes work.  these brushes apply product well to the skin, I recieve no shedding after washing and they dry quickly.</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are soft and dense. Great price and gives many options from four brushes. I would recommend getting this set.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes 3 days ago and so far I am extremely pleased with the quality. They feel very sturdy. The bristles are very soft and are dense. I used the flat top for liquid foundation application and it did an amazing job blending and applying the full, even coverage that I was looking for. There has been no shedding. I paid a little under $13 with free shipping that was extrememly fast and for that price, it is an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> Really super soft and thick super great couldnt live without cant explain how great they are !!!!!!!!!!! Go buy now</li>
    <li> I got these brushes late, but I love them. My sister would always complain about my brushes scratching her when I did her makeup and when I used these she noticed how soft they are. I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the quality of the brushes.. Love them there my fav.</li>
