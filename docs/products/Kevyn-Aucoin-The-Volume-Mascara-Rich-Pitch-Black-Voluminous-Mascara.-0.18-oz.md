      <li>You need to make sure all excess mascara is off the wand before applying.  </li>
      <li>I love this because it doesn&#x27;t smudge and in fact, helps prevent my eye liner from smudging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do a lot of research before buying my beauty products - and most of them DO NOT live up to the hype. THIS ONE DOES. Do you want to have curled, long, thick lashed doe-eyes? Buy this stuff. Another super plus - it doesn&#x27;t come off onto my pillow at night. I used to wash my face and still have mascara come off on my pillow. (Which is super-frustrating if you&#x27;re a neat-nick like me!) This mascara comes off in little tubes when you use any-ol&#x27; regular face soap. Brilliant. Also doesn&#x27;t flake, smudge or budge in any other way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for over two years now and would not switch back to traditional mascara; however my most recently purchased tube seemed older or something.  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; tube has been clumping and flaking like the product tends to do when I know I need to order a new one.</li>
    <li> Yeah I love this product&lt;br /&gt;I have little eyelash so work perfect way for me.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  It is unlike any I have ever used.  Kind of like my lashes are coated in vinyl or something.  The best part is the way it washes off.  It sort of just slips off each lash in a whole piece without getting all over or needing any extra remover.</li>
    <li> Best mascara in the world: curls easily,blackest of black lashes, easy to remove, never smudges or clumps. Kevyn Aucoin products are simply brilliant!</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara! New favorite. Makes lashes look long and doesnt clump together</li>
    <li> I can finally wear mascara! i never could because I would end up looking like a raccoon in no time at all</li>
    <li> i threw out the first first tube, which i received as a gift.  but then i decided to try it again and am converted.  it is clumpy so i have to use a lash comb to unclump&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a waxy mascara that comes right off in a clump when you wash your face or shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however in superhot weather (or probably if your eyes were to tear) it sort of shatters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i decided it was worth if for ease of use -- way better than lash tint and almost as good as extensions.  i  am very lazy about lash removal so i was using these two options before my conversion!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Extremely disappointed. Stick with the pink tube from the local drug store. Over rated and WAY over priced. So much for the theory that the more expensive products are superior. Nope!</li>
    <li> This is a product I will never get tired of. No flaking, goes on great and stays in place til you decide to wash it off. Living in Florida, it even wears well in heat an humidity. It truly is the Best ever mascara!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t run at all throughout the course of the day. Comes off nicely at the end of the day--even with only water. I&#x27;ve been using it for years as it makes my lashes look long and full. Also, i ordered on a Sunday and had it at my door on Tuesday afternoon (regular shipping).</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing.  Eyelashes look extremely natural after application. Very easy to remove. No issues with flaking off.  I&#x27;ll never use another brand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The wand separates the lashes and lengthens them and this is one of the few mascaras I have found that did not bleed dark circles under the eyes after a few hours.  It did not smear and surprisingly was not difficult to remove.  Also, I have a lot of problems with eye products irritating my eyes or making them itch.  This has caused no problems.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use to use this along time ago, but forgot about it. I love it!!!! It makes eyelashes look gorgeous!!! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I ended up giving it to my daughter. I didn&#x27;t like the wand, it clumped very easily</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of overly heavy, thick lashes that look sort of trashy in my opinion.  This gives nice separation and decent coverage. Good for the office.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST true waterproof, sweat proof, tear proff mascara. I LOVE THIS STUFF!! I have small eyes but long lashes so most products end up giving me marks all over my lids. This one leaves no marks all day long. Don&#x27;t be alarmed when removing it. At first I thought I had removed all my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lengthen or volumize or curl or plump  Basically just takes what you have, makes them black and stick together in clumps&lt;br /&gt;It does come off with just soap and water, but it comes off in these big waxy clumps.  After washing my face, I&#x27;d have to pick off these clumps off my cheeks and under my eyes.  It was really weird.  Using make up remover on regular mascara seems less cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;I could deal with the unusual removal if the mascara actually made my eyelashes do anything but just sit there and clump together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste.  The worst part is, after using it for 3 days, I threw it on my counter and forgot to return it.  Now its been more than the 30 days and I&#x27;m stuck with it.  That&#x27;s my fault, though.  I should have returned it from the start</li>
    <li> This is nothing remotely &#x27;volume&#x27; about this mascara...it&#x27;s great for day if you want a little bit of lash, very natural looking but it has no glamour for night time use...takes off easily with soap and water...doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge while wearing.</li>
    <li> I very seldom wear mascara because it usually just ends up under my eyes.  Even waterproof products.  Even if I skipped wearing sunscreen around my eyes, which seems like a bad idea. Wearing waterproof mascara with a coating of clear mascara helped but did not eliminate the problem.  I gave up, but then I read about this mascara in a magazine.  Its more pricey than any mascara I have ever bought, but it WORKS.  I tried it out as soon as I got it, and later spent two hours in kung fu class.  My face was running with sweat.  But the mascara stayed on my lashes and did not migrate.  It came off in the shower with soap and water.  Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Def gives good length but i feel like i have to use it more in order to get a feel for applying it better. So easy to remove too which i love. I feel like it fades throughout the day or weighs down my lashes but so far this and Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; are my go to mascaras!</li>
    <li> Love Kevyn Aucoin Mascara!! I usually end up with raccoon eyes, but never with this stuff! Comes off with just water as it seems to coat the eyelashes and when saturated it just rolls off.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day.  LOVE it and worth every penny.  Comes off easily with warm water.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice but the goo is thick and feels like wax and the next day it  literally peeled off my eye lashes in one long waxy clump.  I have never ever had mascara as bad as this.  Stick with the pink and fop green Mabeline mascara, it is the best of all including the big price brands</li>
    <li> I am a mascara junky. As a former make-up artist for a very high end make-up line, I know how important mascara is to a finished look. I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every mascara available, from the very cheapest to the outrageously expensive with mixed results. Just because a mascara has a fancy name and an expensive price tag, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.  Kevyn Aucoin products aren&#x27;t sold in many places, but it was recommended to me by a sales person in a smaller boutique store. Unfortunately, they were out of it, so I did my usual thing - look on Amazon. I was really eager to try it, so waited impatiently for it to arrive (thank goodness for Amazon Prime). The first time I tried it, I was in love. The applicator is very thin, which insures that I can reach every lash. My lashes look thicker and even a bit curlier. When I look in the mirror at night before washing my face, my lashes look the same as when I first applied the mascara. I love this stuff and can only wish it was more readily available locally. However, as long as Amazon continues to carry it, I&#x27;m in business.</li>
    <li> I apply mascara only to my lower lashes because my upper lashes are not \\&quot;all that\\&quot; and also, if I have a problem with my semi-hard contacts during the day, I do not want to deal with mascara during watery ins and outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying, I do pat the applicator on a tissue so it is not overloaded. For the most part, I can coat individual hairs. If two get stuck together, I just wait until my lower lashes are dry and I comb them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara sticks to my lower lashes without Ratcooning, even when I&#x27;m very very sweaty. I do not rub my eyes when sweaty, so cannot tell you how it would react under that condition, but for normal wear, even if my eyes tear a bit (remember, I wear semi-hard lenses), I have had no smearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara covers the blond tips. I don&#x27;t think it produces that much volume, but it does do a very nice job of covering.</li>
    <li> no rubbing mascara off your lower eyes, stays put.  The mascara when washed off flakes but not into eyes, just clean.  Gives a nice volume too.  Worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with mascara smudging beneath my eyes due to watery eyes due to allergies - not with this fantastic product. I have recommended itnto friends and they love it too. One friend had stopped wearing mascara because of smudging and now feels much prettier.</li>
    <li> Applying this mascara is way too much work when trying to get ready for work on the morning.  You need to make sure all excess mascara is off the wand before applying.  Make sure you have plenty of time because once it gioes on wrong you have to take all of the mascara off.  If applied correctly then the mascara last all day.  Still ended up with racccon eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara was advertised as having &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;....no flaking......no smudges....and easy to remove....it did NONE of these things....I had black flakes on my cheeks all day and by the end of the day,  the mascara had almost disappeared! What was left was VERY difficult to remove...I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that delivered such horrible results....I would NOT recommend this product to my worst enemy!!</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on great. I love the skinny applicator, the big ones are hard for me to use. I also like the thin texture of it as it has a more natural look than the thick, clumpy mascaras.  It wears well, too.  I find it a little hard to remove, though.  It leaves a residue that is hard to get completely off.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have tried every mascara known to mankind.  This one not only makes your lashes thicker, but longer AND it comes off in tubes - no need for make up remover, just splash water on them and rub a smidge and it slides right off.  Of course, I guess if you were a swimmer, that would not be a great feature, but for every day use, it&#x27;s awesome.  Even on bottom lashes, it does not smudge at all.</li>
    <li> It is a great mascara.it keeps the lakes separated.better than most.I have used it for a while and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> It would be really, really great if it were waterproof!!</li>
    <li> I read great reviews for this product on Nordstrom.com, so I was very surprised to use it and find that it was almost dry.  I could barely get any color on my lashes.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 years&lt;br /&gt;this is the best stays on until y take&lt;br /&gt;off if y have long thin lashes this is for y&lt;br /&gt;y wont be sorry trust me&lt;br /&gt;its great</li>
    <li> The best part of this mascara is the way it comes off - splash water and wipe, no harsh removers or chemicals.  I like the mascara, but I do use a different mascara as a base otherwise you have to apply more layers to get the fullness I want.  It doesn&#x27;t flake and stays on nicely throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is really great mascara. It goes on so easily. No clumping. It is very slick so you you can get each lash coated. Once it dries it is absolutely smudge-proof, because it comes off as a weird textured rubberlike fiber. This also makes it so easy to wash off. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I have been searching for a good mascara for So long -- This stuff is amazing -- my eyelashes are long and I get so many compliments -- will def be buying this again in the future.</li>
    <li> No smudge. Easy to clean off.  Looks great.  I keep the tube in my cosmetic bag in my purse. It lasts up to 6 months.</li>
    <li> I tried different tubing mascaras and I have to say that this one has the best price to quality ration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Trish McEvoy High Volume Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132FPFY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00132AI1K/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1).&lt;br /&gt;These are defiantly superior to Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this one) but the price is much higher. I can not say that the quality out ways having to pay ~50$ for Trish McEvoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Blinc Mascaras in black and purple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUNBZS/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and I have to say that even though these are cheaper---I don&#x27;t like them at all! These are very runny and don&#x27;t amplify lashes at all, but rather glue them together. I&#x27;m done with Blinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevyn Aucoin Volume Mascara (this current product) provides just the right amount of lash amplification, with out lumps and clumps. It also allows for proper lash separation and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for using tubing mascaras----it is how easy to take it off---you just wash your face with warm water and the mascara rolls off in little clumps. No more raccoon eyes!</li>
    <li> I finally found the mascara I&#x27;ve been searching for. One that adds volume, length, doesn&#x27;t clump, smudge or flake. Plus, is wipes off totally clean with water only. What more could a girl want from her mascara? I am a huge fan and only hope that they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for a mascara that didn&#x27;t smudge; I always look like I have raccoon eyes within a few hours of applying mascara.  I read about this product in the Oprah Magazine and so far everything they&#x27;ve recommended has been spot on.  So I gave it and I am THRILLED to say that they were 100% right.  No smudging, smearing whatsoever even after a 14 hour day!  I love this so much so that I&#x27;ve already reordered AND given away the two unopened mascaras (I tend to buy a lot at a time) that I was previously using to others (each cost $35).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara comes off super easy with just water.  Simply wet a washclothes, press it lightly a couple of times on your lashses, and then gently wipe away.  Voila - the mascara is off. So gentle.</li>
    <li> Read a review in a magazine on this mascara and thought I would give it a try.  Been searching and searching for mascara that does not give me Raccoon eyes by lunchtime.  Was getting ready for work early on a Tuesday morning and slapped this on my lashes.  Long story short I ended up in the E.R. dept followed by having a surprise appendectomy that evening.  Next day lets just say my first solid food meal decided it wasn&#x27;t going to stay down.  Released home Wed&#x27;s evening and Thursday morning is when I first saw signs of Raccoon eyes from putting this mascara on Tuesday morning at 6 am.  I am beyond impressed with the staying power of this mascara and hope to never give it such a through test again.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance...exceeded  all expectations! I&#x27;m old and I thought I had tried them all but this mascara looks natural, doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear (always my issue before) and washes off with the gentlest face washing routine.  Whoopie!</li>
    <li> I read about this mascara in a magazine and decided to try it.  I am extremely happy with the purchase because it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge yet washes off completely with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Comes off easily, never, ever smudges and lashes are long! Will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as \\&quot;The Volume Mascara\\&quot; &amp; is the exact opposite.  I curled my lashes first; when I applied the mascara, it separated them into thin clumps &amp; they straightened right out.  It also flaked the whole time I had it on.  Totally false advertising.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed!  Smeared, did not lengthen, was hard to apply.i really expected better for the price. Would return if I could!</li>
    <li> No smudging under the eyes, and no eye irritation.  Enough said from someone who as she gets older is finding these two issues a larger and larger problem.  When the eye makeup goes to the nose, we&#x27;ve got a problem.  Also, the brush structure really pulls out all the tiny lashes on the bottom- without leaving a thick line of mascara at the base of those said tiny lashes.  As my lashes are thinning due  to medication, my eye makeup had ceased to ever look like it used to- until I tried the Kevyn Aucoin.  My eyes are now properly lashed, without looking like I have a ton of mascara on, and with no smudging or running, my eyes have become my best feature again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it never smudges and it never runs. It comes off in the shower with ease.</li>
    <li> Started out nice, but I&#x27;ve purchased three times and found it does not last long and dries out quickly. Was pretty good at not smudging but not worth price again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara so much - I originally bought it from Sephora but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, much to my dismay.  I love the tube technology.  It&#x27;s SO easy to remove, literally all you need is warm water.  I love the way it looks, otherwise even the tube technology wouldn&#x27;t sway me.  It&#x27;s the best of the \\&quot;tube technology\\&quot; mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried (by far) AND it&#x27;s just a fantastic mascara in its own right.  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Stays on with no raccoon eyes,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end.  I have tried so many different style brushes and mascaras for my aging eyelashes.  I was so excited and intrigued by this mascara, but to my disappointment it is flakey, smudes, and sometimes lays down the mascara &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; right on my eye and cheekbone.  If this had been inexpensive, I may not have been so upset, but it is too much money for this product. By the way, I have never written a review before and may never again - so that is how strongly I feel.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Got it when I was was getting married and have used it over the last 10 years. No smear and easy to get off.</li>
    <li> awful and i mean awful.what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Who needs false eyelashes???</li>
    <li> Have looked for goods mascara my whole life.  Finally found it.  Love it.  No flaking and comes off with water only.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara after having seen it reviewed in Good Housekeeping. Not a fan of drugstore mascaras, I need something to help build volume and length to my middle-aged, sparse eyelashes. This isn&#x27;t the way to go at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is tiny, supposedly to &#x27;catch&#x27; every last lash and transform each one into a long and lush thing of beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does instead is to very carefully pull each lash OUT. There is no magic potion, formula or brush that will re-grow my lashes. It&#x27;ll be a slow and arduous process, watching my skimpy lashes grow back. Given the chance, I would GLADLY keep my lashes and money and remain a customer at the Lancôme counter.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest most amazing mascara ever! I am 48, have tried a zillion mascaras. Normally would never pay this much but love it so much will probably never buy anything else. With one stroke, I finally have lashes again. Amazing!! and lasts all day and night. I wasted so much $ on cheaper mascaras that all stunk- I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. I love this because it doesn&#x27;t smudge and in fact, helps prevent my eye liner from smudging. It acts like a water proof mascara in that it stays put but once you want to wash it off, it easily comes off with simply face wash. No makeup remover needed.</li>
    <li> No smudge, long lasting mascara! I will be purchasing again. The product is pricey but it does what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I Didn&#x27;t like the brush and didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes. Would not buy this again too expensive and I don&#x27;t mind paying for good mascara.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara as a gift over Christmas and I fell in love with this mascara. It makes my lashes long and full in a really beautiful way. The only down side is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get off, even with eye makeup remover but I never have raccoon eyes because of it!</li>
    <li> Truly unique is the best way to describe this mascara. It stays on all day with good coverage. It is easy to remove, but takes some getting used to because it almost peels off when you go to remove it. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it, but once you adjust, it is great. In fact, I was out of the country and had to buy another highly rated mascara that required me to use eye makeup remover. That was all it took. I&#x27;m back with Kevin Aucoin mascara and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> it was a good product but expected more after reading reviews. pricey but removed easily. will buy again if price is right.</li>
    <li> Formerly used Blinc, but this goes and stays on without drying and crumbling.</li>
    <li> This mascara lasts and lasts. But comes off easily when you want it too. I have fallen asleep in this only to be surprised the next morning that I did not have raccoon eyes. Has a very natural look. It darkens and defines lashes. But it does go on very light so if you have average lashes (like me) it does not add much, just a little bit more noticeable than what I already have. The best thing about this mascara is its staying power. And, if you want a  very natural looking lash, it does that too.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this product. Does exactly as advertised. It separates the lashes as it goes on. I bought a lash comb at the same time but I do not need it. I have never paid this much for mascara but it was well worth the price. Great coverage and easy to remove when I wash my face. Does not come off when I cry. Delivery was no problem.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduced me to this mascara about a year ago.  I work overseas and outdoors for most of my work day...this mascara not only lasts, it does not smudge, and to top it off...when you wash your face at the end of a very long day...it comes off in little tubes, leaving my eyelashes clean and fresh for the next day.</li>
    <li> I will definitely order again this mascara again. It stays in place throughout the day and washes off in clumps, almost like washing off fake eyelashes. I like it a lot but don&#x27;t love it, I wish it gave me slightly fuller lashes. Even so, I will definitely order again as I like the way it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge during the day.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t transfer to my lower lid.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes eye lash extensions unnecessary.  The best mascara ever! Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Earlier versions of this product were better with more lash build up/fibers. This is still good but not the best like it was previously. Seems to be on the drier side.</li>
    <li> Did not like bc the second time i bought the product, the content inside was dry.  I called and they said it was bc it was cold.  Everytime I have to use it I have to let it sit in warm water first.  Just a pain in the neck...</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look so long and thick.  Remember to start at the base and just a little on the ends of the eyelashes, otherwise it gets too clumpy.</li>
    <li> Just did the whole market, got to the car to discover I had black tubes all over my eyes. Moist, sticky day, but honestly!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this but it does not meet my expectation. Too expensive for the value. Overestimated, I guess. I personally prefer having a common mascara we could find easily at Target. I paid too much for it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great to layer. One application and you have natural looking defined lashes, but keep applying it and you could get a really clean smokey look. I don&#x27;t love the price as much but I still gave it 5 stars because I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump and it has a small applicator brush that I can control easily and reach even the smallest of my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t leave raccoon eyes either or flake. I want to say that it&#x27;s water proof, but when you get out of the water, it&#x27;s almost like you don&#x27;t have any mascara on. You never even notice that it&#x27;s coming off because like I said before, it doesn&#x27;t run. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th or 5th tube of this mascara.  I will NEVER use anything else.  This past summer this product was hard to come by.  It was sold out or on back order on most websites.  I was thrilled when I thought to look a gain a few weeks ago.  The free shipping makes the $25/tube more digestible - for my husband at least.  I would pay double that for this mascara that is how wonderfully it works.</li>
    <li> The best for contact wearers and serious blinkers!</li>
    <li> I love the length I get with this mascara, but it does dry out quickly and needs to be replaced more frequently than other mascaras. I may not buy it again as I am wasting so much product. After it dries out in tube, it is totally useless.</li>
    <li> Wears incredibly well, comes off easily at end of day. Best of all, I am very sensitive to many mascaras and this one doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Very similar to Trish Mcevoy but less expensive.  Actually, I like this brand better.  It went on with less clumps and lasted longer than my Trish did.</li>
    <li> It does not leave the smudges under the eye and that is great. However, since it does dry quickly and it tends to clump, plan to quickly use a lash comb to get a smooth effect.</li>
    <li> So I must be missing something. I got the mascara yesterday, tried it yesterday and today and had the same problem. My eyelashes stuck together, no matter how I tried to apply it. How is this not happening to everyone else? It was brand new, not dry at all, but I just couldn&#x27;t get my eyelashes to separate. I had to use a different brush to separate them. At this price, it&#x27;s ridiculous. I hope everyone else will have better luck.</li>
    <li> This mascara is tubing mascara which I really like, the formula is good, and it washes very easily. There are problems with the spindle as it is VERY prone to clumping. It is misleading to call this product Volume Mascara. This really does not add any volume. Compared to other mascaras this is just slightly above average on lengthening and below average on volume or thickening. I have tried just about every mascara [in my quest to make my average or below lashes dramatic]. I would recommend this to someone with thick or plentiful lashes who just needs deep black mascara that washes easily and gives some length. Have a lash brush ready to de-clump.</li>
    <li> Best mascara on market</li>
    <li> After the raving reviews that I heard on QVC and read on Amazon about this product, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I gave up wearing mascara because I couldn&#x27;t stand the clumping, flaking, etc.  My eyelashes are thick and very straight.  This mascara did curl them a little, but it clumped.  I had to take Q tips and unclump my lashes.  It also flacked.  I had black dots on my face.  What can I say?  It&#x27;s just another yucky, messy mascara.  It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Delivery was expedient (Prime is awesome..) Wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; effect but I think it lengthens better than many other mascaras I&#x27;ve used. I do find after a long day my eyes feel as if they are getting flakes in them but we&#x27;re talking really long day - 14+ hours. I like the smaller brush, makes application easier, especially since I an left side challenged when applying makeup... :)</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to be a brand new tube of mascara. It was not just dry.  The tube had absolutely no product in the tube. I don&#x27;t understand how this could happen.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful!  i love it!  Kevyn is amazing!  You have to swipe the brush onto the tube to get the excess mascara off before applying!!!  i usually do this with any mascara I use though.  If you don&#x27;t it will give you &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34;.  As long you get the excess off the brush you&#x27;ll NEVER stop using this mascara!  it&#x27;s wonderful if you use it with his eye lash curler!</li>
    <li> This will be your last mascara. I promise. It&#x27;s that amazing!! A little pricey, sure, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Simply no other mascara out there like it!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 15 years and refuse to use anything else!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product. I am a hard core female athlete who works as a trainer. By the end of a very sweaty work day, instead of the usual raccoon eyes I had with other mascaras this one didn&#x27;t flake, smear or budge. Easy to wash off also which I find amazing. A bit pricey but worth every penny.</li>
