      <li>and I was told your skin looks so good.  </li>
      <li>loved it.</li>
      <li>honestly it didn&#x27;t work all that great for me..</li>

      <li>This soap evens skin tone right off the bat, clears acne and leaves your skin perfectly balanced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and love it!</li>
      <li>Ok, that was it!</li>
      <li>It is also absolutely AMAZING.</li>
      <li>its amazing</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING, A MIRACLE....</li>
      <li>Your face feels amazing after you wash with this product</li>
      <li>but it has done amazing things to my skin.</li>
      <li>Amazing results.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending the money, it&#x27;ll probably be effective for most people.</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow the directions and rub your hands together until you get a nice foam.</li>
      <li>It does have a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits, if anything it is making me break out more.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and it lathers very nicely.</li>
      <li>I love Cor Silver.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I went to so many skin doctors and nothing they gave me work.</li>
      <li>For the price and the reuslts you are better off just buying a bar of cetaphil</li>
      <li>Have been using it for more than a month now but don&#x27;t see any improvements on acne or acne scars.</li>
      <li>THIS soap it does what it saids it will do and even more.</li>
      <li>The 10% BP wash works better than Cor, so I just stick to using Cor on my face and the 10% BP wash whenever I break out</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>but it will give you better skin for sure if used correctly as per mfg</li>
      <li>i LOVE this soap.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels after cleansing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell was okay.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I realized that this was just a gimmick, my acne never got better, and all I seemed to be doing was drying out my skin.</li>
      <li>I love this soap and will purchase again.  </li>
      <li>People compliment me on my complexion, which I think looks more even with less-noticeable pores.  </li>
      <li>While some had better results than others, none of them can compare to Cor.  </li>
      <li>if you either wash your face twice with this, or make sure your makeup is cleared off with something else first and then let this sit on your face for a good couple minutes.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and many of my friends now use and love!</li>
      <li>this is my first time try this product ,honestly it works so well on my skin ,I think I will keep trying it .</li>
      <li>It causes my skin to turn bright red and flake about once a month, and most of the treatments for this condition cause cystic acne.</li>
      <li>because she knows I&#x27;m cheap.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not a product</li>
      <li>A fabulous naturally-derived  cosmeceutical product.</li>
      <li>Even using it just once a day, my skin looks fabulous...</li>
      <li>The size is 1.6 oz or 30 g to be precise.</li>
      <li>I got the smallest size available of the cor silver soap.</li>
      <li>Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar is also nice which costs about $5.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping to see something for what I paid, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This product is incredible, I am a frequent buyer and I would recommend this product to anyone with cystic acne, it does dry the skin a bit if you use too much but its a great product, I would definitely advice on giving it a shot, its great for body acne as well.</li>
      <li>The plastic case makes it super easy to throw in my cosmetic bag for travel or trips to the gym.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t help myself, I&#x27;m so excited and relieved to see my acne improve this drastically and in this amount of time.</li>
      <li>My skin is no longer flaky and is more consistent in tone and type.</li>
      <li>I can get my skin clean with a $7 bottle of Cetaphil which is one of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>right there shows its working!</li>
      <li>For me, since I adore greasy foods and like to splurge, my skin is always super shiny oily, and it was even with this soap.  </li>
      <li>soap is mild, soothing and after two months I see a difference already.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but this soap is worthy.  </li>
      <li>Subsequent uses will leave your skin squeaky clean, (but not dry), free of even the toughest makeup, and with a beautiful glow.</li>
      <li>I assume most would pay whatever to have clear skin!</li>
      <li>This really has lessened the appearance of the fine acne along my jawline.</li>
      <li>I have an auto immune disease that attacks the skin and muscle and wanted to try something to calm the redness on my face.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, but I don&#x27;t want to waste this much money on nice smelling soap that doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This soap may seem a bit on the pricey side but it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used many products purported to clear acne including Proactiv, clearasil, Olay blemish control and clinique.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 48 yr old woman with a youthful appearance (blessed with good genes and oily skin :) that has quite unexpectedly and recently experienced a breakout on my face, shoulders and upper back area (I never get acne on my back or shoulders).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to clear the breakout including many high end products without any success.</li>
      <li>suggest trying the mini bar first if you are sceptical.</li>
      <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t promote itself as a cure or treatment for this condition, but it does exactly that.</li>
      <li>dont get discouraged if you break out at first...</li>
      <li>This soap is pretty $$$</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t always feel dry after I wash with it, but if it does I just put a little avocado oil on my face and that makes it feel perfect.</li>
      <li>My skin never looked as good with Cor soap as it does cleaning my skin with oil, just wished I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money.</li>
      <li>Just look at all the positive reviews</li>
      <li>When I first started using this it really transformed my skin.  </li>
      <li>This soap did not make it dry, flaky, or cause more breakouts.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like a large gumball)</li>
      <li>use it properly, make some foam, put it on and leave it on for two minutes, and finely, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks .</li>
      <li>I got it from &amp;#34;spaspa&amp;#34; seller, and its the real deal soap.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>It leaves your face feeling really clean and not dry or taught.</li>
      <li>I feel like it really makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Really doesn&#x27;t work like a miracle soap like every one said.</li>
      <li>you want something that really gets rid of acne you might try the Oil Cleansing Method -</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t justify the price for this because I really didn&#x27;t notice much.  </li>
      <li>Yes, really.</li>
      <li>and i dont mean just break out wise</li>
      <li>It has worked better than any other product I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I literally cannot live without it!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only soap I will use on my face.</li>
    <li> MIRICLE WORKER. IT IS GOOD FOR ALL SKIN TYPES &amp; CONDITIONS.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, always the best and came on time!</li>
    <li> Cor Silver soap is expensive, yes. It is also absolutely AMAZING. It&#x27;s all you need too. It takes off make up, eye make up everything with no side effects. I have truly sensitive skin. This soap evens skin tone right off the bat, clears acne and leaves your skin perfectly balanced. The medium sized bar lasts 4 months being used twice a day. You just rub it in your hands for a second and spread the foam on your face (eye area too), wait 3 minutes and then swirl it around on your skin for a sec and rinse. No need for moisturizer at night either (unless you have really dry skin). It&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest trying the mini bar first if you are sceptical. That is what I did. Then I HAD to have the bigger bar. I can&#x27;t live without it anymore. I am 43 btw and it really took a few years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this it really transformed my skin.  Then one day I used it morning and night and the next day my skin broke out and became very dry in certain areas.  I have sense taken a break and I now only use this once or twice a week and only once that day.  I brought this months ago and I still have quite a lot left.  As I get my face and hands wet then rub the dry soap over my face to create my desired lather.  I then replace the soap back into it&#x27;s container.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for less then a week and it has done wonders! Typically when using a new product breaking out is common, couple that with it being the prime time of the month for a break out (you know what I mean Ladies)and its amazing this soap has kept my face soft and clear! It actually cleared up the existing irritation I had! My husband comments on the changes he see&#x27;s in my face and that right there shows its working! I know its expensive but its worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I feel like it really makes a difference in my skin.  A nice even complexion!  Would highly recommend and many of my friends now use and love!</li>
    <li> I have an extremely difficult to manage skin condition called seborrheic dermatitis. It causes my skin to turn bright red and flake about once a month, and most of the treatments for this condition cause cystic acne. I also get it at the base of my skull (another name for this disease is &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34;).  This soap doesn&#x27;t promote itself as a cure or treatment for this condition, but it does exactly that. Following the directions, I work up a decent lather and let it rest on my face for about three minutes. Before getting in the shower, I pay a little extra attention to the flaking areas, using my fingers to rub in a gentle circle, and also place it at the base of my skull. After the soap is rinsed off, I feel a slight tingling sensation, and follow with a basic redness reducing moisturizer. Now I&#x27;m never without this soap, and I buy the small travel size when I&#x27;m short on money. Don&#x27;t forget to get a soap dish -- otherwise, this evaporates and loses its efficacy.</li>
    <li> this soap is incredible. my friend recommended it to me, knowing that i struggle from occasional annoying break outs, and the first time i tried it it made me break out, and i got discouraged. i decided to try it again one day when i woke up with a few blemishes, and i did notice that my skin began to break out as soon as i used the soap. this however is normal, because it is pulling all of the bad stuff beneath the surface out in order for it to work. i gave it a chance for a couple of weeks, and my skin is absolutely flawless. and i dont mean just break out wise, i mean the condition and look of it is just amazing. even skin tone, so soft to touch, scars diminishing almost entirely...i LOVE this soap. i will never stop using it. dont get discouraged if you break out at first...stick through the couple of weeks until your skin adjusts and i promise you will not regret it. youll have more beautiful skin than ever before. LOVE COR SOAP!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING, A MIRACLE.... LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have used many products purported to clear acne including Proactiv, clearasil, Olay blemish control and clinique.  While some had better results than others, none of them can compare to Cor.  My friend gave me a sample-size bar (which by the way lasted over a month!) because she knows I&#x27;m cheap.  Within 3-4 days, the pimples I had were clearing up.  Now, I don&#x27;t have any.  None.  People compliment me on my complexion, which I think looks more even with less-noticeable pores.  I agree that this is expensive soap, but to me it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and the results are dramatic.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this product and I was hesitant at the prize, but when I used it, WOW!! I would recommend this product to anyone that has oily or combination skin.</li>
    <li> To all you out there who are yet to try this soap.THIS soap it does what it saids it will do and even more.I am african american i have been suffering from adult acne for about 4 years.I tried everything from pills to creams even chemical skin peels. I went to so many skin doctors and nothing they gave me work. Spent lots of money it was so bad i would get depressed and would not go out.BUT i am happy to say does days are now over!!! I have only been using it for about three months but it as work mircles on my skin!!!.So to all you who are thinking about trying this soap Please do i promise you wont be disappionted it work a mircle of me and it will do the same for you i will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is incredible soap.  It not only cleans your face but it makes your skin glow and clearer at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for five weeks now and I tell everyone about it. I have stopped using everything else but eye cream. Clears 15+ years of bad skin. Hereditary acne. Wow. As long as it keeps working I will never be without it. CLEAR after 4 days. The second week blackheads everywhere! What?! Dried and gone by the third week. 4th week clear with a few small and I mean small hormonal blemishes. But, they didn&#x27;t stay they didn&#x27;t get bigger and dark acne scars are gone. I really cant say enough. Amazing results. Who cares about the money. I will save up and buy the big one next.  I assume most would pay whatever to have clear skin!</li>
    <li> I love Cor Silver. My skin is no longer flaky and is more consistent in tone and type. I have a &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; that is less extreme now. Another thing I love is if I do get a cold sore or blemish, Cor seems to heal them very quickly. Make sure you follow the directions and rub your hands together until you get a nice foam. It leaves your face feeling really clean and not dry or taught. People say is pricey but I am saving a lot of money because you don&#x27;t need a toner and the soap lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and love it!</li>
    <li> This soap is very drying, so I can only use it once a day.  It does have a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits, if anything it is making me break out more.  I would not buy it again, not worth the price.</li>
    <li> A fabulous naturally-derived  cosmeceutical product. I love the way my skin feels after cleansing. Love the scent. Gotta get yours!</li>
    <li> I love this soap and will purchase again.  I purchased the 1.05 oz just to try after seeing it on the Today Show.  I have an auto immune disease that attacks the skin and muscle and wanted to try something to calm the redness on my face.  Last night we went out for dinner with relatives and I was told your skin looks so good.  Which I haven&#x27;t heard in a long time.  People always thought I was sunbathing because of the redness on my face.  It felt so good to hear this compliment after battling this disease for two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is mild, soothing and after two months I see a difference already.  The small size has lasted longer than I anticipated and will probably last four months.  So really $10.00 a month isn&#x27;t bad for a product that you see positive results from.  I use it at night before I go do bed.  It takes off my makeup without stinging my eyes. All I can say is this is a great product and you won&#x27;t be sorry you splurged on it.  Just look at all the positive reviews and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> introduced COR Soap from a friend, look forward to trying it out  and see the transformation of my skin. Hope it help my jaw line acne.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than a month now but don&#x27;t see any improvements on acne or acne scars. When I read other reviews I had started to believe that this product works but then it&#x27;s not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> The size is 1.6 oz or 30 g to be precise. It works better than other expensive soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Its not a cure all for bad skin ( Acne, Rosacea but it will give you better skin for sure if used correctly as per mfg instructions.&lt;br /&gt;To use it properly, make some foam, put it on and leave it on for two minutes, and finely, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful where you buy if from, a lot of fakes out there. I got it from &amp;#34;spaspa&amp;#34; seller, and its the real deal soap.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this soap based on reviewers comments and have been blown away by the results.  I&#x27;m a 48 yr old woman with a youthful appearance (blessed with good genes and oily skin :) that has quite unexpectedly and recently experienced a breakout on my face, shoulders and upper back area (I never get acne on my back or shoulders). I&#x27;ve tried everything to clear the breakout including many high end products without any success. Desperate, I kept looking for a new wonder product and stumbled across this soap. I&#x27;ve been using the soap on my face and back for three days and the difference is unbelievable.  I do have discoloration left but it&#x27;s only been 3 days and I have not gotten one new blemish and the discoloration is fading incredibly fast.  I have suffered from mild cystic acne for about 8 years during my cycle and a cyst I had acquired last month  has almost completely disappeared. The cyst had reduced in size but it had definitely been hanging on.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope I&#x27;m not writing this review too soon but I couldn&#x27;t help myself, I&#x27;m so excited and relieved to see my acne improve this drastically and in this amount of time. I have spent so much for very little results, this soap is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Yes, really. I have been on the fence about this soap for years. I&#x27;ve  really wanted to try it, but I thought it was too expensive for a relatively small soap. Finally, I decided to try the trial version. Ok, that was it! I HAD to have the larger version. As some previous reviewers have noted, there may be a slight Initial breakout associated with the first couple of uses. But persevere! Subsequent uses will leave your skin squeaky clean, (but not dry), free of even the toughest makeup, and with a beautiful glow. I have integrated the soap into my daily regimen in the evenings, figuring that a once a day use and proper care of the soap (drying it before putting it back in the case) will prolong it&#x27;s life. Even using it just once a day, my skin looks fabulous...no blemishes, tighter pores, and I swear I look younger. All this from a soap! What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from adolescent (now adult) acne for several years and have tried just about every product under the sun with very limited success. Cor Silver Soap works pretty well, at least better than any other over-the-counter acne treatment I have tried. I don&#x27;t think it is strong enough to tackle severe acne, as I still use 10% benzoyl peroxide wash on trouble areas other than my face. The 10% BP wash works better than Cor, so I just stick to using Cor on my face and the 10% BP wash whenever I break out elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product but not perfect. If you don&#x27;t mind spending the money, it&#x27;ll probably be effective for most people.</li>
    <li> This soap is expensive but so worth it!  It clears my skin and does not strip it or leave me dry.  When I travel, I skip the 20 things I usually use on my skin and bring just this and I am none the worse for it!</li>
    <li> I started using Cor soap about a year and a half ago after trying all different varities of acne fighting soaps, none of which worked.  This soap has cleared up all acne problems.  I was initially put off by the price, but when I considered the cost of various acne products which I was having to regularly buy, it turned out that this is less or equally as expensive as those products.  One 1.05 oz bar lasts 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Best soap i have ever used and Amazon offers best pricing!</li>
    <li> this is my first time try this product ,honestly it works so well on my skin ,I think I will keep trying it . thanks .</li>
    <li> I bought this for the reviews I was reading.  It does last awhile, that is if you don&#x27;t slather alot of it at a time in your washings.  I did notice that when it got on my palms and I rinsed it off, it felt like it stripped the oil from my palms much like some harsh dish washing detergents.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face and initially it burns in some spots.  I can&#x27;t justify the price for this because I really didn&#x27;t notice much.  I can get my skin clean with a $7 bottle of Cetaphil which is one of my favorites.  Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar is also nice which costs about $5.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping to see something for what I paid, but I didn&#x27;t. For me, since I adore greasy foods and like to splurge, my skin is always super shiny oily, and it was even with this soap.  About 10 minutes after it is washed, its back oily again.  When I eliminate greasy foods, it is not as oily and clears despite what soap I use.  Maybe it works for some, but I doubt I will purchase this $$$ bar again.</li>
    <li> honestly it didn&#x27;t work all that great for me.. had more break outs unfortunately and switched to a different brand</li>
    <li> I got the smallest size available of the cor silver soap. I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and it barely looks used. If you use it as instructed and just rub it a little (I rub the soap on my hand with a little water maybe 7-10 times then put it down) then rub your hands together and form a rich lather it will last a very long time. Since stopping hormonal birth control about exactly one year ago my skin has been very unpredictable and would get all sorts of acne, tons of small bumps but big cysts on my chin and sometimes my nose. This stuff works great. It seriously helps my pigmentation scars and when I use it after not using for a couple of days I notice a drastic improvement. I think it works especially well if you either wash your face twice with this, or make sure your makeup is cleared off with something else first and then let this sit on your face for a good couple minutes. Your face will be squeaky clean, and if you do it in the shower I think the steam really helps it loosen up the dead skin. Overall I always notice a difference when I use it after I&#x27;ve stopped for a couple days out of laziness or whatever, and it has helped more than any other product so far with smoothing out my skin and evening my skin tone. My face doesn&#x27;t always feel dry after I wash with it, but if it does I just put a little avocado oil on my face and that makes it feel perfect.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t work like a miracle soap like every one said. Cleaned my face but that was about it. Didn&#x27;t stop adult acne, didn&#x27;t shrink pores or get rid of wrinkles like other ppl&#x27;s reviews claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell was okay. For the price and the reuslts you are better off just buying a bar of cetaphil</li>
    <li> Your face feels amazing after you wash with this product</li>
    <li> This soap may seem a bit on the pricey side but it is worth every penny. My skin was breaking out really bad and everything I tried either made it worse or completely dried out my skin and made it flaky. This soap did not make it dry, flaky, or cause more breakouts. The soap is a bit bigger than the size of a gumball and with daily use it lasted over a month! Don&#x27;t let the size of this soap fool you, it will last a long time if cared for properly. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell of  it, but I love it, it&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. The plastic case makes it super easy to throw in my cosmetic bag for travel or trips to the gym.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible, I am a frequent buyer and I would recommend this product to anyone with cystic acne, it does dry the skin a bit if you use too much but its a great product, I would definitely advice on giving it a shot, its great for body acne as well.</li>
    <li> Love it. It does as advertised. Lasts for months.</li>
    <li> This soap is pretty $$$ but it has done amazing things to my skin. I will only use this during the summer as it is a little too drying for my skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> After 2 small bars and one of these &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; bars (you would be amazed at how SMALL this thing is!! it&#x27;s like a large gumball) I realized that this was just a gimmick, my acne never got better, and all I seemed to be doing was drying out my skin. It smells nice, but I don&#x27;t want to waste this much money on nice smelling soap that doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that really gets rid of acne you might try the Oil Cleansing Method - it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not a product and you can do it with stuff you get from the supermarket. My skin never looked as good with Cor soap as it does cleaning my skin with oil, just wished I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but this soap is worthy.  I started using it over 3 years ago while suffering with acne and after having tried everything...prescription drugs and drugstore products.  I came across this and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I literally cannot live without it!  It has worked better than any other product I have ever tried.  Though not a miracle as some claim, it&#x27;s the closest thing to it in my books.</li>
    <li> This really has lessened the appearance of the fine acne along my jawline. The scent is fresh and it lathers very nicely. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
