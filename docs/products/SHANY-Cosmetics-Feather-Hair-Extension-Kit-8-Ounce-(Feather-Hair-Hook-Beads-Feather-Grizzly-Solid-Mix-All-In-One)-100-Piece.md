<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think they are cute. I actually got them for a birthday present for a 7 year old. wish they were easier to use</li>
    <li> Just got this set delivered today.  It is perfect!  I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  She has been wanting a feather extension for a VERY long time she will be thrilled with more than 30 to choose from!! It is just what I have been looking for.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! And fulfilled through Amazon so add a couple of other items to your cart and you are all set with Free shipping!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the tool in this item. i love the beads and SOME of the feathers. most of the feathers in this bundle are cheap. however i love the tool and the beads it came with. some of the feathers can be used, but i would not use them on humans. lol. i put them in my dog&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s SO CUTE! i don&#x27;t have to worry about putting an expensive feather in my dog&#x27;s hair. so i probably wouldn&#x27;t buy any feathers from them again, unless i run out of ones for my dog :P i would however buy the tool and beads again.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;the items were not as I expected them to be. I expected Feathers that I could use in the hair. I could not use these in hair, they are hard, crumbly and partly broken. There are synthetic \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; that I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all, and not listed in the description. The hook that came with it works great, and the beads are fine, but the feathers are a waste of money\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The package arrived 2 days earlier than expected.  Product was nicely packaged.  Feathers were in good condition and there are a TON of them (just as pictured).  Beads work nicely.  Just need your own crimpers or use pliers!  :)  went on super easy and look great.</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy and small, I do not recommend buying these (even for first time users). There are others for the same price that are better (fuller, better quality) than this!</li>
    <li> I ordered these and gave them to my Daughter.  She was buying feathers and other things like these and to be honest they just didn&#x27;t look as good as these did in the ad. I thought she would enjoy this set.  She really liked this set very much. First it came with a tool which made it much easier to install the feathers. They last much better and look very good. Second theren  was a lot of variety to choose from. She said she has recieved a lot of compliments on the set and she really likes the variety she got with it.  So I would recommend this set.  LINDA W</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this product, not so much for myself but for my teenage daughter. These are easy for her to put in her hair and everything she needs is combined in the package. The feathers are in vibrant colors which stand out nicely in her dark hair and match almost anything she pulls out of her closet. I would recommend these for teens or younger women. I guess they would be ok for the wild older woman too!</li>
    <li> I love this hair extension, they look so fun and easy to wear, and you have a lot of styles and colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> i got this kit as a gift but i wanted to make a review ok first off i love it and the reasond why is because bright color are in season right now and my liitle cousins love it too. i just wished that they were real feathers instead of synthetic, but other than that i love them</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a great way to add a creative twist to your hair whether it be in bold ways or not. Very versatile.</li>
    <li> My neice bought this product for herself and I tried a few and loved it! Very cute and can be used every day! Lovely</li>
    <li> Great colors to choose from.  Would make a great gift for any trendy girl. The price is amazing for all the different options you can choose from.</li>
    <li> Nice good colors as expected</li>
    <li> Extremely difficult to put in. Maybe if you have someone that can help you or an extreme amount of patience.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews. But I knew I made a mistake just by picking up the box. There is only one hook, &amp;&amp; they get you by stating \\&quot;100 piece set.\\&quot; This was going to be a christmas present, but seeing the product in person is such a set back. Feathers look 150% fake, They&#x27;re waaay to short &amp;&amp; on top of that all tangled up. Save your money &amp; go to a salon.</li>
    <li> I love the new hair feather trend and have been looking for inexpensive feathers so that I can keep changing them. This packet is awesome! Comes with lots of feathers in different sizes and colors. I also comes with the applicator and crimp beads to secure it. Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love them! Almost all of the feathers are undamaged, and good quality. I bought them for my friends and I because we love them, but $10 for one done by someone else didn&#x27;t seem as good or fun. So $13 for a bunch plus the fun of doing it ourselves was way worth it. Came with everything that is listed. And came with enough beads to last quite some time. Overall, very happy.</li>
    <li> Though I have never tried this product before, let me tell you that I would certainly buy it because it allows a real scope of creativity and fashion.  Now I wouldn&#x27;t have to ruin my hair by dying it, or by using certain dyes that would take forever to grow out.  I would simply use one of these, and have great hair, and no one will know that it is an extension.  That is the beauty of this product.  In fact, I will buy it soon because I am so impressed by it.</li>
    <li> We all know fads come and go.  The feather in the hair trend is pretty big right now.  This is an inexpensive way to try out the trend without gluing things in your hair thus damaging it and without breaking your bank.  The colors are fun and you get different type feathers/sizes.  It&#x27;s a great starter kit for those who like to rock a fun look.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SET!! THE FEATHERS ARE VIBRANT AND VERY DURABLE!! I BOUGHT THESE AS A GIFT AND IM SURE MY COUSIN WILL LOVE THEM!! I DID SNEAK AND OPEN THEM TO TEST ONE OUT AND I FELL IN LOVE!! I HAVE TO COME BACK AND REPURCHASE!!</li>
    <li> The feathers are so soft, flexible, and durable. beautiful colors. it has even a better  quality than other expensive sets do in the market.</li>
    <li> Totally unimpressed! The synthetic feathers are poor quality, the real feathers were all stiff as could be or thick as a piece of yarn. They claim to inspect so each is like the picture but not one of my poor quality feathers i recieved looks anything like the picture. Not one of them is striped, one of the feathers was literally an inch and a half AND the tool came bent. If i hadnt purchased this with a gift card i threw away i would demand my money back! Dont buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday. Her and her friends went crazy when she opened them up. Mom made them wait until after the party to mess with them (she was having a sleep-over) so she reluctantly put them away. After the party my sister immediately came to me with the package. I got stuck feathering everyone&#x27;s hair. When the other girls&#x27; mother&#x27;s saw their hair the next day they freaked out, so I also had to undo a lot of them. They were very easy to put in and take out. I was reminded of how much I hate children and pretentious parents but also how much I love my sister.</li>
    <li> These are way better then the salon feathers, and they last longer and are 10xs cheaper. They are extreamly easy to apply and remove</li>
    <li> The long ones are really nice.  Some of the short feathers are really really short, and some of the medium ones are super skinny.  However, they do look good when you put a few together.</li>
    <li> there was only half the bead + feathers? i am not grateful because i pay for the prize and didn&#x27;t receive what i was expecting</li>
    <li> These hair extensions are a great way to spruce up your look! The extensions are versatile and fun!! They are a fun look for me and are age appropriate for all ages. They are something new and exciting for my daughter to wear but also still mature enough that I can wear them too. Great investment when you are looking for a new way to change up your hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally not one for extensions, feathers, etc. BUT, I wanted a change, and decided to buy this kit. Seeing as I had no idea what I was doing when the package arrived, I thought this would be super-hard! But as I later found out, it was quite easy with the tools provided, and your selection of colors is great! A must-have for anyone trying to do something cute and chic to their own hair!</li>
    <li> I like the product...you get more than you pay for...just be careful because you can&#x27;t straighten the hair it isn&#x27;t real..other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This product is great! The colors are bold and they are so soft! This is a great buy for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Wow for $12 you get 100? I go to the store and pay $3 for one. So that&#x27;s really great price. Now of course you probably would only wear these if you&#x27;re younger so the colors are very diverse and you can have fun mix-matching and doing whatever. And it really looks like its part of your hair, I had some which had a clip sticking out of my hair which wasn&#x27;t so great....</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a similar feather hair extension kit from Etsy a month or so ago and paid $70... At $12.99 you can&#x27;t beat this kit! Not all the feathers are long and I won&#x27;t be able to use everything they sent, but you still can&#x27;t beat the price for what you can use. I made cluster extensions layering some of the shorter feathers with the longer extension alternatives... They were beautiful and my girls love them! I would and will purchase this again :)</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this product is because I needed to watch a few videos on YouTube to figure out how to do it  -  Once I did, it was easy to do - But, they come in a teeny tiny bag with no instructions, at all.  Also - the tiny feathers are useless.  You also need to remember to have your own needle nose pliers or similar tool to use, as they do not provide that.</li>
    <li> Item description claims it is a starter set.  There were NO INSTRUCTIONS.  Emailed the seller NO RESPONSE. Disappointed in what is included in the 100 pieces.</li>
    <li> I must say I was expecting something a little different.  When you look at the picture it looks like you are getting two hooks, but you are not, if I would have read closer I would have seen that lol.  The single colored feathers are almost unusable,(2nd pic from right and 6th pic from left) they feel fake, hard, and brittle, like you could snap them.  The other feathers that are not fake hair like, do feel nice and I will use those, not sure about the single tone ones mentioned in last sentence yet.  The beads are nice, they look like the ones the girl at the salon used when I got them done professionally.  I for some reason also thought the longer \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; would actually be feathers and not synthetic hair, which I guess is my own fault, since I did not fully understand what grizzly feathers ment lol.  I do not mind them but do worry about how easy they might be to tangle.  I also wish they came with some sort of instructions, even if it was just a picture diagram, since I have had some put in before I know how or at least understand the basic concept and can figure it out, but if you never have before you might not have a clue how to or where to start.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter as she was excited about doing her own hair feather extensions. What a scam. The \\&quot;kit\\&quot; consists of a few feathers, no beads (as pictured), no insertion tool (also as pictured), and far fewer feathers and feather types than is shown. What a sham. Very disappointed that Amazon would allow a merchant like this on their site as a long time Prime member. Be warned and please look elsewhere to save yourself the trouble of a disappointed little girl.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for feather extensions for a quite a while and I know if I search for it, I&#x27;ll find it at reasonable price and here I am :D  I did buy it for my sister  but she is not really generous   so now im here bying me and my bbf another pack :&gt;  Some colors are bright and visible within the hair  also brown/matt feathers are good for more natural look  natural looking, they are soft, and easy to use</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet I&#x27;m hoping it would be like really cool and just not a few feathers that would really suck</li>
    <li> LIKE MOST OF THE REVIEWS I TOO ONLY RECEIVED ONE HOOK NO INSTRUCTIONS AND THE MEDIUM LENGTH FEATHERS ARE MORE LIKE PAPER PIECES, THE LONG FEATHERS THOUGH ARE VERY COLORFUL AND PRETTY BUT I HAVEN&#x27;T FIGURED OUT HOW TO PUT THEM IN BECAUSE THE FASTENERS ARE NOT THE ONES I HAVE USED IN THE PAST</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s 9th birthday and she opened the package in the morning and was excited to wear a feather in her hair to school.  Unfortunately there was no hook/tool as mentioned in the instructions and product description.  This made for an unhappy morning as we tried various workarounds (a needle threading tool finally did the trick).  She loves the colors, I love the price (one feather threaded into her hair at the local mall would have been the same price as all the feathers in this package).  It arrived super quick - I just wish the seller would have checked to make sure the hook was in the package as well before shipping it.</li>
    <li> Love them! Put 2 in my daughter&#x27;s hair a week ago and they still look great. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> The Shany Cosmetics Hair Feather kit is an absolutely fantastic product for the price. The kit came with a bunch of feathers of all different colors and sizes as well as some fun colored hair extentions. It also included the beads which are used to go on a small piece of hair and eventually attach the feather to the hair. The beads come in a small bag with black,brown and blonde beads to match your hair. The last thing it came with was a hook and latch type utensil which is used to grab the piece of hair and slide the bead onto the hair, I practiced putting them in my sister and niece&#x27;s hair. The only trouble I had was with the hook and latch because it seemed to keep coming open so it wasn&#x27;t pulling the hair through the bead, but I eventually got it. Other than thatI thought these were great for the price and all the feathers and tools that came with it. I definately have a lot of my friends already going to place an order because you just cant find a deal like Shany Cosmetics with the high quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is basically the coolest trend that is hopping. I know so many people that have feather extensions. This is such a great deal on them!!!!!!!!! I love how there is different sizes depending on your layers or length of hair. Get this if you wanna look cool!!!!</li>
    <li> some feathers are decent, but most i would not put in my hair. I bought these for a party as favors and they did not look nice in girls hair. I ended up throwing away most of them and using what i could.</li>
    <li> Create the hottest on-trend \\&quot;Bohemian Look\\&quot;! This is a great addition to you hair style! You can trim the extensions and even wash them. I love the feather look it&#x27;s so hot now with the earrings &amp; stuff so your hair can look just as cool. Now you can create your own special look. So funky, fun and cool!</li>
    <li> They look perfect. I love them. very good color combination. good quality material and it looks very fancy on my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter really only likes the long ones but her friends like the short ones too.  Soooooo easy to put in and you can wash your hair, curl it, everything without worrying about ruining it.  If you are careful when you remove the little metal things you can even use them again!</li>
    <li> They came in early which made me happy but when I opened the package the feathers where shoved in a small box and bent to hell (unrepairable), the only useful thing was the long hair extensions (which I was also under thee under standing was suppose to be feathers too</li>
    <li> I was a little confused on how to put them in at first, but I figured it out and my kids love, love, love having feathers in their hair!</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you need lots of colors to chose from.I do hair and makeup and it is perfect for everyone lots of concealer to choose from and the lip colors are great.</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I was expecting. I thought the product was going to come as pictured but it did not. Everything was tangled,and the little feathers were really little and they were plastic and stick up. The only thing i liked was the beads and the long grizzly ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my 10yr old and it&#x27;s a tangled mess. there is only one hook and the shorter feathers look like crap. The longer feathers are obviously fake and stuck to each other. plus without the instructions, I will have to google how the heck to get them into her hair. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This product is not what it looks like!!! They are hair and Boris fake feathers with very few very short real feathers. Cheap and worthless!</li>
    <li> Im super happy with these they are so easy to use..You get so many to choose from..The colors are so vibrant and unique.. The price is awesome! Buy these they are so worth it! You will love this kit!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Treishapromua</li>
    <li> Loved the product. I thought that it was a great deal...Feather were in great shape. Came with all the tools needed. Great Product</li>
    <li> When we received this item, the package was open inside of the box, the beads/clips were missing, and we only received less than half of the feathers. My daughter was looking forward to receiving this product but very disappointed with the fact that over half of the product was missing and she had no clips to hold the feathers in her hair. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 9-yr old b&#x27;dday party and the girls all loved it.  Initially I was disappointed when I opened the package... all the \\&quot;medium length\\&quot; feathers were very crisp and not &#x27;feathery.&#x27;  But the other feathers were good and worked great.  My daughter has been wearing hers for about a month now.  In summary, it is a decent set for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is so cute! It&#x27;s a great gift for someone who loves to be fashionable! And it&#x27;s not hard to do at all!</li>
    <li> The feathers are very good quality - soft, flexible so you can fold them as you please and they wont break! you can wash them aand teh colors wont run!!! Worth the proce as usual!</li>
    <li> Feathers are so expensive now a days  sometimes you just can&#x27;t the right length it combination. With this set, its so easy to customize the feather extension you want and you don&#x27;t have to deal with ridiculous prices or the chance of them breaking. feathers are soft and durable and definitely worth the purchase</li>
    <li> these feathers came in 1 day early and i was thrilled!! It had great feathers, but dont count on all of them being as long as your hair. I had a great time with them, and they are really easy to put in hair:D. This was a great buy. I totally recommend for first-time users!(:</li>
    <li> Junk!  My grand girls ended up taking them to school to use as decorations on pencil cans for their favorite teachers!  Save your money!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my kids birthday party. It has a lot of extEnsions that are easy to apply. They find them endlessly entertaining. Good value, simple fun.</li>
    <li> I have yet to try this particular product, I do however have a friend who simply loves wearing feathers in her hair. I think you get a lot of product for your money and I have used other shany cosmetic products before and was very please with them. Another plus is that they do not test on animals!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my younger sisters birthday. While some of the feathers were a little stiff, my sister loved them.  Great product for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter ordered these and was mislead by the \\&quot;100 piece\\&quot; claim.  There are NOT 100 feathers.  This product is cheap looking and should have only cost $5 by comparison to other similar products.  We will be returning it ASAP.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I have bought many different types of feathers over the last two years and these were by far the worst quality. There were no soft short ones in my package. only the really stiff skinny ones. they are hard as a rock. The hair extensions are cute, but they tangle all the time. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I got my first feather a year ago and I wanted a new color, without having to pay an arm and a leg or bleach my hair. The long feathers don&#x27;t work with Curling irons. That for me is a let down because I like to try different styles. The smaller ones colors are pretty, but some are dull. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> So after I got my first salon feather during thanksgiving break, I wanted some other colors with out having to pay crazy salon feather prices. After much research, I chose this kit, because for the price/quantity even if they faded, broke off, etc they were a good deal and I loved the colors. Well when I had to move my original feather up, I slipped one of the fluffy feathers in with it (it was a shade lighter and makes a good contrast in my dark hair :)) and I put one of the the medium sized dark red feathers in on the other side. With my dark hair they looked awesome but I was worried about washing the fluffy feather. Turns out I didn&#x27;t need to be. When it dried out, it was still fluffy and cute. When my cousin came to visit, I put a long orange and the fluffy yellow one in her hair and she loves them. I am totally buying a second kit because  all my friends keep using them :) and the beads are great because you can reuse them if you need to move it up or if you mess up.  But I would recommend that you pay attention to how the feather lays before you put the bead in. I put one in my sisters hair and clamped the bead down right away. It wasn&#x27;t until I took a step back to look at my handy work that I realized the bottom tip of the feather stuck out and away from her hair...it was easy to fix. I undid the bead by clamping down on the bead till it opened a little and slid the feather out. I laid it on my desk to see how it should look with the tip facing down and then picked it up and slid in in exactly like how it was on my desk. It was much better and she loves hers.</li>
    <li> This set makes it so easy to add a little \\&quot;something\\&quot; to your look without any permanent changes.  This kit includes everything you need at a fraction of what salons would cost.</li>
    <li> These feather extensions are adorable. Tons of beautiful colors to choose from. You have a different color for everyday. I&#x27;m buying another one for my cousin. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for a 10 year old girl and she loved it! The girls used it at their slumber party!</li>
    <li> It is so strange This phase of useing the feathers was a fast fad but they loved it while useing this</li>
    <li> These feathers are NOT salon quality and most of them were so short, that I used them on my dog, giving my toy yorkie a fashion trend!</li>
    <li> Great price for what is recieved. Tool is cheap and cant handle much pressure. Every thing else is good. Thanks</li>
    <li> They were good but the packages were opened and stuff. But overall they are neat and very bright and stylish.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal and you really get a bang for your buck! Instead of going to a salon to get the feather extension done and spending like $60 or buying an individual extension from the beauty supply for like $30, I&#x27;d much rather buy this kit. I love the variety of colors and styles and the fact that I&#x27;m not stuck with one feather that I might get tired of within a week. This kit&#x27;s perfect for girls like me who like to change things up and get bored of having the same look from day to day. It&#x27;s great being able to coordinate the feathers with my outfits and it&#x27;s a cute way to add some spunk to my style without going overboard. Another idea is to make all the feather extensions and give them out as gifts to friends, almost like a modern friendship bracelet. I also think it&#x27;d be fun if you have daughters as a little activity at a birthday party or sleep over especially if you have a crafty group of girls! There&#x27;s so many things you can do with this product and the advantages are almost endless, I feel like I could ramble on and on. SHANY really doesn&#x27;t disappoint and this is another great product that anyone can get and be fashionable and trendy without leaving your wallet empty!</li>
    <li> I think the colors are beautiful and the quality is great. This would be cool for party&#x27;s and Halloween.my kids love it I bought these for there sleep over</li>
    <li> The only thing I would like to know is, is this product availabe for Prime or do i have to pay full price for it. I believe that it is worth it from how it looks but does any one know who has prime if i can get it on prime before i buy it???</li>
    <li> I have just received it to day.Well it came without the micro beads and hook tool.Also few feathers were broken .It was not a good quality.Now I have to return it to amazon.So as I wanted to make my 2 daughters happy-it turn to be real disappointing .I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my dog my little poodle &amp;#34;muffin&amp;#34; so easy to apply and so UUUbber cute my dog went from boring to fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to try these types of feathers, but the cost at the salon and even for some of the DIY kits was too high. This kit was a great was to try a few kinds out and was very reasonable price-wise. It took a few tries for me to understand how to use the included tool. Once I figured it out, it really made putting the feathers in so much easier. There were so many feathers, I was also able to put some in my daughters&#x27; friends hair as well.</li>
    <li> This a great item for adding some pizazz to your &#x27;do without having to do any permanent damage or the expense of the salon. Very easy to use and great for your younger girls....</li>
    <li> There are so many items here to choose from, which leaves the versatility open for creating hundreds of looks! And the price?! UNBEATABLE!!</li>
    <li> I used these on a friend as part of a costume.. They&#x27;re bright and good for what you pay for. The only thing I disliked was she wasn&#x27;t fully confident they would stay in. (could have been user error however lol)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I plan on buying for myself sometime soon for a party I have coming up.</li>
    <li> Love the variety you get for the price and there cute to match-up with any outfit! I tried them out just to get a different look before putting actual colored streaks in my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing feathers in my hair for awhile now. This is the best price I have found and great quality too!! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> The product looks nothing like the picture. There were no instruction on how to use the profits. The feathers came out as soon as my daughter put them in. Thank goodness that was just a passing fad.</li>
    <li> My friends aunt owns a clothing store and they brought thier kit so we could get feathers! I thought it  would be fun to get my own so i purchased this one. The only thing that was good about it was the beads and the tool the feathers are very bad quality the long ones are made out of hair and get very ratty and the short ones the feathers it self have started falling of the top and are all bent and broken. I do not recommend this kit after i bought this kit i went to michaels and bought and bought 1000 feathers for 5 dollars now that is a great deel. The people who liked this kit have never seen salon quality feathers!</li>
    <li> I cannot stop raving about these! they are so cheap for so many! if you still feel these are out of your price range,  you could easily split the price with your friends and split the feathers too!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this product and use it with my nieces. The feathers in the package were disappointing and did NOT look anything like the photos in the description.&lt;br /&gt;The ten solid colored feathers, of which I received nine, do in fact feel like straw! These must be the \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; ones another reviewer was talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Also the ten \\&quot;grizzly feathers\\&quot; aren&#x27;t feathers at all, they&#x27;re synthetic hair.&lt;br /&gt;The other \\&quot;fashion\\&quot; and \\&quot;rooster\\&quot; feathers were underwhelming. They were thin, very short, some looked kinked or bald in spots, and did I mention thin? Like dental floss thin. They absolutely did not look like the full feathers in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;The price has also gone down over two dollars since yesterday. I&#x27;m considering returning.</li>
    <li> These are in horrible condition upon receipt. The feathers are STUFFED in this tiny box and are all bent and broken. The grizzly feathers are not feathers at all but synthetic hair with dyed grizzly stripes. the smaller fluffier feathers are just cheapy feathers like the kind you would find in a big cellophane bag at a craft store. The quality was disappointing and certainly not &amp;#34;studio quality as described&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t waste your money, even if its only ten bucks.</li>
    <li> These are not high quality feathers. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the price, but these shed and fall apart easily. They&#x27;re great if you want to wear them for one day only, but to expect to be able to shower with them or wash them like you would the higher end feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these are crunchy/stiff. Not sure what you&#x27;re supposed to do with crunchy/stiff feathers.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying, if you&#x27;re expecting salon quality feathers, this is not for you. It&#x27;s a great deal, the tool and the beads included, but few feathers in the kit were of acceptable salon use. I&#x27;ve been dealing with feathers for a long time, and wanted to finally grab a personal kit. First, the tool included was broken and tarnished. most of the feathers were bad quality, and I had to trim the ones that could be utilized. The tool is salvageable (even when broken) and the beads are great. So, overall, if you have a child wanting to have a beginner hair feathering kit, consider this product as an option, but if you&#x27;re experienced, don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
    <li> The feathers aren&#x27;t made for extensions.  They are just colored feathers.  The colored hair extensions are made from very cheap hair and feel very rough.  The only bright spot in this kit were the beads for attaching in the hair.  The silicone inner makes them grip nicely and they last.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this set and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> WE love this!!  It&#x27;s so easy to apply and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  It comes with everything you need.  Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the long fake feathers.  They look awesome in my long hair.  They are very long so you may have to shorten them which of course would be easy.  That&#x27;s the reason for the 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on them.  The box holds more than what it looks like in the picture and the colors are more rich too.  They&#x27;re lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium size real feathers are so skinny that you have to use two or they will go totally unnoticed (I&#x27;m putting them an inch or so under where my hair parts because I don&#x27;t want the micro bead to show).  It&#x27;s tricky to get two feathers in one microbead but I have managed to do so on the times I tried it.  And they look cute but not near as classy as the long ones, maybe if I had shorter hair that wouldn&#x27;t be the case.  I haven&#x27;t tried the short ones yet.  Really my hair is too long and straight I think for them to look good.  But I&#x27;m so happy I bought this.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Comes in a nice little box, so feathers stay organized with plenty of clasps for the hair too. I like the really long feathers, theyre really easy to put in, look very nice, and are really soft. So much fun to use with my friends, and my niece. The rest of the feathers I&#x27;m not too hot about, theyre kind of stiff and crunchy and short so I&#x27;m kind of confused as to how I can make it work and where to put them in my head. I have bleach blonde hair and I put in the blue and green striped long feathers and I love them. Overall a pretty good purchase.</li>
    <li> got this for my daughter , her daughter, and the neighbor girls. They all had a blast doing each others heair.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  Not impressed. The few feathers in this kit are very short. The other &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; (not sure what the material is) are cheap. Package was also missing beads.  Kind of a pointless kit if you don&#x27;t have the beads to put the &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; in your hair.  Would not recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago and the 2 girls are still wearing the feathers.  They love the variety and switch them out all the time.</li>
    <li> The feathers were super stiff, curled and bent. The hair was like barbie hair and tangled into fuzz just as easily. No instructions and completely useless. All of the reviews that just have 5 stars must be fake because there is no way.....</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for my 12 yr old for Christmas. She really like the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; look that is so trendy right now, but I did not want to shell out the $$$ at a Salon.This kit is affordable and looks really nice. Like another reviewer I received only one hook, but you do not need more than one. I had a stylist review this kit before I purchased it and she said for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, especially for a first time user. Shipped quickly and I got it a few days earlier than expected. Overall a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she loved the trend.When it got here it was a mess.It was tangly,only had one hook, and no beads were included.They didnt even have my order slip.I returned it right away!Dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> does it come with what is in the picture?? i was wonderng because i could not figure out?? and what was it like?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve seen exhorbitant prices for the crimp beads and feathers - like 12.00 for one feather and crimp bead or more than 1 dollar per bead.  This little kit gives it all to you, plus the tool so that you can get started without having to buy the three separately potentially paying three different postage and handling costs.  I think the long artificial feathers are a bit cheesy, true, but I put them in my darling daughter&#x27;s hair and she loves it and we have a bunch left.  I put one in her American Girl doll&#x27;s hair (ral feather, much nicer) and it&#x27;s just so cute.  Truly, for less than the 1/2 the price of getting one in the salon and less than what many folks charge just for one feather and bead, I&#x27;ve got a lifetime supply!  It&#x27;s a great deal and you get exactly what&#x27;s pictured.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Cool feathers! My daughter really likes them. No instructions though.</li>
    <li> This set is JUNK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, they stated that they were REAL feathers. the long ones were nylon fiber barbie hair and arrived in a total rats nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the longer of the short ones (the solid colors)appear to be real, but i dont know if its from the heavy dye, but they crispy. the feathers are unable to open so they are just colorful sticks. absolutely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the two shorter sets are the only pieces I could even use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I have not tired this product yet but from what I can see It seems like it would be great for a beginner to practice with. It comes with a lot of colors and different sizes and comes with a total of 100 pieces in all. To me for that price this seems like a good buy. I havent purchased this yet so this review is only my thoughts on how it looks from what I can see. Maybe in the near future I will have to pick this up for my niece and see how it works.</li>
    <li> I have a teenage daughter and when I showed her these she went crazy about them we will be ordering them.You really cant beat the amount and the different colors and style choices that you get with this set.I have bought Shany products and also[[ASIN:B0061YRVOC Shany Cosmetics Feather Hair Extension Kit, 8 Ounce (100 Piece Feather Hair, Hook, Beads, Feather Grizzly Solid Mix All-In-One)]] have been gifted them as well and I have always been happy with my Items. We look forward to more amazing products from you.</li>
    <li> the feathers are very colorful and it is real easy to match everything that I wear. its great for everyday use when you dont feel like doing your hair.</li>
    <li> These feather extensions are really pretty they come in different colors and make my daughter very happy to wear them to school. She has shown them to all of her friends and now they all want some too.&lt;br /&gt;They fit in perfect as well..</li>
    <li> The look of feathers is so trendy right now and these are nicely made with good coloring. Easy to apply and they look stylish.</li>
    <li> these are so fun to have just to add a bit of color and flare for any reason what-so-ever. Who doesn&#x27;t like a little color and a lot of fun? So easy to use and great to just brighten your day!</li>
    <li> While they feathers are vibrant in color they weren&#x27;t as long as I expected for my hair. The feathers are soft yet 2 feathers tore pretty easily. Wish there was an assortment of colors for the beads, but the colors it came in fit perfectly for my dark brown/black hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with all the colors and different sizes it comes with. EVERYTHING is great and well worth the money! better then other brands out there. High recommend its in trend and any girl or guy would love a little pop in their hair.</li>
    <li> This product is super cute and of the highest quality I have seen on the market. My daughter loved it and I have no complaints. Product is exactly as described and feathers are higher quality than I have seen from other companies!!</li>
    <li> the feathers were very small and scraggly i thought the \\&quot;grizzley\\&quot; feathers would be nicer but no.&lt;br /&gt;the synthetic hair was nice but next time will be ordering something better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit for my daughters 10th birthday and I was so disappointing it came in this huge box with no inventory slip, it had a couple of tangled feathers about 10 beads AND NO CLIP TOOL to attach it to your hair, which was the one major thing I wanted  ...this is not worth the price or the disappointment !!!!!</li>
    <li> These were a hit for my 11 year old niece. She love making things and just recently started adding color extensions to her hair from time to time. I saw this set and thought she&#x27;d have fun with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I told her to go to YouTube. She took the kit and tool and figured out how to use it before even looking online for instructions. So it&#x27;s that easy to use. For me I&#x27;d still need to at least check out You Tube to get an idea of how to use it. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s over the moon happy with them and has already made several.</li>
    <li> i love this feather kit! its so inexpensive and you get salon quality at your fingertips!the feathers are great and so easy to put on!</li>
    <li> It is really inexpensive for 100 pieces comparing to other sets that is out there. These are really cute hair extensions.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this feather and bead kit is okay -- not great, not awful -- for the amount that I spent on it.  It has a lot of feathers and beads, and a hook, but I didn&#x27;t count the items in the package to verify the \\&quot;100 Piece\\&quot; claim due to the fact that our daughter ripped off the wrapping paper, screeched, and sprinted to the nearest mirror.  She came back an hour or so later with approximately 100 feathers and beads in her hair, so I&#x27;m guessing it was pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that these items aren&#x27;t salon quality (in case that is what anyone expects), but would like to add that our 11-yr-old really liked this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think that this product is pretty decent in quality and value.</li>
    <li> I received the product pretty quickly...Yes...the feathers look nice and soft, vibrant colors however...ZERO instructions....they are loose with a hook thing and some beads...not even one stinky drawing on what to do with it...I&#x27;ll have to google or you tube it I guess. BTW... I went onto their website and no instructions at all either. Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> These feathers are such a blast form the past. These were popular in the 80&#x27;s and now back. You get alot of feathers for the price and think of all the different styles you could do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  The kit did not come with directions, the feathers were poor quality, scraggly and in poor shape.  Definitely not a kit for beginners.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! I found it easy to use, and the feathers stayed in place. This is the best color selection and variety that I have seen at this price point.</li>
    <li> I bought these just as an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; item and because it seemed easy to use and cheap. I&#x27;ve had feather extensions before and I know how to use them, but this came with no instructions, so someone who is new to this would really have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;d recommend watching some YouTube videos before getting frustrated. As for the feathers, I really loved the longer ones, they work great with my hair. The smaller skinny ones are very hard and plastic like, so I probably won&#x27;t use those. The fluffy colorful ones seem okay to use. And my set came with plenty of beads. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> My fault -- didn&#x27;t realize they were synthetic. Colors are fun but feel this package of feathers would be more suitable for young girls.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandaughters and they use them and like. I would recommend this product to teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> great gift for a teenage girl in the family</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my daughter and her friend for christmas. They are very easy to put in and the girls love them! They seem to wash well without fading. Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Pkg I received looked just like the pkg shown in seller&#x27;s picture. I didn&#x27;t realized the long ones were going to be fake but oh well its still pretty! Got the right amount of each type of feather. Shipped in a decent amount of time!</li>
    <li> I had feathers before I bought these ones for my friends and they look horrible I would never wear something like this. I did not like them at all. They looked like fake color hair instead of a pretty feather....</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a stylistic and have a lot of teenage clients then you will love this kit. It will come in handy for the ones keeping up with the latest young adult celebrities.</li>
    <li> Good product. Order was processed right away and product shipped quickly. The reason I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars instead of 5, is because when I received the product, they were a little &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; made then the ad lead me to believe. However, the product has held together very nicely and once I started using them they ended up looking just fine.</li>
    <li> So I bought these for my friend and she loves how there a lot of different colors and styles to choose from. At most stores it does cost an arm and a leg to get so much variety. :) Once again Shany delivers are awesome thing for an awesome price</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; come in a variety of qualities - the short ones are quite nice, but honestly look ridiculous when wearing them in the hair. The medium long ones are really really hard and feel a little weird when wearing them, but they are overall acceptable for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The long ones, however, are a joke! They are nothing like feathers - it is simply very cheap, tangled, plastic HAIR - no feathers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bonus - very easy to apply, once you got used to handling that little hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something fashionable that looks pretty and stays in, i would advise you to have it done professionally, at a hair salon. True, it costs a little more money, but the significantly better results are definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; choice for a party-gag, i would assume, but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my seven year old granddaughter, (she actually picked it out online). She does not live near me, so I haven&#x27;t seen it.&lt;br /&gt;When I asked her if she liked it, she said it was \\&quot;awesome\\&quot;.  I had looked in retail stores for hair extensions and they are so expensive, this was a&lt;br /&gt;bargain for a child.</li>
    <li> the product presents very similar to others that i have used in the past but these feathers are much thinner so they do not stay in the crimp beads very well each one i have put in my daughters hair has staid in less then 24 hours</li>
    <li> Hair feathers are a huge trend.When I saw these I got very excited.Putting them together is very very easy.I tried them on my 12 year old, she loved them.When it&#x27;s time to take them out little or no hair is taken out.</li>
    <li> I bought These because of the new trend of people having feathers in their hair and I LOVE them! There&#x27;s so much variety and the short ones are great for me because my hair is short and curly.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst hair feathers I have seen. The short ones are hard as a rock and will catch on fire if you straighten it. The long ones are spread apart like hair and are cheaply made. That tangle in about two seconds. The only reason it gets a rating of one is because the puffy feathers are fine. You really get what you pay for and that&#x27;s a bunch of crap!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t complain about much when it comes to this. I usually just try to work with. But these weren&#x27;t even feathers they were crispy, literally no fluff at all!! There&#x27;s literally nothing I can do with these. Its like I just threw money in the trash, because that&#x27;s where they went because they were that bad!</li>
    <li> These hair extensions are so cute! They make your hair do that much more fun! You get such a variety to choose/switch it up.</li>
    <li> This is a great thing for little grls that want feathers in their hair.  You can do it and they can change them when ever they want.</li>
    <li> My girls love putting these in their hair for a change of pace and get compliments all the time from their classmates and teachers.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a good selection of colors and sizes.  Complete with all the tools needed to add feathers at home.</li>
    <li> This item was so bad.  Some feathers are so fake and VERY stiff.  Other feathers were so paper thin they practically fell apart in your hand.  Seriously, dont waste you money on this product.  There are others out there with REAL feathers with some substance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this a bad review before I&#x27;ve tried them.  I ordered them for 10 yo daughter.  No instructions were included and I don&#x27;t know how to use them.  Help!</li>
    <li> Came with no instructions on how to use, all the feathers are stuck together at the top. No way there are 100 feathers, more like 35 or so. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The long feathers are hair not feathers actual feathers are very short and cheap quality... recieved the day after ordering... will be fun for kids but not salon quality...</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as an extra gift (not requested) for Christmas.  It was well received!  They are definitely nice and I&#x27;m buying another set for her sister.  They both love them.</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted hair extensions, and I was not willing to pay $10 a pop.  So, we watched a video of how to do it, and bought this kit.  She&#x27;s been playing with it for about a month now.  Plenty of different extensions to put in, and changes her colors every so often.  Seems easy to put them in.  A good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this item, it was not in the box with the rest of the items and another item I received was wrong, so 2 items were not there.  Please help.</li>
    <li> Item not as described. I paid 8$ for shipping, and item was trashed in transport. Description of item was far fetched as to what was delivered, not even sure I got all items. Items were strewn about shipping box, and there was not 100 items as claimed. I took pictures of destroy box, and the mess inside.</li>
    <li> a cool way to add a colorful look to your hair, a little color would brighten your look and your day. A good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is simply adorable!!! The quality is much more than I ever expected and very vibrant colors. Very good gift idea...but I would def order 2 sets as you are going to want to keep one for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I purchased these as a gift for a teenage girl and she loved them. There are a variety of colors and different sizes to choose from. They are a little sparse, but they can easily be doubled up to create different styles. A few feathers were bent, but with good styling it is not noticeable.</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this product, the feathers are more for barbies, than humans! Items are not as pictured, may not have been so disappointed is I hadn&#x27;t spent over $20.00 with shipping! Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Super cute! I love feathers and these are so much fun and Shany has some really great colors in this set!</li>
    <li> Product received on time and in excellent condition. Was a present for my granddaughter and she loves it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!! The only ones we didn&#x27;t like in her hair were the 10 solid colors feather hair extensions because they&#x27;re kind of stiff and don&#x27;t blend with her natural hair well. But even if you don&#x27;t use those, you still get your moneys worth. I found them really easy to put in, even on a fidgety 7 year old with super fine hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my self and friends and the photos were VERY misleading all of the products shed and the small feathers faded whithin two days! Will never ever buy this again!</li>
    <li> Not at all as good as we expected.  The long ones are like polyester fibers that frizz up easily and dont last.  THe others are tiny,</li>
    <li> This came on a long plastic covered piece of thin cardboard and looked like something from the dollar store.  There was not a hook in it, nor were there as many feathers as it claimed.  I ordered it for my niece and am having it replaced but the package does not even looking like it is big enough to hold a hook!  I will be very surprised if the replacement arrives with all of the pieces unless it is a completely different kit.</li>
    <li> My Grand daughter loved this product. She is 11 years old &amp; has long brown hair. It was a great gift for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this product, it was cheap,and I don&#x27;t recommend buying this. Feathers are small and the hair is just okay.</li>
    <li> Update 10/1/12  I bought  another one of these for me and I LOVE IT!! I have so much fun getting to put all these fun things in my hair. It really changes up my outfit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my cousin as she was really into the whole feather extensions thing and she loved it. Its so much more practical than having them put in at a salon. I&#x27;ll probably order more</li>
    <li> I got this set for my little niece and she loved it! Beautiful colors and it was a way to show her creativity off! She had so much fun playing with this hair extension set!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new with my hair, but didn&#x27;t want anything permanent. This fits the bill! You can make so many different, unique hair styles with this kit. And best part is? It&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how frustrated I am with this purchase. We have done feather extensions before. This set is pure GARBAGE. All bleed dye when wet. The long ones are synthetics that tangle like doll hair.The real feather ones come in 3 varieties: too short and poufy, too thin and nearly invisible, or bulky stiff feathers that feel like they came off a seagull tail. I made the mistake of promising my 7 yo daughter that if she got her hair cut I would replace her old feather extensions (which looked great after 6 months)with new ones. The old ones were removed, her hair was cut, and then I tried to insert these on the night before school starts. Needless to say there are many tears in my house tonight. I&#x27;m so aggravated. I would give this zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is not something I would use. However, I have two younger nieces that would LOVE this! They are both at the age where this became popular. They would have so much fun trying them all out, and for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting and no instructions! However, my 6 year old will enjoy if I can figure out how to do this.</li>
    <li> my feiance loves it she allways wanted a bunch feathers at once. Thank you again it was worth the money</li>
    <li> My granddaughter (the gift recipient) and I laughed long and hard when we opened it. Looked like it came from the dollar store!  Actually, the same items in the dollar store were worth their purchase price. This was certainly not!</li>
    <li> Product was ok but feathers were packaged with feathers curled up. They need to do different packaging. Was a good thing I knew how to steam and iron them to straighten them.</li>
    <li> The shorter feathers, the beads and the tools are awesome. But the long ones look like really fake bad hair... I would return it, but its a birthday present for my four year old niece, and I don&#x27;t have time to get something else.</li>
    <li> since it was summer i decide to try out the hair feather extension cause they are so in for summer, and i found this shany feather extension kit that was for a great price i had to check it out it came with some many different types and it was so easy to put in and take out and i got to try cool styles, i love it overalll great stuff</li>
    <li> The feathers were not soft at all it&#x27;s like they were sprayed a billion times with hairspray. I didn&#x27;t enjoy it as I was hoping to.</li>
    <li> Looks very cheap. The small 99 cents like package came a ridiculous huge box. Won&#x27;t recommend this at all especially if you are planing to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Once we got the hang of putting then on, it was a blast at the party.</li>
    <li> This is crap - weird hair extensions, NOT feathers. Smaller items were bent and unusable. Essentially purchased for the beads and hook tool.</li>
    <li> This was horrible I was so exited and it came in a big box and there was this skinny little package in it with knotted up extensions the hook things was broken and it didn&#x27;t cone with a manual to know how to put them in it was definitely a waste of time even though it was $9</li>
    <li> Got these for my granddaughters to go into their Christmas stockings. Colorful feathers in a variety of styles and sizes will provide lots of cool looks for these preteens.</li>
    <li> The extension strands are fine and the fatter feathers, but the thinner feathers are mostly useless.  They are hard to add in, see, get destroyed easily.  The metal holders if you try to use them more then once will not work, so don&#x27;t plan on that, you would need to buy extra if you are going to reuse the extensions.  After crimping and uncrimping the circular clamps the metal will flake since it&#x27;s a sheer/tin base.  Kit works for occasional use.</li>
    <li> This is a cute kit I bought for my little girl. She was happy with it so I guess thats all that matters. There appears to be a lot more pictured in the kit or I expected bigger feathers anyway. The grizzly hair extentions are fine and are the best part of the kit. The actual feathers are very thin and short, not very good at all. There is a few feathers that are just ok but they are to hard and stiff to wear. The rest are pretty much useless or 2 small to do anything with plus some are falling apart, not good quality. However it was just 8 bucks and the grizzly synthetic hair was worth that much to put a smile on my daughters face plus you get the beads and hair tool so im happy with it for the money but dont buy this kit for the real feathers or it will disappoint. I would probably not buy this kit again because bundle monster has a set of 20 grizzly extensions for around the same price and this kit only has 10. The feathers are only good for maybe a childs craft project if that.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with this &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34;. I bought this and was so excited to receive it and when I finally got it I was so disappointed. My &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; came without a tool or the micro beads. The feathers were in unusable condition and the synthetic &amp;#34;feathers &amp;#34; were just cheaply put together pieces of hair that literally fell apart when I held them. All together I only received about 15 unusable &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; and a whole lot of disappointment. This product was not a 100 piece kit and was nothing like the description. Don&#x27;t even waste your time on this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone and I never saw them use it, haha. When I received it in the mail it seemed ok but the feathers were a little mashed..</li>
    <li> Vibrant colors and arrived in time</li>
    <li> What a scam DONT BUY worse product ever the feathers and the Hair are dollar store quality and mostly broken...  I get why you cant return it because it is trash! I am really upset</li>
    <li> these feather hair extensions are great. they are so comfortable and soft you can&#x27;t even tell that its in your hair. it works so well! I bought it for my friend and she said they were great so she let me try and i love em! i hope to buy some soon!</li>
    <li> I had a really bad experience with feather extensions before that I had put in, in a professional salon. After reading the reviews, though, I decided to give it a shot. Wanted to do something different to my hair without having to color it and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot. These are beyond, WAY beyond the quality of the feather extensions from the professional salon and last a long time, while still looking great. Give them a shot!</li>
    <li> The feather count is accurate but the feathers are of crafting quality. They aren&#x27;t fashion quality. The loop tool they give you is very hard to use considering I bought this for my 6 year old sister to do with her friends. We had to end up doing it for them but they loved the feathers. I recommend for younger girls but be advised, they will need help with putting the feathers into their hair.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!!!!! I got them the day after I ordered them. I&#x27;m a kid writing this and I&#x27;ve got really long hair and there are long and short feathers in different styles and colors. There is something 4 everybody. The crimps are in blond, light brown, dark brown and black 4 different hair colors. They went in easy and fast and have epic quality!!!! They look like what they did in the picture. I would say these would be a great gift 4 girls who want feathers but cannot afford them with those outrageous salon prices!! These are a great deal but I wouldn&#x27;t get them 4 girls under the age of 7. I LOVE them!!!! :D</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it showed up almost a week after it was supposed to. The feather were just stuck in plastic bags and started to tangle together. and the bag that held the beads ripped as soon as I opened them. If you want this product find a different seller</li>
