      <li>Don&#x27;t waste time looking for the best one ---THIS</li>
      <li>Do they still offer free sharpening ?</li>
      <li>These serve my purpose for getting to a wider area but not as precise as the pointed ones are.  </li>
      <li>So quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>When I look at these tweezers they don&#x27;t seem to be anything special.  </li>

      <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>Worth</li>
      <li>i felt like splurging since this is supposedly near the top of the tweezer market.</li>
      <li>Everything good they say about this trademark is true at least for me, accurate precision.</li>
      <li>He was right.  </li>
      <li>the cheep ones, they grip 99% of all the hairs on the first try</li>
      <li>Red is my favorite color</li>
      <li>I love tweezerman and they seem the same quality that I have purchased from the store.</li>
      <li>The strong, sharp tips grab hair easily, although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on skin.</li>

      <li>Grips fine and very short hair follicles.</li>
      <li>I have only had the tweezers for a few weeks, but they seem great.  </li>
      <li>I have never tried a tweezer with such a comfortable pull.  </li>
      <li>This was a real bargain compared to prices in my community for this.</li>
      <li>works very well -</li>
      <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve used but definitely not the worse.  </li>
      <li>Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>Plucking eyebrows or the occasional stray chin hair (for me), and cleanly taking care of pesky ingrown beard hairs (for him) is now almost effortless again.  </li>
      <li>Highly recomend,&lt;br /&gt;yes</li>
      <li>Very precise, sharp, easy to grip even small hairs.</li>
      <li>and it gets the hair instead of my skin more often than tweezers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
      <li>Same as my old ones.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it was totally worth the price</li>
      <li>but it works really well and its uber sharp!</li>
      <li>But other ones I have purchased in the past were not engineered or machined properly and their clasp would miss fine things, like hairs.  </li>

    <li> Great product. Been using it for a long time, no complains.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Idk why I didn&#x27;t get them sooner. Would&#x27;ve saved a lot of time and trouble.</li>
    <li> I can not say anything exceptional about these tweesers</li>
    <li> It has a very sharp points at tips....not used to that and have to be careful&lt;br /&gt;very careful when using it. JM</li>
    <li> Highly recomend,&lt;br /&gt;yes they are not cheep, but they work so much better then the cheep ones, they grip 99% of all the hairs on the first try</li>
    <li> Love these after years of buying others and not getting what I needed.  I bought these and the pointed ones. These serve my purpose for getting to a wider area but not as precise as the pointed ones are.  Very good quality and will be at my service as long as I can imagine.</li>
    <li> My last tweezerman tweezers lasted for 15 years. These are just as well made and work great. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> When I look at these tweezers they don&#x27;t seem to be anything special.  I hated plucking my eyebrows and at first glance these didn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d change that.  I swear there&#x27;s less pain and it gets the hair instead of my skin more often than tweezers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I don&#x27;t mind plucking if I&#x27;m using these.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used a set of Tweezerman tweezers then you know they&#x27;re the best. Got these at a great price and the seller happily shipped them to Canada. The Limited Edition red coating is great too.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not sure if it was totally worth the price but it works really well and its uber sharp! i felt like splurging since this is supposedly near the top of the tweezer market.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything but Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezerman products for over 20 years. They have always been the best products available...</li>
    <li> Best tweezer I have ever bought. What a difference!!!!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned! Very precise. This is my second pair, because I wanted two. Both are amazing. Perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Tweezerman tweezers. They are the best. They even get to the smallest and thinnest hairs. Look no further, Get Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> Everything good they say about this trademark is true at least for me, accurate precision. I&#x27;ve never bought tweezers that were as much as expensive as these but I&#x27;m wondering why did I wait so long. I love them.</li>
    <li> These were just what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I found it. It works perfectly. Don&#x27;t waste time looking for the best one ---THIS ONE is the best one :)</li>
    <li> Precise, and well made.  Not much to say, it is just a tweezer after all.  But other ones I have purchased in the past were not engineered or machined properly and their clasp would miss fine things, like hairs.  No such problem with these.</li>
    <li> I have been using Revlon&#x27;s Ultimate Tweezer for the last few years now. It was time to replace my dull Revlon&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve always wanted a Tweezerman.  I bought these off Amazon and I am hooked!  I have never tried a tweezer with such a comfortable pull.  So quick and easy.  Very precise.  It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs and it&#x27;s comfortable to grin/hold.  I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers - worth the price and red is a good color for spotting in my messy drawer</li>
    <li> Not disappointed at all with what I consider to be the top of the line tweezers.  The get even the smallest of hair and out it goes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good tweezer for the price.  Not the best I&#x27;ve used but definitely not the worse.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> works very well - this is 2nd I am buying.</li>
    <li> I have had Tweezerman tweezers before so knew what to expect.  The pair that were being replaced suddenly became useless  but as I have had them for about 10 years I think they were good value for money, as I hope the new tweezers will be too.</li>
    <li> When we lost our last pair of Tweezerman tweezers (we think it got bumped into the trashcan unnoticed) I was reluctant to spend the money to replace them, as they aren&#x27;t cheap.  We tried some less expensive brands from a local store, but they just didn&#x27;t have the sure grip on the hair that we had come to expect from our tweezers.  My husband finally put his foot down and said we needed to get another Tweezerman tweezer.  He was right.  Plucking eyebrows or the occasional stray chin hair (for me), and cleanly taking care of pesky ingrown beard hairs (for him) is now almost effortless again.  &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; is certainly true in this case!</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers. The strong, sharp tips grab hair easily, although I wouldn&#x27;t use it on skin. Best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Red is my favorite color and I know I&#x27;ll love this Tweezerman, replacing one I bought Oct 2002. Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Grips fine and very short hair follicles. Handle is stable and non-slip and the whole tweezer&#x27;s weight is nice and light.</li>
    <li> Thank you. It arrived well packaged and well made. Exacting tip.</li>
    <li> can precisely remove short brow hairs, love it</li>
    <li> I bought these online because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $25 at the store for a great pair of tweezers.  It&#x27;s a great pproduct at 1/2 the store price!</li>
    <li> I have only had the tweezers for a few weeks, but they seem great.  I am trying to keep the tips in the plastic that they arrived in in order to protect them from damage.  I love tweezerman and they seem the same quality that I have purchased from the store.</li>
    <li> These are just the best tweezers out there. I have 2 pair. Buy an extra set because your man or kid will borrow them.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are outstanding!  Where have you been all my life?  Worth every penny and then some...I only wish I had purchased them sooner.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect.  It does the job well and I love the bright color making it easy to locate in my makeup or bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> Huh? People say these tweezerman are not as good as they used to be... LIES.  Same as my old ones. the only reason I had to replace them is because I lost my last Tweezerman&#x27;s.  Do they still offer free sharpening ?</li>
    <li> These tweezers are sharp &amp; grasp small hairs, but the tension is so loose. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before even with $3 tweezers. Would not spend the money on these again. Better off with $8 Revlon!</li>
    <li> Hate this tweezer.  I have always loved Tweezerman products, but this one is worse than useless. The edges are so sharp that it cuts the hair off instead of grasping it.  I manage to pull most of my brows, but end up cutting about a third of them off with this tweezer.  A lot of money for a failure of a product.</li>
    <li> Good, accurate tweezers for the money.  So far, it works great and I haven&#x27;t needed to invest in another.  Not sure if there is a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; tweezer, but this does the job well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there could be difference between &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; tweezer and &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; tweezer.  I thought tweezers were tweezers and they couldn&#x27;t be so different I quality.  Oh I was wrong.  This tweezer is amazing.  I can even pull white-heads with this tweezer (sorry sounds gross, but it&#x27;s true!). If I ever lose this, I would be purchasing the same item again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more can I say.....great tool</li>
    <li> Very nice......very precise........i thought i would never pay this price for a pair of tweezers, but these are top notch high quality and i would definitely buy again.  In fact, I bought another one in pink!!</li>
    <li> Very precise, sharp, easy to grip even small hairs. Telling all my friends about it!  Worth every penny- it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these tweezers for years now and I just got around to doing a review. LOVE them. Still sharp. Grabs the tiniest hairs.</li>
    <li> This was a real bargain compared to prices in my community for this. Such a basic in my beauty routine that I ordered five. Doesn&#x27;t that say it all?</li>
