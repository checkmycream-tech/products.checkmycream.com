      <li>The area under my eyes is sensitive, so I try to avoid putting moisturizers or make up on it.  </li>
      <li>Made in The USA, no harsh ingredients that tend to burn your tender facial skin.&lt;br</li>

    <li> I bought this for my wife. She really likes this product. It helps take away the puffiness and moisturizes her skin around the eyes. Helps makeup go on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the way my eyes look after using this cream for only a week it&#x27;s great. I have puffy, dark eyes when I get up not to mention a couple crows feet lines I believe they call them at my age. I apply this cream in the morning before my make-up and it is cool and refreshing to help wake you up. It doesn&#x27;t take a long to dry so you don&#x27;t have to wait to apply make-up. Then I apply at night after washing my face and I really think it even helps your eyes rest at night with the cool sensation. It has made a difference in the puffy bags under my eyes and the crows feet seem to be blending in much better with my skin tone now. I will continue to use this as part of my daily routine and can&#x27;t wait for the month result to come. Thank you..</li>
    <li> My eyes actually look better in the morning after using this product for over a week. Les puffy and the wrinkles a lot less norticiable.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonia Miller</li>
    <li> I have had good results and have now ordered two more bottles so I never run out.  I wish the volume was more in the bottle and was one ounce.</li>
    <li> I have sleep apnea so the area under my eyes always seems to look the worst. I purchased this to help tighten the area, lighten the circles, and give my face a brighter appearance. It has done all those things. I noticed tighter skin just applying it. After a few weeks my skin appeared to have better color and appearance not to mention my puffy eyes decreased. I may not sleep well, but this certainly helps hide it.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles around my eyes and after only a few days use, I noticed a difference. I have been using this for a month now and my circles are gone!</li>
    <li> This has already helped my fine lines around my eyes. I have super sensitive skin, and allergy proned eyes. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate at all! And it doesn&#x27;t smell of anything strong!!!! Win win win!</li>
    <li> This feels really good going on.  It&#x27;s a bit cooling and does reduce the look of puffiness.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the long term lasting effects.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this. It feels great on the face - I don&#x27;t just use it under my eyes, but all over my face.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and am obsessed! I put in on every morning and it helps take away my bags under my eyes almost instantly. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks.  The first thing I noticed was a tightening around the eye area.  My eye area looked and felt firmer.  I am starting to see a decrease in the small lines and crepiness under my eyes.  My dark circles do look diminished.  I cannot wait to see how my eye area looks after continuing to use the product.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I find it hard to use it consistently.  The instructions aren&#x27;t really clear as to WHEN to use the product?  So, before cleansing?  After cleansing??  I usually do it after, and sometimes it stings after taking off my eye makeup.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying it, though, and see if I can use it more consistently if there are any results.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for awhile now.  I am very impressed :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this item and would recommend to anyone. I always wake up with dark circles and I have wrinkles around my eyes this is a life saver. I will use it and be buying more. It makes me look younger under my eyes. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and my mom says that it works great and she noticed a difference almost right away, definitely within the first couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I love a product that works fast! I always wake up with puffy eyes and circles, and upon using these a few days I felt that the skin under and around the eyes lightened and looked brighter. My eyes also don&#x27;t look as puffy and my makeup goes on much smoother. Anything that goes near the eyes is scary, so I love that this contains natural ingredients. The gel is cooling and refreshing! It will become a part of my daily regimen!!</li>

    <li> Great product, works as advertised.</li>

Opus eye cream absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving no greasy residue..just a relaxing sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for people of any age, I am in my 20&#x27;s and have found this has improved the quality of my eye area.  I apply this lotion in the mornings before I leave for the day, a few people have complimented me on how nice my skin looks now.  This is way cheaper, and more comfortable than going to get a facial done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item in return for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old and am starting to wish I would have spent more time caring about my skin in my 20s. I recently started using products like this, and have found that this one seems to be superior to the store . Some creams irritate my eyes but this one has not . I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference but I haven&#x27;t been using it for months yet ! I will definetly keep using this product !</li>
    <li> Works great thank you</li>
    <li> I want to cancel this too. ok</li>
    <li> One of my best purchase ever!! Works as soon as you use it.. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for almost a week! 6 days to be exact and I can see and fee the results.. Try it and you won&#x27;t be sorry.. pass on it and you will.. I&#x27;m one happy customer :)</li>
    <li> Immediately Happy!!! Fast results. I put this eye gel on and as it was drying I could feel the skin around my eyes tightening. It glides on easily and has a gentle cooling affects. I work long hours and this was very rejuvenating to my tired eyes. What I like best about this gel is that the lines under my eyes have softened and some have disappeared. I have gotten a lot of compliments lately on how pretty my eyes are. I was happy to be able to find this on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product was too harsh for me.  I stopped using after the second try and skin burning.</li>
    <li> This has been a great new addition for my eye cream. Works great.</li>
    <li> Did not see any change in under puffiness which is why I made this purchase</li>
