<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only real rub, the plastic stand is cheap and to small to effectively hold both the razor and brush.  The razor has a tendency fall off, a lot, while getting the brush.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s great. The soap smells nice, light scent. The brush had a strong scent the first time I opened it, but after a couple of shaves, it loses the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Edwin Jagger DE89 and it&#x27;s a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is nice to create the lather and to hold the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is just a stand, does the job, but I&#x27;ll soon replace it with a better stand.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice set. The brush is soft and the bowl is heavy. I use a different soap, but it comes with a large puck.</li>
    <li> First shave set bought in a long time. Good product. Soap is real good and the badger lather brush puts the soap on smoothly and evenly. Easy to clean and looks really nice</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> Huge waste of money. You wanna buy this because you think, Well oh didn&#x27;t my grandpa or cool old guys use this? Probably not. Normal canned shaving cream is better in every way. Better than this cheap set anyway, I cant speak for the other soaps and what not. Do not waste money on this, Buy your son a can of gilette sensitive shaving cream, double edged blades and razors and you ill be good</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother for Christmas and he loves it. If someone you know is looking for a lot like this I would recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> The soap and the mug is great, I will give a five star for that. The brush is below average and keeps on shedding the bristles and its a mess to clean the puck of shed bristles, even after a few months of use. The stand also is the same, its wobbly and cheap. Basically you are paying the price for just the soap and mug.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best if not THE best starter set out there for anyone wanting to get into using a double edged safety razor and brush.  I bought this a couple years ago when I first started, and still use the brush, cup, and stand still.  First the brush is 100% badger!  It is hard to even find a 100% badger brush for the price of this kit.  A number of them start at double what this kit costs.  So you can almost think of it as just getting the cup, soap, and stand for free!  I&#x27;ve read that some people have had issues with the brush falling apart, but I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and not had those issues.</li>
    <li> I got this set as a gift so just the thought of it was nice but overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the quality of the brush and stand. The brush, like all brushes, lost a few bristles early on and that was expected. Then for the next few months it was fine until this morning. A large clump of bristles just fell out of the center of the brush. Mind you, I&#x27;ve only had about 4 months use out of it.  It might last for a few more months but I&#x27;ll be replacing it soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic stand was a letdown. Cheap plastic and the shape of the stand makes it pretty precarious when only the razor is resting on it.&lt;br /&gt;The soap had a very distinct aroma that smelled more like a discount bar soap.  That got put aside after only a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in the headline, the shaving cup is really nice, so at least it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
    <li> Great set for the money. Wish the lather or soap was better but other than that, the brush and stand and cup are a bargin.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set to start wet shaving with a safety razor and it is great.  I was worried about wet shaving in general because I have sensitive skin and my neck breaks out when I shave.  I have tried everything from high priced electric razors to disposables 1-5 blades, with no relief from red bumps, itchy skin and ingrown hairs.  Let me tell you I have never, never had a better shave than the one I get with my safety razor.  I hated shaving for all the reasons above and therefore would only do it 2-3 times a week.  In a professional environment I felt like I came across lazy if I didn&#x27;t shave all the time.  Not only do I love to shave now but I look forward to it and even do it on the weekends when I am not going into the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shopping around for the pieces individually I came across this set.  Price is unbeatable for what you get.  The mug is solid and fits in my hand well.  The stand is functional and functions well my DE razor fits securely.  The brush holds a good amount of water and builds up a good lather.  I have been using the brush daily for over 2  The shave soap is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are better items out there but this set is 100% useable and was inexpensive enough to allow me to feel comfortable to try it out.  I am satisfied with this set so much that I don&#x27;t think I will even purchase other item to try and find better ones.</li>
    <li> Nice set - unfortunately the shaving brush came apart from its handle after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I got tired of shelling out $ for replacement blades so I opted for a straight razor and figured I&#x27;d try this old school shave set to round it all out. I had no interest in buying a set for $100 so I chose this based on the details and reviews. The set looks very nice and even came with a pill of soap. At first my lather was very sudsy and not very thick but I realized that if you use less water it fixes the issue so the soap itself seems to be fine. The brush is natural hair which supposedly holds water better which would make sense since it is more porous than synthetic material. The downside is that the brush had a musky odor for a while but over time it&#x27;s seemed to mellow out. It was quite pungent at first though. The razor/brush holder is just molded plastic with a blocky type form that is quite pointy and edged which is don&#x27;t much care for but until I get a better one this will do. Ultimately for the price I am happy with this product. The only other thing I would complain about though is that the product name sounds German but the bowl had a sticker that said made in china so that was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price.  Arrived on time.  Soap lathers nice and works well.</li>
    <li> Great buy..... Best shave ever and great scent</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Price--hard to find a shave set for this cheap.  Basically you&#x27;re buying a mug and get everything else free.&lt;br /&gt;-brush is quite soft which makes lathering easy and feels good on the face&lt;br /&gt;-mug works well, and comes with soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hate the stand.  Works for the brush, but it holds the razor very close to the brush handle.  As well, the razor just doesn&#x27;t feel that secure, and the slipping it in and out the side just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;-brush has a slight smell to it, but is normal for badger.  A pure bristle brush will have less smell, but won&#x27;t be as soft.&lt;br /&gt;-soap smell is very feint, which for some might be a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered a different stand, brush and soap.  Since the kit is cheaper than just buying a mug, I&#x27;ll give that stuff to my brother and I won&#x27;t feel like I took a real hit, and I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I liked this set the brush is great and I like the matching bowl, it also comes with a display stand and the soap smells great</li>
    <li> I wanted to get something for my dad different from other years. I liked this set from the minute I saw it on Amazon. The product is ok, nice quality and good presentation.</li>
    <li> and he loves it. I thought he&#x27;d just think of it as a novelty item, but he really likes the soap. It&#x27;s less wasteful (he complained that old shaving creams dispensers would dry up pretty quickly for him) and he likes the feel.</li>
    <li> great little set, love the mug and the brush is WAY softer than the boar hair brush that comes with their lower end set</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this. The brush is good quality, and the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t irritate his dry, sensitive skin. I bought this for him for Christmas and the shaving soap is still going strong. He says he doubts he will want to go back to shave gel after using this.</li>
    <li> The badger brush still smells to date (owned for over 60-days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit works well, I wanted a spare brush and a shave bowl.  Its OK, and prices right</li>
    <li> everyone that sees it wants one.  even if they dont know how to use it. for me it does its part to give me a nice shave!</li>
    <li> the bristles have not stopped coming out over the last 7 months. I thought since it was Badger bristles that after a few uses it would be good, but I end up with bristles all over my face every time I use it. Time to give up and purchase a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using the set for two weeks now and the soap is ok, not the best lather in the world, but it works.  The brush is sub-par.  The hair keeps coming out and I am afraid I will have a hairless brush soon. The cup is the best part of the set and looks good in my bathroom.  WIth that said,  I will buy another brand of soap and brush next time.</li>
    <li> only downfall is that the brush seems to shed a LOT more than other brushes</li>
    <li> Shave in style with this kit!  A great gift for guys.  I&#x27;d like it if the brush and razor holder was black (like the rest of the kit) instead of clear plastic.  Also, some heavier razors topple over out of the holder.</li>
    <li> The product arrived with the handle of the shaving mug broken off. Additionally, the soap puck that should have been included in the set was missing.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best bargin for the best supplies.  You can look around the internet all day and not find something this nice for $35.00 The Mug is great and when I chipped it all I did was touch it up with my wifes nail polish!!!</li>
    <li> The mixing mug is solid and built well, the badger hair brush also works very well. The only issue I have is the soap is lackluster. If you go this route like I did, I&#x27;d recommend getting a better soap/cream for your shave</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I decided to use a single bladed safety razor and &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shave set. I purchased this product about 4 months ago, and have barely seen any reduction in soap. You get great value, and a very mild smelling soap. The brush is great quality- it stirs up the whiskers on your face to prepare it for the single bladed shave.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I shave my face AND head. While it is difficult to quantify how much this soap contributes to a shave vs canned shaving cream, I can say that I would have gone through no less than 3 cans of canned shaving cream in 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;With this shaving set, the quality of shaves is no different than the canned shaving cream. In conclusion, you are probably better off buying this shaving set vs the canned stuff, if anything, for financial reasons.&lt;br /&gt;And it makes you feel manly. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to be a little heavier in the wallet and have a little swagger in your step.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this and I am very satisfied with it. The brush is great, the mug looks and works well, and the soap even smells great, and come with a stand for the brush and room for a safety razor! All of this taken separately or even in another set would cost you way more so the value is really there too. I even bought one for my dad I liked it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back I would say is that the stand isn&#x27;t the prettiest in the world, but it gets the job done of letting the brush and razor dry after a shave. I might buy a nicer stand in the future when I upgrade my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (7/20/13): FYI, I saw this set at target today for $20!</li>
    <li> I bought this shave set a little over a month ago. I am not a hairy guy I shave 2 times a week, maybe 3. So after fewer than 20 sbaves my brush broke. The plug of badger bristles seperated completly from the handle. I am very disappointed. Guess that&#x27;s what I get buying Chinese!</li>
    <li> Great little kit, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband a month ago and the bristles have detached from the handle. It can be glued back in, but it&#x27;s disappointing to have to do it when it hasn&#x27;t even been used every day for a month. The soap and cup are fine.</li>
    <li> Nice set to start out with. Love the shaving mug and it&#x27;s old style handle. The badger hair brush is good and acceptable. Not too impressed with the soap included in package. Would highly recommend taylor of old bond street sandalwood shave cream. 4 out of 5 stars isn&#x27;t bad however. Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This method of shaving gives me such a clean and even shave every time. My face feels so much better afterward.</li>
    <li> Love the brush and the stand is a nice touch.  The mug arrived with a big chip in it.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product unless you are willing to pay the price for just the brush.  I don&#x27;t even want a replacement as the mug seems pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> The mug is great,  fits my hand well, sturdy, classy looking.  No complaints there at all.  The soap makes good lather and gets me a pretty decent shave, what you&#x27;d expect from a kit. The brush looks good, but sheds a lot of hair.  Doesn&#x27;t cause a problem with it&#x27;s effectiveness, but it&#x27;s annoying.  The stand looks cheap but works well.  It&#x27;s everything you need, and it all works great.  Price + effectiveness &#x3D; 4 stars</li>
    <li> Good brush good bowl don&#x27;t care much about the soap overall good product</li>
    <li> I purchased this set based upon the reviews and great price for the \\&quot;set\\&quot;.  Maybe it is just me, but the only thing that I found of decent quality is the mug.  - The shredding from the brush is less now after three months, but it is still there and is very annoying.  - The soap gives very little lather.  - The stand joints seem weak, it has already broken off for me during a travel, just sittin gin my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this product. I searched high an low for a badger brush kit and this was a great price. I am not disappointed!</li>
    <li> Having just started wet shaving, this was the perfect start up set for me. It comes with everything you need to start minus the razor and blades. I have seen other reviews bashing the quality of the brush or saying the mug was awkward, and I must say I haven&#x27;t had those negative experiences. The mug fits well into my hand and is easy to hold and the brush is the lowest quality of badger brushes, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect to much. I&#x27;ve lost a couple hairs from the brush here and there, but nothing that would make me think any less of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the stand could be a little wider so the brush and double edged razor would both fit better. You can still put hang both on the stand with no problem, but one of them will not be placed in their spot all the way.</li>
    <li> Pluses:  -The brush stand holds a razor as well  -The soap is surprisingly nice. Very mild and very easy to lather.  -The bowl is easy to use with any type of soap and is a nice, heavy, ceramic bowl  -Badger brush feels great and lathers well with any type of soap  Minuses:  -The badger brush lost a bit of hair in the beginning, but I think this is pretty normal. Since the first use, I have noticed significant hair loss from the brush, just the occasional bristle here and there.  Lather:  The lather was very easy to work up. By adding water incrementally to the bowl with the brush, and working the brush in a circular motion in the bowl, I was able to build up a nice lather on the brush. The brush then washes really easily--it really is more like hair than I thought it would be. The soap that comes in the set doesn&#x27;t have much (if any) fragrance, and is super mild.  Brush:  The brush is great. Before the first time I used it, I shampooed it as I had read about somewhere with the shampoo I regularly use. Don&#x27;t know if this made any difference but it was easy to do. I tend to rinse the brush thoroughly in warm water before I use it, and flick any excess water out. If I need additional water to get a good lather, I just put water in the soap bowl or rinse the brush a bit more. I hesitate from using super hot water because I&#x27;m not sure what it would do to the bristles.  Shave prep:  I just take a hot shower and use a mild face cleanser. I don&#x27;t use any pre-shave oil, and I use a plain moisturizer instead of an aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for a great price. The brush is a dream to use. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> The razor and brush stand feels/looks very fragile, but did not have any issues with it. The brush however loses at least 3-4 hair during each use. overall, it was worth the price even if it was for just the mug. I love the mug, have no problem holding it or what so ever. would recommend this to someone who wants to start wet shaving. Paired this shaving set with a Parker 96r razor, and i have been having a great shave for the past month.</li>
    <li> Received as gift.  Love it.  The mug is sturdy and soap is better than previous shaving cream I used.  I enjoy lathering up with the badger.  Only con, is that it seems to lose quite a few badger hairs after each shave.  I would expect a hair falling out every one-and-a-while, but every shave it loses a couple of hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had enough of the poor quality and overpriced disposable blades (e.g. Mach 3) and was initially set on just upgrading my cordless electric shaver.  However, when I really thought about it, I&#x27;ve always preferred the feel and result of a good shave with a razor blade, so I decided to go old school and try out a double-edged razor.  I decided on this kit both because of the good reviews and I simply like the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is very cool and looks good on the bathroom counter.  Out of the box, the logo on the badger hair brush was partially scraped off (or poorly applied), so I questioned the quality a bit there, but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to warrant an exchange, plus the quality of the brush overall seemed fine.  After only three uses, the badger \\&quot;stink\\&quot; seems to be gone already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that the included soap was hypo-allergenic.  For my first time using a brush to work up a lather from this kind of soap, it seemed to lather up fine and the fragrance is very, very mild.  The brush and razor stand with it&#x27;s clear plastic (or perhaps acrylic) complements the brush and my black-handled Edwin Jagger razor nicely, but it definitely could be a bit sturdier when racking the brush handle (a tad wobbly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this kit and would say it&#x27;s fairly priced.  I look forward to trying a different soap when the included one is used up and perhaps upgrading the stand, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Brush rinsing tip***&lt;br /&gt;So, you&#x27;re supposed to rinse out all the soap and dry the brush as best as you can when you&#x27;re done, so here&#x27;s what I found to be the most efficient way:&lt;br /&gt;-Start by gently shaking and rotating the brush under fairly high faucet pressure.&lt;br /&gt;-Splay out the brush against the palm of your hand to increase the amount of bristles exposed to the water.  Don&#x27;t spread them by pulling the bristles apart with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush should be thoroughly soaked at this point.  Immediately hold the brush upright(bristles on top) to prevent the water from dripping on your floor and go to your shower and vigorously shake the water out. Should only take a few shakes till the bristles look fairly dry and you don&#x27;t see any soap gathered at the tip.  Doing this in the shower will save you from the splatter mess that would otherwise occur on your bathroom counter and mirror (as I found out the first time).</li>
    <li> My guy was using the art of shaving miniature set and he was complaining about the tiny size of the brush so I got him this for Christmas and he loves it.  Not only is the brush much bigger it works a lot better.  He loves the soap which was a little confusing at first but a quick YouTube search showed us he was using it wrong. (You aren&#x27;t supposed to put the soap in the bowl, the bowl is for spinning the brush to lather.  Leave the soap in its packaging.) only issue he has is his Gillette Fusion with the Flex Ball doesn&#x27;t really fit in there but he just wrapped one of my hair scrunchies on there and it stays put.  All in all this was an excellent purchase that competes with and demolishes the competition in price and quality.</li>
    <li> my fiancé its LOVING this set..i like watching him use it and hear from him multiple times (because I muct have amnesia between his shave times) that it is real badger hair lol..great quality product and a great gift to the conscientious male</li>
    <li> This product was exactly like describe. the ink that was on the mug came off a little, but who cares, its literally for holding the soap. the brush was nice. Overall everything was great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. The badger hair brush is very soft and the holder works well and the shaving soap smell great.</li>
    <li> The shaving mug alone is worth more than this set costs. Throw in a Badger brush, high end shaving soap and a stand and you&#x27;re golden. OK, the stand is nothing to write home about but it does its job. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> My cousin really loved this. I got this for him for Christmas. The shaving cream is almost citrus scented and really great.</li>
    <li> Basic shaving kit. Price was good compared to other places.</li>
    <li> I switched to the traditional wet shave about three months ago. This kit and the razor are holding up well. The badger brush does a good job on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve used Van der Hagen&#x27;s deluxe and luxury soaps. Both work great. The acrylic stand is functional but not cool. The mug is great. The razor is awesome. For the money Van der Hagen is great way to get into traditional shaving without having to shell out a lot of money. I recommend their products.</li>
    <li> The set is nice and I like the soap cup. I have one problem and it is the brush. The hair just falls right out even after a couple months of use. I would still recommend the set just buy a separate brush and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
    <li> I was really enjoying this set but the brush broke after about 6 or 7 uses. The brush literally just plopped off of its base. I am very disappointed by it. The price should mean its a sturdier and more well put together product.</li>
    <li> Good first kit for the price. The brush looses hairs and doesn&#x27;t keep much heat in. However it lathers nicely and the smell is fairly neutral.</li>
    <li> Well after shaving with a safety razor for 2 months, i decided to edit my review. This set is extremely good for the price. The brush is very nice and it is holding up very well. It shed some hairs in the beginning but it does not lose any now. I really like the soap and prefer it over the Proraso Menthol Shaving Cream, which i&#x27;m sure you probably heard of already if you are researching DE shaving. You will definitely save a lot of money buy buying this instead of buying parts individually. However, in the future you can easily upgrade and spoil yourself with a $100 brush or what not if you are shaving with a safety razor and saving all this money by not buying&lt;br /&gt;cartridges for that horrible and expensive Gillete Fusion. A pack of 100 Derby blades will last you a year.</li>
    <li> Great set for those starting out with wet shaving. It has everything you need to start - the brush is a pretty good badger brush, the soap is very good (smells great), and the apothocary mug is very nice looking and easy to use. The stand for the brush is a little chintzy but it&#x27;s pretty sturdy plastic with a slot for your razor (wish it matched the brush and mug). It is well worth the price and a great way to start.</li>
    <li> A Badger brush, very nice shaving soap, a mug that fits easily in the hand, and an attractive and sturdy clear plastic brush and razor stand make this a great value.  The packaging was very protective.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit. The brush does shed a bit, but for me that&#x27;s not a big deal. I did not receive the stand in my package, but contact Amazon and they offered 20% off.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. He was new to wet shaving so I figured this would be a great addition to the Merkur razor I gave him. I thought the set looked great so I bought one for myself. The soap smells great and lathers up really well. The stand looks great which is a plus since it&#x27;s out in the open in my bathroom. However, the brush has poor quality as it loses bristles every shave. Most brushes will lose bristles for the first few shaves but this one lost bristles every shave for months. I switched back to my Tweezerman brush and found I was also getting a better lather.</li>
    <li> This set is great. If you&#x27;re taking the plunge into strait razor or safety razor shaving or even if you still use you cartridge razor, this set is sure to add comfort and class to your daily (or weekly, nobody&#x27;s judging you) shave. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare the entire set to, but I can say I quite enjoy it and that I have no buyers remorse. The brush is extremely soft, and only about 5 hairs fell out during the initial break-in period (about 1-2 weeks), which I hear is normal for most brushes. The soap lathers extremely well and has a very pleasant smell that strongly reminds me of my body wash and deodorant, which is good because I love the smell of my body wash and deodorant (Dove for Men: Clean Comfort, for those wondering). The mug holds the soap; that&#x27;s about it, but it does so in class. The stand is a simple solution and does its job extremely well. The stand is acrylic, which guarantees it won&#x27;t rust. Overall this set is an awesome value, and the soap is easily replaced if you don&#x27;t like it.    Pros:  -Excellent value for both experts and beginners  -All components are of high quality    Cons:  -The only con I could really think of would be that, this set won&#x27;t quite do it for those shaving snobs</li>
    <li> The pictures you see of this product on Amazon doesn&#x27;t do justice to the quality of this set. It exudes luxury for a fraction of the price you&#x27;d pay to get some sets from top brands like Truefitt &amp; Hill. I&#x27;m very pleased with this set. The badger brush is adequate. Not the best, but it does what it&#x27;s created for: to create lather. It&#x27;s also extremely soft and builds a good lather if you use proper technique. Please build lather by using it like the way you&#x27;d paint, stroking back and forth with your shave cream or soap.    Also, the accompanying mug is quite nice. Normally, you&#x27;d expect to pay the price you&#x27;d pay for this set just to obtain a quality mug like this. It&#x27;s got an old school feel to it, and it feels good in the hands, and is well crafted. The stand that comes with this set isn&#x27;t made of chrome or stainless steel, but it really does go well with this set. Finally, if you have a shave cream or soap that you like, this may not live up to it. However, this is a solid soap, and it smells fresh and clean. Can&#x27;t say that about a lot of soaps these days. All in all, a fantastic set for those who want the best on a budget.</li>
    <li> I like mine very much, works good for a beginner and the soap makes a nice thick lather. However you can get this at WalMart for 24 dollars</li>
    <li> The soap is great! Takes a bit more to lather it than other soaps do, but overall it&#x27;s great for a beginners set. The brush lathers up pretty well, but it does shed quite a bit. Stand is a little flimsy and my razor (EJ89) doesn&#x27;t like to stay in it very well. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new stand soon.</li>
    <li> Never had one before.  This is a real gem.  Makes shaving a pleasure.  I would recommend this product to all men who want to enjoy shaving again.</li>
    <li> I decided to get back into wet shaving with a DE Safety razor.. Saw this set for a good price and bought it..  The mug is really nice..  A good weight to it..  The brush I got with the set was shedding 3-4 hairs each shave for the first week, which I thought was normal..  Then it started shedding 10-15 hairs each shave (which is NOT normal)..  I contacted VDH, and they sent me a new brush!!  Now that&#x27;s great customer service!  I&#x27;ve had the new one for almost a month, and besides a couple at the beginning, has not shed any hairs!  Wonderful brush!  Gets really soft in a week or so.  The stand is nothing to write home about, but it does its job.  I have not used the shave soap (I prefer creams)..    My wife somehow broke the mug a week ago, and I&#x27;ve been using a fruit bowl..  Just not the same..  When I saw a price drop on the set, I just ordered another one!!  Mainly to get the mug, but now, I&#x27;ll also have a backup brush...  Maybe this time, I&#x27;ll try the soap..  :)</li>
    <li> I have one of these, and I got this one for my son-in-law. It helps you get started with shaving with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> My husband is hard to buy for and this made a perfect gift! He loves it!!! Thank you for a quality product and a surprised husband!!!</li>
    <li> The product works fine. The only thing is that the plastic that retains the brush broke and it is useless.  Other than that, the product works as preached.</li>
    <li> If you are new to wet shaving, this is a great starter set. However, if you decide you like wet shaving, you may want to replace a few items. The brush is a decent brush, but will shed more and longer than higher grade brushes. Also, shaving &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; are harder to work with in general. Soaps require a pretty specific water content, so if you are having trouble getting used to wet shaving, before you give up try a cream rather than a soap.</li>
    <li> Purchased this along with a Parker DE 22R safety Razor.  The mug is solid and feels nice in my hand, the brush seems to be of high quality and the stands does what it is designed to do.  I really like the smell of the soap as well as how much it can lather up, quite impressive how little is used each time.  I read alot of reviews commenting on how the brush seemed to shed alot, I did not experience this issue so much.  Now I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far but have lost a total of maybe 3 or 4 bristles.  I have been fairly vigorous with the lathering process wanting to produce as much rich lather as I can becuase I shave my whole head.  I would definately recommend this to anyone interested in trying out wet shaving.</li>
    <li> These are high quality products that really get the job done.  An excellent shaving system at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great starter set for the money. I bought this when I first got into shaving with a double edge safety razor back in 2012. I still use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush/razor holder works fine.&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic mug retains heat from hot water fairly well, keeping the lather inside it warm.&lt;br /&gt;The luxury shave soap has a nice scent and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;At first, the brush would lose hairs, but after getting past the brush&#x27;s break-in point, loose hairs are less common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare the brush to higher end brushes, as I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend hundreds of dollars on a silvertip badger brush. I can compare it to the synthetic brush from The Body Shop. This brush is more bulbous and I feel it creates and holds lather better. I use the synthetic Body Shop brush more for travel.</li>
    <li> A good starter set. The cup has a solid feel to it, and should be no problem holding with wet hands. The soap smells great with a scent of honeydew melon. I haven&#x27;t used it yet since I have another cake already started. The stand is very sturdy and not flimsy at all. The brush did not have a \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; smell, but a faint smell of book paper. It was scratchy with the first use. Maybe it will soften  after a few shaves. All in all, a good deal.</li>
    <li> The shaving set was just as advertised.  Only issue the cup it too wide to fit in our medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this company for free shipping.  Otherwise I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great kit. The soap is OK, I use Taylor of Old Bond Street instead. The brush has lasted me a few years and you really need a stand like this to hold the brush to get it to last that long. The shave cup with handle is great for someone who uses the type of soap that comes with the kit. Again, great kit for the price, even if all you use is the brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, I&#x27;ve used it several times and it has not shed one bristle. The soap dish is a high quality, heavy duty ceramic bowl with a handle. I was a little leery of the stand when I first ordered it but when it came in I saw that it is a very sturdy single piece of plastic. It doesn&#x27;t look as good as the chrome stands you can buy but it serves its purpose and it does it well. There is also a slot on the stand for a razor. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone not wanting to spend a fortune on the chrome sets.</li>
    <li> This kit is so much better than their original set. The brush quality is surprisingly very nice.  The soap is amazing, and lathers with almost no effort. Great bowl.  The stand is a little flimsy and I wish they would have provided an adhesive or something to mount it on a wall.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this kit to anybody looking to start wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I love my shave set! Been wanting one for a while now and have not been disappointed since getting it.</li>
    <li> First, this is a handy kit.  The cup and the stand are perfect for me.  The shaving soap is wonderful on my incredibly sensitive skin too.  In fact, the shave soap performs better than any other shaving cream/gel product I&#x27;ve used in the past.  One day I was in a huge hurry and I used the soap with my old Fusion and I was quite surprised at getting the best shave I&#x27;ve had from a cartridge system ever.  Anyways, my only complaint is the brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and the bristles are starting to fall out.  I&#x27;m not doing anything odd or improper with the brush, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong.  I&#x27;ll probably get a better brush after the new year and put up with the thing for now.  I would say find another brush if you get this pack.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving since the Navy forced me to do that daily in boot camp in March 1964.  I prefer using a blade and Gillette with its constantly changing blade count has provided me with the necessary instrument to remove the excess hair.  When younger I tried foam from an aerosol can as softener, but settled on soap from a bar rubbed between my hands for that medium.  That worked for about 35 years, but I was interested by using a brush and soap dish and this was the first offering of that combination which was inexpensive enough to get my attention.  I like it.  I like the handle on the soap dish, I like the stand for the brush between usages, I like the foam that the soap provides and I have been getting excellent results.  Great product and great value.</li>
    <li> I think this is a nice set. The soap is great, the porcelain bowl is very nice, the stand is plastic but works well and looks OK. My only problem is with this brush. I looks very good and makes a nice lather but mine loses bristles almost every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Bought a couple of these as groomsman gifts at my wedding. Both friends loved them and converted them to a fancier side of shaving.</li>
    <li> First, I am not a shaving perfectionist, just switched to wet shaving several months ago.  Chose this set as a starting point, primarily due to price and good reviews.  Definitely not disappointed.  Everything is quality.  No doubt, there are better products but, at what price?  This Van Der Hagen set works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is a good set to buy if you&#x27;re thinking about getting into wet shaving, or if you just want to enjoy your shaving experience a little more, but there are some things to be desired in this set.  My absolute favorite part of this set is the soap.  The soap produces a good lather and it is extremely gentle on the skin.  On top of that, I absolutely love the smell of this soap.  I like the soap so much that I will definitely be buying refills in the future.  The second best part of this set is the soap mug.  It&#x27;s a nice ceramic mug that looks sharp and provides a great way to load up your shaving brush.  I will continue to use this mug for a long time.  The stand that comes in the set is serviceable, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a safety razor particularly well, and it&#x27;s just cheap looking plastic.  For the most part, the stand does it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll be upgrading someday.  My least favorite part of this set is the brush.  This was my first shaving brush, so I at least appreciate it for the simple fact that it introduced me to wet shaving and opened my eyes to the reality that shaving can and should be a more enjoyable experience.  The experience of brushing a nice smelling lather on your face with a soft brush is pretty cool if you&#x27;ve never done it before.  However, the brush itself just isn&#x27;t that great.  I was getting frustrated with not being able to build a good lather with this set and thought it was either my own poor technique or a problem with the soap.  I spent $17 to get a decent boar brush, and the improvement was immediate and profound.  The first time I used my new brush with this soap I built a thick, meringue-like lather.  When compared to my new brush, I&#x27;ve realized that this Van Der Hagen brush is just plain cheap.  The bristles aren&#x27;t that soft and they just don&#x27;t produce a great lather.  Even my $17 boar brush completely blew this Van Der Hagen brush away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this kit isn&#x27;t bad if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving,or if you just want to try shaving with soap and a brush, but if you&#x27;re serious about getting into this style of shaving I would recommend getting a different brush.  The set is worth it for the stand, mug, and soap, I think, but the brush is underwhelming.</li>
    <li> buy it now. this product is a great entry level set to anyone new to shaving the way it was intended.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set, but it arrived very dusty (weird, since it was supposed to be new), and the box had a nice rip in it. We figure it was a display or something. We paid for new. So all in all it&#x27;s nice, but we feel a bit cheated.</li>
    <li> I like this set. The Shave mug, soap, and acrylic stand are great.  The everything in the set is high quality.  The only thing I&#x27;m not excited about is the brush.  The badger hair bristles are too soft and thin so it does not retain the water well.  Also, because the bristles are soft it is hard to build a decent lather.      Bottom line.  I would recommend the set because it is still are great bargain for the price.  I would probably throw a tweezerman badger brush in your cart when you order this because it is a superior brush against the one that comes in this set.</li>
    <li> This set, is wonderful. First the Cup: the cup is larger(wider) than what I&#x27;d expected but very nice and heavy. The Brush: the brush is a lot better than the other one I had, bristles are firm and smooth and don&#x27;t fall off with every use. The Soap: the soap it came with is pleasantly scented and lathers like a dream. And lastly, The Razor/Brush Stand: the stand is acrylic and modest, and it fits my safety razor perfectly. All in all, it looks great next to the sink, it feels great on the face, and I actually get up feeling excited to use my shaving kit.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, arrived quickly.  Was just as pictured.  Very nice, good quality and attractive.  Is a gift so not sure how well it works.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but there are sturdier options available at a steeper price.  We will see how long the plastic holder lasts.</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  Good buy for the price.  Nice mug.  Fair brush.  Excellent soap.  I think that for a hard cake soap this is superior both in price and in lather.  I think it beats all of the higher priced cake style soaps by a mile. It is not a Taylors of Old Bond Street but for the price it is a great shave.</li>
    <li> I got it but it is something completely different from what is shown and something that I could buy from a local CVS store for $6!!! I will ask for my money back...</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me and i love it the quality is very good and the seller shipped very quick as well. I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> For traditional shaving, this set has all you need to get your technique down. Then, perhaps, you can move on to other products, or not, if you like it. It is a good value and a better than VDH&#x27;s Deluxe set -- which is has a bowl, glycerin soap and a boar brush, rather than badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is pleasant and requires about 45 seconds of swirling to load the brush. You can then face lather or whip it up in an additional bowl, whatever your preference. The soap smell is nice, subtle and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is quite good for the price. Obviously, not as dense as a silvertip at $150, but it does the job with a reasonable amount of backbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is an apothecary style and does what it does, either for lathering on the puck or transferring to a bowl after loading the brush. It&#x27;s an attractive style, used by many other makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is the weak part, but not enough to downgrade the set. I don&#x27;t mind the plastic and the brush section holds the brush well, but the razor section is a little weak and assumes either an extra long razor handle or a straight razor, the latter of which is not the likely purchaser of this set. But it will hold the VDH razor well, dangling, if the TTO doors are OPEN to dry as this razor has a narrower head than an EJ89, Merkur 34c, etc. It holds these brands as well, dangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is likely designed to please everyone, so it doesn&#x27;t master one. It&#x27;s designed to hold a DE hanging... and the bottom divot is for water drips. For a razor to lean in the slot, resting in the divot requires a handle 120mm long! Most DE handles are 75mm (short) to 100mm (XL) long. Traditional is about 80-85mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this set for a family member or friend looking into trying traditional DE shaving without hesitation, knowing they will likely move on in a few months. It&#x27;s a good value. (The VDH razor is forgiving and not bad either, but that&#x27;s another review.)</li>
    <li> Recently I decided to go old-school with my shaving habits.  I&#x27;d read about the benefits of using shaving soap and a badger hair brush as part of a morning routine, so I took to Amazon to research my options.  After looking through items by The Art of Shaving, I&#x27;d started thinking the price point on this sort of thing might be out of my ballpark if I wanted quality.  Then I stumbled across Van Der Hagen.  I&#x27;ve been using my Van Der Hagen shave set for 2-3 weeks now, and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try this years ago!  My mornings are honestly more energized since I added this to my routine.  I used to hate shaving; now I actually look forward to it!  It has without a doubt become one of my favorite simple pleasures.  And the aesthetic of my apothecary cup filled with shaving soap, and my brush in it&#x27;s stand...it just makes the bathroom counter feel more luxurious.  When I need a refill on my shaving soap, or a new badger hair brush, I will definitely be a return Van Der Hagen customer.</li>
    <li> This is a great set to give double edge or straight razor shaving a try. I like the brush, and while i am sure for more money i can get better, this was a great way to try it without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush: I had no issue with hair falling out at all, losing only 2 hairs total in 4 uses. I soak the brush in the empty mug in warm water while i shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap: Smells great! I received this set before my razor arrived, so i figured i would learn proper lathering while still using my regular 5 bladed beast. It made my 5 blade razor shave super smooth and comfortable, and once i moved to the straight razor, it provided the protection needed for such a steep learning curve. I put a few drops of warm water on soap before i shower so the top layer is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand: Quite small, does what it need to allowing your brush to hang dry. My straight razor doesn&#x27;t stay so well in the stand, but it isnt moving anywhere, so it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug: here was my confusion. Was i going to use the mug with the soap puck, and then a separate bowl to build lather? I wasnt sure, so i decided to use a coffee mug for the soap puck. I wet the bottom a bit, and dropped the soap in and let it dry overnight. Now the puck is fixed in the coffee mug nicely. I run the brush around the soap for 45 second to one minute, then use the mug from this set to build lather. I am not so sure this is the ideal solution, since the mug is a bit narrow for swirling lather, and probably makes more sense for the small swirl need to load the soap, and not the lathering part. I will get a small bowl, and try it this way as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this allows you to get started, and after just a couple of shaves with my [[ASIN:B002PQZEHQ Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor and 5 Shark Super Stainless blades]] i know i have good shaves ahead of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know about the huge savings factor though. i know many guys go through blades like crazy, and with the 4 or 5 blade ones going for a couple bucks, it adds up. I was using the [[ASIN:B003BVINQI Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor]] and it is the best of the multi blade razors. I found a cartridge would last me a month (15 shaves) without getting too dull or irritating. SO it was only costing me about $2-3 a month for one or two. Now i spent on a razor, this set, plus i will probably take the advice of others and get a sampler to see which blades are the best for my face. So I am in at almost $60, which could have bought me well over 2 years of cartridges. With the straight shavette, i will have to replace soap, and buy razors as well, albeit cheaper. I am not looking at this as a savings  issue to though, and i am very happy so far with how great of a shave i get with a straight shavette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any comment about how i am using the bowl and mug setup, i would be interested to hear!</li>
    <li> This is a great gift nice holder for may razor looks great brush and soap works well in cup. My wife is happy it keeps all my shaving stuff stored in an orderly way but more importantly keeps my razor dry and allows the brush to dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself when I first started wet shaving.  It has a great brush and mug.  I&#x27;ve found soaps and stands I like better, but you can&#x27;t beat the price and quality!  Most mugs by themselves cost as much as this whole kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be ordering one for my brother-in-law, and one for my dad soon.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the set!</li>
    <li> This set is worth every penny.  I was a bit concerned because some badger hair brushes alone sell for this much or more but the soap smells fantastic, the cup and stand look great, and the brush is exactly what you need.  The soap smells a LOT like Candies cologne for men.  It lathers well and the brush does an extraordinary job.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The soap itself has feels like it has almost no slippery ingredient for the razor blade to slip on the skin easily. The little plastic holder that holds the brush and the razor is practically useless. If you move it just a little, the brush and the razor will simply fall off as they are very loosely held. The soap holder is really nice porcelain and heavy, so it stays in place. I think this product should be cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but looks nice and for the price has all the essentials to get you started. The soap smells good but not overly potent so I like that</li>
    <li> This is a nice set. The brush, stand, and bowl are all nice to use when shaving. The soap is nothing special, in my opinion. Four stars because I believe it overpriced at $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the arena of wet shaving and safety razors, so I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to compare this to. That said, it&#x27;s a quality set, and it&#x27;s pretty hard to beat for the price. The stand is a must so your badger brush can dry properly and it&#x27;s nice to have a place to put the razor too. For someone who&#x27;s just getting started with this \\&quot;new\\&quot;-old way of shaving, this set works just fine. The brush seems to be pretty high quality, and it&#x27;s got a nice weight to it. I did actually lose a couple bristles the first time I used it, but I believe that is fairly normal. As for the stand, I used to have no other choice but to leave my disposable razor on the counter or under the sink, but the stand takes care of that problem. My overall impression is that it&#x27;s a great starter kit. Short of the razor, it&#x27;s got everything you need. There is better stuff out there, but if you&#x27;re just getting started, this will work fine to start with; without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great price for what you get, the bowl alone can go for as much as this entire kit.  The soap is un-remarkable, but still a nice freebie that adds variety to your soap choices.  The brush is a solid \\&quot;pure\\&quot; quality (quality for badger brushes goes pure -&gt; best -&gt; super/silver-tip).  It&#x27;s a little bit prickly when applying lather to the face, but mellows down somewhat after the first few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great introduction kit, and you can upgrade your brush once you know what features you&#x27;re looking/paying for.</li>
    <li> After causing a near-riot at a local business establishment when they raised the price of the modern bajillion-blade razor cartridges for the fifth time in five months, I realized something had to give. What happened to the days when a man could shave in the solitude of his bathroom without the insult of having it cost him $3 a day? Like so many others who reached the same breaking point, I looked around and found out about the wet shaving renaissance. And then I found this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen makes a solid  product. Their brushes are sturdy and well-built. Their soap smells terrific and lathers wonderfully. Their mug comes in the standard size and shape which fits pleasantly in the hand and just looks great with the matching brush. And the included stand holds the brush perfectly and is unobtrusive and takes up very little counter space. This set, therefore, is just what you need to augment your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What? No razor? No worries folks, they can be found all over the place. One is not included here, presumably because there are many varieties of razors, and individual preferences vary widely. I recommend Merkur or Edwin Jagger models, personally. Either way, this kit presumes that you have already chosen a razor and does not include one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy all of these things separately if you choose, but the price is right with this set. I think if you are just starting out, this will give you a good idea of whether or not the old-fashioned wet shave is for you. You really can&#x27;t go wrong starting right here with this set.</li>
    <li> I recently gave up my Hydro 5 to go to an old fashioned safety razor after becoming fed up with paying way to much for razor heads that never seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured why not take it a step further and ditch the shaving creams and jells and really go old school.  After seeing the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] at the local Rite Aid and talking to a couple of friends who made \\&quot;the switch\\&quot; months before I did, they all told me the same thing; badger brush only, and if you are going to spend money, spend it on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I would spend a couple more bucks, started looking around, and came across this.  Not only is the brush pure badger, but the set just looks a lot better than the other product mentioned above and does not break the bank.  And lets not forget, I have been using good &#x27;ol cans of cream since I started shaving back in the 7th grade, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money just to discover this way wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, that&#x27;s all I can say right now, wow.  I can&#x27;t believe I did not make the switch long ago!  The soap smells wonderful, once you work up a good lather its the best cream I have ever used, the brush is soft enough for me (I can see buying a higher grade brush in the future), and lastly, it just looks nice.  A clear stand that can hold my razor, a new well built brush, and glossy black shaving cup, what&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a practical gift for your father, husband, brother, son, neighbor&#x27;s son, or any shaving man you know, including yourself, don&#x27;t think twice and just buy this shave set!</li>
    <li> very good deal. the soap leave nice subtle scent and smooth skin. solid cup is nice too. holder is ok . brush is a bit wild and bushy yet still great deal. faster then noted shipping good seller!!</li>
    <li> What a waste of money.  This has got to be the worst shave brush ever.  Since day 1 there has been a steady loss of badger hairs out of the brush.  They wind up slathered on your face, in the shave bowl, and clogging up your razor.  This is FAR from \\&quot;LUXURY\\&quot;.  If you want the cheapest of the cheaply made in china garbage, then this is for you!  Save your money for a few more days.... buy a real brush / stand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I thought it would eventually stop shedding, but 10 weeks now and it still sheds EVERY time I use it.  It is going to the round file as it is not eligible  for return.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift and my husband loved it. Only issue was it initially smelled like wet fur, which makes sense given it is badger fur. After a bit the smell went away, and he&#x27;s very pleased - still uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for about a month now with an Edwin Jagger de89 razor, and I can honestly say that this combination is the best shave I have had in my 47 years of shaving, I was once a believer of the &#x27;more blades the better&#x27; line of thinking, spent a lot of money on expensive blade refills, then a co-worker got me this for a Christmas gift and I will never go back, sometimes simpler is better, this was how my father and grand father shaved, and I believe they had it right, the de89 razor is almost like a piece of art, with it&#x27;s gleaming chrome and weighty feel, and using the badger hair brush the soap whips into a nice thick pleasant smelling lather, extremely close comfortable shaves,and blade refills are dirt cheap and there many different brands to choose from, so my advice to anyone thinking about trying wet shaving, do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the same time I got my new Merkur safety razor. Got them both on the same day, and tested them out almost immediately. The brush is nice, the soap works up to a nice lather, and the stand holds the brush and razor perfectly. I could probably do without the logo on the cup, but I&#x27;m very particular about things like this and I recognize that it does not affect the function of this at all. Very glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing entry set for any beginner or professional DE shaver. and for its price it&#x27;s even more amazing. The stand is very handy, the shaving soap lathers up well and smells nice, and the brush is of excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Good place to start. My girlfriend loves the smell of the soap.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price, would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this as a present. It&#x27;s very good construction, and looks high quality. The set is pretty enough to look nice on the counter, and the shave soap smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this set to go along with the first safety razor that I bought and not only is the set amazing to use it is classy as hell.</li>
    <li> I got this kit from my wonderful wife as part of my 30th birthday present. I&#x27;ve not used anything other than the blue goop before, so this was a whole new experience. I love it. This set looks good on my counter. The brush seems to hold an impossible amount of water. The soap smells good, but I did think it would give a bit more lather.  My new Safety Razor fits perfectly in the stand. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this set.</li>
    <li> Like James Bond would say, &amp;#34;sometimes the old ways are the best&amp;#34;. Having that in mind, I wanted to give it a try with the old traditional way of shaving. This was my very first shave set, as I was looking for something affordable and nice. For beginners, this set is really nice. It comes with a brush, mug, shaving soap and a stand (for the brush and shaving blade). However, my biggest issue was with the brush. In less than three weeks of usage (I shaved three times a week), the part that hold all the bristles together, came off from the handle. The brush has been rendered unusable. Now I&#x27;m not sure if it was because I was handling the brush inappropriately while preparing the shaving soap, but I was expecting it to last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I like the mug that comes with this set, and is one of the main reasons I purchased this product.  That being said, the stand is plastic and functions well to hold my DE razor and the supplied badger hair brush.  The soap itself is okay but there are much better options to be had.  My only complaint, which others seem to share, is that the badger hair brush sheds like crazy.  Every single morning, I lose AT LEAST 10 hairs out of this thing.  My razor ends up picking them up off of my face.  Some people have not had this experience and lucky for them.  Unfortunately, I will have to buy a new brush within a year, when these brushes are supposed to last at least a year.  In the end, I could have spent 30 dollars elsewhere and been just as satisfied on a better soap and a regular coffee mug.</li>
    <li> After only about two weeks of using this the brush has already started falling apart.  I gave this as a gift and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these sets for me and my dad. The bowl and stand area great, plus the soap smells great and when lathered properly works great. The brush however is a different story. After a month or so, my dads brush completely fell apart with all the hair falling out. Mine has started to do the same thing a month or so later. Very poorly made brush. So be fair warned, you are basically buying the bowl and the stand, but don&#x27;t expect the brush to last.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit when I started wet shaving about a year ago. I´m constantly on the lookout for new products and as of yet I have not found a better kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is fantastic. It´s really nice and wide (a big plus) and has not chipped at all, even though I have accidentally banged it various of times against the sink. I have used other soaps on it even though they don´t initially fit, I´ve cut the soaps and microwaved them in this bowl for about ten seconds and then left them on the fridge for a couple of hours. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is 100% badger, it´s really nice and bigger than the others I´ve seen. It is much bigger than the famous Tweezerman sold here. I have not experienced shedding at all, so I´m sure the people with the negative reviews have no idea what they´re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is decent and lathers well, but the scent is simply amazing. I have tried a few other soaps and my favorite scent so far has been from this one, it´s a bit citrusy and strong. Some find it overpowering but I love it, it makes the bathroom smell awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is OK, it´s nice and clear. I prefer it over metal stands that will inevitably stain or rust. Looks fancy, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I believe this is a must for anyone new to wet shaving, it´s got all you need except for the razor and blades and all the components are top-notch. Trust me, you will not find a better kit.</li>
    <li> I used to use the jell and switched to this set. I wanted to use a brush instead my hands to lather up. I really like the way the brush puts the soap on not to thick just right. Leaves my skin soft and smooth. I do like the handle on the mug makes it easy to hold on to. The acrylic brush and razor holder is ok, it does the job. I may trade up but the mug,soap and brush make a difference. Treat yourself.</li>
    <li> This has everything you need to start classic wet shaving except the razor. The stand does have a spot for you razor, though. The shaving soap has a very light bay rum sent, and is in no way overpowering. The brush is not the best quality, but much better than one would expect for the price. I expect it to last several years.</li>
    <li> Nice set with a fresh scented soap. Brush and holder were classy.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful set.  Great to give as a gift.  We have gifted it to my father, my brother-in-law, and a good friend of the family and so far all have loved it.  The mug and brush are very good quality.  I will say that the soap in the picture looks like a little silver can, (maybe it&#x27;s just me, probably is) so I thought that the soap would come in a little silver can but it does not.  It comes in a plastic case, though.  Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful looking gift to give to a man in the family that loves to shave with a safety razor :)</li>
    <li> Nice enough brush with a good basic type of soap that will last about 6 months or so. Cup has the type of handle that is easier to hang on to with wet hands. I was going to upgrade the brush but this one works well enough.</li>
    <li> The bug has bitten and I made the switch to a DE razor last month.  As part of my starter set-up, I opted for this Van Der Hagen shave set with the badger brush over the set with the boar brush.  For what you get, it&#x27;s a great value for the starting DE shaver.  The mug is large, heavy, and houses the shaving soap puck just fine.  The brush was a little smelly at first, but after a few shaves it went away.  It&#x27;s not the highest quality brush, but it definitely does a great job of creating a thick lather.  The stand which holds the brush is very convenient in that it has a slot for your razor.  This set saves you a few bucks over buying it all separately.  I highly recommend to the beginning shaver!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. Lasted less than 5 months and the whole center of the brush fell out in big hunks.</li>
    <li> I wanted something unique and inexpensive for his birthday. I thought this might be a fun, unique gift that he&#x27;d actually use (and that wasn&#x27;t a video game!) He LOVES it! Easy to use, instructions included. The razor is NOT included but I purchased the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor as recommended by others -and the two were a huge hit! The soap has a very light, manly scent. The brush is soft and durable. The clear, plastic holder works great to hold the brush upside down (dries better that way and lasts longer) plus has a slot for a razor. I&#x27;m thinking of making this my go-to Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the soap in the least, and the brush head fell out of the handle after its first use. While it can be fixed with super glue and careful resetting, it shouldn&#x27;t have broken anywhere near that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug, however, is in good shape and the brush stand is simple clear plastic with an additional slot for your razor.</li>
    <li> The shaving mug, soap, and stand are fine, but the brush is useless.  The bristles are glued together and stuffed into the handle.  The bristles fell out of the handle my third time using it.  I believe I have some gorilla glue with which I can attempt to repair the brush, but the company should really try making a quality product from the beginning.  If you don&#x27;t already have a decent brush I recommend buying a different product.  **Update**  I ended up using some waterproof gorilla glue to hold the glued together bristles in place.  It is pretty ridiculous that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t use better glue to begin with.  Customers shouldn&#x27;t have to modify such basic products in order to make them useful.  I still recommend getting a better brush, though, because the bristles are still a bit scratchy and have not softened despite almost daily use for over a year.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had expressed interest in a shaving kit a few weeks prior to Christmas. I purchased this as a starter kit for him. The price was reasonable so if he wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as I had hoped, I wouldn&#x27;t be out of a significant amount of money. I was initially hesitant because it did not include a razor but realized (and embraced) that I have fairly limited knowledge about man stuff like that. Anyway, he loves it and I now have to feel his freshly shaven face and neck every time he shaves (his insistence). He&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy. It was a great gift.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice kit for the money. I bought it because I was looking for a brush stand and this entire kit was just $10 more than purchasing a stand by itself. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is because the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high quality as it appears in the pics/description. That one little issue seems worth mentioning just to make you aware that it is not the highest quality brush, but it shouldn&#x27;t stop you from ordering this kit; its a great value.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product</li>
    <li> The down side to this product is that the brush sheds like a nervous cat, and it only comes with one puck of shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather the brush up and rinse it out completely about 5-6 times before using on your face to get the badger stink and loose hairs out and after that it is a very nice brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great, smells great, and glides great! Super simple to build a lather and the puck lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mug feels great in hand and the flared top makes brushwork a snap. Do yourself or a friend a favor and pick one up now!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as part of my introduction to using a DE razor. I had previously used [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] with my cartridge shaver and enjoyed the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is a HUGE upgrade from the value set. The brush is badger instead of boar and lasts much longer. The mug itself is beautiful and looks great on my counter and the soap is extremely underrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this set for far less that what comparable sets will cost you and the value is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now.  Everything is still holding up quite well.  The boar brush lost a few bristles during the first few weeks but that&#x27;s to be expected with any brush.  The smell from the brush that some people complain about is also to be expected with any boar brush.  Best thing to do is fill your sink with soapy water and let the brush soak for a few hours.  All in all I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and price of this product.</li>
    <li> The soap(smells nice), stand(has no smell) and brush(new brushes always smell funny) are nice the bowel on the other hand was shipped to me in a million pieces. I blame UPS for that though. They are notorious for that. I could probably send the whole lot back and get a replacement but a coffee mug works just fine.</li>
    <li> The shave set arrived in a timely fashion as advertised.  I was impressed by the quality of the shaving dish and brush.  Both very good.  The soap was also top of the line.  Brings comfort and ease back to the art of shaving.</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;NIce looking acrylic stand that will hold just about any razor and your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy soap bowl that has heft to it and will create a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;Badger bristle brush really softens up nice after 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not So Great&lt;br /&gt;Badger brush smells like wet dog until you get past the 6th shave with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Brush bristles separated from the plastic handle... fixed this problem with a bit of cyanoacrylate (Super Glue).&lt;br /&gt;Stand is very lightweight and will slide around easily... fixed this with by applying rubber adhesive feet to the bottom of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;Many people complain about the fragrance of the soap. For me it was the scent of the brush that was throwing off the smell of the soap. I would describe the soap as a very light &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34; soap smell, which is why wet dog brush overpowers the smell of the soap. :)&lt;br /&gt;Seems like the star of this package is the apothecary mug (soap mug).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor and Blades?&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the following both on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L aka L6&lt;br /&gt;25 FEATHER BLUEBIRD ASTRA SHARK LORD DERBY BIC NACET Blade Sampler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;Would I say that this is the best shave kit out there? No. Is it the cheapest shave kit that includes everything that you need to &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; without having to scour the interwebs, while not being a completely &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product? Yes. If you can get past probably having to fix your brush with super glue and can put up with the wet dog scent (maybe you prefer it... to each their own) for a couple shaves. Eventually the brush will lose that smell and be more sturdy after the super glue fix (the bristles rotated in the handle from the beginning fyi) and you will then begin to enjoy the slight fragrance of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the main star of any shave set package should be the brush and this one broke in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is easily fixed with Super Glue butit do seem odd that VanDerHagen does not use cyanoacrylate when gluing this brush together. Instead uses what appears to be and smells like wood glue to fashion the bristles to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Maybe. Would I buy this just if I need a shave brush? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you buy this if you want to start wet shaving and don&#x27;t know what to buy and want a package that has a badger hair brush in it? Yes.</li>
    <li> I was new to safety razor shaving and wanted a good set to start with. I saw the reviews for this product on Amazon. The price was reasonable to I gave it a try. I&#x27;ll review the product by each piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apothecary Cup- The cup is very solid and not cheap feeling. It works great at holding heat if you soak your cup in hot water before lathering. The top of the cup is alright for lathering. I would have preferred a shorter cup with a wider mouth but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather Brush- The brush has a nice handle and is made with real badger hair. It works a good lather but sheds hair way more then I would like. The brush will have a smell for the first few uses but will fade away after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap- The soap is standard fare. If you&#x27;re new to soap lather you may get discouraged trying to learn how to lather correctly. I was doing it wrong for a few weeks. I recommend doing a youtube search on how to lather shaving soap and you will be on your way to greatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush/Razor Stand- A piece of clear plastic with a few cutouts. This holds my safety razor and brush. It is a solid build but not as heavy as it could be. Sometimes I feel like my Merkur 180 will tip this thing over but so far it&#x27;s worked fine for my needs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mostly for the apothecary mug, but I also wanted a matching badger brush to go with it. I previously had the Tweezerman shaving brush, and I had no problems with it, but I also needed the stand. This set has been working very well for me.  The badger brush is great. A few hairs fell out at first, but I find that&#x27;s normal with most brushes. It&#x27;s also larger than the Tweezerman, which I now prefer.  The mug looks great. Though I don&#x27;t really use the handle, it does look interesting because it&#x27;s a bit different from a normal mug that I know a lot of people use.  I have not used the soap yet-- I filled the mug with my own shave soap that I melted down and let set inside the mug.  Although the stand isn&#x27;t very fancy looking, I find it does the job. I didn&#x27;t have one before, so I had to let my brush dry by laying it on its side or standing on its hairs, but this lets the hairs keep their shape. The stand also accommodates a razor. I use a safety razor and it fits in there, but I image a Mach 3 or Fusion may not fit so well because of their shape.</li>
    <li> Glad I got this as part of my DE setup. Brush and soap are nice. Holder has a slot for what I presume is a razor and it works well enough. If I had one complaint it would be the brush and razor holder. It&#x27;s practical and does the job but I see myself upgrading to something nicer in the future. In the mean time if you need a brush, some soap, and a bowl then what the heck you cant go wrong with a stand too at this price.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got me this shaving kit for Christmas as I told her I wanted to get into straight razor shaving.  She got me the Parker SR1 straight razor with disposable blades to learn on (not having to worry about learning to keep it sharp and learn a new form of shaving).  The kit itself is great.  The bowl is a good size, and the soap is nice.  It smells great and produces a decent lather.  Wish the lather was a little thicker but I have a feeling that is due to my technique, not the soap.  The brush is soft on the face yet seems to work decent (loosing a few hairs but I image that will stop after the first few uses).  The holder is nice and will accommodate a straight, safety, or regular razor.  I have heard that it is hard to find a replacement brush to fit the holder though.  Time will tell if this set is good but initial impressions is good. I will update my post if I start to dislike the set or if it breaks.  Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband who constantly gets irritation and razor burns shaving with his Gillette razor and shaving gel.He loves this shaving set and does not have any skin problems with shaving any more.I also got him Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor to use with this set.He prefers Feather razor blades and he finds that changing them every other shaving is necessary for him.Badger brush has a good weight to it but sheds a hair or two every time it&#x27;s used.Stand is very handy and bowl is the best.Soap is good too and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.December 17,2012.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 month of light use(only 1-2 times a week) brush sheds ridiculous amounts.Probably 50+ hairs every time.Did not expect to need new brush so soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father-in-law for Father&#x27;s Day. He raved about how much he liked the set and how nice the brush/stand were.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;d had the same brush for about ten years and it was a hot mess, so this was a huge improvement over his old brush.&lt;br /&gt;However, my husband owns another brush of another brand and the quality is significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you already have a decent brush - This won&#x27;t be an upgrade. But, if you have an old nasty brush that you&#x27;re having difficulty replacing - This will make a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Or, a good starter brush for someone that&#x27;s trying to start out in the old-fashioned shaving style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just getting into DE shaving and wanted a reasonably priced kit.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I already had another brush but I&#x27;ve been using this one sice receiving it.  It lost some bristles early as expected but has since stayed intact and is soft and well made.  Looks good too as does the mug.    The stand is fine though I will be asking for a new one for Christmas.  This works OK but is a bit small and easily tipped, at least for me.  Looks nice, but I would prefer a larger more stable stand.  The soap is good- lathers well and smells good.  All in all, I am happy with this product and I will bew buying another for my son for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I just recently started shaving the DE razor&#x27;s for about a month now. At first I was having issues getting a good lather but with practice I did get better. Every time I use this brush it does lose about half a dozen of so hairs. I assume this is somewhat normal but this has been happening no going for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased another brush [[ASIN:B004OJU968 Semogue 1250 Natural Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]]and I found using this brush creating a good lather was easier, this brush has only lost a few hair and seems to hold the lather better and longer. Considering I am just beginning I suspect things will improve as I get more practice, so far it has all been a pretty positive. Take my review with a grain of salt from the perspective of a newbie...</li>
    <li> I decided to go back to using the razor my father used and gave me when I became old enough to need to shave.  I was fooled into buying more blades thinking more was better. I was wrong.  Shaving with the double edged razor is the closest I have gotten ever!. So I looked into getting a kit.  This kit was reasonable, I already had the razor..  The stabs keeps r everything off the sink.  The badger bristles are like shaving with a mink coat!  Such a luxury it seems, but so very worth it.  I love taking the time to shave the lather this brush whips up is pure luxury, the mug is perfect for holding the soap and keeps the soap from eroding needlessly.  This kit looks elegant on my bathroom counter.  Reminiscent of a more relaxed time.  This is something every man should do for himself.  I&#x27;m so very glad I chose to slow down and do it right for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with how this setup keeps everything neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> Despite some unfavorable reviews, I&#x27;m thrilled with this product.  I&#x27;ve only used the brush and stand so far and it gets the job done and the quality is great - regardless of price.  So the pot and soap are a bonus in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a daily shaver with moderate growth.  I stumbled upon a men&#x27;s shaving cream at Bath and Body and ended up buying a few tubes and wanted to go old school, like dad used to.  The only similar product I&#x27;ve used was when my father would teasingly put some lather on my 5 yr old face using his brush - 35 years ago.  Clearly, that was a much better experience, but I&#x27;m sure that was because of the &#x27;barber&#x27; and not the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process is great compared to the pump and primp shaving creams and gels.  You really feel the brush against the grain and the facial hair is raised for clean and easy shave.  It leaves a clean and comfortable feeling every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, I take it gentle with the brush and avoid traveling with it.  I speculate that if I flick it hard every morning to get the residual water out after rinsing, it may fall apart.  So I&#x27;m extra careful and flick only with squeezing the bristles with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great shave. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The soap and mug are great but you will spend more time shaving off the brush hairs then your face</li>
    <li> I purchased this product new however, when I took it out of the box it had been clearly used. The soap was not packaged like in other reviews seen online and had brush hair mixed in. The bowl had dried soap all over and the stand had dried water spots along the base and back.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy into all the nonsense this is a basic do as it describes product. I guess if you want a hobby go for the rare or expensive stuff. Otherwise if you simply want to shave and have a better shave then disposables this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open package, add water, swirl the brush then apply to your face. Thats all the thought I put into it and guess what no issues or problems at all. If it broke in shipping return it it could also happen to a $300 brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop the nonsense, shave and go about your day.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  No more razor burn.  I would&#x27;ve given 5, but the brush came out of the handle (nothing a little epoxy couldn&#x27;t fix, though).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better quality brushes on the market, but for the money spent it would be very hard to complain about this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this brief. The bottom of the soap dish is very narrow (only Van Dar Hagen soap will most likely fit). The soap itself has a nice scent but really isn&#x27;t a very effective lather for shaving. The stand works OK but is cheap plastic and the Van Der Hagen razor tends to slide out of it. Worst of all, the hairs of the brush completely came apart from the brush handle on it&#x27;s first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit doesn&#x27;t come with a razor either, FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m going to have to say this kit isn&#x27;t worth $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I do own the Van Der Hagen razor as well. Compared to the Van Der Hagen kit, the razor is at least usable.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 17 year old son, this is his review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years of shaving with an electric razor I was not happy and needed a shaving method. I purchased this set along with an Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor and haven&#x27;t used my electric razor since then. It took a couple of weeks to get the hang of shaving with a safety razor but now I have gotten the hang of it and can get an extremely smooth shave without cutting or nicking myself. Now for the Van Der Hagen set:&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap is very easy to lather although I find that i can face lather better than i can mug lather.&lt;br /&gt; The soap provides a fresh scent but leaves my face a little dry afterwards. Although I&#x27;ve found that applying Nivea sensitive skin post-shave balm fixes that problem.&lt;br /&gt; The brush is a decent starter brush and over the first month and a half i&#x27;ve only lost a few of its hairs. I will definitely be buying a better one but this one is more than good enough for a starter.&lt;br /&gt; The brush stand is very good as well because it holds both my brush and razor and looks decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to start shaving with  safety razor</li>
    <li> Ok, I haven&#x27;t fully used it yet, but I did whip up a lather and apply to part of my face when I got it during my lunch break.  The brushs seems much better than the VDH boar that I have.  It was much easier to make a nice thick lather with this brush.  The other seems to eat my lather somehow.  It looks very cool, and performs well, and the soap smells very nice.      Great deal for $27.00.  I&#x27;m not sure you can find anything that will beat the value.</li>
    <li> Just as described. The only issue was the box was heavely damaged and wasn&#x27;t presentabally pretty for gifting.</li>
    <li> Wheather u are a beginer or old to shaving soaps  this is a great kit.  I use this kit brush stand and mug even if I try diifferent soaps.  Which brings up another good point,Ii tend to re order the soap.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a girl daily shaver  28 bucks was nothing for this value.     the soap smells great and not really targeted  for just men from what i smell/not drying or   irritating for me, my legs are loving it.  super badger lather brush, nice acrylic stand and the mug...  i love the mug.  a best buy item for me of nice quality  they state luxury and it is correct</li>
    <li> Smell of the soap is awesome. The mug is a mug, but looks nice. The stand isn&#x27;t anything great - just a clear plastic stand. The brush is okay, I get a few hairs off every time I shave. The brush doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.&lt;br /&gt;My merkur 180 fits in the stand okay.</li>
    <li> This product was average at best.  The bristles of the brush continually fall out and are left on your face or in the bowl.  Also, the cream doesnt lather well at all.  Its basically the same as shaving with regular soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set and a safety razor about a year ago. The mug and soap are top notch but the brush still sheds. Overall it still is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have lived through safety razors, electric razors, and modern 4-blade razors.  Being tired of always buying shaving cream, I decided to \\&quot;revert to nature\\&quot; and get the old-time shaving mug and brush.  It was as advertised and shipped quickly.  All I have to do now is find the satisfactory straight razor to match.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving and this set is great for beginners! Really nice scent, and good for your skin, cleared up my acne. will recommend!!</li>
    <li> The bulb fell out of the brush after 3 months. Otherwise I completely love the set.</li>
    <li> Meets my needs. Brush is sturdy &amp; does not shed like my old one did. Glad I bought it. Happy to find a product like this on line.</li>
    <li> If you ever plan on shaving, this is a must buy. Once you shave with this set up anything else will feel like dragging a dull butter knife across your face.</li>
    <li> The hairs fell out every time I shaved (yes, I stored it properly after each use). Eventually, the entire brush fell out of the handle. I attempted to hot glue it back into place, but it kept losing hairs and falling out. There is nothing wrong with the soap cake that came with the mug, but it is also nothing special. It&#x27;s just plain, unscented soap. I really like the mug. I&#x27;m still using it along with the brush stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For replacement products, I went with the Escali Badger Shaving Brush and Proraso Shaving Soap Tub for a total of about $23.00 and I&#x27;m much happier with them.</li>
    <li> I just got this product today and it&#x27;s a very nice looking kit for a beginner to wet shaving. You can wet shave without the joy of making the lather with a nice badger brush and a cup that is very easy to handle. Also the stand is well made... You can either put a straight razor or a safety razor to hold and it looks really nice instead of your equipment sitting on the side of the sink. I suggest you get this kit if you are new to wet shaving. The soap that comes with this kit lathers very nice and has a scent to it that isn&#x27;t overpowering. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I just made my switch to a de safety razor, and figured I would go all in on the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; thing and try this set.  the quality of the brush is wonderful, It is soft and easy to use.  The shaving mug is sturdy and well made, I know I will get years of use out of it. The shaving soap is wonderful.  It has a great sent, it softens my beard and does a great job of providing a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to start shaving with a DE you cannot go wrong with this shave set.</li>
    <li> for a reasonable price this set is a good starter kit</li>
    <li> The mug is nice and the brush is pretty well made I have had no hairs come loose and it makes a good lather. Great for beginners!</li>
    <li> Great product for all you old school shavers. I have been using it for over a year and is still in great shape. The brush is still in great shape and still creates a great lather. The brush and razor plastic holder is still functional after hitting the floor a few times. And the ceramic lather cup I think is great cause I hear it up really hot under the hot water and it makes the lather nice and hot just before it gets applied to my face. The lather itself is nice very basic not anything to complain about but there are better out there to get a better lather and nicer feeling shave. All in all great kit to start with them just upgrade your lather soap when you run out.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to switch to wet-shaving, so this is my first kit.  Initially, I can say that I&#x27;m greatly pleased.  The brush:  The brush is 100% pure badger hair, so it&#x27;s good, but not like the more expensive brushes.  (UPDATE: I personally prefer boar brushes like Omega now.  This one got too flimsy for my preference after 1.5 years).  Like all brushes, there is a stinky smell when the bristles are first wet, but this went away after soaking the brush in hot water, washing with shampoo, and two uses while shaving.  Lathers very well, and feels nice on the face.  The black handle looks sleek and is easy to grip. (UPDATE: The handle and brush head are pretty small, so I like I mentioned earlier, I prefer larger brushes like Omega now).  The bowl: Nice sized bowl.  The included shave soap fits in perfectly.  The sides are high, which is great for not spilling while lathering.  Sturdy construction and nice sleek design.  Was a little dusty from packaging (as was everything else), but can&#x27;t complain about that.  The stand: Just a simple acrylic stand.  Brush fits in perfectly, and my razor hangs nicely as well.  Not the most sturdy thing, but it does its job.  Sort of tacky looking due to the clear material, but it does its job.  The soap: Amazing soap!  Lathers nicely and smells amazing!  A nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It actually freshens up my whole bathroom sitting in the cup after a shave.  It does a great job of preventing irritation while shaving, so great all around!  I was torn between buying this product, or its cheaper companion, the Van der Hagen premium set.  I&#x27;d say the extra $20 for the higher quality brush, bigger bowl, and stand make it worth it.</li>
    <li> Junk. After a couple dozen shaves the brush broke loose from the handle. Even more annoying since it was a gift from my wife. Spend a little more on a top quality brush.</li>
    <li> My razor is too tall to sit in the stand, it really needs to be about an inch taller.  I had previously bought the cheaper model without the stand, and will probably switch back to that one.</li>
    <li> I bought two shave sets, one for my husband and the other for my father. They both love them. My husband raved over it again and again. My father even threw away his old brush which he has had forever. And he never throws things he likes away. That says a lot. Thank you for this product. We recommend this it to any man who wants to or does shave with a brush and mug. It also looks sleek and manly.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he seems to really like it.  Uses it every morning and likes the soap that came with it.</li>
    <li> The product is one of the best shaving mugs I have had the soap is very good the brush is excellent quality</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product . I gave it to my Son for Christmas . He was very happy with it . It has lasted a long time .</li>
    <li> I always wanted a beaver shaving brush and so far for the price this set has been great. I highly recommend using it because it allows you to get a close shave. The only bad thing i notice is that the brush smells but i heard it eventually goes away...but for the price one cant really complain</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a father&#x27;s day gift. He loved it: &amp;#34;I felt like such a gentleman.&amp;#34; He has very sensitive skin, and said this really helped. Next on the list is a straight razor for him.</li>
    <li> cool set just wish the brush was softer</li>
    <li> Great set! Only down fall is the brush smells terrible for a while until it&#x27;s had some good use</li>
    <li> Well. The bowl is really nice, I&#x27;ll give it that, the stand works well. The soap does take a little elbow grease. Doesn&#x27;t make an extremely cushy lather like some other soaps but it is very slick on your face if you know how to lather soap. If you&#x27;re looking for a strong smelling soap look elswhere. The best thing to do is take a about a teaspoon of hot water from your tap and pour it on top of the puck towards the end of soaking your brush for about 3-5 minutes. The brush is very rough to start but this is normal. Make sure you soak it well every time and soak it and work it in your hand a couple times in hot water over a couple days before you use it, or you will get one hell of a brush burn on your face. The brush stinks, as do most hair brushes when you get them, but i&#x27;ve been using this kit for about two weeks now and it still has not gone away, while its not as strong anymore, you can still smell it through the shave soap. Not the greatest kit in the world, but the bowl and stand are really nice, and the soap and brush will make good back ups, or very least a good starter kit for a newbie. I would give it higher marks if it wasn&#x27;t for the brush stinking so bad. Solid kit.</li>
    <li> This is a great looking set.  You cant really tell by looking at the picture but the shaving cream bowl is pretty big.  It all looks great together, especially with my new Edwin Jagger Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to wet shaving only months ago when, for Father&#x27;s Day, my son surprised me with the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Kit, an [[ASIN:B003LW4LJK Edwin Jagger De86bl Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor, Black]] and some [[ASIN:B001OXTHJC Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]] blades. I was surprised how the VDH kit exudes quality well beyond its very modest price: the flared black ceramic mug has a classic shape and heft, the badger hair brush is soft and lush and its chrome-trimmed black handle cradles comfortably in the palm, the soap lathers up luxuriously (as its name would suggest), and the acrylic stand, while not a traditional material or design, is very functional, providing a rest for both brush and razor (even including a dimple to stand a straight razor upright). I quickly found I can spend quite a large amount on similar items individually, should I become a shaving connoisseur or collector. There may well be finer, certainly more expensive, products out there in the burgeoning market of wet shaving products, but I am quite happy with this kit as it is. For price and quality, the VDH kit is the bomb.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for beginners who want to dip their feet into wet shaving, but aren&#x27;t prepared to spend a lot of money.  Unfortunately in this case, you get what you pay for.      For starters, be aware that this brush sheds a LOT.  A little shedding is to be expecting on the first few uses, but after two months, I&#x27;m still losing clumps of hair with each shave.  On top of this, I do not believe this brush is 100% badger as described.  While this brush is reasonably soft, it is nowhere near as soft as many badger brushes I&#x27;ve felt since this purchase.  The brush is well constructed and feels good in your hand, but it is not a joy to actually use.  The hairs are a bit coarse and tend to poke at the skin.  I&#x27;ve since dropped $30 on a true badger brush.    The soap smells great, but is a trick to lather.  A tiny amount of water on the brush will result in a thin, bubbly foam that doesn&#x27;t coat the skin well.  But no water on the brush, and the soap won&#x27;t lather at all.  After two months of practice I still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand of soap to try.    All that said, I love this bowl  I love the look and feel of it.  I&#x27;m a tall guy with large hands, and this bowl just fits so comfortably in my grip.  It&#x27;s absolutely perfect.      The stand is also very well-constructed, though the clear acrylic may not fit the aesthetic that some would expect to see in this kind of set up.  I&#x27;ve noticed more experienced wet shavers prefer a metal or wooden stand.  But this is entirely personal preference for the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of your kit.  As I said, the stand works great for what it does.    I would definitely not recommend this kit for the seasoned wet shaver.  This kit is made for beginners, and priced as such.</li>
    <li> This has been a great starter set for me.  I don&#x27;t shave more than once or twice a week, but the results are always very good and I get great lather with the brush and soap.  The only complaint I have is that the razor just doesn&#x27;t fit in the slot on the stand very well and tends to fall out if you bump it, but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the cup but the bristles came out of the handle not long after purchasing this item. I glued them back in and haven&#x27;t had a problem since. Not real thrilled with the design of the stand for brush and razor. Will probably buy a different stand.</li>
    <li> Tired of throwing aerosol cans away and also running the risk of clogging drains.  This system also prolongs the life of the blades as the additives in the aerosol shave creams coat the blades and clog them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for about a year. The rest of the set is a nice finishing touch. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Bristles started falling out like crazy after 1 month.</li>
    <li> I give this three stars because the mug stand and brush are fine but the soap smells awful. It has a real chemical smell makes you wonder after you use it if you smell as bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product about a month after it broke. The badger brush handle broke off from the actual brush portion. This should not happen from a product even if it is from a &#x27;kit&#x27;. Was really enjoying it until this happened. NOT ACCEPTABLE.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. The shave you get with a good lather is second to none. Love it.</li>
    <li> The built is well made for the cup, stand the the brush it self however the hairs on the brush just get off way too often. But either way it is a good quality shaving set if you do manual shaving.</li>
    <li> Very nice starter set.  The soap works as well and feels comfortable on the face.</li>
    <li> This was my first set into brushes and bar soaps instead of a can gel. I got to say the experience was rather pleasant. I guess I like the older ways in some points. Anyways the brush is still holding up as well as the bowl. Of course the soap is gone now. It took about a month or so for the bar soap to be used up but I was shaving everyday. The soap didn&#x27;t lather too much but it is a lower end soap. As for the brush it took some getting used to. It maybe just the way I was putting the soap on but it seemed kind of prickly even after much use.  I have no other brush to compare this to so it may have been user error. All in all I Would recommend this to anyone for a starter set.</li>
    <li> Got this and a Merker razor as a gift for the spouse.  He loves it!  The set is very handsome and well made!  This is by far the happiest he has been with any gift... ever!  The price on a set like this cannot be beat!  Tha apothocary bowl is solidly weighted.  Badge brush feels so comfortable in hand.  Soap smells great.  And the windmill monogram just makes it pop!  And the razor along with - shaves very smooth and very close, no tugging on his face, the razor just glides.</li>
    <li> very nice shave set.mug is super and the shave soap is very good.nice brush with stand.pricewise this set can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> After two months of ownership, I am ready to make my assessment: I love this set. It looks excellent on my countertop, the brush lathers well and feels great on the skin, the mug makes lathering extremely easy, and the stand is very functional in that it holds the brush and my razor perfectly. I had a little trouble lathering the soap, but i am relatively new to wet shaving and I am not about to take off points from the review based on my lack of technique, particularly when many people have had excellent results with it. I use [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] in the mug instead and it works beautifully. I plan on upgrading the brush to a silvertip when this brush meets its end, which shouldn&#x27;t be for a while as I am not having the issue with shedding that others seem to have experienced. For the price, this set cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> good smells creamy smooth</li>
    <li> This is a great set for the price.  A couple of notes though:  First, this set includes a \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; brush.  This is the lowest grade of badger hair (higher grades, in ascending order are \\&quot;fine badger\\&quot; and \\&quot;silvertip badger\\&quot;) and often has the tips cut off in order to form the brush shape.  If the tips are cut the brush won&#x27;t wear in as well, so I was hoping this wasn&#x27;t the case but it is.  Given this, the brush is a little scratchy and will stay that way.  The upside is that it works up a very good lather, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.  Second, the apothecary mug is meant to have the soap left in the bottom.  The soap that&#x27;s included has a pleasant mild scent, lathers up well, and fits nicely into the mug, so that&#x27;s nice.  However, you might have difficulty using other soaps with it and the remaining space is difficult to work up enough lather in.  It would be nice if it were a little taller and tapered out further with a milder slant.  For the price and what&#x27;s included, it&#x27;s still a great set.  I got this set along with the [[ASIN:B003LW4LJK Edwin Jagger De86bl Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor, Black]], which fits nicely in the stand, matches the style, and is a great value as well.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews, and users complaining about breaking. Should have listened to them. It was exactly as they mentioned. I can not believe they didn&#x27;t use good quality gum to stick those two pieces. send a mail to manufacturer, no response. I would give 0 starts if it was an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other note, I like the cup and soap. There were no issues with them.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for a beginner (which I am). The soap goes on smoothly, the mug is cool and the brush is sturdy and reliable.</li>
    <li> Got this for my father because he is constantly shaving his head and face. so I thought why not do it right and get all the right things to do so. he loved it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The only con is that it does not come with a razor or the option to buy a razor. An option to buy blades would be a nice option also.</li>
    <li> I use a straight razor not one of those sissy-boy safety razors so you know you&#x27;re talkin to a real man here and I&#x27;m going to give you a real man&#x27;s opinion on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I got this last night and used it for the first time. The brush is soft enough to take your face to Valhalla on the cool breeze of the summer ocean yet still strong enough to get under the titanium like hair that grows out of my face. The bowl is a nice porcelain material that is light enough to hold comfortably, yet strong enough to beat someone over the head if they interrupt your sacred shaving time. The mere sight of me holding it made my wife instantly gasp and run to the kitchen to make me a sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;The soap produces a perfect lather and the smell of it is just on par with &amp;#34;Come here woman&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve probably killed a shark with my hands&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The stand that comes with it holds the brush perfectly, however, I could not see it being able to hold a safety razor at the same time, but that&#x27;s okay for me since I&#x27;m not a woman and don&#x27;t use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this is a great product through and through. it will have you with a close shave while you sing whatever Celine Dion song you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great deal at twice it&#x27;s price. Great quality, good lather, nice look, man stuff here.</li>
    <li> It took me two tries to get a set without a broken mug, but it was worth the hassle.   * Brush - This brush is really nice, especially for the price. It is much better than my lower-end badger brush I purchased from The Art of Shaving. It is a medium sized brush that builds a great lather quickly and holds a decent amount of water. Quite a few hairs will fall out in the first couple of uses, but that is to be expected I suppose.  * Stand - Ok this is pretty useless, but if you don&#x27;t have a stand for your brush and razor it will do. It isn&#x27;t fancy but the construction is solid.  * Mug - Some people don&#x27;t like building a lather in the apothecary mug. If I use a bit more water in my brush than I would if I were just loading it, it seems to build fine in the mug. In fact, I think it builds very quickly. They key is using enough water.  * Soap - The luxury line soap is fantastic. Nice smooth lather and a pleasant scent.   Overall this is a good deal for the new wet shaver or someone looking to ugprade their shaving setup.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly in excellent condition.  Everything is good, although I don&#x27;t like the size of the shaving mug, it workswell with the brush and the soap is pretty good too.</li>
    <li> As the title implies, my biggest beef with this set is that hairs are continually falling out of the brush (even after 5-6 weeks of use). This is my first experience in many years using a brush, but I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;d also point out that the stand is made of acrylic and isn&#x27;t really what I&#x27;d call \\&quot;luxury\\&quot;; the photo doesn&#x27;t make that clear (for some reason with the appearance of the edge of the acrylic I thought when I ordered it that it was stainless wire or chromed tubing or something).</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving yet, you must. Get some good cream ( I like Taylor of Old Bond Street), a shaving brush, and a mug. That alone will improve your shave dramatically. After that, you can start looking at a nice razor.</li>
    <li> Beginner to this style shaving and this was a great set to buy.  Sure there is better stuff out there for more money, but I have ZERO issues with this set.  Shave stand is much nicer than looks in photo.  Very thick \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;.  Cup is great and perfect size.  Brush works very well.  Will probably go back to creme instead of the soap, but this was a good way to try it and the cup will work well for creme also.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Overall i am happy with it. However, the stand couldn&#x27;t be any cheaper.</li>
    <li> Everything was as described! The boar brush is smooth, the stand is great and the soap and dish work very well!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this kit to anyone looking to expect the brush to hold up. With every shave, even 6 months into using it, I can count at least 5 bristles falling out. I&#x27;m not rough on this brush and I do not soak it in extremely hot water.&lt;br /&gt;The mug is nice, but the soap leaves my skin dry and taut and the stand doesn&#x27;t do an exceptionally good job in keeping my DE razor in a very &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; position. It slides out from time to time.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect gift for father&#x27;s day, I can not wait for my dad to see it, he will for sure love it!</li>
    <li> I had a decent brush that fell in the toilet. Was new to wet shaving but enjoy the process and decided to replace the brush and look for a stand that would hold my razor and whatever brush I decided to buy. This set was available online but also found it at Target. Bought at Target and was impressed by what was included for the price. The brush is ok for a beginner (which I am)and the mug and stand are good quality. I prefer shaving sticks as I find the mug splash/foaming process to be too messy and time consuming. I don&#x27;t use the mug or soap, but I still think the stand and brush justify the price. The brush does shed a bit even months after purchase but  I think the stand is great. I figure I paid $19.99 for a mediocre brush and a nice razor/brush stand. If you are wanting to try wet shaving like your grandpa used to do, this would be a cheap way to check it out. Don&#x27;t pay $30 on line plus shipping though</li>
    <li> After shaving with cartridge razors and two electric shavers that went out in a couple of years I decided to go back to the safety razor. I ordered the mug set and it met my expectations and then some.  I use to shave with a brush and shaving soap, but haven&#x27;t done it in years. The mug is ceramic but it is not to heavy and has a good balance. The brush is better than what I had used in the past which was boars hair, this is badger hair a lot softer. The soap lathers up fairly quickly. I like the stand as it not only holds the brush it also holds the razor, this is a plus as the razor doesn&#x27;t get moved around to dull the blade.I would definitely recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product update 9/1/13: I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and found it to be excellent. Some of the reviews said the brush looses bristles, like any good natural hair brush weather it be a house painters brush or an artist brush this is normal.&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers quickly. One reviewer said it was hard to lather, I found this to be somewhat true, the solution is to wet the soap down a little and it lathers fine. I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to shave with a brush and mug.</li>
    <li> This purchase was based on all the reviews that were written. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it. It&#x27;s a great starter kit and I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> The box arrived without the badger brush or stand.  I was very excited to do my first shave, but the main pieces were missing.  I contacted Amazon and they said they would have a new set delivered the next day and provided me with a return label for my defective product.  Turns out, they were out of stock and I wouldn&#x27;t get a new replacement for at least another week.  I canceled the replacement order and I am currently getting a refund.  I recently found the Van Der Hagen Premium shave set at my local CVS for ten dollars, and I intend to buy that instead.  I will simply purchase a separate brush/shaver stand to go along with the Van Der Hagen Premium kit, and still come out ahead of the Van Der Hagen Luxury kit.</li>
    <li> This set is so nice!! I got it for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. High Quality item. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!It was worth the price you pay for it to.</li>
    <li> This kit is full of great products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap: it has a pleasing, mild, masculine scent. It lathers easily, and is very lubricating.  It works best if pre-soaked in hot water for a moment and drained before being worked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush: it holds a good deal of water, builds lather well, and takes up excess lather (great for later passes!). It also rinses clean with no fussing. The bristles do NOT fall over willy-nilly; you&#x27;ll be able to use the semi-rigid bristles with authority when you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug:  foremost -- it&#x27;s handsome. (That&#x27;s the only distinction I notice between &#x27;shave mugs&#x27; and latte mugs)  It&#x27;s also a nice size, shape, and weight.  It&#x27;s a good balance between paying a few dollars for a bathroom display piece and going overboard on laughably-overpriced, purpose-built apothecary mugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On balance, I&#x27;m glad the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the stand. I swear, I even *looked* at it funny and it dropped my brush! (A dab of hot glue fixed the tilt problem.)</li>
    <li> Great set. I have the razor from VDH also and it fits &amp; hangs perfectly. The brush is excellent and the quality is very good. Great value comp. to like brands.</li>
    <li> Soap is okay, I don&#x27;t find it is better then a shaving cream. A perfectly find staters kit.</li>
    <li> This set is my intro to brush shaving.  Two months in and the brush is holding up great and I still have tons of soap left.  This will really save money on shave cream in the long run. It really gives you a great shave. The soap makes your face feel great.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy for the scent of the soap at first but quickly got used to it.  All in all a great shaving set.  Will buy this for a gift for brothers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father for Christmas and he is asking me for more soap. He loves this product.</li>
    <li> i love it! everything looks great and the soap smells so good! i didnt have any issues with hair falling out of the brush like other people are saying on here but ive only used it like 4 times... either way it was a great value and cant complain</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I was sceptical to buy this product ennitially due to all the claims of loose badger hairs. I went ahead and bought the product anyways because of its price. Not knowing what to expect I was pleasently surprised. So far, after weeks of use, I have only lost one or two hairs. Not a big deal but so much better than what was expected.</li>
    <li> So was I, five months ago.  I spent A LOT of time researching how to get started, and my research led me to a few options.  Once I had my blades and razor, I came here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First of all, this is a great starter set.  I really recommend this for beginners because it contains everything you need and products like the ceramic cup and plastic stand don&#x27;t go bad.  Second, this is a good, cheap set for those who want to try a lather rather than getting all those expensive items individually.  Save the fancier items for later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set isn&#x27;t perfect, my brush just broke during the fourth month.  The adhesive that kept the bristles to the knob weakened and separated.  But for me, a novice at the time who was still getting the hang of creating a lather, I still have some of the lather left.  Both of the perishable items fair well.  This is a budget starter set, go in with the right expectations.  A breaking brush was fine - I had accomplished my goal (and I am now hooked on double edged shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the set that will absolutely get you to the point where you can safely decide on whether to invest more in this style of shaving.  I feel this is the objective of the set, and it is flawless in that regard.  And like I said, its not like the ceramic bowl or plastic stand go bad (minus dropping the ceramic).</li>
    <li> Got for my brother for Christmas. He was really impressed with the quality and style. The price was very reasonable for the quality. A++.</li>
    <li> This is my save all for ravor bumps.  I have sensitive skin and the soap/butter doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> So far he likes it.  First time he&#x27;s ever used something like this.  I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if the logo on the soap cup and brush wasn&#x27;t printed on.  It will wear off, just a matter of time.  The stand is just acrylic.  This is a nice set, and I&#x27;m glad he is happy, but it&#x27;s over-priced.  I&#x27;ll look for stainless steel as a replacment.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of ways to remove hair. [...] , this is a nice gift for a man.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaving kit for a while and I found this one that had pretty good reviews! It is a great product and the brush is amazing!</li>
    <li> the brush can be better but i bought it for the cup and that was perfect</li>
    <li> The brush is cheap and clumps up after the first week of use. It sheds horribly and the soap&#x27;s lather isn&#x27;t really desirable. The mug is cool though.</li>
    <li> Good set to begin with.</li>
    <li> I have a new found respect for shaving because of this product. Used to Id use my can of shaving cream and those ridiculously priced razors. My face would get nicks and it would dry out but now I get a closer shave (the safety razor is sold separately)and the soap keeps my face soft. Great product and it won&#x27;t break the pocket book.</li>
    <li> Great product that I recommend to everyone who grows hair. I want to order a few for my family for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Good beginners set. My badger brush fell apart on the fourth use, the handle separated from the brush just from regular use. Overall though not a bad product, just invest in a better brush.</li>
    <li> As someone just starting out in wet shaving this was a great buy. I was really happy with the stand as it holds the brush and razor. The mug is nice and big. Both the brush and soap are fine. I am able to build a good lather with them.</li>
    <li> This is a great little set up for a decent price. The brush holder is a simply plastic design that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The brush is decent quality; holds water real well and makes a good lather. The soap does dry my face out a little more than I hoped for, but it leaves my face nice and smooth so my lady can rub face lotion on it. The soap fits perfectly in the mug and doesnt bounce around while I&#x27;m creating lather.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will likely order more.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I am relatively new to the straight razor bit...My only complaint is the brush...a lot of hairs fell out initially stabilized then a ton more fell later on...you are better off buying the synthetic brush here on amazon and soap and mug separately....the synthetic brush rocks...it is the  Beauty Strokes H.I.S Shaving Brush and I highly recommend that...</li>
    <li> Just got into trying to take my grooming seriously and have to say this was a perfect way for me to start.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I don&#x27;t continue buying their soap, I&#x27;m glad this is what I went to to convert from the regular spray-foam-at-face-then-quintuple-blade-my-face to a more traditional style of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent brush, pretty good feeling lather, weighty/solid mug, and of course a convenient stand.</li>
    <li> Target sells this for less than 20 dollars. Check their store for a deal on this item and save ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also sell the brush for less than ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Pag</li>
    <li> The shaving stand, cup, and soap I found to be quite satisfactory, and elected to use an additional dish in which to place my shaving soap (I prefer to lather inside the cup rather than on my face).  The downfall that I found was with the included shaving brush; I&#x27;m not sure whether it may be due to the quality of bristles, loft of the hair, or number of bristles in the brush, but I&#x27;ve been having quite a bit of difficulty with creating a satisfactory lather versus the brush which I bought from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the set is was a good buy, and have no additional complaints.</li>
    <li> I went to the Art of Shaving, and they wanted to sell me a $200 brush and another $100 on shaving cream.  This does exactly what you need it to do, and includes a razor stand and a soap dish.  Even if you&#x27;re just doing classic wet shaving (not with a straight razor), you should think about getting this.  Better than the canned cream/gel that I&#x27;d been trained on.</li>
    <li> I like it and decided to spend the money and get the good stuff.. Works amazingly well. spend the money and get the badger brush and make sure you hang the brush after use so that it drip dries</li>
    <li> The brush is good and so is the cup, but the stand is bad it broke when I hand washed it so not bad for 30$</li>
    <li> brush is a really good quality for the money. husband likes the soap that comes with too. the stand isn&#x27;t great but a bonus at this $</li>
    <li> Got this set and was very impressed. The badger brush is real fine quality. Big full brush that feels great on the face, it also has a silver ring around the bristle base that looks very nice. The mug is nice and heavy with wide sides so it&#x27;s easy to build lather in. The acrylic brush stand is both stylish and functional. Great Product! Great Buy! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This little set comes with a decent badger brush, a great mug, the soap is meh, and the stand is down right crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the brush is good, I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a more premium one. The plastic handle feels especially cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The mug is a mug. It hasn&#x27;t broken. Not much to say beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;The VDH soap included is not my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good, nor does it lather well. HOWEVER, they did include a bonus Col. Conk Bayrum soap which I do actually like.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is crap. It&#x27;s cheap, doesn&#x27;t properly fit my razor (Merkur #34C), and is honestly just awkward to use.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this product. Its amazing. It has a awesome light scent. Lathers very well. And feels great on the skin. Looks great displayed on my bathroom sink also.</li>
    <li> The soap and soap dish is nice. The brush, however, is junk. I used the brush a maximum of 5 times, taking care to hang it to dry every time, and on the fifth time the whole brush portion fell out of the handle while I was using it. Save your money on this one and just buy a different soap and brush separately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now and I still like it. The soap lathers well and smells good. The mug is a mug, you can&#x27;t really go wrong there. The brush is pretty good, it sheds but nothing crazy. The stand isn&#x27;t the best for double edge safety razors, there is nothing to hold it in. If you move the stand while the razor is in it be carful to keep it from falling out.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my husband, who has very sensitive skin.  He shaves, and his face is red for hours. I&#x27;ve tried many sensitive skin products for him, and after doing some research, I thought I would try this kit to see if using shaving soap made a difference.  Wow, it sure does!  His face has so much less irritation after shaving now.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a straight razor a while back and got this shave set to go along with it. It&#x27;s a good little set with basically most everything you need. The soap is fine. The fact that it comes with a stand for the brush is nice. That way you can use it, and set the brush in the stand to dry off for the next shave. I was a little disappointed with the brush itself. Within a couple of shaves, the hairs began to come out. Not sure if that is supposed to happen, but I expected it to last a little longer before that started. For the price, it was fine. That said; if you are able, I might suggest holding out and spending more on a quality brush designed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a good set for someone just getting into shaving with a straight razor and not wanting to really invest a lot into before you&#x27;re sure this is what you want. If you&#x27;re thinking this would be a good gift for someone who already uses a straight razor, I would encourage you to aim a little higher. Anyone who already does this will be able to tell.</li>
    <li> Alright, so i&#x27;m going to start off saying i watched this item for a while, until i finally saw it placed at a friends house where it in person it didn&#x27;t look as flimsy or bad as i had expected so went with the purchase. If you are in the market for a safety razor and badger brush and stand, then in all honestly you shouldn&#x27;t bother looking any further. This is the most reasonably priced stand, brush and dish you will be able to find. Other companies, which shall remain un-named, charge ridiculous amounts of money for the same if not a proprietary functioning device similar to this. Now, i&#x27;ll break this up into Pros and Cons as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Affordability&lt;br /&gt;- Functionality&lt;br /&gt;- Badger Brush is of mediocre quality, not to say its bad, if purchased alone that would still cost anywhere between $20-30.&lt;br /&gt;- stand is very functional, i was able to put in a mach 5 razr, and what i actually use it for, my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;- stand is sturdy, won&#x27;t fall over while taking anything off the stand or placing it on.&lt;br /&gt;- the base is well designed to equally distribute the weight so it won&#x27;t tip over, fall over.&lt;br /&gt;- there is actually a slight groove where the blade, razr, would go that allows to sit, and drain properly so you won&#x27;t let anything rust&lt;br /&gt;- since there is no metal like the other stands, you never have to worry about it rusting,&lt;br /&gt;- the soap dish is well made, sturdy, easy to grip and lather up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- my safety razor doesn&#x27;t go all the way down to the base, some MAY consider this a con cause it hangs off the top, but i haven&#x27;t had it fall out, tip over anything so far.&lt;br /&gt;- look or appeal, it is plastic, literally, so don&#x27;t expect it to \\&quot;wow\\&quot; you when you get in the mail. This is one of those things that in the long term its functionality will wow you, not the appearance like many others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;- do wish the base had run off drains, so water wouldn&#x27;t pool, but does clean very easy&lt;br /&gt;- the base is flatplastic, so when water does get under it (btw the stand and counter) it will stay, may want to consider placing a rubber non-slip mat under it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all i&#x27;ve been using this set now for over a month i would highly recommend this to anyone even if you are going to be using just for a regular disposable razor.</li>
    <li> The brush is OK. 2  weeks of use and smell of badger still in it. The brush and razor holder is also OK, but does not hold well Edwin Jagger razor. The soap has its own cup which I have been using so far, but the black cup is sleek looking and will enjoy with better soap.  For a first set to try out if wet shave is for you, this is a good set to start for the price. You will need to upgrade the brush later most likely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would be a great looking and functional gift. However, when I received it, the windmill logo on the badger brush was scratched (right across the center of the windmill, making it look old and worn) so that the white paint used to print it onto the brush was flaking. Since I wanted to give it as a gift, this defect was unacceptable! I called Amazon CS and they said they&#x27;d send me a replacement in 2 days (for some policy reason I&#x27;d never heard of they were not able to generate a replacement order for a certain # of hours). Dissatisfied with this I called CS again, and this time the representative told me they&#x27;d ship that&#x27;d afternoon and it&#x27;d get to me the next day (I needed it w/in 2 days for my gifting purposes). Thanks goodness I ordered with some buffer time. However, the first replacement set I got had the same issue, as well as the 2nd replacement (my guess is there was a mix up and they didn&#x27;t cancel my first replacement order, but I sent both back regardless). Not sure what was going on here, since I&#x27;d never had Amazon botch an order twice, let alone 3 times. I just couldn&#x27;t believe that all 3 iterations of the same product had the same issue. Then I took a close look at the photos other reviewers had uploaded, and none seem to have the defective brush logo scratch that I did. Perhaps bad luck on my part? I&#x27;m still not sure what happened here. Will most likely limit my purchase of this brand in the future, since Amazon did their best to fix the situation.</li>
    <li> This shaving set is a great value. The brush was a major upgrade for me, replacing my worn out boar&#x27;s hair brush. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the badger bristles coming out when I lather up in the few months that I&#x27;ve owned it. The brush does smell like wet dog the first time you get it out to lather, but that smell goes away after a few uses. The cup design is flaired, I think a bowl design would probably work better. The stand is cheap, and doesn&#x27;t effectively hold a Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl:dr Brush is awesome. Cup and soap pretty nice. Stand: meh.</li>
    <li> I just got into the DE shaving world and based on whats out there figured this set was a good place to start.  Everything is sturdy and well made.  I obviously ditched the provided shaving soap as it just doesnt lather very good but the brush/cup/stand were the reasons why I bought this set anyways.  However, the hair on the brush is slowly falling out which considering the price of a stand alone badger hair brush is to be expected I guess.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the mug mostly, soap is alright, smells good but I&#x27;ll be using different soap when its gone. Or even before that, probably.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use brush I have a better one by RoyalShave.</li>
    <li> The brush was disappointing. Came apart after a couple months and never stopped shedding hairs. The soap was just &#x27;okay&#x27;. Not very rich and blade didnt glide very well. Might be okay for someone just looking to try wet shaving for the first time but doesn&#x27;t do justice to the shaving experience. I would recommend spending a few more bucks and get better quality soap and brush. I did like the mug though.</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint about this kit is that the brush doesn&#x27;t seem very high-quality.  The brush bristles are not very soft and every time I use it, more bristles fall out all over the counter and my face.  Eventually I think there won&#x27;t be any bristles left.  The soap is decent but nothing amazing; the apothecary mug is handy and the stand is excellent for holding the brush and the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/1/2012: the brush is STILL losing bristles every time I use it, and it&#x27;s fraying badly even though I&#x27;m very gentle with it and always dry it after each use.  Downgrading to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this item at Target, having found it for $19.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the set itself is very classy. I typically use a mug to put hotwater and use to rinse my razor, and the apothecary mug serves that purpose well. As far as the brush is concerned, the bager brush feels comfortable and is of nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap actually surprised me in terms of leaving a very smooth face despite my quality of shave with my ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product and would serve as a fine gift.</li>
    <li> The brush is super soft and just a pleasure to use. Very comfortable and does a great job of standing the whiskers up for a nice close shave. The brush is by far the best part of the kit in my opinion. The soap is ok and does lathers rather easily, and is pretty slick, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;The brush/razor stand is FAIR quality. It appears to be made out of plexiglass and is very stable. The only issue I have with the stand relates to the location of the razor holder. The cutout for the razor is directly behind the cutout for the brush, which makes getting to the razor rather awkward at times. But this is purely a personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving mug is GREAT quality. It has a nice little T-Handle on the side that fits nicely between your index and middle finger, giving you a secure hold without causing you to bend your wrist in an unusual way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I used to cringe each time when buying shaving gel canisters and overpriced cartridge refills for my old Gillette Mach 3/Fusion razors, so finally I figured that I&#x27;d try shaving with double edge safety razor. I did a lot of research into it and saw that most of the variations in good and bad experiences with shaving with a DE safety razor included a number of smaller, contributing factors, but primarily only two main factors: the type of razor blade and the type of shaving brush. While I completely was expecting that people to vastly different experiences with different razor blades, I certainly didn&#x27;t think that a shaving brush would make any sort of difference. Nevertheless, since I was new to using a DE safety razor, I figured I&#x27;d trust the advice of long-time DE safety blade users and try to find a decent brush, specifically one made of badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this set while looking for a badger hair brush. I liked that it came with a brush/razor stand as well as a soap dish and soap all for a pretty reasonable price. Since I had never tried a DE safety razor before, I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a lot of money for the initial investment, because to be honest, I had no idea if I was going to like it or not. The aesthetics of the dish, brush, and stand really appeal to me. It looks nice enough to sit on my bathroom counter all the time, and the clear stand bring to the focus to the brush and razor. The brush itself seems to be pretty well made, but it has lost a number of bristles over the last few months. I would say that probably every other time I shave, it loses a bristle or two. The shaving soap feels and smells great. It lathers pretty well and shaving with it is very smooth, although I do use another product ([[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]]) with it as well, so I can&#x27;t say for sure which one contributes more . Eventually, when the brush wears out, I&#x27;ll probably put a little money into a better one...but overall I&#x27;mvery happy with this set, especially considering the overall value.</li>
    <li> I bought this item about 6 months ago, and have used it since. Only complaint is that the hairs on the brush kept falling out, at first a lot, but now not so much. There are still plenty and seems to have stopped happening. Do all brushes do that? The shaving cream, container and stand are all great. I&#x27;m now trying to find more cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for your boyfriend! Highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Nice product,  should have cover for bowl.  Price reduced by 5 dollars day after it received it</li>
    <li> I just started using a safety razor and considered this to be a great companion for a good shave. I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on some of the more aesthetically pleasing pieces just starting out and this kit definitely delivers the goods for what it is.  As for each component, here is my take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush&lt;br /&gt;After unboxing the kit I promptly cleaned the brush with shampoo and warm water and allowed it to dry on the stand. The first use saw a good amount of the bristle hairs coming out which has decreased over the past month of use.  I soak the brush in the cup with hot water and it softens up the hairs quite nicely before applying the shave cream.  I saw a huge difference in the amount of lather using the shave cream I traditionally use.  This is highly important for me because I shave my head and the extra lather really helps prevent the soap from dissipating during the length of the shave.  The brush works well with bar soaps such as the included one, although I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of the one in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for in regards to looks with the simple clear plastic design.  It is a good idea to rest it on a small hand towel to keep it from sticking to the counter when it gets wet. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space which is a huge plus for anyone who knows what it is like to share a bathroom cluttered with hair dryers, tooth brushes, and all kinds of other random objects.  My razor handle (a little cheapie from the local beauty supply store) has a bit of a hard time staying in place as I move the stand around; I don&#x27;t have a problem with this and it may only be my razor but holding onto the handle while putting the stand away is a good idea so you don&#x27;t accidentally allow the blade to slip and cut your hand.  Overall it does the job I want it to do: hold my brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Mug&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this thing.  It is nice and solid and the grip is great.  It fits well on the counter and isn&#x27;t at all slippery when wet so placing it in the shower is not a problem at all.  This mug is definitely staying with me after I upgrade my set in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Soap&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly care for the musk scent of this soap, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it does not get the job done. I have used it a few times and it provides a decent lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this set is exactly what it is supposed to be.  I give it five stars because I didn&#x27;t expect perfection with this set but a great starter kit which this is.  I know I will upgrade items over time as they wear besides the shaving mug.  This is a good first set for someone looking to get into the more traditional (and economically friendly with the price of blades nowadays) form of shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a nice complete shave  kit for the money. I would like a little more fragrant scent, as the scent of the shave crème and balm is a bit subtle and non descript like soap.  I also use Art of Shaving Products, and prefer that line&#x27;s sandalwood and lemon scents a bit better. Crème and balm work well and give it a 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> as a gift or for your self no matter what razor you use these products will get you in to the old school shaving</li>
    <li> Everything in the set is good except the brush which shed a lot, more and more after each use. Broke after 1 month of use by coming off the handle (as some users have shown) and i had to epoxy it back together after about a mount it shed more and more until it became pretty much unusable.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for our 18th anniversary because it&#x27;s porclain and that was the gift suggestion!!! He loved it. He loves the brush the stand and the lather of the soap!!! He won&#x27;t be buying any more shaving cream! It was a pleasant surprise!</li>
    <li> Very nice starter set.  Will try different soaps as this one is used up, but this one smells nice.  The brush is soft.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The soap was decent, and I really like and still use the bowl.    The stand for the brush is plastic, ugly, and tacky looking. That is why you can&#x27;t see it very well in the picture, they are trying to hide how hideous it is.    The brush itself is absolute garbage. If you know what badger hair feels like then don&#x27;t bother with this piece of s***. It falls apart instantly, its super rough, and it leaves hair from the brush in the lather which end up on your face.    I would rather create and apply a shaving lather with a course grit of sandpaper rather than this brush.    TLDR: Even for a first timer, splurge for something better. This is the internet you can find something better that&#x27;s a competitive price.</li>
    <li> This is a great beginner kit.  Provides everything you&#x27;ll need at a great value.  I&#x27;d give it a 5-star rating except for the brush.  It very comfortable and helps my soap lather well.  The only issue is the shedding, which likely has been mentioned in other reviews.  It will lose bristles over time.  Other than that, I have been very happy with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reading this review who&#x27;d take issue with my &amp;#34;provides everything you need&amp;#34; statement please note the kit does not include any shaving lotion/aftershave or styptic pencil for bleeding.  Of course, you can get both for next to nothing at any major store.</li>
    <li> For the money, you won&#x27;t find a better product. I was quite pleased to find a brush, stand, and a mug that I could actually afford. Of course, I was skeptical at first, but upon receiving my order in the mail, I have no regrets. The brush is incredibly soft and the mug looks really cool. The included stand is functional, and it even has a place where I can store my razor. At first, I used soap that I had bought elsewhere, but one day I opted to try my other soap. The included soap has a fresh scent, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The soap smells great, the mug is nice and hefty, and the brush feels nice.  This is my first shaving brush though, and I&#x27;ve noticed that I lose a lot of the bristles from the brush every time I shave.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal, or indicative of the quality (or possible lack thereof) of this brush.  The stand holds the brush well, but it&#x27;s not too secure for the razor.</li>
    <li> Love it so far...  -brush is nice  -mug feels and looks very classy  -soap has a classic clean smell that I really enjoy  -plastic stand works fine and easily fits my merkur razor</li>
    <li> If you are new to the world of double edge shaving this is a good place to start.  Yes, there are better brushes out there, by why break the bank for something you might decide you hate (I have had 0 problems with my brush)?  The bowl that comes with this set is worth the $26 price tag.  I have sensitive skin and the soap that came with the kit didn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
    <li> Well, the old saying about you get what you pay for,definitely  applies here ! it&#x27;s a louzy brush ! it sheds, it&#x27;s rough on the face and the bristles are stiff on the skin ... It doesn&#x27;t bother me though because I only use it to wet my face and then use Gillette foam so it works fine; the soap is ok., it&#x27;s about it for the soap !</li>
    <li> For the money, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase.  The soap is very poor quality.  My brush fell apart after only 2 weeks of normal use.  I would not recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> love shaving old school.  nice set</li>
    <li> The brush falls apart after one year</li>
    <li> For a product marketed as luxurious, I was disappointed by the quality. Mostly plastic except for the mug. The brush handle was poorly glued on, and separated after less than two weeks of use. Not a good value.</li>
    <li> Never shaved with the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; brush before...it perks up my whiskers giving me the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had; time and again. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit.  Not too expensive and great quality would recommend to anyone.  I bought it with&lt;br /&gt;Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor and 5 Shark Super Stainless.  They go great together.</li>
    <li> I really liked this set when it first arrived, the soap smells wonderful, the bowl is very useful, and the stand is adequate.  The brush does initially smell terrible, like fresh off the badger butt, but after several uses the smell was not noticeable anymore.  The one star rating is because the brush has fallen apart after 6 months of use, and I shave once every week, so not a heavy workload.  I really wanted to like the whole package but the premature failure after minimal use leads me to dislike it overall.</li>
    <li> I just got into straight razor shaving. You can certainly spend a lot of money on that stuff. I bought a Parker SR1 straight razor and this kit, as well as proraso shaving soap. It all cost me around $60, I think. The brush is awesome in this kit. The cup too. I haven&#x27;t used the soap yet, but even just for the cup and brush, the price is right. If you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving, buy this kit.</li>
    <li> I will keep this short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is perfect for my Merkur long handled safety razor. It takes up very little counter space and it is sexy enough to leave on display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush may loose a few hairs at first, but after a few shaves, you won&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap could smell better.</li>
    <li> I got this because it looked nice. And it was very inexpensive too. I thought it was a lot more convenient than buying things piecemeal. Boy did I get my money&#x27;s worth. Anyway since I&#x27;m somewhat new to wet shaving I&#x27;ll leave a little room in here for inexperience. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t mixing up the lather good enough or something but the lather was very thin. The soap dried up very quickly before I could even shave it off most times. Was that may be the domino effect of thin lather? But the fact that the so called &#x27;badger&#x27; brush was of crappy quality was not due to inexperience. The thing felt very weak and had very little body to it whatsoever. In addition to that the hairs fell out of its hollow plastic handle in only 1 and a half weeks of me having it. The combination brush and razor blade holder which looks very nice because it&#x27;s clear is barely functional. It maintains its upright position but because the bottom of the base has no friction it slides all over the counter very easily with only a little bump. The only thing worth it&#x27;s salt in the kit is the glass mug/soap holder. They say that if you want to be the boss you have to pay the cost. Yeah that might be a little cute saying but do yourself a favor and avoid the headaches of buying this thing. Either get yourself another kit. Or buy things individually but with a little quality. You believe in LOA? If you do then regardless of the price get something that will make you feel good and look forward to shaving in the mornings. Because you&#x27;re worth it. Right?</li>
    <li> Everything is very nice. The soap that comes with the kit needs to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; before it is perfect, but offers a quality shave once built up into a nice lather. The brush with its stand is also well made.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband so this is what he had to say about it.  The mug is easy to hold and a good size.  The brush lathers us the soap well and lifts up the stubble.  The soap lets the razor glide effortlessly but does have a bit of &amp;#34;old barbershop&amp;#34; scent that he is not especially fond of.  The stand isn&#x27;t much to look at but works well.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 12/4/2013: The brush with this starter set fell apart the other day, so I&#x27;m adding this comment to report what happened.  Be aware that the brush is actually constructed using a wax-like glue to hold the bristles together at its base.  The brush has a metal ring around its base, and this is inserted into the handle.  Glue is applied around the bottom of the bristles to hold it in the handle.  This quality of construction is poor.  Most people soak their brush in hot water before shaving.  With this type of brush construction, soaking the brush in hot water loosens the glue, making it prone to failure.  For this reason, I&#x27;m downgrading my rating for this item from four stars to three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this set, do not use your hand to squeeze excess water out of the brush.  Doing so can pull the bristles and wax out of the handle.  Rather, shake the brush to remove extra water.  Treat the brush gently to ensure the assembly remains intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quality brush uses knots, not wax, to hold the bristles together.  With this brush, you&#x27;ll notice some badger hairs will fall out, over time.  Given the low price of this set, I still see it as a nice starter for those new to wet shaving.  Just be aware that you&#x27;ll probably want or need to replace the brush eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting started with a safety razor can be an expensive proposition. You have the razor, which can set you back anywhere between $35 for a cheapy to $300 or more for a high-quality shaver. You have the cup, the soap, the brush, the shaver and brush holder, the balms, salves, creams, lotions. OMG! If you&#x27;re like me, you want to save money and not have to spend a fortune on replacement razors for your store-bought shaver. The good news is that all these things are a one-time expense. Once you&#x27;re up and running, the price of quality blades is where you&#x27;ll save your money to pay for all these other items, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen shave set gives you everything you need to get started, sans shaver, at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s a starter set for those new to this form of shaving, and it can be used by those experienced also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with a ceramic cup that nicely houses the supplied soap cake. The cup size supports many other manufactured soap cakes also. The cup handle is a little small for those of us with large hands, so if you have large hands, you may want to wrap your digits securely around the entire cup, lest the little handle slips out from between your soapy fingers. A badger brush is provided that is of acceptable quality, although if you take to this form of shaving, you&#x27;ll probably want to upgrade the brush, in time. A stylish, thick, transparent plastic holder has cutouts to hold the brush and your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this set for a few weeks now and like it. It does what it&#x27;s intended to do and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. The quality of the soap is adequate, although it lacks the slickness I can get from other brands of soap, but it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable. It&#x27;s easy on my skin and leaves a mild, clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a starter set and are beginning your ventures into the relaxing world of wet shaving, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the Van Der Hagen shave set. In time, I plan to upgrade the brush, but for now, this is fine. I&#x27;m definitely going to change the soap cake to something with more slickness. What&#x27;s nice about this set is that it&#x27;s a one-stop purchase for those who want to get started with the basic essentials at a reasonable price.or all these other items, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen shave set gives you everything you need to get started, sans shaver, at a very reasonable price.

    <li> All you need is a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 things sold me on this kit:&lt;br /&gt;The stand will hold a safety razor along with the brush. I saw other kits with metal stands but every review said the stand would fall apart. No mention of this stand breaking of falling apart without extreme conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger hair brush. In educating myself on proper techniques, and preferred products. Badger hair is preferred over boar hair, in feel, lather, longevity, and heat retention. Boar brushes usually cost more, finding this in a kit was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush that a lot of reviews are mentioning. I purchased this item on August 23, 2013. Occasional hair fall out but that was expected with a new brush. I suggest once getting the kit to work the brush with some soap in the hand a couple times to work the loose hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this kit I purchaced [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B004UIZFQW 35 FEATHER 7 O&#x27;clock SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD DERBY Blade Sampler]] to figure out what I liked best.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this set.  It is well-made and doesn&#x27;t take up the whole countertop with shaving gear.  He loves shaving with an old-fashioned safety razor, and this soap + brush keeps his skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Okay to start things off let me just say Iexpected the badger brush to be terrible and to my suprise its the best one I own.The soap smells so fresh but not overscented and it lathers within seconds. The mug is great for lathering but if you want a bigger surface to lather you might still need a bowl but its all preference. The brush I got was really smelly but once you break it in its perfect you wont smell it.</li>
    <li> Brush feels so great on your face. The soap is not overpowering like those other company&#x27;s you buy at the supermarket. lather feels smooth when you go across your face with a razor. The cup is solid and the brush as well. I love using these products together. Makes shaving a great time instead of a pain staking hassle.</li>
    <li> this is a great product at a good price,from the quality of the bristoles to the soap you will not be dissapointed would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a really good place to start if you are new to DE wet shaving. It&#x27;s also a good everday set if you just want to DE wetshave and save some money. DE wetshaving can get really expensive if you feel you need to have the most expensive stuff to get the most spiritual shave possible. I think some people get a little carried away with wet shaving. Our dads and grandpas used these things everyday to shave. They used the basic stuff. No $100 badger brushes or $200 dollar safety razors. They seemed to survive just fine. This set has a decent brush, bowl and stand. I have yet to use the shave cream disc but I&#x27;m sure it would be fine too. In fact, I just ordered this set for my son for Christmas. He wants to wet shave and always uses my stuff when he is home from college. I got him this set, a tube of porasso, and an EJ DE 89bl. He will be set for shaving for a long while.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve looked into badger brushes you know that they can get fairly expensive.  This set is a nice set.  The mug is great, the soap is nice, the stand is very useful, but the brush shreds way too much.  The brush does work very well however.  I can get loads of lather if I get the soap-water ratio correct.  I usually just load the brush with soap by swirling it around on the soap about 30-40 times then around in the mug for about a minute.  If I don&#x27;t get the proper lather then I start adding water a little at a time until the mug is overflowing.  The shedding is the only reason this set doesn&#x27;t get five stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this starter set and the brush fell out of the handle after using it 15-20 times.  EDIT: Contacted the company about my brush failure and received a replacement from them.  Changed review from 1 star to 4.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. Its really the best value I could find for soap, cup, brush, and brush stand that I could find. I don&#x27;t love the aesthetic of the acrylic stand, but the brush and cup are nice. Note: not all soaps will fit in this cup! If a soap does not fit, just melt it in a dish in the microwave for a bit, then carefully shove it into the cup. It wont look pretty, but it works. Also, the brush does smell at first. Several soaks in vinegar &amp; water along with a few uses faded the odor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible set to start with and are commonly avaliable at allot of stores. But,  the brush never stops shedding, and the stand will let you&#x27;re razor slip off easily so do not put you&#x27;re expensive razor on it , but i like the mug it&#x27;s the best part of this set;  you can get a better shaving mug  for $25 dollar!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, cup, and stand - convenient and compact on counter top. The soap is amazing - was using a different soap and this one is so much nicer. It seems to create the right amount of lather and is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like it if they had a small tube of soap (cream) and a case for the brush for travel purposes, as traveling with the mug would not work but soap and a brush would be easy to pack.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is a great product. Very comfortable when applying the lather with the brush. An awesome Shave! Stores very well on the counter...</li>
    <li> I looked all over for an apothecary style shave mug and finally settled on this one. It&#x27;s sturdy and looks good. The brush stand is not however. All in all, worth it.</li>
    <li> After some time trying different brushes , i prefer the boar bristle brush for these hard soaps, it seems to go on smoother and doesnt flop around like a badger brush does, and no matter how much i wash the brush: vinegar, soap, etc , that nasty , musky dead animal smell always remains. Any how i like the soap but do not like the brush.</li>
    <li> So i received this kit on Apr 2, 2013, and i like it.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box, the stand came out broken at the top (although there was no visible damage to the exterior of the box), but a little superglue at the joint took care of it pretty well, and is still holding strong today (4 months later).&lt;br /&gt;The apothecary mug is great; it looks fantastic as part of the decor, and the finish holds up really well and cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;The soap it came with smells pretty good, although i may go with a different brand, just to get a sense of different lathers and textures and smells. It fits great in the mug, and can stay there.  (For those of you who have not used a set like this, or are just starting out... the soap stays in the bottom of the mug, and you wet your brush ans scrub the soap to make lather in it. After each shave, the soap will dry up, back to normal.  It makes cleanup easy, as you only need to rinse your brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i gave a 4 out of 5 is because of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the bristles are either, not holding up, not staying in, or of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to get a few of the bristles to &amp;#34;fray outwards&amp;#34; kind of like an old paintbrush. But i will account that to normal use, or maybe i&#x27;m misusing it... i dont know... but i wont fault Van Der Hagen for that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard that the brisltes falling out is kind of like a break in period... each time i shave i&#x27;ll get 5 or 6 bristles fall out.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt seem to be slowing down either. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months, 4 times a week. About 64 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it was an inexpensive set, but at a very good value... especially if you are a novice and don&#x27;t want a lot of startup costs.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give an update in a few months regarding bristles.</li>
    <li> The brush and bowl are made in China and the brush smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is made somewhere else and it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. I followed the instructions to a T but no matter what I tried it just creates a soapy brush. Less water or more water, hot or cold, more pressure or less nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try to shave with the soap and it doesn&#x27;t provide any benefits over just wetting your face with water and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must be odd man out as this kit was a waste of time for me. The stand does hold the brush and a razor. It is not tall enough to fit the bowl under the brush though.</li>
    <li> Provides everything you need to start: mug, soap, badger hair brush, and brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set exudes a high-quality feel with an average build quality and aesthetic. The brush holder is clear acrylic, and I&#x27;ve taken to not using it at all due to its tenancy to easily become dirty. It does have a slot to hold a safety razor, however, which I found useful at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is a pleasure to use, and has stayed in one piece despite multiple drops into my sink and onto the floor. The included soap isn&#x27;t whipped or easy to lather at all, and is perhaps the cheapest component of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some time is needed to break the badger hair brush in, as the bristles are a little prickly at first. After about a year of use, the wax and hairs of the brush slid out of the handle, and was a simple job to glue back together. Continued aggressive use of the brush definitely caused wear and damage, so I&#x27;ll probably be upgrading to a more expensive, higher quality brush soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely an excellent and affordable shaving set for anyone thinking about trying an older-style shave before committing.</li>
    <li> This Van Der Hagen Luxury shaving set is outstanding. The Badger brush is of excellent quality and the shaving soap is very smooth and provides a great shave.  The mug and stand are also of excellent quality. This whole set is a great value. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Van Der Hagen. Thank you very much Amazon.com for a Super-fast delivery. I ordered this set on Friday evening and received it Monday afternoon. Excellent service. AAAAA+++++.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s ok. Not great, just ok. It lathers well, but I stay away from using it mainly because it&#x27;s a nuisance to keep taking the hairs off of my face everytime I use it. I thought the balding of my brush would go away, but it still sheds at a regular pace (5 - 7 hairs per shave). This occurs mainly from the middle of the brush, thus, I think it&#x27;s a manufacturing issue (not enough glue holding the brush hairs in place with the handle). I&#x27;m going to try and return this brush, but it&#x27;s already been a while...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it and actually uses it.  The soap lasts forever, it looks nice on our bathroom counter and he actually likes it too!</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because of the value of the package, but almost gave it 3 because of an issue I had with the brush (see end of review).  I have looked at other badger hair brushes that cost over $50, just for the brush.  Now, they might be the best brushes ever, I wouldn&#x27;t know, but I know that the one that came with this kit works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the shaving soap that came with this, but rather the Proraso Refresh Shaving Soap that so many others have recommended.  It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand for the razor and brush works fine, but it&#x27;s just clear plastic, so nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup works well, and I can hold it easily in my hand while using the brush to work the shaving soap into a good lather.  I saw that someone else who posted a review here said they use a small bowl that was meant for salsa, and I think that would work a bit better.  This one, while not small per se, feels like there is not much room at the bottom, so not much room to swirl the brush around for the lather.  Still, I got used to it and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the brush.  The brush hairs came loose from the handle when I was squeezing the water out of the hairs, i.e. after  rinsing out the soap.  This was probably partially &#x27;user error&#x27;, but also just cheap manufacturing.  I used just the hairs for a couple of days, since they are bundled together by some glue or resin, and then I used some crazy glue to put it back together.  A simple fix,and the brush feels a bit more solid than before.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> It looks nice in the picture but the silk screening of the windmill design (the white markings) were transferred sloppy to the brush.  The bowl looks ok, the soap isn&#x27;t that great, and the brush sheds heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it...it gets the job done just fine but its annoying to squeegee badger hairs when you&#x27;re shaving your face.  Looks cool, but you probably want to buy a better brush.</li>
    <li> Everything looks exactly like the image, the mug is made in China however it still looks quality. Throw in a Merkor safety razor and you have a very good shaving kit with affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It also arrived earlier than the expected date which is a plus)</li>
    <li> I like the mug but I wish the handle was just a bit bigger. The soap was really nice all around...easy to get a good lather and smells nice. The badger brush is soft, comfortable to hold, not too heavy but loses bristles ALL THE TIME, I would say mine loses 4-5 every single time I use it, even after a couple months. The razor is great though I prefer the shorter one. The stand is what it is, it works well for the purpose it is supposed to serve but a metal one looks as nice as it performs.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it and has been wanting it for a very long time. The soap smells really good too. We will be purchasing additional soap bars for it. I think it helps give him a cleaner, closer shave as well!</li>
    <li> You can buy this exact same set at any Wal-Mart for $24.99. its an amazing product the brush is great the soap smells amazing!! but why buy it online and have to pay more and wait for it when you can go pick it up at a Wally world??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the brush n the stand. The sops is good as well. After using the soap it does nit leave slippery stuff on your face which normally happens if u use shaving cream. I m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn’t say it’s the best shaving set out there, but it got the job done which is all I ask. One downfall was that after a month or so the brush started to fall apart. I was kind of upset about that, but it was only $25 so I still think it’s worth what I paid for it. I like the stand it’s sturdy and works well. I’ve been using it a while and haven’t seen anything get any rust which is good.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I ended up replacing everything in this set except the mug and stand.  Its ok for a novelty, but if you are going to wet shave in a traditional fashion, buy the expensive stuff.  Its an investment.  Soap is ok, brush is a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I bought this same shaving set a year ago from one of the popular brick and mortar &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; stores. The shaving soap and bowl are very good; however, the brush is not at all good quality. I will point out that the bristles in my brush are different from what I see of the brush in the picture here at Amazon. My brush&#x27;s bristles are lighter in color. The bristles have been shedding ever since I bought the set. Sometimes there is a sizable clump of bristles that become detached from the handle when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came online here at Amazon to find a good quality brush. As another reviewer suggested, buy a good quality brush separate from  the bowl and soap. Unfortunately, for those of you who have not already purchased the set in order to get the bowl and soap you must buy the complete set. I have yet to find the soap and bowl sold separately. I have found just the soap for sale.</li>
    <li> I was originally interested in getting a piecemeal assembly- buying the brush, soap, and mug separate- but then I saw this kit and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. For the price, it&#x27;s not bad! The cup is a little smoother than I&#x27;d like on the inside, so you need to work the soap into a lather with a little more force using the included brush, but it&#x27;s a good starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the brush is a boar bristle, which isn&#x27;t exactly the highest quality- but if you&#x27;re interested in getting everything you need in one shot instead of looking around for a tweezerman brush, checking out sites for soaps, and hitting up etsy for a cup then drop a few bucks for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint, and that&#x27;s the scent of the soap- it&#x27;s not very appealing, rather bland in fact. I suppose it&#x27;s still good enough if you&#x27;re looking to learn the basics about wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It was one of the cheaper ones on amazon too so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This was just what  we were looking for. My dad was very  pleased  We would recommend this item to our friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shave set for my husband as he shaves the old school way. (Nothing gets closer!) And he told me it was exactly what he was looking for and LOVED the way the soap smelled. The only gripe i had was the plastic holder for the brush. But I couldnt beat the price. I also got this order right when I was supposed to. I would 100% order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He has a beard and mustache but still shaves some of his face.  He likes the kit very much.  I like that he has a place to store his razor.  The brush is nice and he loves the soap.  He likes that it recalls his Dutch heritage.</li>
    <li> It is a nice shave set.  Really attractive mug, nice smelling soap, and cosidering that this is my first badger brush, it is the best I have had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually quite an excellent bang for your buck, if you price out the components individually, you&#x27;re saving probably $15.  The brush works really well for a beginner&#x27;s brush, and really lets you learn on it hard before upgrading to a higher end brush.  Doesn&#x27;t shed too much, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is excellent for an acrylic stand - very well designed, practically speaking, and not unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug and soap is really where it&#x27;s at, though.  The mug is absolutely perfect, and the soap is simply phenomenal.  The scent of it is unmatched, and it lathers beautifully.  Here&#x27;s my review of this soap, upon which I regale people of its magic and wonder. :P http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNY4U82NCPPU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm</li>
    <li> I bought this as a starter kit along with an edwin jagger safety razor with feather blades and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll replace this brush any time soon!  The mug is of a good quality and the soap actually works really REALLY well!  I don&#x27;t know much about the quality of badger brushes, since this is my first, but it definitely feels soft to the touch and is great at distributing lather over my face.  A couple hairs fall out now and then but I&#x27;ve been told that&#x27;s normal, and its only one or two per shave.  I got this thinking it would give me an idea on what to go with as I switched to more \\&quot;classic\\&quot; shaving and I think I&#x27;m going to stick to this set for a while.  A great deal, since buying these items separately would get you paying at least $20 more.  I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t experienced any other more expensive equipment yet, but right now it really feels like a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Almost two years later, and I am still using the same brush and bowl. I don&#x27;t lose as many hairs and it still feels great and works up a lather quite well. This might be because I have been using Proraso cream which I think keeps the bristles good. Absolutely worth it. I upgraded my review to a 5.</li>
    <li> I decided I had enough of paying high prices for only a 4 multiblade pack for today&#x27;s razors that individually didn&#x27;t seem to last that long or shave exceptionally well. So I bought a DE safety razor on line and decided to try going back to the old shaving days of my dad. I also wanted to try out using a brush and shaving bowl just like I remembered him doing when I was a youngster. This shaving kit looked like it should work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I like everything about it except for one temporary thing that I&#x27;ll explain at the end.&lt;br /&gt;1. The clear acrylic shaving stand gave me a place to hang my Merkur HD razor as well as the brush that came with this kit. It is simple and the fact that it is clear should allow it to fit nicely in almost any decor.&lt;br /&gt;2. The soap and bowl are very nice. I really like the light masculine scent the soap has and it seems to work pretty well. You can almost hear &#x27;Timberrr&#x27; as your beard hairs fall away.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brush: I was concerned about a few reviews I had read that said the brush had a bad smell to it. Mine had no smell at all when it arrived but unfortunately after using it in hot water and as I began to apply soap to my face I thought it smelled nasty. I washed and rinsed it in shampoo about 4 times and it still smelled a bit at that point like faint burnt rubber. Finally after a couple more wash and rinses it thankfully did lose that odor and has been fine from then on. I wondered if this initial smell was normal with new badger brushes. But since most reviewers of this set have not even mentioned it at all I am guessing that it is not the norm.&lt;br /&gt;  - Overall I would still recommend this shaving set.If you are unlucky enough to get a brush that seems to smell funny when initially used/wet then remember to use a nice scented shampoo on it; keep lathering and rinsing it and it will eventually lose its bad odor. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and when making the initial investment, buying a starter-kit seemed to make a lot of financial sense.  Every site that I referenced during my research said that you should invest in a badger hair brush.  This kit has one, and the price certainly is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The Brush**&lt;br /&gt;This brush is 100% pure badger hair.  It&#x27;s soft to the touch, and does a good job with lathering/applying the shave soap.  Some other reviewers had some complaints about loose hairs and an odor.  Well, a bit of quick research will tell you that you should expect to find a few hairs in the lather (in the bowl, or on your face) during the first several shaves, as you need to break in the brush.  These hairs were probably relatively  loose to begin with, but the manufacturer wasn&#x27;t able to remove them before shipping.  I also read that you can expect a few hairs to come out during the life of the brush - especially during the first few months after it breaks in.  If you have clumps falling out, then the product is defective.  In short, don&#x27;t worry if you see a few hairs here and there!  As far as the smell, well...  it&#x27;s made of animal hair, and it smells very faintly like wet animal after you wet it.  It&#x27;s not oppressive, and the soap that comes with this seems to cover it up.  Don&#x27;t worry...  if the faint odor is even remotely offensive, it&#x27;ll go away in a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The Soap**&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen soap that comes in this kit if perfectly serviceable.  It smells nice (the perfume seems to be used sparingly here,) lathers up decently well with only a little effort, and most importantly, rinses very easily.  Many websites will recommend this even to veteran shavers, as it&#x27;s affordable, gentle, and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The Stand**&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clear plastic stand.  It is exactly the right size to hold the brush and my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Razor.  It might not be pretty to look at, but it works and won&#x27;t really clash with any of your bathroom decor.  No complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;d recommend this starter kit to any of my friends who&#x27;re interested in wet-shaving.  I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d replace anything in it anytime soon (except maybe the stand, if I find an affordable one that looks better.)our bathroom decor.  No complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;d recommend this starter kit to any of my friends who&#x27;re interested in wet-shaving.  I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d replace anything in it anytime soon (except maybe the stand, if I find an affordable one that looks better.)</li>
    <li> Primary reason for 1-star rating is that the brush and handle separated  really easily within the first month of use. I tried gluing it back in with limited success. No the quality I expected.</li>
    <li> great set for the price. i love the soap. its called Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap, you can buy a 12 pack set for cheap. i  have combination acne prone skin, and this soap is great, doesnt leave me feeling dry afterwards.the proraso cream i brought leaves me dry, this left me more moisturized. and the shave went more smoother</li>
    <li> I bought this for the mug, since other mugs were about the same price (or more) than this kit.  The mug is heavy with an unobtrusive logo and nice ball handle.  Wide mouth makes it easy to whip up a nice lather and the size is standard for soap pucks.  Nice upgrade from a coffee mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes a nice lather with no overpowering scent.  Smooth shaving with a nice clean smell that clears up once you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is pretty good.  Not too coarse and the handle is certainly the nicest of the lower dollar brushes.  Its not silver badger, but it does the job.  Mine took about a week to soften up and stop dropping hair.  You&#x27;ll probably want a better brush if you really get into shaving, but this should be fine until you buy a $70+ one.  Overall I think its better than the standard art of shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand works well enough.  Its nothing fancy, after all it is just plastic.  The base is a bit slippery if you set it on a wet counter but if you have a place where it stays it&#x27;s fine.  It holds the brush securely with no worries of sliding out.  It also holds either a double edge razor, straight edge razor or cartridge razor like Fusion or Mach 3 nicely,  I would prefer a heavier base for daily use but most of those stands cost twice what this whole kit does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great kit to start with or as a gift.  It comes in a nice gift box which is quite sturdy and very well protected with cutout padded dividers for each item.  I received this on deployment where my mail got kicked, stepped on, dropped by helicopters and stepped on again!  The outside amazon box was toast but the gift box arrived perfect, as did everything inside.</li>
    <li> The mug is perfectly sized. The soap fits in the bottom just right and the badger hair brush is great. Softer than my than my white tipped badger brush but more firm than my synthetic brush. It&#x27;s just right. The stand is just a clear plastic but it holds any brush quite well. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Great Value for the price.  All great quality.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of this product (this one for my son).  Excellent shaving bowl, brush and soap.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star rating is due to the cheap acrylic stand.  My first one broke in half when cleaning it.</li>
    <li> purchased this for my husband and my father in law they both loved it..</li>
    <li> Great mug, Good soap, OK stand, and mediocre brush. Plan to move out of the house the first time you wet this brush (STINK) like most badger brushes, but the usual Dawn soak and vinegar wash got rid of most of the smell. After 15 or 20 shaves, the brush is OK for the money (the mug is almost worth the price for the whole set), and it is signicantly better than the boar brush that comes in the cheaper Van der Hagen set.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. I&#x27;m a convert to shaving brushes now!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try a straight razor.  I have not used the razor yet but this stuff is amazing.  I used to nick myself every time I shaved but with this I do not. I also really like the smell it has.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee and he absolutely loves it! Great, quality, product...awesome price!  He loves the soap and gets such a nice shave.</li>
    <li> When I received the package  it smelled so bad the ups man had it wrapped in a plastic bag. The brush broke the first time I used it but I really love the mug</li>
    <li> Got this for my grandson as his first shaving set. Bought the feather razor separately to complete the set. I would have to say that this is a great set for the beginning wet shaver. Doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot to get him set up for de shaving. He is very happy with his own shaving set.</li>
    <li> Fantastic starter set! I love the soap, so smooth and rich! The brush is great, very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought the kit thinking that it would be an upgrade from the kit from walmart.  Well the price was higher but the quality was not, after two weeks the brush separated from the handle and my husband had to use gorilla glue to repair the brush that was embarrassing because I was trying to make my husband upgrade his shaving items only to have him say his walmart set seemed to be better.  He liked the mug, soap and holder but the brush was a joke to him.</li>
    <li> I have had this kit for about a year and still use it daily.  The badger brush, although not fancy, does its job and makes great lather from any hard shaving soap.  The razor and brush stand allows both my DE razor and brush to dry.  The shaving can hold either hot water to soak the shaving brush or a shaving soap puck, and the mug&#x27;s handle is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen luxury shaving soap that comes with the kit lasted for almost three months and performed well.  I now use Edwin Jagger sandalwood shaving soap, but the VDH soap is cheaper and lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Luxury kit over the VDH Deluxe shaving brush and soap.  This kit costs a few dollars more, but is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great value/bang for the buck; great as a quick start kit for folks just getting into wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.</li>
    <li> Thinking of getting into some old fashioned shaving?  It&#x27;s worth doing!  This set is great for anyone looking to get their feet wet.  Quality is great for the price.  After a 9 months of use, the bristle part fell out of the base but I did what real men do and fixed it.  A little crazy glue and we are back in business!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter shaving set. The brush is good enough quality to get someone into wet shaving. The included mug works well with other soap pucks. The brush&#x27;s bristles are soft and maintain moisture and soap really well.</li>
    <li> This shaving set offers everything the much more expensive sets do because you settle for a plastic handle and stand.  That difference does not affect the shaving experience.  The quality of the bristles is very good. This brush, like all badger brushes, will lose a bristle once in a while.  The stand has a spot for a razor to hang as well.  Hanging the brush extends its life (it should dry thoroughly between uses).  All in all a great set, and a great gift.</li>
    <li> A good shave set for the money. Most other shave sets do not have a stand for this price. The stand leave a little to be desired but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> So I got into straight razor shaving a few months ago. I bought this set because I thought it was the quickest and easiest way to get what I needed to get started, and it was.....HOWEVER.... 1) NOT the best soap. It smells nice and lathers well but the lubrication just isn&#x27;t there. I found myself re-applying soap 4-5 times to the target area to finish the pass and still cutting myself due to lack of lubrication. 2) The bristles on the brush come out easily and are just too long. I couldn&#x27;t produce a decent lather with the brush without bearing down and dissipating the lather I had already applied. If the brush were trimmed ½ inch or so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I use a quality vintage style straight razor (DOVO Bismarck $135) or Spanish style (DOVO Bergischer Lowe $275) razor and neither shaved well with this soap. I tried Col Conk&#x27;s glycerin soap and it lubricates well though I have Prosaro and Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps on order. The shave is much better with Col Conk&#x27;s and the SimplyBeautiful 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush (shorter bristles) with much fewer nicks and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;So, basically, you spend $30 for a kit whose only useful components are the stand (only 1 razor) and mug. If I had it to do over, I&#x27;d select the pieces separately. $8-$16 for a mug and $16 for a triple stand, $14 for a 3-pack of soap and $12 for a brush. So $50 for a quality set I&#x27;d keep instead of $30 for a set I&#x27;d throw half of away.&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent set if you&#x27;re giving as a gift, but serious shavers (or serious entry-level enthusiasts) should consider other options.&lt;br /&gt;I intend on evaluating the Proraso and Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps when they arrive.</li>
    <li> Wow! Nice shave set for around thirty dollars, Although you can not see it in the picture,the brush stand also has a spot to store your razor when not in use. Badger hair is the key to produce a good lather with the brush &amp; soap. This kit has a well made soap cup with a handle to help when you are creating lather with the brush &amp; soap.The stand is a heavy,clear plastic that matches any type of bathroom colors if you are that picky. The Van Der Hagen soap is quality &amp; has been for many,many years. There are so many other shaving kits out there that are way more expensive.Why do you need to spend any more than thirty dollars just to store a brush,razor &amp; soap?</li>
    <li> good stuff, works well</li>
    <li> The stand is a bit cheap, but the mug and brush are excellent starter pieces. I&#x27;ve had mine for several years now.</li>
    <li> After one week of use, the brush bristles separated from the handle. It seems poorly glued together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say anything positive, I would say the bowl is nice enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a traditional shave set before so I thought I&#x27;d go for something inexpensive. The included soap and apothecary mug are good, though I wish I had spent a little more on the brush. After one month (about ten uses), the brush is losing a lot of hairs and the handle fell off ([...]). I re-glued the handle back on, but I feel I will likely be shopping for another brush [too] soon.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit, but if you get serious about shaving this way, you need to up grade the brush and soap.</li>
    <li> Soap, cup, and stand are great. Brush fell off the handle after 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I just received this set yesterday seems nice so far. To bad the stand was broken when I opened the package, I glued it back together and it&#x27;s holding so far. The rest of the set is very nice, I really like the way the soap smells. The brush seems good, it will need a little breaking in, I didn&#x27;t see any hair coming out and I practiced lathered the soap 4 or 5 times. To bad the first thing I pulled out of the package was the broken stand, it kinda took the wind out of my sails. Other wise the rating would have been a solid 4 maybe a 5...</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I love this set.  I&#x27;d been going back and forth between cartridge razors and electric shavers for 35(ish) years and was never truly happy with either option.  Most recently, I&#x27;ve been using G*** mach 3 razors, and while they work fine for me, they&#x27;re very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this set at my local walmart and I thought, what the heck, give it a shot.  The safety razor is sold seperately, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave (with a little practice) is as good, or better, than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m down to the skin with zero stubble every time.  And for those of you on a tight schedule for your morning routines, it really doesn&#x27;t take that much extra time.&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap is nice and creamy, and has a nice scent....my wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;The apothecary mug is nice, heavy and solid, and doesn&#x27;t move around when I make the lather.&lt;br /&gt;The brush does shed a bit, but not too bad.  The only thing I would change is make the handle on the razor a bit longer, and maybe put rubber grips on it.  It can be a bit tough to hang on to, especially when your hands are wet and soapy.&lt;br /&gt;And lastly the stand is just ok.  Clear acrylic, does the job, looks ok, but not very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great set.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter brush set. The stand actually works a lot better for me than the other people reviewing. Yes it&#x27;s made from plastic but it&#x27;s a pretty thick acrylic so it&#x27;s nice and sturdy. The brush is still shedding after about 7 uses. Before first using it I recommend wetting it down and trying to get as much of it to shed as you can.</li>
    <li> This is a great bit pf starter KIT for a shaver. Alas the soap comes in a clear plastic tub and not the metal tin shown in the photo and that was a disappointment (but the soap works as well)... Brush was a surprise as its a great badger for the price too.</li>
    <li> This was a great item for what I wanted. I wasn&#x27;t looking for high end because I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference, but this has proven durable so far with little effort, just remembering to rinse the brush out after using it.</li>
    <li> I gave this set to my boyfriend for his birthday over 5 months ago. He really liked it, and when he showed his friends who also shave safety razors, they were quite impressed with the quality as well. He still uses it regularly and enjoys it. The best part about this gift, is you always have follow-on gifts to complement it (travel cases, new soaps, after shave salt sticks, etc.). That&#x27;s a blessing if your guy is hard to shop for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the razor if you don&#x27;t already have one! This set doesn&#x27;t include one. I got my guy the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated razor to accompany this kit. He liked that too...</li>
    <li> At $30 its an easy buy.&lt;br /&gt;The soap would cost $5, a similar quality brush is $12, the mug is $20-$40 depending on the brand, and the stand is $10,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug and stand are great.&lt;br /&gt;They look good on my countertop and the stand easily holds my parker 99R DE Razor.&lt;br /&gt;(it has a divot in the base where you can stand a cutthroat razor as well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is.... well poor.&lt;br /&gt;It looks good and it is badger hair, but its very loosely packed.&lt;br /&gt;It will work up a lather, but it requires some work,&lt;br /&gt;also the entire knot fell out of mine and had to be glued back in.&lt;br /&gt;(It was an easy fix and has worked fine since.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good starter set.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it for a friend(with the warning that they may have to fix the brush),&lt;br /&gt;and will continue to use it myself,&lt;br /&gt;however I will upgrade the brush in the future.</li>
    <li> Firstly - it&#x27;s a board brush not a badger... says so on the box..&lt;br /&gt;I like the mug and the soap - brush was not too bad - but having actually switched to a pure badger brush - there is a HUGE difference...</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a gift (along with a beautiful straight razor from Straight Razor Designs - highly recommend!). My friend loved it! The soap smells so nice and lathers really well - the brush is a great quality badger hair brush, perfect for lathering the soap. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this kit to go with my Colonel Conk Safety razor. I have used this kit for a month and love it. The brush is of good quality, the soap is great, I usually have problems with shave creams and brake out because of it. But this soap does not, and has a great refreshing scent and feel when foaming my face. Don&#x27;t be fooled because the stand is plastic, it is sturdy and holds the razor and brush perfectly. The soap cup is sturdy and has a great feal and weight to it the soap fits perfectly in it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps a strange Valentine&#x27;s gift, but he had been wanting to try the brush and razor.  I couldn&#x27;t afford to get a set that included the razor, so he is using his regular one.  He likes tha mug and soap better than aerosal gel.  Brush is staying together and not losing bristles.  Will continue to shave using this brush and soap.  Softenens/moisturizes his face nicely.</li>
    <li> it came with the mug in a 100 pieces.</li>
    <li> Perfect starting set or for travel. The brush is better than expected only issue is that it is a bit thin for my liking. The soap although more of a cream smells great and lathers with ease.  I really enjoy the cup and the way it is held feels natural. Van Der Hagen really surprised me with the quality of each item packed in this kit.</li>
    <li> Soap is ok&lt;br /&gt;Mug is really nice and well designed for one hand maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;Brush works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Stand is outstanding, I thought that later on I would have to replace that plastic part, but far from it, it is Way better than expected. Does look good and well made.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first shave set  now that I am into wet shaving, I personally recommend this shaving set for wet shaving starters. Not a pro neither a guy who shaves with plastic trow away razors.&lt;br /&gt;If I had received this as a present... I would it like it very very much. Can&#x27;t say I love it because I only love family and food, but pretty much.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to give this as a present trow away a double edge razor for a complete wet shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;Got myself a Sodial $6.00 USD (aprox) razor, and works really good.</li>
    <li> This set was first a gift for father&#x27;s Day to my dad and he liked it quite a bit, so I purchased one for myself and I have enjoyed it so far. The brush is a nice entry brush for a beginner in the world of wet shaving and the mug is of course reusable if you continue to buy the shave soap pucks. Should get a long life from this product. It is nice having a stand for the brush and razor as well.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The brush seems to be holding up and seems to be of decent quality. The stand is very cheap and I&#x27;m not sure how ling it will last. The mug is well made and the facial soap works pretty well. All in all this product is worth what you are paying for, but if you are looking for higher quality items you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It is a shave brush stand soap and bowl.  The bowl broke within a month and that was just from setting it down on the counter.  I tossed it and used an old coffee cup.  the Brush loses bristles like a long hair dog rolling on the couch.  The soap is good and lathers well and the stand is convenient.  I don&#x27;t know that I would go to the expense again, but I am not totally disappointed</li>
    <li> I like this set for the money. Is it expensive...Not compared to everything else on the market.  I found the brush and cup to be better quality that I expected. I prefer the plastic over my old metal stand as it will hold both my brush and my Feather razor and will not dig or scratch.  I have not tried the soap as I have a favorite.  I do find this cup and brush lathers better than my old cup and brush so I now use this every day and like it much!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Mug is fantastic! Will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;Brush fell apart after just under a year of use and I will not buy another brush from Van Der Hagen again.&lt;br /&gt;Acrylic stand works great for other brushes though and holds razor too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a beginner wet shaving set though I would highly recommend the set to get someone started until you know if you&#x27;re going to like it or not! Comes with a free soap which is a nice bonus too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed soaps a couple times, and got a  new brush, but this mug and stand should stick around for a while. Worth the bucks. Especially for a newbie. The brush on this will last you enough time to get a better brush and figure out what you want in a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am planning on buying a couple more of these for friends who are interested in wet shaving for holiday gifts.</li>
    <li> Every man needs to shave the right way with the right tools. Oil, a nice lather using a brush, and moisturizer. This is a great starter kit for anyone who is thinking about taking their shaving experience more seriously. Do yourself a favor and buy this kit. This is the only way I&#x27;ll shave from now on. Use a brush and take your time.</li>
    <li> Shaving soap is decent &amp; smells ok.  The bowl does what it was intended to do.  The stand is functional.  The brush however, worked fine for approximately 8 shaves then the handle came loose from the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update...I contacted VDH and they replied within 24 hours.  They are sending me a new brush.  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> the mug is nice and the plastic stand in serviceable. Brush works as expected and an overall decent little set. My GF loves the smell of the soap, which is a thing, I guess.</li>
    <li> Its came with everything only issue the brush has loose hairs that come off in the shave soap a few times</li>
    <li> Purchased this a while back - just getting around to doing a review.  This is/was an amazing kit.  The &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; is all used up.  We kept the little black container for cotton balls and such.  We still have the brush and holder and we keep his razor on there also.  It is very well made and it provides a great close shave.</li>
    <li> Need I say more? None of that 50% or artificial badger. We are talking, 100% authentic badger hair. Van der Hagen knows the secret to a premium shave... and it starts in the brush.</li>
    <li> Pretty sweet for the price.</li>
    <li> He loves it and I really love the super smooth results it provides. I would give this as a gift to any man and EVERY man!</li>
    <li> I love this shaving set!!!!  Yes you could probably get better but for the money this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a beginners set but the brush could use some work. I&#x27;ve had it since December and just recently the handle completely seperated from the brush. I was able to re attach it but I am definitely upgrading to a  better brush. I also dont understand how the stand is supposed to hold the brush and your razor. Mine do not fit at the same time at all so I am not able to hang my razor from the stand so If you can find a set with a better brush and stand go for it.</li>
    <li> The badger hair brush smells pretty bad. I&#x27;ve used it for weeks now and it still smells like (I assume) a wild badger. I deer hunt and it smells &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; like the glands on a wild deer. I keep thinking it will go away, but it hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this set every single time I’ve shaved since receiving it nine months ago. I could not be happier with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift!  It was great, great quality, and fairly priced for what the product it.  Accurate description and the gift recipient was pleased!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! love the brush and the stand!! the bowl works really great to make the lather or just to hold the soap, It&#x27;s like premium kit but with a little &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; on it and of course a better quality in all the items</li>
    <li> I am my own barber  again. After Virginia made it almost impossible to get a straight edge shave at a barbershop, I decided it was time I did it my self. I am never going back to the rip off razors of today for sure. The brush is awesome. I selected this kit after reading the reviews of other brushes. every one stressed spend some money on the brush and I am glad I did</li>
    <li> Great product and for the right price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this set - will order again when he needs one.  It has all the necessities required for shaving and they are long lasting.</li>
    <li> This shaving set is very nice, just like I was hoping!  And it works very well!  Just make sure that you buy a razor to go with it.</li>
    <li> This mug complicates my razor and my shaving experience. I have been wanting to get back to a straight edge for a long while and this brush is great also.</li>
    <li> Produces a great shave with or without a straight razor especially if you have sensitive skin would higher recommend this product due do its reasonable price &amp; quality versus competition.</li>
    <li> Everything was intact, but imagine my surprise when this &amp;#34;specialty item&amp;#34; was available at my local Target... For $10 cheaper. I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> I needed a new brush and this set came with a lot more for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush did shed a little at first, maybe a few dozen hairs, but after a week it has stopped.  It is coarser than my 10 year old boar hair brush (that I dropped and ruined) which took some getting used to.  It holds more water/soap than my old one as well (and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is as good as much higher priced mugs. It&#x27;s a mug.  People get carried away with them IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is thick acrylic and holds the brush well with a spot for a DE safety razor.</li>
    <li> As a first time user with this style of shaving I must say I love this set. A very good set for a beginner and I recommend it to anyone starting out.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good product, like the lather from the shaving cream. I&#x27;ve had the product for a bit of time and only give it 3 stars due each time i use the brush a couple to a few of the badger hairs come off. Long term not great but for now a nice product.</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft and holds up well over time, soap is moisturizing and has a gentle scent that won&#x27;t get past a cologne, mug is comfortable to hold and the shape produces a great lather with the included brush. Whole set is very classy looking and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves the kit and says it is complete with everything he needs. Also, he smells wonderful after and it produces very smooth results (he has coarse hair, but not very densely packed). I have noticed he has less irritation after shaving.</li>
    <li> Looks great on the bathroom vanity, and the soap smells nice and fresh. Badger brush sheds a bit, but after the first few initial uses, it tapers off.</li>
    <li> Great Set. FedEx of course delayed the shipping, but the product is great. The soap and mug are extremely nice. The boar brush really helps get a good lather and the stand is a nice touch.I also ordered the VDH razor as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he really likes it and uses it every time he shaves, however it&#x27;s been six months and the brush has become detached from the base. We will glue it, but that was a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors and so when I saw this kit I thought I would give it a try since you get just about everything you need.  Maybe I&#x27;m missing something because the soap smells good until you rub it with the wet hair of the brush and then it seems to smell like wet beaver (the actual animal) which isn&#x27;t too appealing.  I also wasn&#x27;t able to get what I consider a good lather with this brush/soap combo.  Oh well, lesson learned...</li>
    <li> The bowl: No chips or obvious flaws, which you often get with cheaper glazed ceramics. The bowl is definitely large enough to fit the shave soap puck and make a good lather on top of it. It is handsome and looks good on the bathroom countertop next to the brush and razor on their stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand: Has a spot to hang a double edge razor, and also compatible with straight edge razors (there is a dimple in the base to keep the razor from sliding away when leaned in the razor slot. It probably would not work well with cartridge razors (mach 3, etc.) as the slot is quite wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap: probably my favorite part of this set. Mild but pleasent scent, makes a nice thick lather that applies evenly to the face and doesn&#x27;t run. Lubricates and conditions beard nicely for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush: this is the disappointing part of the set. Several bristles come loose each time I use the brush. It has a marked scent of badger, but this disappears after about 10 shaves, and never left a musk smell on me (I could just smell it when I had the wet brush next to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you are new to traditional wet shaving, this is a good kit to get you into it. You will probably want to upgrade your brush at some point, but it never hurts to have a spare brush. You can use it for travel to avoid traveling with an expensive brush. Or you can pass it along to a friend to get them into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father as a fathers day gift. I had them gift wrap it and it came in perfect shape, everything seems well made and my dad who had never used a safty Razor loves the set. and says the soap it comes with smells good, the mug is sturdy and not cheeply made. simply put he really likes it since it was  a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Wanted to get into straight razor shaving, got this neat little set( razor not included) works like a charm, shave soap smells good last a little while the smell and the soap too.</li>
    <li> Review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for approximately one year now.  Yes I&#x27;ve been using the stand, brush and bowl for a year.  The soap it comes with is very mediocre, I found that out after mine had run out after a few months (wish my cans of shaving gel lasted that long!).  I&#x27;ve had fun since looking around Amazon for different soaps/creams and finding something I will most likely stick with for the rest of my shaving career.  The brush is a very nice one, I have a boars brush (boars brushes aren&#x27;t going to rip your face off) and another badger, apart from STILL shedding this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to ding it because of the soap and the still shedding brush, but I stand by my statement that this is the best box set to buy for when you are getting in to traditional, double-edge blade shaving.  Nothing beats having a ceramic bowl, brush and stand for this price.  Only way to make this better is by adding a Styptic Pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;I have been upset with buying cartridge based shavers for years now:&lt;br /&gt;-  I&#x27;m required to shave daily for work, if I shave on Monday and its irritated that usually means by Friday my face is trying to run away from me.&lt;br /&gt;-  $50 for a set of 10 cartridges that will last me maybe 2 months, the base was $25 alone.  Since my purchase I realize the bases are now practically free.&lt;br /&gt;-  Cans of cream/gel/foam are messy and don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;-  Shaving took me a long time due to the level of scruff I have under my jaw line.  Constantly clogging the cartridge and taking longer then expected to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set out to find alternatives to this harsh reality us men have to go through!  I came across traditional DE shavers and thought man ... these are still a real thing? AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve learned quite a bit on my own in how to shave and that&#x27;s how I truly believe it should be with everyone.  Seeing as everyone has different skin, different hair, different growth they should figure out what works with them and their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is when you are first taking your baby steps into the magical land of Double Edge Safety Razor shaving, go slow, very slow.  Take that razor by the hilt, let it touch your skin without putting pressure on your razor and let it glide slowly down in one small motion and don&#x27;t go over the area again immediately.  Eventually you will figure out how fast you can go, angles to take, pressure applied (I don&#x27;t apply any!) and if you should go against the grain.  Also I find it helpful to change the blade immediately when I feel tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes and Lather:&lt;br /&gt;Soaps and Creams aren&#x27;t very different.  Creams take less time to make &#x27;thick&#x27; lather and often have very strong smells to them.  Soaps are tough bars that are usually placed in the bowl with hot water or rubbed in a face cloth to develop lather.  Pick your poison, I have both and chose the soap because its A) More fun and B) Doesn&#x27;t smell like Sex Panther.  To develop lather its comically easy; wet brush, stir brush in bowl that has soap in it  and apply suds.  Personal Preference: As I&#x27;m applying lather I would much rather have a &#x27;close&#x27; to solid white of foundation versus having the super thick foundation where I won&#x27;t see my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush, buy a few.  If this one isn&#x27;t cutting it for you there are tons of cheap ones available.  I really only bought the other 2 to see what other brushes were like.  Found out they are all very similar and why wouldn&#x27;t they be? I&#x27;m not buying a diamond studded brush for $200, all of mine are sub $10 and they did their job without removing my face from my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion: All the bases are essentially the same.  I have a Merkur that transforms into a butterfly so you can let the blade go.  I also have a Parker that does the same thing, I find that all I wanted was the easily accessible razor blade.  Oh and razor blades, I dislike Merkur Razors.  Currently I&#x27;m going through a 100 pack of Astra and after that I&#x27;m going to try Feather.  Right now the Astra&#x27;s blow away the Merkur&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I have made the move, saved some money, learned something new, got a better shave and I&#x27;m having fun shaving now.  Its no longer a chore, I like building up my lather, I like that I have to think about shaving my face and plus its great when others find out you don&#x27;t use a Mach 5 to shave as if you were nuts or grew up in the gritty west!  I kept my Mach 3 set, its my backup and travel companion, since I heard they don&#x27;t like these razors going on planes.</li>
    <li> As previously reviewed, the apothecary mug and brush stand are worth the price I paid.  The badger hair brush sheds like a long hair cat in Death Valley.  The initial smell of the brush was not a problem.  It was noticeable, but after a week of shaves, it was totally gone.  Think of the brush as a temporary fill-in while you find a quality brush.  It will shed into your tub of shaving cream or soap.  Have fun getting it out.</li>
    <li> Got into wet shaving about a year ago, and got a bunch of stuff for christmas last year, this included. . . honestly it&#x27;s not worth what you pay for it. Even after shampooing the brush multiple times before using it I still end up with bristles all over my face every time I shave. Also, it slipped out of my hand one time and cracked a large chunk off itself from an 18-inch fall to the bathroom counter. . .  The soap smells nice but is nothing special. . . . The mug is sturdy enough that it will stay put on the counter while you lather, which makes the little knob on the side slightly overkill (just my personal opinion here). The stand, however, I have used every day since getting the set. it will hold the brush and any safety razor perfectly. After doing a little research I found that you can make a perfectly good stand out of a coat hanger. . . so wishing I had saved Santa some dough and asked for the cheaper version instead, which is available on here and I have seen at most walmarts for ~10 bucks.</li>
    <li> This is the best option for anyone who is considering luxury shaving. I ordered this kit over a year ago to see if it was for me, and still use the shave soap and mug. I have since upgraded to a higher grade brush, but it serves well enough for a beginner to get an idea of what it is all about.</li>
    <li> Very classy gift for the man in your life, if he enjoys an old-fashioned shave.  High quality items and the stand also has a slot for your razor.</li>
    <li> Mug is solid and sturdy, soap smells nice and lasts a good while.  The lather that comes from it is good quality and shaves nicely.  I like the smell of the soap because it is light and pleasant.  Similar to a sandalwood but not quite.  The brush is better quality than I expected and after months of daily use I have only had a few bristles lost.  The brush is soft enough to be used dialy without discomfort but firm enough to generate lather and lift the hairs.  Definitely a great buy for a start off kit.</li>
    <li> Great but buy better soap I you plan on using I everyday</li>
    <li> This is a soft badger hair brush with high quality shaving soap in a stylish kit that&#x27;s going to look very good in your bathroom. The soap lathers and spreads nicely and makes for a positive shaving experience, and having a brush laden with lather allows you to reapply quickly and effectively should you need to touch up any places while you&#x27;re shaving. I personally use this product with the Merkur long handled safety razor and Merkur razor double edge razor blades. All together they have given me the smoothest and most irritation shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I love this shave kit.  I have been asking for my wife to buy me this shave kit for a couple years so I could try it.  She finally did and I absolutely love it!  The brush and soap help stand up my whiskers for a clean smooth shave.  I will be buying more soap once this wears out.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit. The soap smells a little weird and the brush started shedding from the first use. But it&#x27;s still a decent starter kit. The bowl and stand are very nice!</li>
    <li> I love using it, good quality.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this kit to receive the badger hair brush.  I am not an expert in all brushes, but I can state that this brush is much better than the badger hair brush I own.  The apothecary mug was a bonus.</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart within a few months. The bristle component dislodged from the handle and separated in two while I was shaking it to dry the bristles after a shave. I&#x27;d like to think Van Der Hagen would happily send me a replacement brush, backing up their product and demonstrating that my experience was a fluke. What is more likely is that the brush is just cheap and you should plan on buying a better brush. Other than that, the set is just dandy. Soap smells great, cup is functional, stand serves its purpose, barely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set, excited to get both a new soap and a decent badger brush.  I was very disappointed when I first opened the package and the cloying, synthetic-smelling flowery fragrance made me sneeze.  The badger brush is just a &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and not a silver tip bristle knot, but it looked thick and good for whipping up lather.  The mug is heavy and has a little knob for your hand to hold it.  The stand is clear acrylic and very sturdy. This set LOOKS great, but the performance leaves much to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL badger brushes come from animals that are basically hunted wild in China (with licenses and a only a certain number each year taken in each season) so I expect the hair on the brush to have variation and also a little smell to it.  It&#x27;s usually advised to wash the brush in shaving soap for a bit, then rinse gently and dry it out.  But this brush had a horrible animal odor to it that was mixed with a formaldehyde or solvent smell that several washes couldn&#x27;t get rid of!  It was detectable over the scent of the soap (more on that horror in a bit) and lingered in my nostrils after shaving with my favorite soap.  Additionally, the brush lost a LOT of hairs (10 to 20) every time I tried to lather with it, rinse it or manipulate it in any way.  The knot is not secure enough in the handle and it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is another sad story.  It&#x27;s supposedly full of glycerin and oils, but the smell is so overpowering to me that my allergies flared up as soon as I lathered my face.  After my shave, I broke out in a rash over the places where the soap was.  I respond like that to some synthetic fragrances so I was very disappointed in the soap.  It seemed to need a LOT of work to make a good lather, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is a good start but is NOT worth the money.  You are better off getting a NICE brush (I have several Edwin Jagger brushes, and they also make Crabtree&amp;Evelyn brushes!) and a GREAT soap like the New Proraso or even a really expensiveshea butter soap bar.  Woolfat soaps are also excellent.  You&#x27;ll spend more than this kit, but the brush will last for a LONG time and the soap you like is the soap you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try again, Van der Hagen!</li>
    <li> This along with some other products has changed shaving for me. The was a great started kit to start the wet double-edge shaving. The only slight complaint is the amount of hair that came from the brush, but it&#x27;s only the first few time mostly.</li>
    <li> When I received the shipment the shave bowl was smashed into smithereens. But Amazon issued a return label and I had a replacement faster than I received the original one. I like the bowl, the handle is easy to grasp and hold with wet or slippery hands and it seems deep enough that nothing slops over the edges. The boar brush seems to get better with time for making lather, faster and easier so I think that&#x27;s either  a matter of break-in, or I&#x27;m getting better at knowing how much to soak the brush prior to starting to lather. The soap round that came with it leaves a little to be desired, it seemed to produce a weak lather and now that I&#x27;ve used different ones, I know its the soap and not my technique. I think with time I&#x27;ll find a better stand as this one is plastic and tips over easily on my counter top with regularity.</li>
    <li> Brush is awful. Loses hairs like crazy.</li>
    <li> Mediocre at best, and decent at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;br /&gt;-durable mug&lt;br /&gt;-The soap puck makes a very good lather and lasts dozens of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The logo wears off quickly&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is very cheap and bristles will find their way onto your face with every use.&lt;br /&gt;-The stand has enough room for a razor or the brush. If you do manage to fit both, a slight bump will knock one off.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent of the soap is unremarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good starter set, but leaves a lot of room for improvement.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price but I would spend a little more next time. The brush is too light and its holder is cheap but the soap lathers well and it was a great price for a set.</li>
    <li> was exactly what i was looking for. Brush and soap work very good for a close shave.</li>
    <li> great shave set looks good and the brush is very good like he way it raises the whiskers</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas. He likes this brand and he hated carrying it back and forth when we vacation. Bought it as a back up for vacation home. NOT crazy about the plastic stand for the razor but serves the purpose. He has a stainless steel one he keeps at home.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for Christmas and I was very surprised and pleased with this gift.  The Bowl for the soap is glass and weighs a bit which is a good thing for me.  The brush however was a bit rough but I guess its because it was the first time and needs to soften up a bit.  The bristles are holding very well and again, it feels good in the hand.  The soap lathers up just right and i tried different degrees of lather like the instructions say and it was dead on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is plastic, though I wish it was made from another material, but everything looks stylish and is very, well, manly.  This and the  Merkur Razor makes shaving an Old School experience.  Which is a very good thing.</li>
    <li> The stand needs some weight on the bottom, it is easily tipped and the slot for the brush should be a bit tighter as the brush comes out too easily. The handle on the bowl is a bit unwieldy, but it&#x27;s not really an issue because I don&#x27;t hold it up when I lather up. The stand is made of clear acrylic and the bowl is heavy ceramic.</li>
    <li> My son started shaving this year and Christmas seemed the appropriate time to get this for him. It&#x27;s a starter set and he says he likes it. The mug is the right size and the brush and stand don&#x27;t take up alot of space. If it becomes the kind of shaving routine he likes then he can work up to the &amp;#34;silver tip badger bristle etc.&amp;#34; For now this is just right.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my shavette (like a straight razor, but with disposable blades). It has everything I needed in here. The little plastic stand is perfect for letting the brush dry out, and it even has a spot to store the razor! The shaving soap has a nice smell as well.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my son in law was looking for and more!  It was an excellent gift.  Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> good quality brush and soap.  still do prefer aerosol shave cream for thick coverage and comfort. may need more time to get use to this product</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting something like this and was initially thinking about getting one of the expensive ones from Art of Shave.  I thought I would try this out for awhile and upgrade if I liked having the brush/etc.  Actually haven&#x27;t bother upgrading though, thoroughly impressed!</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor recently and bought this set to accompany my Merkur 180. It was immediately clear to me that this is the way I should be shaving. Not having my hands covered in green sludge from shaving gel is great. The brush feels great against my skin and I don’t end up washing a handful of wasted lather down the drain. The cup is solid and the shaving soap has a very low tone scent. The only issue I have with this set is the stand. Having the brush and razor so close together on the stand makes it a little awkward to grab just one. You have to make sure you grab the brush before the razor and put the razor back before the brush. It is simple clear plastic as well which clashes with the aesthetic of using a safety razor and shaving soap.  For the price for a starter set however this can’t be beat so it still gets 5 stars from me. I expect to upgrade the stand but keep the brush, soap, and cup for a long time.</li>
    <li> The shaving soap is good, and has a great scent, however the brush tends to shed more than it should and doesn&#x27;t lather extremely well.</li>
    <li> This was a present for a friend. It worked great for a day and then the brush handle broke within two uses.</li>
    <li> Dad bought me this as a gift, along with a safety razor. It really is a better way to shave. Once you get used to it, it doesn&#x27;t take much longer than a modern razor and you get a closer, smoother shave. Leaves your skin in much better condition too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is very nice, it&#x27;s made of heavy durable glass in a high-gloss black color and has a convenient knob to keep it still while you&#x27;re making lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is fantastic, it has a plastic handle in a color to match the mug, I&#x27;ve really abused this thing, I rinse it with scalding hot water and wring it out every day, but none of the hair has come out. It&#x27;s very soft, absorbent, and is great for lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is very nice when compared to others I&#x27;ve used, creates a very creamy lather, has a pleasant scent, and lasted several months for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is clear plastic, and holds your brush and razor. I would have liked for the stand to be weighted at the bottom, as I&#x27;m afraid of it falling over sometimes. However, it never has fallen over on me, and it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Shaving cream is great and so is the razor...the only complaint is that the razor does not always stay in the holder (poor design) aside from that great product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> The day i received my Van Der. product i was exited to try something new. Spectacular, to say the least. I could not imaging how rich the lather was, the smell from the shave soap was that of greatness. Along with the brush, it felt as if a soft handed angle was coating every inch of my face. The mug was beautifully crafted with its black polished glow.  I have no regrets on purchasing this set, never again will i shave with the canned Gels ever again.</li>
    <li> Excellent kit. Love the brush and mug. Exactly what I was looking for. The included shaving soap is very nice and leaves a great scent on your skin. The included holder is designed for the brush and other brushes that I have will not work in the holder (it is too wide for their handles). Worth the money. I have been able to find shaving soap refills at my local Fry&#x27;s/Kroger supermarket.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the kit itself. The soap smells too much like perfume for my taste. I&#x27;ll go back to Taylor of Bond Street, something almond or sandalwood.</li>
    <li> The VDH shave set is inexpensive and has everything you need except a blade (plus body, if double-edge) to start wet-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished the soap ages ago, but I&#x27;m still using the mug, brush, and stand.  Everything works fine, but the brush is beginning to fall apart after a couple years of use.  I especially like the design of the mug--the peg is much easier to hold than a standard loop handle.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice. As is the cup. The stand broke in about a week. Cheap plastic so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. The shaving soap is nice, had many good shaves out of it.</li>
    <li> Comes with everything you need to shave. the bowl is big ans sturdy and the brush is well built. Thank you</li>
    <li> The shave set is a neat starter for those who want to do things the original way.  The quality is good and the shipping with Amazon is always great  - thanks!</li>
    <li> This set is pretty darn good to start out with the brush is solid and controls easy, the soap smells good and can lather up really well and the cup....well, its a cup, but it&#x27;s sturdy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Only a few bad things to say. The brush lost a few hairs upon the first few uses, but never effected its use. The cup has a tendency to let the excess lather spill over the top but that could be user error. The soap smells great but I don&#x27;t think it is right for me, nothing wrong with it, gives a good shave, just doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Looking for a great starter kit? You&#x27;ve found it. Complaints about this set will be minor, if any.</li>
    <li> Great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to Safety Razors and needed a starter kit of stand, bowl, brush and soap. This looked like the best, most cost-efficient solution so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the Bowl is perfect sized, nicely finished and the Apothecary Style Knob fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap Smells Amazing and does a decent enough job lathering. I originally wanted a Sandalwood or Cedar scent but the Luxury Soap it comes with smells good enough I would strongly consider buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works for a beginner- nothing special, slight odor at first, seems to go away after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is the stand. The brush fits fine, but the razor stand slot is awkward and could have been been designed better.</li>
    <li> I bought this set when I decided to give the DE Safety Razor shaving a try.  I&#x27;m extremely glad I made the switch, and this kit was great at first.  Over time I found some things that I didn&#x27;t quite care about it, but overall it&#x27;s definitely a good get to get a feel for the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with the mug, it&#x27;s a good weight, the little carrying knob fits in the hand well and helps keep the mug sturdy while lathering up your brush.  I do wish it had a cover/lid to it though to keep the soap from drying out.  The depth of the mug is great but the narrow bottom does make it a little difficult to get a thicker/fuller brush moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great at first, good weight, thick hairs.  After a week the whole hair assembly came out after letting the hairs soak in some steaming hot water, the metal ring is basically held on with an adhesive that had melted from the heat.  I got it seated inside the handle again and it has never come out again.  What has come out, however, are the hairs.  Every...single...shave I end up with a hair or two that comes out either in the bowl or on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap was great while it lasted, it lathered up great.  The scent was a little odd at first but it definitely grew on me.  When it was all gone, however, I decided to opt for a higher quality shaving soap.</li>
    <li> i have spent years and years and wasted literally thousands of dollars on 2, 3, 4, and even 5 blade razors. After using this starter kit for the past three months I can&#x27;t imagine ever shaving with those harsh, money-wasting throw-away razors again!&lt;br /&gt;At 43 years old, I was more than a little nervous and apprehensive about upending my shaving routine with the shave gel and &#x27;convenient&#x27; razors. Seriously, the best decision I ever made and my face has never looked or felt better!! Great as a starter kit or gift set for the gentleman in your life.&lt;br /&gt;Specifics: I haven&#x27;t tried any other products, so I can only provide feedback on this set.&lt;br /&gt;Soap: The soap is super easy to use, works up to a creamy lather quickly. This took some getting used to because I was such a &#x27;gel&#x27; user. Please, put the gel away! It&#x27;s drying out your face and is leaving all kinds of chemical residue.&lt;br /&gt;Razor: The set doesn&#x27;t come with a handle. I got a regular length Van Der Hagen handle at a local dept store and I&#x27;m happy with the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Brush: I did a lot of research on brushes and was expecting this one to fall apart rather quickly based on the reviews. However, I&#x27;ve found it to be very reliable and I will continue using it for the foreseeable future. It has lost a few hairs, but doesn&#x27;t seem impactful.&lt;br /&gt;Bowl: I&#x27;m still using the original soap and the bowl has been perfect for that. I&#x27;ve already ordered my next soap (Proraso) based on reviews so I&#x27;ll have to see how this goes.&lt;br /&gt;Blades: If I remember correctly, the set comes with five or ten various starter blades. Some were better than others, but I got multiple (2-4) comfortable shaves out of each one. I ordered a box of 100 double edge blades from Personna and I&#x27;m very satisfied with their comfort and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you are thinking of breaking up with your expensive razors with their vibrations and flex-balls and 18 blades, I strongly suggest you do it NOW and start here! You don&#x27;t have to break upwith your old stuff, just take a test drive. Your skin and wallet will appreciate it!</li>
    <li> this old school kit + dollar shave club &#x3D; better shave</li>
    <li> Here i thought badger hair would be cleaned somehow before being made into a brush, but it isn&#x27;t so!  Maybe you think that the smell of a badger&#x27;s musky pelt is a manly thing, but let me assure you it is a terrible stink, a terrible awful stink.  Good thing i didnt smell it until i had rubbed it all over my face.  I am forever unclean</li>
    <li> Great shaving kit! For people who are new to DE shaving, this is a great starter kit. The soap smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> This brush feels as though it is really good quality. I haven&#x27;t had any hair coming out of it yet, the handle is comfortable to hold and use, and the shape of the brush bristles facilitates building a really nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap smells good, and builds a great lather... I&#x27;ll be getting more of it when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed in many of the reviews that the mug is hard to hold.  I think this may be because people are trying to hold it &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34;... this mug isn&#x27;t designed to be held by the handle.  That handle actually slides between your middle and ring fingers as you wrap your hand around the actual mug itself.  That gives you a comfortable and VERY stable grip to the mug while you build lather in it.  Best shaving mug I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too much to say about the stand... it is fully functional but kind of ugly and not the most stable base for your razor. That said it performs it&#x27;s job well enough to not be replaced.  It just seems a little out of place in the greater set.</li>
    <li> The soap gives an incredibly close shave and smells manly. This is a handsome shaving set for any man that wants to shave like his forefathers.</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and my groomsmen. Great value with these I was surprised that the soap lathered quite easily and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> A good quality shaving kit that&#x27;s stylish and contemporary. I found other shaving sets a bit ordinary or old fashioned. This is perfect for a younger man or a slightly more fashion conscious gent.</li>
    <li> Holder will not hold brush and razor at the same time. Very cheaply made! Razor or brush keeps falling off holder.&lt;br /&gt;Soap and brush are okay.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. I liked the smell and lather the soap made. the soap was fairly hard so it lasted months of daily shaving. The brush does loose a lot of hair (like a lot, even by properly breaking it in!) but mine has now stopped shedding and now its great.  The mug itself is nice. I got this intending on upgrading but I can&#x27;t think what more I could want out of a mug and the only way up for the brush would be a silver-tip (those are pricey!)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to start using a shaving brush and soap instead of the aerosol cans of shaving cream. I break out easily on my face due to sensitive skin. I am still using this set after a about a year and have had only great results with it. The included soap is easy on my skin, lathers well, and lasts about 3 months for me. The included apothecary mug fits my hand just right. The best part of the set is the brush. I had read that cheaper brushes start to loose their bristles very quickly. This brush has only lost about 4 or 5 bristles that I have been able to see left in the mug. I do think it is very important to rinse your brush and shake out as much water as possible after every use and then hang it on the brush stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a super top of the line shaving set, I think it&#x27;s the best you can get for someone who has never had a brush and mug set before. There are other scents available to buy separately in this soap line but I haven&#x27;t tried them. This one has a nice but very light clean scent.</li>
    <li> I have looked online everywhere else and Badger brushes can run up to $120. This is a great shaving set and it is very convenient. The soap smells wonderful and will last me for many months</li>
    <li> I like the classic styling and the brush, soap, and dish make for a nice shaving experience - great way to start the day!</li>
    <li> Great set for the price.. The shaving soap last forever, Couldn&#x27;t be happier, much better shave with this and the DA razor over the Mach 3 and you shaving cream in a can. Will never go back..</li>
    <li> Soap was the only down in this kit.  Love the brush and cup, but had to replace the soap.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set. Some people were complaining about the holder, yes it&#x27;s cheap but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The brush is great I really like it, the soap that comes with it is nice too. I&#x27;m using the Merkur 180 long handle safety razor whitish an amazing razor, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because it had several items i I needed to get into wet shaving at a really competitive price. The apothecary mug alone was worth the ~$25 price tag. The mug is glossy and as well made as any mug seems to be. The soap is actually pretty awesome. It&#x27;s a different product from the cheap VDH pucks available at most drug stores (which also aren&#x27;t bad). It lathers really well and has a pleasing mild scent. It lathers really well with the supplied brush. That leads me to the brush. The brush is actually a solid beginning product. The black acrylic handle is polished and has had the seams removed. The brush is badger and comes with a slight odor (like all natural hair brushes). The smell dissipates after a few uses. My brush loses a bristle or two each tim, which allows for the brush to last at least a year or two according to other reviews. Overall this is a great entry set with a cool mug, a great soap, and a solid intro brush that will last a couple years or until you experiment and find one you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/9/2013 After owning this product for about three months the glue holding the knot in the brush handle came loose. The chrome ring, still holding all the bristles in place, just came out of the handle. I guess I&#x27;ll need to purchase a new shaving brush. While I still think that the kit is a fine place to start, and that the mug and VDH luxury soap puck still make this a fair price, I have to bump the product from five to three stars. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 01/29/14 Originally I said that I really liked the soap, and I do like the smell and the consistency. Unfortunately, it has the slight effect of drawing water away from your face. by the time I get to the last part of my face, I find my skin under the later to be dry and the razor does not glide appropriately. It isn&#x27;t a severe issue and it doesn&#x27;t always happen, but since my initial soap puck ran out I have tried both the cheap VDH \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; soap [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]] and Colonel Conk&#x27;s shave soap [[ASIN:B0071B7XCO Colonel Conk Glycerin Soap - Variety 4 Pack]] and I have found that neither of these products have that effect. Overall I have become pretty disappointed in this starter set. I would recommend you do your research and buy a decent brush and soap and then use a coffee mug.</li>
    <li> The bursh holder is small enough to fit into a medicine cabinet and holds the brush well,  The cup is easy to grip and the weight is very good.  However the brush bristles are too hard and makes a heavy lather instead of a light foam.  The holder cannot hold a Fusion Razor - it has to be carefully balanced.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for our Annivasary and he loved it, The brush was very soft and I liked the soap it smells good but not to overpowering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright starter set.  The brush came off but has stayed well after reglueing.  The cup is alright for pucks, but id reccomend something bigger for other types of shaving creams.  No problems with the stand. Bought for $25.</li>
    <li> The brush works great and the soap helps get such a close shave. I have a merkur razor which fits perfectly on the stand. Some of the bristles on the brush come over but its not too bad and I feel like that would happen to any brush after such use. Soap is not that great. Good starter kit though</li>
    <li> I bought this shave set because I wanted to give wet shaving a try without breaking the bank, and this set was exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and feel that it gives good quality for a good value. I definitely get a closer shave, have less irritation, and, frankly, I just feel like wet shaving is a more manly way to start my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Not much to say here. It holds the brush and my razor well and looks fine on the counter. It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl: The bowl is probably my favorite part of this set. It&#x27;s ceramic, and just looks sharp on my bathroom counter. It does its job of holding the soap fine, and I like that it has a wide mouth to make it easier to work up a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap: The soap leaves my face moisturized, and my wife loves the scent. I&#x27;m not sure she&#x27;ll let me try another brand. After 6 months I&#x27;m just starting to see the bottom of the bowl so I&#x27;ll need to buy a new puck soonish. Definitely beats the can of Gillette I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: The brush does a good job of building a lather. It does lose a few bristles with every use, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in performance. I expect to have to get a new brush in a year or two, but I never expected it to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an introductory wet shaving set. I expect the bowl and stand to last forever. The brush is decent for the price, and the soap is nice too.</li>
    <li> The product is good, I&#x27;m happy with the brush, the stand isn&#x27;t designed for a straight razor that I use, so I park my toothbrush there! The soap needs a bit of work but that&#x27;s the whole point, very good feel and I am overall very happy with it. The soap bowl is very nice as well and the full set looks great around the sink.</li>
    <li> I could have spent more money on a fancier set, but at this stage of my life, money saved to get another need met is more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works fine for me.</li>
    <li> the brush with this set is awesome it does not shead and it holds the lather really well and spreads evenly. the soap is also very nice, when i first saw the picture on amazon i didnt like the handle on the mug BUT after using it i like it much better than the tradition handle like on a coffie cup, the stand is ok its plactic but has a slot for youre razor and brush .</li>
    <li> Wish there was detail in the description of the scent of the shaving soap, and more options for customization or individuality.</li>
    <li> the brush could be better but the shave puck is pretty good, overall a good starter set</li>
    <li> Good set but the brush quality is questionable as it seems to be falling apart with more use. The holder for the brush feels like a cheap plastic stand. On the other hand, the soap smells great and the soap tray feels nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. Arrived timely and as expected!</li>
    <li> item was as described and was shipped promptly</li>
    <li> My husband really liked it.</li>
    <li> This is great little starter kit for anyone wanting to try DE shaving.  I love the smell of VDH soap and it&#x27;s easy to produce a decent lather  The soap also leaves enough residual to make a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; second pass without chafing.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for anyone interested in traditional wetshaving.  This set has everything you need minus a DE or straight razor.  I know some might argue that there are better brushes out there, and yes there are, but for someone interested in wetshaving this is a great setup to begin with.  The brush I received shed about 5-6 hairs during my initial break-in, and has been rock solid ever since.  One nice factor is the brush has no smell/odor that is common during the break-in of most shaving brushes.  The mug and soap provide a nice thick, slick lather, and have a great look as well. All in all this set is a great value for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE / traditional shaving, but this little inexpensive set is perfect to get started with.  It comes with a real badger hair brush that is pretty soft and the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of the new brush wasn&#x27;t too offensive after the first shave.  I just pre-rinsed/washed it with some shampoo, thoroughly rinsed and let it dry.  Now, after a few weeks, it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little stand does its job, nothing more, but it&#x27;s very effective.  The cup, as expected works fine and it looks nice. I&#x27;ve used it with both cream and the supplied soap.  The soap....I like it better than the Edwin Jagger cream (I also reviewed) I purchased.  Don&#x27;t overlook this soap just because its inexpensive.  It has a pleasing aroma, lathers well and protects well.  I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had the closest shaves ever using this soap!</li>
    <li> Brush isn&#x27;t very firm.</li>
    <li> Got this last week.In my 45+years of shaving, I have tried a brush and mug twice  before and found it not so great. But ..thanks to the ether-net I learned the secret. Badger brush...Good quality soap....And knowledge.Buy this and check a few  sites to learn the EASY rules of brush and mug shaving.The soap that comes with this  set is really good!!! I bought a 12 pack of their glycerine soap but I haven&#x27;t used   it yet, and I think it will be a long time B/4 I do. The soap with it is very long lasting....I had read that some people noticed an odor with the brush, I shampooed  the brush with a little baby shampoo b/4 initial use. Noticed 3or4 lost hairs.  IMHO....I say 5.0 for this product.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this set was a pretty good deal to get started wet shaving, but I was disappointed this morning when the bristles separated from the handle of the brush. I&#x27;m sure I can glue it back, but really I shouldn&#x27;t have to do this on something I just bought less than 2 months ago. Van Der Hagen, how about you look into some better glue for this application?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of the set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand isn&#x27;t really anything you&#x27;d want to put on display. But it&#x27;s fine for keeping in the medicine cabinet so the brush can hang and dry.&lt;br /&gt;The mug holds the soap just fine, and the finish isn&#x27;t too slippery in wet hands. I like the stem handle as well.&lt;br /&gt;The soap seems OK, but I haven&#x27;t used any others yet to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did it again I might have just bought a better brush...</li>
    <li> Good value for a beginner.  Good quality for the price and it helps provide a good shaving experience. Have purchased another as a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this method of shaving.  Great set to get started with.</li>
    <li> Good price for a starter set. I actually really like the soap that&#x27;s included. I thought it would be of low quality. I still use the stand and the cup but have since upgraded the brush.</li>
    <li> The brushe was loose in the plastic holder, but I turned it into a project and inserted a piece of hardwood into the hollow base then epoxied back together. Better heft and a nice tight brush. The brissles are kind of pokey, but since this is my first brush I don&#x27;t have anything to jusge it by.</li>
    <li> Okay cup. So so razor holder (plastic and falls over too easily, especially with a DE safety razor in it). The shaving cream it comes with is okay though. The brush however, is awful and to me that was most of the reason for buying the kit. Unless of course you enjoy having five to ten gnarly boars hairs stuck on your face and razor while shaving every morning, not to mention all those same hairs clogging up your drains. The brush also pulled out of the handle on the second use and it does a pretty poor job of holding water. Avoid this set and invest in a quality brush, then spend a few bucks on a cup and stand to go with it. You&#x27;ll spend a bit more upfront but that&#x27;s better than ending up with this brush in the garbage after a couple weeks with it - which is where mine is going.</li>
    <li> This came as a gift for my husband, who has been wanting to try &amp;#34;old school shaving&amp;#34; . It comes well packaged and looks to be a nice sturdy set. I think he will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Whole badger brush fell right out of the handle and couldn&#x27;t be fixed. It was stored properly in the hanger. Soap, cup and stand seem fine, but many brushes won&#x27;t fit in the stand.</li>
    <li> Really like the brush, mug, and soap.  Just recently switched to DE (double edge) shaving and my wife LOVES the smell of this soap.  Every time I shave she smells my face for like an entire minute, haha.  Great set, great price, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> The plastic stand broke easily and the brush fell out of the handle after 4 months use.  The soap cup is good though!</li>
    <li> I am still using this shave set every day. The soap that came with it wasn&#x27;t very good so I swapped it out with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream. Works just like it should, I will probably be upgrading the brush at some point but for now it suits my needs just fine</li>
    <li> Fantastic soft Badger Brush, great shaving soap that lathers very quickly and leaves your face smooth and soft after shaving and a beautiful mug and razor holder for convenience.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband who expressed an interest in &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; shaving.  It was a nice way to get used to using a shaving brush and kit.  However, the brush started shedding heavily within the first week.  Other than that, he really enjoyed using the kit and is looking to upgrade soon.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with the set.</li>
    <li> Excellent product (cup, soap, brush, and brush holder)! So nice to get back to shaving this way! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Brush was used twice and on the third time of use the bristles came out of handle.Waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchased this set from another retailer.  I have gotten use out of the mug which I really like and the shave stand which is serviceable.  I have since purchased a much higher quality soap and shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is not very slick and the lather it does create seems to dry and dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is ok for a cheap first brush but the bristles fall out regularly and are really stiff.  I have not had the knot fall out of the handle as some have reported though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the value is fair given the brush and the soap are below par in my opinion.  A similar mug and stand purchased separately on Amazon would set you back around $25 anyway, so the brush and soap are really just bonuses.</li>
    <li> Well... I knew it was going to break eventually but I didn&#x27;t know it would break apart after a month. The brush didn&#x27;t retain water properly nor did it lather at even the level of a synthetic brush. I mean I can&#x27;t complain, it was quite a cheap product but the soap was okay... When not being used with the badger brush included. The soap is one of the best smelling shaving soaps I have ever used. The shaving mug is beautiful but is obviously trying to mimic the Muhle trademark (which by the way is one of the best shaving brands out there) overall a pretty terrible experience with bristles falling out constantly and a very poorly constructed handle.</li>
    <li> I really liked this set.  For the past 6 months it&#x27;s been a pleasure to use and my shaving has been wonderful.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the soap lasted longer than the brush.  Like other reviewers the brush popped out of the handle far too soon...</li>
    <li> My first kit to get me away from regular razors. Easy to use set, definitely for a beginner like me!&lt;br /&gt;My set arrived shattered, but amazon replaced it quickly!</li>
    <li> I started with this kit when I dumped the multi-blade crap razor in the trash. I was very happy with the VDH soap and I&#x27;m still using the mug. I moved to a slightly smaller brush though. There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the VDH brush, I just preferred a smaller one. I would have kept using the VDH soap, too, but I couldn&#x27;t find it locally the day I ran out and needed it, so picked up another brand in the local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to new wet shavers.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast, and everything was in great shape. I am giving this as a present, and I did a lot of research to be sure it was of good quality, so I hope that it stands true!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased an omega of the same &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; and didnt find it to be to the quality i was looking for, however  i recieved this today and was blown away! EXCELLENT product quality! will last for years!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s previous shaving brush was so old it was actually disintegrating.  He was thrilled with this new set he received for Christmas.  The cup with soap is easy to handle.  The stand to hold the brush is clear acrylic - easily fits into any bathroom decor.</li>
    <li> The brush is fairly good quality,  however it will begin to fall apart after some use...the brush hairs end in the sink. The lather bowl has a great handle, but it&#x27;s heavy and somewhat too tall to lather your soap comfortably. The stand for your brush and razor is flimsy and impractical because it is not sturdy at all. Great products just slightly too expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought mainly for the brush and stand. I think it&#x27;s meant to be a straight razor stand, as putting my merkur in it is a poor idea. The only way to grab it back out is from the head. The brush is advertised as badger, but feels much more like boar (very stiff). Didn&#x27;t enjoy it, it&#x27;s gonna get returned.</li>
    <li> I thought the shaving kit was just as nice as showed in the pic.  My boyfriend liked it very much.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Target for $19.99 and really love it  (the Target VDH luxury set a premium boar bristle brush).  This set is perfect for any wet shaver beginner or pro.  The mug alone is worth the price.  Soap is nice and this was my first experience with a boar brush which I enjoyed.  If you buy the set you won&#x27;t be disappointed, money well spent</li>
    <li> I have a lot of high-end shaving stuff.  I bought this as a gift for my dad to go along with a DE razor.  This set is a nice starting point.  Brush is a good badger, which I personally prefer.  Soap is not Proraso or Wool Fat, but smells good and does a nice job.  Scuttle is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying to get into the DE scene, although you&#x27;ll probably buy things later to supplement.</li>
    <li> I like the cup the soap and the brush for the quality. To start using the shave brush set makes the choice easy.</li>
    <li> This is a great beginners set. I have had it just over a year and the brush is starting to come apart slightly. I just need to push the knot back in and it works fine, but I&#x27;m about to upgrade. The soap is difficult to lather, but fairly slick when used. I quickly upgraded to a better soap though. I also like that the stand has a place for the razor, not many included stands have that.</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap set. Soap smells kind of good. I&#x27;ve had the brush for over a year and it still sheds bristles, which is so annoying that I&#x27;ve stopped using it. The plastic stand is cheap and the brush slips out of it all the time. Doesn&#x27;t have any grip. This would be suitable as a first-time set for someone in high school learning to shave. I regret buying it and should have gone with something a bit more high-end.</li>
    <li> so far so good impressed nice sent on soap</li>
    <li> A great shave set.  Really love the badger hair brush,  works so much better than the boar bristle I was using.  The stand is a nice tough as well.  Great job Van Der Hagen !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott L.&lt;br /&gt;South Bend, IN</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a wet shave connoisseur, as are apparently many of the other reviewers of this product, then there is probably nothing of value I could tell you about this shave set. You probably have your own ideas about what&#x27;s best, anyway. Shopping for shaving products online has been a hoot, reading all about how people consider scraping a metal blade across your face to be a &amp;#34;lost art.&amp;#34; What are we, princesses? Anyhoo, I&#x27;ll write my review for &amp;#34;the rest of us.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was looking to get as much stuff in a single package as possible, at the lowest price. I researched online for several days and ultimately decided that this one was the best value. I think that much is undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, mug, and soap are all fine. I would not describe them as amazing, I would simply say that they do an adequate job, and considering that we are talking about bathroom products, what more do you want? What are we, princesses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic stand that holds the brush - and a razor, although the packaging does not specify this - is the weak link here. It holds the brush perfectly, but the razor slides in behind the brush and has a tendency to slide back off the stand. It was obviously designed to save space, which could be a benefit, but for me, it tends to be a mild inconvenience to try to get at my razor every morning. But then again, what are we, princesses?</li>
    <li> Recently converted to using a safety razor for shaving. On recommendations from coworkers, I decided to try using shave soap instead of the normal shaving cream in a can. Found this set for a very reasonable price ($10 less than my local Walgreen&#x27;s) and thought it would be a good introductory set. It is just that; a perfect introductory set. The apothecary mug is nice, and some mugs cost just as much as this whole set. The stand included is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done, and fits both the brush and my Microtouch one safety razor very well. The shave soap is great and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. The brush is all badger hair, which my research tells me is the only way to go. The brush handle is plastic, but still looks good (doesn&#x27;t look cheap). Brushes can cost upwards of $100+, and I&#x27;ve read that if you are going to spend money on anything, you should invest more in the brush. My only concerns with this brush is with the quality of the glue holding the bristles to the handle. I just don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up. Only time will tell. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an open box item. It came sooner than it was quoted as when it would arrive . There was nothing wrong with the item the box was wrinkled on one corner. Big deal. great item.</li>
    <li> Got this one for my boyfriend for Christmas and it was a huge hit. He enjoys shaving with it, the only things that could be improved would be a nicer container for the cream (my boyfriend tipped it out into a little pyrex dish which looks a lot better) and the depth of the mug, which makes it difficult to work up a lather without getting it all over the brush handle and your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the whole a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave and good design. I had my doubts about the soap, but it has won me over. The only issue I have with it is the smell of the brush. It&#x27;s...gamey? I would say... I guess it&#x27;s the smell of badger. If I got the chance to change anything, it&#x27;d be getting a synthetic brush.</li>
    <li> bought this set about a year ago.  haven&#x27;t replaced a thing.  nice quality double edged razor and mug.  the only thing I&#x27;ve considered replacing is the stand.  Its plastic and easy to knock over.</li>
    <li> This is a nice starting kit for any beginner. The mug is solid and heavy, I leave it in the sink full of hot water to stay warm. The brush is not the best. It sheds often, and on my very first use the epoxy holding the knot in came right off... maybe my sink is just hotter than yours. The plastic holder is fine. I purchased as a first timer knowing I would upgrade relatively soon anyways, so it was worth the price to see if DE shaving was for me (IT IS).</li>
    <li> At the initial appearance everything seems nice and sturdy except for the fact that the stand was broken. It is very inconvenient to send the whole kit back because I need the kit now, plus why should i have to pay for return shipping on a defective item??? The brush seems fine to me. others have complained of it breaking, but honestly my two other Art of Shaving brushes came unglued as well. Nature of the beast I guess. The soap smells good and the mug is really as nice as my $50 Classic Shaving mugs. Just really bummed about the stand.</li>
    <li> the shipment was very quick, it was delivered way before the estimation time. The package was all good however the stand for the shave brush was crack but it can still be use. other than that it was spotless</li>
    <li> I had pre-ordered this set just for fun and to satisfy a shaving brush aquisition disorder along with a shave soap aquisition disorder. I wish I had owned something like this when I first started wet shaving.  It was shipped on Thursday the 24th of March. I received it the next day the 25th and shaved with it on the 26th. I am very pleased with this set. You could own only this set and not need any other soap or brush. The brush is pure badger and is a great brush. Soap is an improved one over the Deluxe (which is also a good soap for the money). It lathers great and is slick and protective for the blade. The scent is faintly reminiscent of cucumber. The apothocary mug is easy to use. Style wise is goes hand in hand with the brush. Both being a shiny black. And the stand for the brush is a thick heavy plastic which also has a slot for your razor. I&#x27;m liking this a lot. It is well worth the price of the product. If you&#x27;re just starting out wet shaving, this is a great way to start. If you&#x27;re an old pro, then this something worth adding to your collection.</li>
    <li> Great set...The first shave set that I owned was the old Van Der Hagen Shave set that was good for the beginner. Since then I have purchased the Art of Shaving Sandalwood set with the badger brush (great, but $100). I wish this new Van Der Hagen set would have came out sooner, I would have saved $100. The brush from TAOS is great but I LOVE the one from this set..Perfect height and weight..REAL BADGER HAIR..I know because I forgot to wash the brush with shampoo prior to the first use and it smelled like a wet dog...REMEMBER TO SHAMPOO BRUSH BEFORE USE...The mug I love as well..Perfectly designed...I have not tried the soap as of yet since I wanted to try the brush with my Proraso cream but it smells great...The stand is nice, not all that..Does what it is supposed to, hold a brush and a razor..Nothing to display and show off..It looks like it was a single piece of acrylic that was melted and formed into shape..Nothing to write home about but great add on...Over all if you are into wet shaving or know someone who is, BUY THIS SET if they do not all ready have it..</li>
    <li> Mixing bowl is nice but my big hands cant really utilize the handle it could stick out further by and inch and it would be perfect. The stand is ok but the slot for the razor is waaay to big so it flops around in it to much to the point its almost falls out guess they used a baseball bat to determine the slot size for the razor. The brush fell apart on first use due to the cheap woood glue they used on a metal to plastic part but was a easy fix with super glue. over all ok but if i had more money i would have bought better stuff.</li>
    <li> Looks great but this is a cheap product.  Had it for less than two weeks and the handle on brush broke!  Would not recommend!! Save your money and buy a better set.</li>
    <li> Great set at a great price. Genuine badger brush, nice cup, useful stand and pleasant shaving soap. What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my roommate and he loves it. Everything is a good quality. I would definitely recommend this as a gift for the special guy in your life</li>
    <li> The brush in this set is terrible quality, on my first shave with it I could smell what I thought was manure, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the glue used in the brush. The hairs of the brush are thin and limp and don&#x27;t pickup shaving soap very well. I&#x27;ve used a good quality brush for years but purchased this set for the mug (and a new brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use (today) and dried, the brush is all frizzy and looks more like an afro. I&#x27;ve avoid this set if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality brush.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  Yes some of the bristles come off, but I&#x27;ve never seen a brush that doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  The soap that comes with has no aroma, so I will be replacing with one that has a more menthol smell to it.  All in all not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> Be warned... I bought this kit for the same price at walmart but my box on the back says it is a boars brush not a badger brush! Im a little dissappointed because i read the discription on amazon and assumed it was badger. Beside that the set looks pretty good. The mug is solid and has a nice finish the stand is sturdy but simple. The soap smells good as all the other reviewers have said and the brush doesnt seem too bad. I have not used it yet as for they did not have the razor i wanted. I might use it tonight and use my fision just to give it a try. In the end the soap, stand and mug ar probably worth near $24 so if the brush is bad ill buy a super badger off amazon like im already planning.  Ill post an update after i use it.      Ok so i used it tonight just playing around. The soap was a little harder to lather then some i couldnt quite get it super thick i added water and used less and still wasnt that WOW lather. It smells soapy not as manly as i thought. So the brush was my concern and i let it soak in hott water for 15 minutes... The brush felt soft to the touch but not quite the case when i put it on my face... It was fairly prickly and also lost maybe 10 hairs. It will do the job for the price for now. Will be getting a super badger and maybe some other soaps.</li>
    <li> First to make it clear this is my first shaving brush so i don&#x27;t really have anything to compare too. Although i smelled the brush it didn&#x27;t smell like a dead animal like some other brush reviews I&#x27;ve read. My first use I didn&#x27;t have bristles fall off but we will see in a few more weeks to months. What i will note and i&#x27;m not sure is this important but after the first use there was several bristles that was frayed to the sides. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal, like i said just noting.        The cup looks very nice and sharp. Also very easy to hold as displayed. The soap cake fit in the bowl perfectly. The soap has a light and pleasant smell; practically neutral.  I won&#x27;t comment on the later since this is my first as we mentioned, but I have been shaving for 10 years and I must say its better than any creams or foam/gel that i&#x27;ve used. It may just be the nature of shaving soap but I love it and i intend to try different brands.        The stand however, held the brush very well but it couldn&#x27;t hold my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor. It doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to me as I do plan on getting a nice chrome Stand and a Merkur Safety razor and drop my Gillette. For the price one should be glad to get a stand at all.  --------  update day 3        I&#x27;m having bristle fall, about maybe 3-5 every time i use it. so i guess for 25 bucks the cup and soap was nice but i would recommend buying buying a colonel conk soap for 5 bucks and use a coffee mug and get spend a little more for a pure badger brush unless you want to go all out for a silvertip.</li>
    <li> The plastic stand for the brush and razor broke very easily just from falling off my counter. The soap and razor are nice but the razor handle is very short and my boyfriend has trouble with it. Everything looks very nice but it isn&#x27;t up to the quality standard I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Something the multi-blade industry has relied on is our stupidity. I grew up on multi-blade razors thinking more was better. My dad on the other hand used a safety razor. After reading and article on Lifehacker, I purchased a safety razor from Amazon and have never looked back. With the high cost of multi-blade razors, a safety razor is by far the best way to go! Much closer shave for much less! Same goes for shaving soap, a little goes a long way. I bought this for my son, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Definitely committed to the idea of DE shaving after years of tossing money down the plughole with the latest and &#x27;greatest&#x27; techno-shaving garbage. Once the drugstores start locking up something behind those glass cases, you know for sure that the scam is on.  I would say that all the components of this set are excellent save the stand which seems to be something of an anachronism. I replaced it with another more suitable stand and now the set really shines.  Those of you still shaving with Quadroopo-Mega nonsense from corporations that are just looking to empty your wallet, come back to the way your grandpa shaved. You will be amazed and delighted at what a classy thing a great DE shave can be.</li>
    <li> I received this kit as a Christmas  present this year (Dec. 2014) the brush is already falling apart. The hair is falling out in clumps, What a Chinese P.O.S. The mug and soap are O.K.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this kit. Buy a brush a good brush and any mug and soap will be fine.</li>
    <li> I love the set but my brush sheds ALOT...maybe I got a faulty one other than that its awesome and everything I wanted...I combined it with a nice black and chrome long handled double edge traditional butterfly razor that fits perfect in the stand and with the set...wish they would send me another brush</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for xmas and he loved it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Lots of questions and coments have been going around this product.&lt;br /&gt;1)  The bowl:  This is why I got this.  I needed a low cost bowl for my existing soap.  This bowl is a good design.  short enough to use (anyone using a coffe cup knows that digging in deep when soap is almost gone is hard to lather up without clinking the sides a lot), fit a standard size cake of soap very well as.  So the bowl gets an A+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brush:  I have only used it one time so far, but I am impressed.  Nice quality look and feel and only one lost hair.  Not bad sheeding as is normally expected.  Too early to give a full endorsement, but early signs are a solid A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  The soap:  OK its a personal preference but I think it smells nice.  But I have not used it as I am not done with my current cake.  Soap is cheap and a matter of choice.  I&#x27;m not grading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  The stand:  This is ok for the brush to stand in.  Of course you can just set the brush on its base facing up as I have done for years anyway.  Some folks say it is tippy.  If you only have the brush in it it seems to work fine.  The razor part is another story.  If you use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; razor with disposable blades like a Mach 3 or whatever it works ok.  I put one in there to check it.  but if you use a short handled double sided safety razor, this stand is quite poor.  I give the stand a C as a brush only stand and F as a combo razor / brush stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the small price,  I can not complain.  The item I bought this for gets an A+.  I am pleased with teh brush as well (bonus i my mind)  The soap is fine too.  Only the stand is dud.  But this is is very low cost buy it for you need and if you really want it for the stand, look at another kit.</li>
    <li> Bristles came unglued from brush. Superglued it back works fine. Soap is really nice. Foams well and doesn&#x27;t dry you out. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> The bowl is great. The bottom of the bowl is exactly the right size to fit shaving soaps. The handle and shape is perfect for creating foamy shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap in the set is wonderful. Creamy. Great scent. Gives as good a shave as I&#x27;ve received from a non-aerosol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great. I didn&#x27;t want anything that would show water spots, and it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush? Well, I don&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;m still picking a lot of brush hairs out of the bowl every time I shave. It functions okay, though. Just kind of thin and limp and getting more so as each day passes. Because of this, I was going to return the set. But then I compared prices for bowls and stands, I discovered that this set is still a good value, even if the brush doesn&#x27;t last long. When it gives out, I&#x27;ll just get a better one and keep the rest of the set.</li>
    <li> I bought the DE razor and this set from Target for a total of $45. On my first shave and use of brush to lather half of the Bristles were on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally my first use of it!!! Looking into different brushes to use with the bowl and Shaving cream.</li>
    <li> the soap is good as well as the mug but the brush is coming apart after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Broken mug upon opening.  No damage to other items or to the package itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband as a gift, and he keeps telling me how much he likes it!  The soap smells good and doesn&#x27;t have a lingering smell to compete with his cologne (a plus).  I knocked a star because it has SLS which my husband has a sensitivity to...</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a DE razor for bf. Lover that this was a package with a stand. So, far he loves everything! Fast shipping and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to get started, except for the razor &amp; preshave cream. I would purchase this set again. The brush sheds a couple of hairs at first, but tapers off after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I thought getting back into &amp;#34;luxury shaving&amp;#34; this would be a great starting set.  Well, the stand is the only thing I&#x27;m still using a few weeks into it.  The mug I very well may use in the near future.  Basically, the mug, stand and brush are all made in china.  The mug is basically the same you can get for around $15 and up with different names on it.  The stand is nothing fancy and does the job of holding the brush and razor (mine is a Merkur 180).  The brush is poorly constructed, however the badger hairs are soft.  The soap is glycerine based and not much better than bar soap.  Basically, I now use an Omega Boar Brush, Cella or Proraso soap and still use this stand.  Again, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but if I did it again, I&#x27;d basically buy a better stand, a brush and use a better soap product and not worry about this set or a mug in general.</li>
    <li> The bad: The stand arrived broken, and far too much of a hassle to send back the whole kit just for a new stand. The mug is great; soap smells good and makes adequate lather. The brush however is constantly losing bristles this gets annoying when applying the foam.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice starter set, or for the person that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, like me. The soap has very light scent, the mug is very nice, the stand is adequate and the brush is just fine thank you.  I have noticed the odd hair in the soap occasionally as some have pointed out, but it is not every shave. I get a nice, close clean shave. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked the soap dish and the soap, and I liked the brush, The stand was way too small and when you remove the razor you knock the brush off, and vice-versa!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and the brush is of good quality.</li>
    <li> Prefect for starter, all include, maybe just need to get after shave balm. Just wonder if other soap bar will fit the same bowl.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a gift. My brother is into nostalgic things and I thought he would get a kick out of this. He did like it a lot and he played with it for a bit, but it takes practice and work and he gave it up after a short time. Good gift though.</li>
    <li> I gave this set to my husband.  He was keeping his brush in an old coffee cup and the razor on the counter; I needed a holder for the brush and razor and the clear one that comes with this set works perfectly.  I like the simplicity of the black mug.   The shave set would make a great gift for the guy who \\&quot;has everything\\&quot; and likes the close shave of a safety razor.  My husband says the triple, quadruple blades on \\&quot;modern\\&quot; disposable heads pull his facial hair out too far before it cuts it, causing ingrown hairs under the skin.  Invest in a good safety razor to make this set complete.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this shave set to anyone who is looking to get started or just wants a nice soap mug and a terrific soap.  I agree that the brush may not be the best but I certainly have had much better results than what some have described.  My brush is soft but makes a great lather and it has held together quite well.  I can&#x27;t recommend the soap enough!  Get this soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this set and just tried it out. The bowl and the shaving soap do the job. The holder is nice. The brush, on the other hand, is a piece of hairy crap. Half of the hairs fell out on the first shave. That&#x27;s not supposed to happen. Would return it, but not worth the hassle. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Had this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s held up well.  My face is a difficult one to shave without getting ingrown hairs, but the badger hair brush really helps to get a close shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> For the price a good deal on a beard brush, cup, and soap with holder for brush and razor! Badger bristles are secured very well and are soft to medium. Good starting set or high end replacement.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this set to shave. The soap is surprisingly good and works as well as the ultra high tech shaving creams and gels that I have been using. The brush does lose a few bristles with every shave but it has not caused a problem and there has been no visible change to the brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for myself cause I was tired of buying replacement blades which are expensive! This set is made very well and the badger hair brush is awesome! But I was surprised how big the shaving bowl is because the pictures online are decieving. But I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this set! I highly recommend this set for anyone who wants to go by to the traditional way of shaving. And I really like the shaving soap that is comes with. It feels good when shaving.</li>
    <li> Just started the wet shaving technique and so far so good. Bought this set since it had what I needed in addition to my new Edwin De Razor. First impressions on this I have to say wonderful product, my only concern is the sensitivity of each persons skin. My skin is sensitive and that might be the reason for me not giving 5 stars for the included shaving soap product. Ordered a new shave cream to use in my shave bowl and will update wit information once I receive the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this kit and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The mug and soap are very nice. The brush is pretty floppy but will get you started if you don&#x27;t have one. The stand is designed more for a straight razor. I keep knocking the brush off when trying to put my DE razor on it.</li>
    <li> The Van Der Hagen Shaving kit is nice. The brush: perfect size and of quality hair. It does loose a few hairs, but not unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. The cup &amp; soap: great! the cup is functional &amp; looks good. The soap lathers up really well and has a traditional scent. The stand: cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t hold my razor very well...the brush seems to knock it out.  But no big deal as I&#x27;ve got a separate razor holder. All in all a quality product that makes you want to shave!</li>
    <li> Hair started falling out of the brush after three months&#x27; use. The soap was nice, the bowl is terrific, and the stand is perfect. But the brush isn&#x27;t much to talk about. I&#x27;m already in the market for another.</li>
    <li> Bought a weishi 9306-f with this product. I only bought this set because i needed a brush, mug, and wanted to try the shave soap. Wasn&#x27;t my first choice but the only set reasonably priced with a 100% badger brush, mug, and soap. It seemed that all other sets were either too over priced or didn&#x27;t have the items that i was looking for included. Quality is on point with price. If it lasts me a few years I&#x27;ll be happy</li>
    <li> I purchased the Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave Set.  It has a fancy European sounding name that is appealing and good for their marketing.  But what you receive is &amp;#34;you get what you pay for,&amp;#34; meaning it&#x27;s crap.  The bowl is nice with the knob in appearance, but with usage it&#x27;s uncomfortable to hold on to the knob and you end up &amp;#34;cupping&amp;#34; the bowl.  The clear plastic brush stand is heavy duty but just another thing to clutter the bathroom counter.... so for me it&#x27;s not needed.  The soap lathers well, smells nice without being overbearing and seems to have glycerin for your skin.  Now the brush...... cheap, brush irritates the skin and stinks right out of the box.  First time using, the brush came out of the handle... plop into the sink.  I&#x27;ve tried notifying the company with never a response for a replacement, comment, etc.  It&#x27;s all made in China.  Which is not a bad thing, but some things made there or anywhere is CRAP and this is CRAP.  With the time, hassle, and cost to ship it back for a refund you&#x27;ll be loosing more money and the &amp;#34;Van Der Hagen&amp;#34; company must know that.  Just good marketing starting with the fancy name.  Though tempted don&#x27;t buy, you&#x27;re wasting $$.  Wet shaving is good but go elsewhere for products.</li>
    <li> Great shave shoap, makes a nice smelling, rich lather. The badger brush is the lowest tier of badger (pure badger), but nonetheless is soft and good at charging up soap and creating a nice lather against your face, in a mug, or even the palm of your hand. The brush itself could be better constructed as it has lost quite a few hairs and this is happening after several weeks of ownership and use. Thankfully, this brush does not deform from use, at leats not yet, and retains its fluffy, soft nature. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the brush head falling off, but I do agree it feels cheap (knot is glued to a cheap, plastic handle). The bulldog mug it comes with is nice and comfortable in the hand and the stand looks good on almost any bathroom countertop (Will fit most safety razors or even regular cartridge razors, not meant for a straight razor). Overall it&#x27;s a good starter kit for anyone curious about delving into the world of safety razor shaving and using shave soap/creams.</li>
    <li> The horse hair brush smells like the horse is still connected to the brush</li>
    <li> This is good for beginners. You will find yourself craving a higher quality brush after 6 months, but for the price you can get none better. I highly recommend this to anyone who is about to begin, or someone looking for a travel set. I love you. Bye Bye.</li>
    <li> I order this product hoping to get a great shave,but unfortunately these razors aren&#x27;t as producted as I imagine they would be, I regret that I purchased this product,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a double edge razor for shaving.  Followed in my father&#x27;s footsteps.  I had a brush and mug years ago that went by the wayside.  What a wonderful relief to receive this set.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Since I already had Van Der Hagen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Premium Shave Set&amp;#34;, I figured let me get this one.  I went to my local Target &amp; picked it up for $24.99 plus tax.  The set came with an acrylic Shave Brush/razor Stand, a Badger hair Brush, VDH&#x27;s scented Luxury Soap, &amp; their &amp;#34;Apothacary&amp;#34; Mug for the shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;  I gave the Shave Brush/razor stand to a friend of mine who just started with the shave soap &amp; brush because I already have Shave Brush &amp; razor holders already.  But I kept everything else.  The mug is nice.  I still prefer the bowl I have from the premium shave set of Van Der Hagen&#x27;s.  I will have to wait to use the badger hair shave brush since I am still using a good boar bristle one.  But I CAN&#x27;T wait to use it!  The Luxury Shave soap I am keeping because I love Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Shave Soaps anyways.  Overall, I really like this set!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a father&#x27;s day present. My dad has been using it for the past three weeks and today the head of the brush popped out from the handle. You can see the dried glue around the rims. I suppose I can superglue it back, but I&#x27;m upset that this happened with only 3 weeks worth of use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend as an anniversary gift. He never used a shave set like this before- so it was great because it included the brush, stand, and bowl. He used it the first day he got it and raved about the great smell of the soap. This was a pleasant surprise because I was expecting it to be a little more musky. He said he kept smelling it for the rest of the day and loved it. And he&#x27;s not one to talk about perfumes or colognes. He&#x27;s planning on ordering more of the soap. And he loved the experience of whipping up the foam. I think it makes him feel a little classier in the morning!</li>
    <li> It works OK, but it does lose some of the hair each time I use it.</li>
    <li> I admit I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to achieving. A few months ago I bought this and started using the soap along with my five bladed fusion massacre machine. I just started purchasing different shave soaps and associated toiletries as well as a double edge saved razor. I decided to start off with the Van Der Hagen safety razor for 23 bucks here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very confused however because the razor would not stay in the razor part of the stand .I even called the company and they did not know why it did not. After looking at it for several moments, and perhaps thinking it was made for a straight razor–which may fit,I realized that I had to open the butterfly doors on the razor a tiny bit to make the bottom flat so it sits flat against the stand... still not a concise fit that I would like, But it will do until I make my custom marble shaving tray for my Subway tile bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI for anyone that&#x27;s on the fence about buying all this stuff for wet shaving all I can say is DO it! It really feels like you&#x27;re a MAN, the way men used to be the way...our fathers and grandfathers would. It&#x27;s very relaxing and you&#x27;re going to save lots of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus you smell really nice throughout the day and definitely women notice. I have had women, young and old that I didn&#x27;t even know come up to me in public and touch my face and come close to me to smell my face.... on more than one occasion. That is usually followed by a  &amp;#34;mmmmm&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t mind being told that i smell like their father or grandfather because they say it with a  that little twinkle in their eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So young males .... Keep your Axe body spray and chem–perfumed crap to yourself. The true appreciative women like that old-fashioned smell.</li>
    <li> What is there to say about a shaving mug and soap. The brush seems to be holding up well without the loss of too many bristles. The soap has a pleasant aroma and the mug is easy to hold with wet hands.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware that the brush included in this kit is complete garbage. The boar brush in the 10$ soap,mug,brush combo by Van Der Hagen has the same quality of hair as the brush in this kit. I purchased this kit thinking that it came with the same brush as the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Badger Brush IT IS NOT THE SAME BRUSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to make it clear the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Badger Brush that is sold as a separate item is a vastly superior brush in terms of the badger hair. The brush included in this kit is NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENT and would be a good way to rub your skin raw. The hair doesn&#x27;t even look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of that said, the soap and mug included in this set appear to be of good quality. The plastic stand was bigger and heavier than i was expecting an that was a pleasant suprise, however i was a little disappointed that the plastic stand was scratched up inside of the undamaged box. If you are buying this kit only for the mug soap and stand this could be a good deal for you, assuming you take the brush as a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a new wet shaver i would recommend that you buy an actual brush rather than this kit.</li>
    <li> Great shave mug, okay stand and good badger brush. I&#x27;ved owned a boar brush and I must say that the badger is a great upgrade. Some say that they would like the brush to weigh more because it floats, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. The soap lathers okay but doesn&#x27;t compare to a cream. Has a great smell though and leaves your skin nice and soft. Doesn&#x27;t overdry. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Excellent beginners set! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Brush is sturdy and creates/holds a nice lather. Plastic stand is a little boring but does the job. Make sure to keep brush held in upside down position when not using. Will extend life. Mug is nice. Very solid. Good handle. Soap is okay. Makes a nice lather and smells nice. If you are a serious straight razor shaver, I recommend the DREADNOUGHT products. As a whole, this is a nice set.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my last brush, but now wish I hadnt. The brush is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; quality, and the cup is pretty useful, but after a few uses, the brush got knotty, and it really just isn&#x27;t as smooth as the last badger hair brush that I had. If there are varying qualities of badger hair, I&#x27;d say this one is low. If your going to spend $30 for a badger hair brush anyway, just spend more and get something that will work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I now buy my brushes from WhippedDog.com Great Silvertip brushes for the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen on the web!</li>
    <li> Great Save Set, good quality soap and a decent quality brush. Brush smells a bit odd, but I assume that is the case with all badger hair brushes. The lather dish &amp; razor/brush stand that comes in this kit are great also. Over all nothing but good things from this at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> The brush is of good quality as is the bowl. I&#x27;m not to crazy about the shaving soap that comes with this set, but it may be my lack of experience in this type of shaving that&#x27;s at fault. It has a very good scent but it is just hard for me to build up a good lather. All in all it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> It was  gift, and it was well liked. A good useful purchase!!! I would recommend it as a gift for people.</li>
    <li> The brush is still losing strands of fur even after a dozen uses.  Just buy a top of the line brush from the get go and save yourself the trouble.</li>
    <li> Well, some negatives first: the brush head fell out on my first use!  I had to superglue it back in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still undecided about how I feel about the soap.  Seems ok for now.&lt;br /&gt;And the stand does not hold the brush or razor well, especially the razor- it&#x27;s very easy to fall off if you don&#x27;t keep it still.  If you have a place on the counter you can keep it at all times, it&#x27;s probably a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: The mug was much bigger than I thought it was going to be, at first I thought wow this is huge, too big even.  But after using it I realized it&#x27;s just right and their soap bar fits it perfectly.  The brush, aside from poor gluing, is a nice full head of hair, not a dinky thing that many cheap brushes are.  It may not be top quality and very stimulating to the face, but it lathers on the soap good.  Oh and the brush and mug do look nice and presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to rate it 3 or 4 stars, until I took the price into account.&lt;br /&gt;Based on what you get for only $25, I have to say I am overall pleased and would probably buy it again if I had to do it over.</li>
    <li> I learned to shave with a safety razor some 30+ years ago, but have been using the cartridge razors since. The prices on these are getting outrageous, so I&#x27;ve decide to go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, and started with this when my shaving gel ran out. Took some practice to get just the right amount of water so it will lather up just right, and now that i have that figured out, I LOVE this! The shave is just as good as the fancy shaving gel I was using (I won&#x27;t name names), but I get less irritation on my skin with this soap. As soon as my cartridges run out, I&#x27;ll be switching over to a safety razor for good, too (have one ready to go, and tried it a couple times - LOVE IT!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, though, that I did not buy it on Amazon. I found it at Walmart, and got it there. I&#x27;m not going to give out the price I paid since I&#x27;m reviewing the product, and not starting a pricing war. I&#x27;ll just say that, like everything else, you should shop around if you want to find the best price.</li>
    <li> The shave soap is not great.  It worked for my first couple shave experiences until I got my Proraso shipment in.</li>
    <li> I bought this to start shaving with a double-edged safety razor.  I was nervous as to how it would work, but I have been very satisfied.  One thing to note, the mug included with this kit is too large for the replacement soap they sell in the 12-packs.  The soap in this kit is very nice, lathers great, and allows for a great shave.  I would definitely recommend if you are considering a change to a real razor, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this kit!</li>
    <li> I liked the set however the brush broke the second time I used it. A little super glue and our was back if action. I just figured I would get more then one use out of it before it broke</li>
    <li> But I recommend using Williams brand soap instead of the soap this comes with.</li>
    <li> perfect gift for a guy!</li>
    <li> If you are interested in embarking on the incredible journey of classic shaving, I would say this is a great place to start. Van Der Hagen has produced an excellent product here, especially for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to be any sort of classic shaving veteran by any means; however, I am most definitely well accustomed to this class of shaving. Is there better/higher quality products out there? Yes of course there is, but not in this price range. The brush offers a comfortable handle for building your lather, and holds water quite well too. The mug is a perfect fit for the puck that is included with this package. The mug has a nice quality feel to it and is quite comfortable in the hands as well. As for the soap, It has a fantastic fresh sent to it that is not to powerful like others I have used. It seems to to a fair job and building up a decent lather too! Last but certainly not least, the stand. A stand for your shaving set is absolutely essential for proper care of your equipment. It may not be the most appealing stand on the market, but hey it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Its a great kit for $25. Mug: the mug holds water, fear not, the water is held by the mug. :) Soap: I was pleasantly surprised by the soap, i was expecting a cheap, motel hand soap scent and a crappy lather from it and thats not what i got. The scent is very enjoyable almost cologne-ish. The lather also worked well for me and lasted through my shave without any nicks. Stand: the stand holds my brush and my razor in a haphazardly fashion. The razor has to be in a specific angle or it won&#x27;t stay on the holder or there isn&#x27;t room for a brush (minus 1 star.) Brush: the brush has actually been working really well for me, its stiff enough to get a good lather/exfoliation but still soft. Again the kit was $25 (at time of purchase) so if you&#x27;re starting out or testing a potential hobby give it a go, just order a different stand. Cheers!</li>
    <li> The only reason i gave it 2 stars and not 0 was because the soap and cup are great. Cup is solid and works as it should. The soap has a light fragrance and works well on my skin. Now the bad, the brush is horrible. Worked fine for the last month then the hair started falling out a little by little. Then last night after i soaked in hot water as i do my others the glue holding it together gave way and the thing fell into two. There is a huge cavity in the handle and not a lot of surface area for it to be glued in properly. Do yourself  a favor and buy the soap and cup separate. Brush is poor quality,</li>
    <li> Okay brush. Nice stand and mug.. Great cake of shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I&#x27;ve had is the knot shed a little bit with the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;It also had an oily smell to the bristles on the knot,and this has faded some with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 March 15... Update&lt;br /&gt;Took this from 5 stars to 2 stars after a few  weeks of limited use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving brush knot started to become loose in the handle so I had to Gorilla Glue it back on.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving stand broke an ear off at the brush holder. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold up well.. The mug is great. The soap is okay..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this for the mug were I to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year now. Great product. Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to and looks great as well in any bathroom</li>
    <li> I really like VDH products and this set is no exception. The mug works well, the brush is nicer than my old Boar brush which I actually really still like, and I like the stand it comes with too. I&#x27;m not some wet shaving expert but this set works for me and I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and price. The soap is great too. VDH soaps work really well for me and since they&#x27;re cheap, I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> got it for my dad as a entry level set and he is stoked with it.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for our adult son,  It is a nice looking shave set, and he was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift at Christmas.  I love the brush, it appears to have a quality build, and I hope it lasts a good long time. The mug is a mug. The soap, however, is a big disappointment.  It does nothing to soften up my beard or lubricate my face.  I am getting the worst shaves in a decade with this soap.  In any case, I have some goat milk soap on the way and I&#x27;ll probably toss the soap that was included in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand for the brush and shaver is basic acrylic, but it is nice to have a place for my razor now.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it is a nice starter set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update ***&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice of some other users and the soap is working better. It still isn&#x27;t my favorite and I won&#x27;t buy more.  You have to add water and let it sit in there for a while.  I also used some shave oil I had sitting around, which didn&#x27;t hurt on the lubrication front. The soap still doesn&#x27;t do a great job softening up the beard, but I&#x27;ll use up what I have.</li>
    <li> My husband is extremely proud of his beard and has procrastinated about buying a set like this for years. He loves the feel of the badger brush and really enjoyed the scent of the soap.</li>
    <li> Now, I don&#x27;t know much about the world of men&#x27;s luxury shaving. What I do know is that my boyfriend has always wanted one of these types of kits for &#x27;fancier&#x27; shaving, so I purchased it for him as a Christmas gift. Little did either of us know that there really is something to it! The brush really exfoliates your hair follicles/face prior to shaving, so you end up with a much smoother, closer shave than you would if you had simply lathered on some shaving cream. For a starter kit this is very nice quality, I even use it on my legs. The soap smells really pleasant.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! It was his first boar hair brush and after using said it was the most amazing shave ever. The soap that comes with it has a wonderful scent and I plan on ordering refills of the soap.</li>
    <li> Simple starter kit. Came as pictured. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good quality and looks great on the bathroom countertop. The brush works great and your straight razor will fit neatly in hte holder. The holder is a little light but works well. Amazon rocks on how quickly I recieved it.</li>
    <li> My dad used to use sets like this when I was small, so I ordered him one for Christmas. He really liked it.</li>
    <li> For a good start into the shaving as a real man, this is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package itself let&#x27;s you know the good of a product you bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three things&lt;br /&gt;-The cup - nice black ceramic gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;-brush - has a weird smell, hope it&#x27;s from the real hair, does a fair job if using good lather&lt;br /&gt;-soap - nice shaving soap, don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin but it isn&#x27;t a no no NOOOOO</li>
    <li> This is a great set for the price.  I just started wet shaving and this set is my intro. The shave soap smells nice and lathers up pretty easily.  The stand is nothing special, just clear plastic, but it does its job. The brush is better quality than those in the grocery store but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will hold up terribly long. The brush does feel really good though when you are lathering your face. All in all a solid product.</li>
    <li> This is a great Mug &amp; Brush set for those of you jumping on the wayback machine for great shaving experience. You could probably piecemeal each item but you&#x27;ll be spending more. The Badger Hair Brush does a great job of getting a good lather while raising all those small hairs on your face and neck. While it has lost some hairs during my initial uses it has held up very well to this point. The stand is clear Lucite, looks good and holds the brush easily for drying plus there&#x27;s a place that will fit most safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mug is a nice heavyweight ceramic one and comes with a bar of pleasant smelling shaving soap. Whether you dry shave or wet shave you&#x27;ll have plenty of room to raise your preferred lather. Overall this is a good value and paired up with a simple Van Der Hagen safety razor I&#x27;ve been getting great shaves very inexpensively compared to the disposable cartridge razors and canned creams/gels.</li>
    <li> it is cheap and the Brush has already fell apart and it is just a little over  month old</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to make the switch to shave soaps and a badger brush.  I purchased this at a Walgreen&#x27;s, and Amazon is a little less expensive.  You can get more expensive starter kits, but this one is perfect, especially if you&#x27;re just trying to test this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have extremely sensitive skin, and am prone to razor bumps, even with a brand new razor, and sensitive-skin shave gel, with a lot of skin prep.  So keep that in ind while reading.  Here&#x27;s my rating in order of precedence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o The SOAP gets 5 stars --  The soap has a very pleasant scent, and even though it has cocoa butter in it, I can&#x27;t smell it (which is a plus for me).  The soap lathers really well, is very slick, and I actually got no nicks on my first shave.  It rinses very clean, and left me with a feeling on my skin that I usually get after using a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o  The BRUSH gets 4 stars -- The Brush did shed a little bit, which may be normal, but it did bother me a little bit.  Also, the bristles are very soft, which make it difficult to work an extremely thick lather.  However, it did allow me to work a lather that was very slick and protected my face; I just usually prefer heavier.  The scent of the badger brush isn&#x27;t overly powerful, and I&#x27;m sure it will wash out in a couple weeks (I shave daily).  Does the job, and is an attractive handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o  The STAND gets 4 Stars -- There&#x27;s no channeling on the stand for water runoff, which is the main reason (NOT A DEAL BREAKER).  Standing water breeds bacteria, so I didn&#x27;t like that.  It cleans very easily though, and holds my triple blade razor just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o The BOWL gets 5 Stars -- This bowl is large enough to accommodate other soaps, and not run over with lather.  The handle isn&#x27;t entirely ergonomic, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  The porcelain finish is very smooth, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o Not that you need to make a fashionstatement while shaving, but this kit looks great, and is just as functional.  I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I&#x27;m very impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using this with a 4 bladed razor, and it&#x27;s great.  I plan on purchasing a safety razor once I&#x27;m out of cartridges, so I&#x27;ll update my review then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this was helpful</li>
    <li> works well, the mug is comfortable in the hand and looks nice. The brush holds water nicely and works up a good lather. The soap smells nice. The stand is very simple, not much to look at but it does work well and allows the brush to dry properly and even has a little dimple at the base for the razor handle to sit in.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the soap! It&#x27;s very exotic, and my girlfriend loves it. The stand is great. Not expensive looking, but very sturdy, and elegant. The bowl is amazing. Very heavy duty for ceramic, and the handle feels great. The brush is fantastic other then the fact the bristles seem to come out rather fast. Everytime I lather it up, around 5 bristles come out. Not sure if this is due to it being brand new, or poorly made. That is why only 4 stars. Otherwise 5!!!</li>
    <li> I soak the brush in a coffee cup of boiling water while I shower. I enjoy the feel of a hot brush and the hot foam it makes in the shaving mug. I&#x27;ve had it almost 2 years and while I&#x27;ve occasionally noticed the loss of a bristle or two the brush is still in great shape. I just bought another set because I dropped the mug on a hard tile floor and it cracked.</li>
    <li> This set is currently selling for $28. It includes a bowl, a larger shaving soap, brush, and stand. The brush is actually really a quality brush, much better than the $15-20 brushes offered on amazon like the Escali. It has a realy full head and is easily worth at least $15-20. The bowl is pretty nice, I wish it were a bit smaller on the bottom to hold in place the cheap Van Der Hagen shave soaps that you can buy, but as it stands it&#x27;s a great bowl, easily worth $8-12. The stand is simple, and looks good sitting next to almost any sink. Probably worth $5-8. The soap is larger, smells nice, and lathers really well, probably worth $3. You add everything up, and you realize this set is probably one of the better deals on Amazon. It&#x27;s EASILY worth its $28 asking price, and a great way to introduce yourself to the art of wet shaving. Buy this, and the gorgeous and amazing [[ASIN:B001VSX0XY Edwin Jagger Double Edge Safety Shaving Shave- Black &amp; Chrome Plated]] and you&#x27;ll know only get an awesome shave, but look BA and cultured as hell as it sits next to your sink.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research online, and this is the best deal that I could find. If you are starting out with nothing, you need the cup/bowl for the soap, soap, a good badger brush and something to hang it on so that it can dry.  Buying these separately will cost you more.  Every other cheap badger brush got worse reviews.  I&#x27;ve used this brush a few times so far and have been impressed with the quality and craftsmanship. Good soap as well.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for about 6 months.  The mug is very nice, the brush comes with a stand and the items preform very well.  Despite some brush shedding, this did not bother me.  Unfortunately, the bristle head of the brush has detached from the base.  Despite my efforts to reattach with glue, it cannot withstand a good lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one would be better off buying a higher quality brush and getting the cream/soap and mug seperately.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father in law, who is old fashioned and takes his grooming very seriously. He loved it. So thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Good brush and stand. And I really like the soap. This is the perfect starter shaving kit. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shaving Set is the best package out there.  Well packed and professional looking box makes is a great gift presentation.  All in one kit and a fair low price.  Good quality brush and hip design.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Update one year later:  The receiver of this fine gift set said he was going to grow a beard so I thought I&#x27;d give him a beard trimmer and asked him about it. He then said he changed his mind about the beard because he loves using his shaving mug/kit!  The brush is fantastic even after one year&#x27;s use - that is a lot of shaves!</li>
    <li> My husband used to use a specific brand of aerosol shaving cream, but it was discontinued and he had to switch to the gel-type aerosol stuff. He&#x27;s never been really happy with it. Plus, there are a LOT of really questionable chemicals in most of these products ([...]  On a whim, I decided to get this set for him as a stocking stuffer. Well, he REALLY likes the shaving brush approach, and the handle on the bowl seems to make it much more comfortable/easy to use. As a bonus, the soap cakes used for shaving brush lather are generally much simpler products than the aerosols, and you can get some really neat scents.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush and soap set. I like the handle on the cup to hold on to. The soap cake fits well in the bowl. The soap creams nicely and is better than any foam or gels I have used in the past. The brush sheds some. Otherwise I&#x27;m pleased with the set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money so a few month ago I began using an old style saftey razor. Using the brush, cup, soap from this set, along with a Merkur 180 Long Handled Safey Razor, I began getting the best shaves of my life, and I have been shaving for 6-7 years now. The only reason why razors with 3-5 blades are so popular, is because the companies that make them spend lots of money on advertising to make people believe that more blades make it better which is very false.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this item, or anything else related to safety razors, please search around online and do your homework. You will be amazed when you realize how much money you will save over the course of the year and your lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By shaving with a double edged safety razor you might not be like all the cool people with the newest razor that you see on tv, but you will have a better shave and a lot more money in your pocket.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased 2 of these for our boys....Christmas Gifts so they have not opened them as of yet.  We wills see on Tuesday if they think he is crazy or not.....I think I know that answer!</li>
    <li> Like other people said in many of the other reviews, this is a good shaving set for someone who just got into shaving more traditional way with straight or safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just say that this is a good set. The soap is big and it smells nice. The soap cup is big and it has nice shiny black color to it. The brush is something i am not sure what to think about. It looks nice, feels nice, but like few other people said, the brush tends to lose little hairs all the time. I tried wetting it a lot, putting a lot of soap on it and saw few tutorials on how to shave with safety razor. However, the hairs still fall out even after two month use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it is me or the brush, but the hairs are still going to come out. This can be annoying but the hairs are not coming out as much as on the first day I shaved with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nice set and nice reasonably price. Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 03/01/2013&lt;br /&gt;Alright, after having this set for a while I figured to give an update. Everything so far is great (soap, cup for soap, and the stand) are great. The brush on the other hand is really bad. I pull out more than 30 of those hairs before each use and even more after. It has come to the point that my sink is full of hair that clogs the sink. It is all over the place. Do yourself a favor and get a new more expensive brush. It will be well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He likes to use this about once a week for a good smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush, and a great sturdy soap bowl. Good way to work up a thick lather, good lubrication for shaving.</li>
    <li> I just received this shave kit and it such a wonderful kit. The soap bowl is a very elegant glass bowl that is fairly heavy and has a beautiful design on it. It is not overly heavy but it is heavier than I thought because I was expecting it to be plastic. The brush is softer than I can describe and is so much better than the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush I had before. The stand is just a clear plastic stand that is nothing special but it does its job. It holds the brush very well but not as good for my straight razor. Any little bump and it will fall over. If you have a safety razor, Mach3, or any conventional razor like that it should be fine. Being only 32 bucks they have to save money somewhere and the bowl and the brush are excellent quality so for the stand to be on the lower end is fine with me. The soap smells so much better than the Omega Shave Soap that I have been using but it doesn&#x27;t have the older generation musk smell. I cant really describe the scent but it is so nice. I cant say enough good things about this kit and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;m the type of person who scrutinizes every little thing so for me to like it you will love it! I would buy it again in a heart beat and even be willing to pay more for what already comes in the box but would pay more for sure for a better stand. Don&#x27;t look at any other kits. Just click add to cart and check out. You wont be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this set! Uses it everyday! Could not find in any store. Located here at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He really likes the feel of the brush. It sits on our bathroom counter and looks nice! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Brush is a decent quality and the stand is nice and modern looking. Soap has been mild and makes a nice foam, I haven&#x27;t missed using the old Mach 3 and shave cream. So much less irritation and very smooth. Not to mention less expensive.</li>
    <li> everything you need besides the razor and that is perfect bc that is the item you want to do some research on when you look up which one to buy.  The badger brush makes a great lather.  I prefer cream over soap but you will get that with feel of using them both...great set for a great price</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the high quality of this product.  Never thought a shaving brush and shaving soap would make such a difference in the closeness and comfort of shaving--I&#x27;ll never use regular shave cream again except in an emergency.  The brush is well made, works up a great shaving lather, cleans easily, and dries quickly.  The soap works well, and having the mug and stand as part of the bargain made this an excellent buy.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Besides the constant shedding of the brush, I was pretty happy with this product overall.  Some people complain about the soap, etc, but I thought it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the brush handle broke in two after just a few months.  Emails to the manufacturer come back as undeliverable, and for whatever reason the contact form on their website doesn&#x27;t seem to work either.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift, a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; to evaluate how my husband would like this type of shave. He will never return to conventional shaving cream.</li>
    <li> The kit comes very well packaged and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is good quality and froths up nice.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very soft and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;If the stand were not plastic and matched the soap mug better it would be perfect, but the stand is strong and does it&#x27;s job so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set at a reasonable price. The mug is ceramic and you can place it with the shaving soap in the microwave (for about 10-12 seconds) to create a sealed base. The brush is alright. The clear stand gives it a neat modern look.</li>
    <li> Very high quality brush, cup, and soap. Mild masucline scent in the soap. Brush is strudy and bristles don&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this set!  Now all we need is a quality razor...maybe we will check if this brand offers some!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to straight shaving so maybe this normal when you get a new brush. This brush seems to loose hair every time I use it. This soap and mug do what there are supposed to.</li>
    <li> It is not good or bad, just okay.&lt;br /&gt;The mug is nice but if you do a mug wrong there are real problems. LOL&lt;br /&gt;The brush is okay but is not luxury, it&#x27;s not even &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;; those words have specific meanings for shaving brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells nice and lathers okay but not &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;.  I will finish using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: a fair price for a starter kit but it is just that, a sample kit to see if you like it.  If you do, you will upgrade the brush.</li>
    <li> I began my switch to DE shaving using the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]]. That kit is actually pretty usable, and I had no issue with the plastic-handled boar bristle brush. However, it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand. If you look around, the only stands you&#x27;ll find are either expensive, not made well enough to stand up to water exposure (cracking of wood, peeling of metal plating), or hold only a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one at the same price as a plastic stand elsewhere, but THIS one&#x27;s stand comfortably holds the included brush AND my razor. Since it&#x27;s plastic, it won&#x27;t rust or crack from exposure to water. It looks good on the counter. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a badger brush, instead of the boar brush that comes with the cheaper kit. The \\&quot;off\\&quot; smell of the badger brush faded within three days or so, and the initial shedding of bristles was done within a week. The brush is nice and soft, although, to be honest, I might slightly prefer the stiffer boar bristles for spreading shaving cream. (Note that the slot for the brush on the stand included in this kit is a bit snug for the cheaper kit&#x27;s brush. A bit of sanding might be in order to enlarge the cutout a bit, if you wanted to do that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a mug for shaving soap. A HUGE, OVERSIZED mug. I donated that to the thrift store, in favor of a smaller repurposed coffee cup that matches my bathroom and isn&#x27;t ginormous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it comes with shaving soap. It&#x27;s white, and really heavily scented. It also doesn&#x27;t lubricate as well as the inexpensive [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]] that comes in the cheaper kit. I tossed the soap with this kit after 10 days (and several razor burns), and all is well after going back to the cheap kit&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m quite happy I bought this, if only for the stand and brush, so even if the other items aren&#x27;t to your liking (as they weren&#x27;t to mine), you&#x27;re coming out ahead.</li>
    <li> The price on this set is a  huge value. I&#x27;ve seen the cup for more than this set. Shaving brushes can go above $100. I have had this a bit over a few months. This review has been edited on April 11,2015. To shave with this you can&#x27;t hurry . My best results have been doing these steps.  Microwave a coffee cup of water for 2.5 minutes. Pour a small amount on top of the soap and cup, place brush in the cup of water. Let it set for 5 or more minutes.Water should be absorbed by the soap.Shake out the brush  and work up the lather. This will take at least 2 minutes. brush your face in circles to get good lather on your face. I have squeezed lather out of the  brush to get the thickest lather to my face. The lather/soap has a very clean nice smell and the lather  is thicker and less airy than the cans.Some soaps cost more than this whole kit.I read other more costly palm oil based soaps may last a year and have better lather. There is a lot of shaving with a brush videos &amp; tips on you tube.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. It came fast and it is  an accurate description</li>
    <li> Brush broke off the handle on the first use! Kind of a bummer but I didnt buy this kit for the brush anyway. I already have a nice badger brush. Will try to hot glue it back in place. Mug is a little narrow at the base but looks nice. Stand is functional. Havent tried the soap yet.</li>
    <li> First experience with shave soap and brush.  It adds an extra minute to morning routine but it smells good and the whole kit looks nicer on the sink than a metal can of shaving cream that leaves behind rust marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six weeks of use shaving 4-5 times a week I&#x27;ll admit that the brush bristles seem to be falling out more often than I would like.  Brush might need to be replaced more often than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it. it comes with a stand , soap, ceramic mug and brush.</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoys the luxury shave set. It looks very nice in our bathroom too.</li>
    <li> Love the bowl, soap and stand.  But I wish the brush didn&#x27;t shed so much.</li>
    <li> like the foam but it has a smell... ... .... ... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ...... ..... ...... .... .... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... .. ..... .. ..</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my boyfriend and my brother. My brother was a first time wet shaver so at first was a little lost but ended up loving it. His favorite item was the soap, my brother has some issues with dry skin and occasional breakouts and ever since using the shaving soap his skin is soft and clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My boyfriend has been using a straight razor ever since he learned how to shave and is VERY picky when it comes to brushes/soaps/shavin mugs &amp; bowls etc. He was blown away! He removed his old set (which he spent over $300 on) and replaced it with this one. He loves it, the modern look, the soap, and even the brush. Thank you for helping the men in my life be happy campers. I was so worried too because they are hard to buy for, but this indeed do the trick! (he said it was the closest shave he has had in years and loves the smell of the soap! Ty!)</li>
    <li> Budget material for a budget gift set.</li>
    <li> If you or someone you know is considering making the switch to this type of shaving experience, this is the kit for you. Soap lathers up well and has a light scent to it. Brush handle is plastic, but otherwise well made. Best part is that you can continue to use your favorite brand of razors with this kit. Definitely a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice set, great brush, decent lather, but i plan on trying other soaps also. Bought this along with a safety razor. The shave is much better than the multi blade razors out there. Also don&#x27;t get the razor burn.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. You will get the closets shave ever. I will only use this product. So amazing and works so well. The brush is great and the soap is so soft and good smelling.</li>
    <li> i went back to wet shaving and this is a great starter set. I like the cup especially, as it really allows you to whip up some foam. The soap have a pleasant smell to it and covers well. The brush works well and does shed a little bit at the beginning which is to be expected. That happened with my Art of Shaving badger brush too, so it&#x27;s just part of starting out I suppose. This is a great set to start with as I said and you can grow from there and upgrade as you like. Plus, if you don&#x27;t like the wet shave feel then you did not drop tons of money on a expensive option.  Great value</li>
    <li> All good but the stand was broke and the broken pieces weren&#x27;t even in the box I say you just go to Walmart and pick it up there but it&#x27;s good stuff though awesome</li>
    <li> I was hoping i would love this brush and shaving soap better than my normal gel, however I find that the brush is always losing the strands and the soap does not seem to work as well with my skin as the gel.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this but it&#x27;s turned out to be a mix of okay and good. The mug is great, I even had coffee in it after I ran out of clean mugs, so it&#x27;s multi-purpose, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a bit meh. I thought when it touched my skin, it would feel like Jennifer Lawrence gently caressing my cheek in a seductive manner. I did not feel that way but it&#x27;s not too bad either, if you think really hard, you can almost feel Jennifer Lawrence caressing your cheek but with gloves on!&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells very pedestrian and does not foam as easily or as well as I would have liked. I have not tried showering with the soap yet, I plan to do that soon and hope the soap will redeem itself as a shower soap.</li>
    <li> Love that new soap and brush for shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice set but it is extremely basic. It is an excellent option if you are getting curious about this type of wet shaving. The badger brush actually came out if its handle yesterday. It is just cheaply assembly line made. Luckily I was able to reassemble it with a strong epoxy. I will probably be getting a better quality brush soon anyway. the shave mug is very nice and is probably the best part of the kit. The soap is okay and it lathers up pretty nicely but there are better options out there. The stand is decent but not real stable. Overall this is a great basic inexpensive starter set to see if you want to actually do this sort of shaving. If you already wet shave then stay away from this as there are much better options out there buying each piece separately.</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart almost immediately.  The bristle head separated from the handle, making it almost impossible to use.  Poor quality - I would recommend buying something else.</li>
    <li> I had to re-glue the brush head to the handle. I don&#x27;t know how long this brush will last.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I really like this kit. The soap cup is perfect, and the brush does whip up a helluva lather. I recommend Conk&#x27;s Amber soap, and have not used the included soap yet. But honestly the soap cup alone is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I started using a safety razor and was getting nicks on my neck. So looking for someway to better lube up my face, I came across this. Takes a little more time to shave, but a very pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Probably the best shaving set I&#x27;ve owned. The soap holder is high quality with a great grip and easy to clean surface. Also the brush is decent, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Pretty basic stuff, everything worked as expected. The soap smells good and the brush feels soft. Saved me from having to get this stuff separate.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas because normal shaving gel and razors were giving him terrible razor rash. Once he started using this, the razor rash greatly decreased. He really likes it. Compared to other shaving kits I looked at, the value for the money on this one was great.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to receive this set as my old brush, which I have had for more than 20 years, was on its last \\&quot;legs\\&quot;. But within 3 months, this brush has begun to lose its bristles...great clumps are falling out. Cheap is cheap, I guess. I won&#x27;t be buying another of these brushes ever again.</li>
    <li> I am a noob at this shaving traditionally, and once you go black (with this kit!), you won&#x27;t go back. I bought a Mercur blade that uses feather razors, excellent product complimenting this excellent starter kit.</li>
    <li> Feels great to use this soap and brush on the skin.  Compared to most gel and creams this goes on smoother, you use less of the product, and my face feel smoother afterwards.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this shave set to arrive in the mail.  It was going to be my first venture into using a shave soap.  After the first use I was washing out the brush and it completely popped out of the handle and couldn&#x27;t be reattached.  Looks like I should have used a higher quality brand.  I will say that the soap container was very nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving (badger brush and soap) for over 7 years now. I have over a dozen badger brushes and have tried so many shave soaps I&#x27;ve lost count. This kit from Van Der Hagen is the most exceptional value I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, while not super soft like a high end brush, is a perfectly serviceable brush. It&#x27;s a little scatchy on your face but not uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is fantastic. Paired with the brush you can create a rich, creamy, wet, slick lather - perfect for shaving. The soap is very moisturizing it won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dried out like many shave soaps. Instead, my face feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included mug and brush stand are a great addition. I&#x27;m stunned that such a great kit is available at such a low price. I would recommend this kit for all would-be wet shavers and even those veterans that own several brushes and soaps like I do. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only piece of advice is to wash the brush well before your first use. Wet the brush and use some hair shampoo and work up a good lather to rinse out the residue from manufacturing the brush. The brush will shed a few hairs after each use but this will subside over a few days use.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast and very promptly! Great little kit other than I would redesign the razor holder as a whole rather than a slot, other wise overall a great product.</li>
    <li> This shaving kit is so wonderful. my husband and I both love the manly sent of the soap. thank you</li>
    <li> This purchase was my first foray into shaving with a brush and shave soap.  Been for about two month now and I&#x27;m very happy. The brush is high quality and after being used almost everyday for two months I have not found one hair that&#x27;s fallen out of the brush.  The shave soap that comes with the set is nice and foams up well. The acrylic stand holds the brush nicely and also holds a standard razor, although my razor does fall out occasionally.  The manufacturer should redesign that part of the stand so a razor sits at a more acute angle to prevent this.</li>
    <li> This is a good value old fashioned style mug and soap that has a badger brush that is comfortable and eay to use. The holder is nothing special it&#x27;s just plastic but the mug and brush are both nice quality.</li>
    <li> There are many different kits out there to start the journey into Wet Shaving or #shavinglikeaman ;) and this one is great! Wonderful smell on the shave puck. The brush from what I can tell is good quality. (i&#x27;m fresh to this so i&#x27;m trying out different brushes) The handle on the mug makes it great so you won&#x27;t drop the mug on your toe and ruin your morning. The holder is clear rigid plastic and holds up nicely. For the beginner this is great! Have fun and enjoy the shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for a bit now and I LOVE it.  Soap smells great and works very well, way better than any big name stuff from a can.  It&#x27;s very gentile on your skin and does a great job letting the razor glide across your face (I have the Merkur Futur D/E).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand works very well and fits my razor on it perfectly.  The mug is heavy and looks really nice.  easy to just leave it on the counter and build a lather with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush is good (excellent at this price).  I have not had any issue with shedding from my brush.  I took the time to read the instructions and get tips from online before I used anything and I think that&#x27;s part of the reason I don&#x27;t have any issue.  Silver Tip Badger brushes are softer and feel better on your face, but the brush alone can be 3x-6x the price of this whole kit so let&#x27;s keep things in perspective...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t and should not use a lot of pressure on the brush when building a lather or applying the lather to your face.  I rinse the brush well and shake off excess water, put it right on the stand and let it fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the brush I had about 4 hairs shed (expected from a brand new brush).  Since then, maybe 6-7 more hairs total have shed from the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of this set and it will take care of you.  This is a great set to get you started with out a lot of money down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10-1-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still Zero issue from this set.  I&#x27;ve used up the soap and moved to a Taylor of Old Bond Street cream that is very nice.  not THAT much better than the soap that came with this set, but it does moisturize my skin better and is nice enough to be worth the extra few $$ to me.  Brush is still working great with still nearly zero shedding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, this is a great set to start off with and expand upon.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas last year. He loves having the cup for his soap and uses this every day to shave his head. He already had a cheap brush that he bought at the drug store and prefers it over the brush that came with this set but loved the rest of the Shaving Set.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s only complaint with this was the brush - which is the most important component ... The hairs fell out ... A LOT ... it&#x27;s not terrible, but if you&#x27;re serious about having a nice brush/set, then invest the extra money in a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> I love how the soap leaves my skin feeling. much better than edge gel i&#x27;ve been using forever, and less messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for nearly two years, and it&#x27;s still my daily shaving setup.  The mug and brush are perfect for whipping up a nice lather and the stand is still going strong. The stand also has a place for my razor, and though basic, works great.  As I remember the soap was quite acceptable as well, though I now use Proraso as my daily choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped the mug, more than once, and it&#x27;s still in one piece, so it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.  And the set goes with me for overnight trips as well, and still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen brush is a real workhorse and, other than losing an occasional hair, is still going strong.  It&#x27;s actually quite generous in size, in case you are wondering.  I have a Tweezerman brush, which is smaller and more compact.  The Van Der Hagen brush is both longer and fuller and has a great feel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would quickly discard the stand, but it&#x27;s very handy.  Holding both the brush and my razor, it makes the perfect overnight setup.  And, being acrylic, its surpisingly tough and very easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to shaving, or just looking for a nice daily setup, I&#x27;d recommend the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set without any reservations. As well as all the other positives, the mug and brush have the classic appearance of a much more expensive set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, and I cannot get used to that handle.</li>
    <li> Great intro set for people interested in trying wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Soap is actually pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Brush will shed hairs, but still performs fine.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap.</li>
    <li> Arrived before Christmas</li>
    <li> Not knowing what to expect, I am utterly surprised at the quality of this kit.  Well worth the money, you receive a lot for the dollar.</li>
    <li> Great set for the starter.</li>
    <li> this is a very good gift for anyone who prefers to use a brush rather than can of shave creme/shave gel the stand will even accomodate a straight razor or safety razor which i find impressive, as I said good product</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this shave set!  The brush is very nice, and the soap and mug are very classy and well made as well!  A great bargain for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to check the metal ring around the base of the bristles on the shave brush when you receive this in the mail.  The first shave set that I received had rust all over that metal ring.  The replacement I received was fine and I have had no problems with rust developing at all.</li>
    <li> This is my first kit and I&#x27;m very impressed.  For the money you can&#x27;t beat it.  The brush is nice and well built (you will loose a few hairs when first using it but only a few), the bowl is sturdy and easily held, and the soap produces a nice lather (I still need some practice) and smells great.  I didn&#x27;t notice that the brush had odor to it as some have reported online or perhaps it simply didn&#x27;t bother me.  Feels nice on the face and paired with an Edwin Jagger DE89 and some Clubman Pinaud aftershave I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> SCORE on a perfect Christmas present for my burly, bearded, hard to buy for brother!</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars is due to the quality of the brush. I have experienced better and after trying this brush, I can now appreciate the finer brushes and will invest in one soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this shave set, you wont be disappointed. Again, just note the brush is not the best but if you haven&#x27;t used a finer brush before, you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap smells great and does not dry out your skin. I actually use it to wash my face daily and continues to smell great. Every time I am in my wash room and by my sink, I can smell the soap which I really like. I will definitely be buying more of this soap in the near future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set with my Merkur Model 180 blade because I needed some shaving soap. The set itself is very nice and while I wouldn&#x27;t label it to be &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a great beginners kit. The bowl is nice, the soap makes great lather, and the brush doesn&#x27;t seem cheap. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times so far since I&#x27;ve had it, and I love it. Recommended to anyone looking for a starter kit.</li>
    <li> He started using it immediately and likes the little stand for the brush. He says the soap is little bubbly, but you can bye you favorite soap and use it in the standard size mug.</li>
    <li> Look:  it&#x27;s hard to mess this up, and the kit does what it&#x27;s supposed to for the most part.  The soap works and smells great, and the cup is pretty cool.  My problem is with the other two parts.  The stand is a little small, without enough room between my razor (completely normal size) and the bottom of the brush.  To get them both in, I need to either bump the brush forward a bit or put the razor in sideways, which means it falls out more.  And while the brush was fine for about four months (losing a few understandable hairs at a time), just yesterday the first huge clump came out of the middle, followed by another today.  I&#x27;m on Amazon to shop for a new one.</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair on the brush seems good, the bowl as well seems up to par. There is some rust on the metal ring that is holding the hairs on the brush, however. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I am updating this review on March 15, 2013. I was beginning my shave last night and while I was lathering up the badger, \\&quot;pop,\\&quot; the brush came off the handle. The thing is cheap--NOT worth the money at all. First of all, the hair stops at the above mentioned metal ring--no wonder the hairs keep falling out. They are glued in. The handle is almost as long as the brush, but is fully empty. In other words, machine-made, junk. That&#x27;s what I get for trying to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I rated down to one star from four. The bowl and soap are fine. So, it isn&#x27;t luxury, and I already had to go to \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; to get a travel badger brush for $16, but at least that is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a picture, and if I can find a way to post it, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Hair of the brush is constantly falling out. The brush is too small for the bowl. The bowl is too deep and tall for a small brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally waste your money. Totally not recommended.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it!  The brush is nice, soaps smell really good and he really likes the handle on the cup.</li>
    <li> Shave with this system almost daily now. Had it for about a year or so. Brush came apart, all I had to do was glue the head back in.&lt;br /&gt;brush has lost hairs here and there, but nothing to effect its use. Soap works great and has a nice manly smell to it</li>
    <li> Very NICE Brush and mug.I have recommended it to friends.I would buy it again.Joe W.</li>
    <li> The brush is soft but I didn&#x27;t like it. Rest everything is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 2 star as the hair from brush stick to my face and create a little problem while shaving.</li>
    <li> Overall a good set.  The brush takes a few shaves to break in.  Don&#x27;t worry if some of the hair falls out at first that&#x27;s normal.  Once you get a few shaves in the brush is great.  The mug is good too.  The soap takes a bit of fiddling with to get a good lather, but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll be good to go.  Soap has a nice and light clean smell.  The brush stand is a piece of junk. The brush and my razor (which is a Parker 96R) would slide off of the stand and into the sink with just the lightest of touch.  The stand is the only thing that stinks about this set.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good purchase if you are just starting or your dog runs a muck and destroys your old set.</li>
    <li> A nice shave cup which is easy to hold and deep enough to fit the enclosed soap, but a bit small for most other brands. The soap lathers nicely. The stand is nothing special but does what it is designed to do. The brush fell apart before lather even reached my face. Overall the purchase was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Item as described, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Merkur 180 long handle and it has been a great starter kit. I am able to get a good lather from the soap and the smell is nice. My only negative is that the brush keeps losing hairs.</li>
    <li> I love it but the same kit is at walmart for the same price.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband, who just started doing traditional shaving a few weeks before I bought it and wanted a set.  All the sets I found with the real badger brush and ceramic dish were ridiculously expensive - sometimes the dish alone was almost $80 - so I was happy when I found this inexpensive set.  It was part of a larger Valentine&#x27;s Day gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well for him.  He says he didn&#x27;t like the soap because it dried out the skin on his face, so he doesn&#x27;t really use the soap.  He sometimes uses a solid soap, but usually uses a gel shave cream like Gillette.  I know, defeating the purpose, but it works for him - he says using the brush helps raise the hairs to get a closer shave and he likes having the dish to lather up the cream/gel with.  The stand is the perfect size to hold the brush and his Gillette ProGlide razors.  If you brush against the stand lightly, the razor will fall out - a bit annoying because we have a small sink, but most of the time it&#x27;s not a problem.  The dish is really sturdy.</li>
    <li> The brush is decent.  The stand is lousy: the brush handle bumps into the razor head.  The soap and mug are probably ok if you like shave soaps.  I have discovered that I don&#x27;t like soaps, and prefer creams.</li>
    <li> Van Der Hagen hits the mark for affordability and practicality, period. I don&#x27;t agree with the title of &#x27;luxury&#x27;. But it&#x27;s still an incredibly nice set. Although made in China (except the vegetable-based soap), all of it appears to be very high quality. The clear, plastic stand is rather spartan, but serves the purpose for what it was intended. The brush is soft and has good &#x27;skin feel&#x27;. Unlike some inferior quality brushes, this one does not lose a lot of hairs. The soap has a clean, almost neutral smell. Seems almost like a &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; type of shave soap, but not quite. Doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up as much as others I&#x27;ve tried, but still good. All in all, a great value!</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting a shave set for awhile, so I decided to get him one for his birthday.  He absolutely loves it, and said it&#x27;s the best gift he&#x27;s ever received.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the mug and the brush,and would recommend this to family and Friends.Stand is a little small for razor and brush,get one and the other fall off the stand.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a father&#x27;s day gift after reading lots of reviews for more expensive kits.  The brush is good - maybe not as high quality as you can possibly get, but still very nice.  The soap is nice smelling and seems to last for a long time.  Also purchased a long-handled Merkur Model 180 Safety razor based on other reviews.  The razor is great, though it only comes with one blade so you have to purchase extras.</li>
    <li> The mug is heavy and of good quality, the brush loses a few bristles over time but not enough to be a problem, and the soap is awesome. I liked this set so much I bought one for my Dad and another for my brother. However you can find them at some Target stores for $20.00</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for two years. I ALWAYS rinse the excess soap from it, shake it dry, and hang it with the bristles pointed downward. I read a lot of reviews about cracked handles, and can only conclude that a few folks got their brush handle too wet while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this brush, or more accurately, building your lather with this brush is a great experience. The glycerin based soaps seem to be better for my skin, and the brush just feels luxurious and stimulating. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even shave, I just use the brush to wash my face. The bristles exfoliate nicely without sanding your face. Yep, baby smooth every time. The thick lather helps the razor glide OVER the skin and not INTO it. Less knicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the way the lather goes on, makes for a very relaxing shave.</li>
    <li> A gift set for my brother in law that he really loved.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving, and thought that this set would help me out, unfortunately, the brush came apart from the handle. The soap would not lather the way I wanted it, and I had to spend a lot of time to get it the consistency that I wanted it. The only thing I like from the set was the cup and the stand. I threw away the soap, since I decided to get Taylor shaving cream, and I don&#x27;t regret that decision. If you want the stand and the cup, it&#x27;s best to get them separately, same for the brush as well.</li>
    <li> The mug and soap are decent. The brush is mediocre and wouldn&#x27;t stop shedding. If I were to start over, I&#x27;d buy separately instead of together.</li>
    <li> This set is a very high value, covers all bases set for anyone who is interested in DE razor or straight razor shaving. As I was looking into getting a DE safety razor, I was looking around for a brush. Money is tight, so I figured I could just find a bowl somewhere and get some soap at the grocery store or something. However, I realized I did need a brush, and that I did need a stand for the brush. After looking around for the best badger brush I could get for under 30 dollars, I came across this set.  I was like, &amp;#34;Wow, a decent looking badger brush AND a stand!!&amp;#34; (other stands are usually like 20 dollars themselves!). I figured the mug and soap were just nifty little extras. But man I underestimated this set. The mug is really cool, the stand holds your razor and the brush (which by itself is very decent considering the cost. It could be a little softer, but I&#x27;m satisfied with it until I wear it out, which I don&#x27;t expect to happen anytime soon). Just look at the set up in the pictures. Drop the soap in the mug, and you&#x27;re set! It took some practice to get the lather right. What you need to do is soak your brush for a minute, then shake half the water out, and just start whipping. Keep going and going and going, longer than you think you should at first, and you will have a VERY high quality and functioning lather. Even if you don&#x27;t want to go old fashioned with the razor, use this set with your fusion or whatever you use, it will shave like a dream (also fantastic gift set).</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush and mug purchase.  I had been looking to get into traditional shaving.  I read the reviews on this set and made my purchase based on that. I have been completely satisfied so far. I&#x27;ve used the brush with three different creams:  Bigelow, Musco Real, and Art of Shaving  The brush lathers extremely well and I have only been hand lathering.  The mug works well and is the perfect size. The clear brush stand is a nice compliment to the set as well.  Very satisfied so far and great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Badger brush builds a great lather super fast. The stand holds my brush and de razor very nice. Haven&#x27;t used the soap yet but I do like the VDH shave soap they sell at Wal-Mart and this stuff is a step up so it should be good. Last I love the mug I see plenty of mugs just like it going for $25 on there own. So even if everything in this kit went to hell some how you would still have the mug that it&#x27;d worth the price alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if you are new to wet shaving try some CO Bigelow shave cream. You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
    <li> The package was delivered in a timely fashion.  Opened the package and was pleased with the quality...  until I discovered the brush was not included and the clear stand had dust on it, not sure if someone returned it and ripped off the brush, but this was not a good transaction.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1TRYX2KBWHM1Q]]I apologize for the rough editing, I have family over for the holidays and they are staying in my studio...and by studio I mean my room.</li>
    <li> Honestly, wet shaving is the only way to shave. I suffer from sensitive skin, so the razors from the store really did a number on my face. My only saving grace were disposable ones (rec. to me by my doctor) since they were sharp. I ventured into wet shaving since I heard it was the best way to go. WOW. No more ingrown hairs, red marks, white heads, etc., I bought a cheaper starter set at a local drug store and the brush fell apart. Then I bought this. The soap is nice, the stand works and the mug--is fantastic! Will this be the last set you ever own? Of course not. But will it work to test the waters? You bet. Honestly, the only thing I see having to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; over time is the brush. The mug is very well made and the stand, well it&#x27;s plastic, but it doesn&#x27;t do much but hold your razor/brush. Also, to combat razor burn, ingrown hairs, use alcoholic aftershave (yes, I know people will tell you it dries out your skin, but your grandpa used it his whole life and his face didn&#x27;t fall off). I love this [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6-Ounce]] most.</li>
    <li> The brush is very high quality.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody looking to start wet shaving.  The stand and bowl are both very sturdy.  Much stronger than I was expecting for this price.  My Merkur 180 Long Handled Safety Razor fits perfectly. My only complaint was the soap didn&#x27;t lather nearly enough.  I now use Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl. It does great but is a little more spendy.  In my opinion it&#x27;s worth the cost.  This kit was also worth my money.  A great way to start</li>
    <li> This set looks like it will work for my husband but the box arrived damaged and the stand had smudge/fingerprint marks all over it.  Im kinda wishing I hand&#x27;t ordered a shaving set online because I don&#x27;t believe this one is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my husband and he loves it!  I would recommend this set for anyone that likes a great close shave!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to be able to rate this product 5 stars.  The soap is wonderfully refreshing, and it is something I look forward to smelling every morning.  The mug is sturdy and ergonomic, and makes building high-quality lather a breeze.  The stand is stylish, yet unobtrusive, perfectly showcasing my shaving implements.  As others have mentioned, however, the brush is the achilles heal of this shave set.  Thankfully, I already had a Badger Brush from an Art of Shaving set I received as a gift a few years back.  The sad thing is, within 2 days of use, the Van Der Hagen brush lost more hairs than my old brush had in 2 years.  Not to mention that it was already lacking some heft to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, if you already have a quality brush or don&#x27;t mind purchasing one on the side, then I fully recommend this set.  To those looking for a complete set, however, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Im 5 shaves into my de razor journey and this was a great first purchase.  Soap smells good and lathers very well.  I was able to get good lather first time.  I did look up some videos on YouTube.  I would recommend to any noob.  Might not be for a seasoned vet but I would not know.</li>
    <li> Using this kit is a night-and-day difference from using aerosol shave cream. Includes a soft, high quality badger hair brush that lathers quickly and hasn&#x27;t shed too badly so far in three weeks of daily use. Top quality kits may run upwards of $100; this is a fine alternative for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the dish and the soap, the brush is nice but way too many hairs started falling out, so I ordered a new one. Overall this is a great deal even if its just for the stand, soap and dish. I only gave it 4 stars because of the brush, but I do love this set.</li>
    <li> The mug is of high quality, and the stand is very useful.  The soap lathers up nice, and gives a clean feeling after the shave.  However, the brush, when I first got it, and even after washing it multiple times, and using it multiple times, it still has a very offensive odor.  The odor is pervasive, as well.  The first day I had it, while it was drying out, you could smell it when you entered the room.  I live in a dorm room with one other person, and you can see where this would be a problem.  Borax may help, it&#x27;s next on the list of things to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $32, I&#x27;d probably buy this again, despite the complaint about the brush.  The combination of items alone make it worth it.  Caveat Emptor, however, be ready to deodorize the brush when you get it.  Others report a much milder smelling brush than mine, maybe I got the bad one out of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I received this shave kit with a broken stand which was obviously broken at the factory during packaging. These things can happen. What annoyed me was the total lack of any customer service at Van Dear Hagens. They provided an email address which didn&#x27;t accept my email! I crossed this my company off my buy from list!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set, not cheaply made. My husband loves his. The bowl is a very generous size, we are very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> At first my boyfriend hated this set. But now he loves the brush and the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why...I was really excited to give this to him for Valentines but the set was incomplete. It was missing the soap and the soap holder. Also, as if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the brush smelled horrible once you got it wet. My boyfriend described the smell as \\&quot;badger fear pee\\&quot;. NOT something he wanted to use on his face. Also, the stand is super cheap and barely stands up with the brush on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...this set has kinda grown on him. He washed the brush out numerous times and now, over a year later...he LOVES this brush and uses it every time he shaves. (He says it helps make the hairs stand up more and gives a much nicer shave.) He also really likes the cup and says it feels comfortable in his hand. Since we never got the soap, he uses a Dr. Bronners soap instead. And the stand is cheap and is sitting in drawer now. I bought him a nice chrome stand instead. (which I should add...was difficult to find. A lot of the nice metal stand out there do not fit the brush that comes with this set)</li>
    <li> This is a good inexpensive shave set. I still use the kit today, the brush is still full of bristles and soft. I definitely would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> This shave set is nearly perfect! The mug is worth the cost of the set by itself. The soap smells great and is really easy to lather. The stand is great for storing one safety razor and one brush of your choice (will fit most brushes). However, the brush is the weakest link. It sheds like crazy, and is not very well constructed. Overall: great products, great value, but you may want to add a better badger brush to your order. I&#x27;d recommend Omega.</li>
    <li> Excellent first set. Great mug and excellent brush. Haven&#x27;t used soap yet, still finishing one I had open. Really like the stand.</li>
    <li> This kit is great and the shave soap that comes with it is very effective and smells good.  If you currently use store bought gells and creams you&#x27;re gonna notice a huge difference.  I am an every day shaver and one soap bar lasted me from December to now (March) and it still has a couple weeks of life left.  The best part though is the beaver hair: it feels amazing when brushing on your face.  It is quite the experience!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Everything I wanted and more.</li>
    <li> This was a neat item to give to my husband for Christmas 2013, BUT he was SO SO SOoooo disapointed that the box did not come with the holder for the brush. :(</li>
    <li> The brush and stand were less then good but meh</li>
    <li> The soap is great, and the mug is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The stand, on the other hand, is very clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;A standard safety razor (an old Gillette, in my case) does not fit in the slot comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is not securely kept in the stand without turning it, and turning it interferes with the brush when in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a re-design of the acrylic stand.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit as part of my experiment with double-edged razor shaving, which was designed to help (I hoped) eliminate some persistently recurring ingrown hairs. The soap is fine and I have no complaints about the dish it sits in. I don&#x27;t like the plastic stand - I&#x27;ve knocked it over a couple times and will be ordering another. I also cannot recommend the badger hair brush. The strong smell was still present after a month or so of use, and I replaced the brush with a smaller one that doesn&#x27;t smell as much or shed as much. If you have a limited budget, this set works as a starter kit. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who wants to pamper himself.</li>
    <li> I am sure there are \\&quot;better\\&quot; shaving soaps, but I haven&#x27;t been able to try them because my puck from this product has lasted a long, long time.  The brush is excellent.  I used a boar brush and a synthetic one.  I love the feel of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand....so, so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the shaving mug, great, especially the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.... I bought two!</li>
    <li> this starter kit is an excellent value. The mug is good quality, the razor/brush stand works great, and the brush and soap work well together.&lt;br /&gt;I may buy another, so the brush gets 48 hours to dry fully, and i&#x27;ll have a matching mug to try a different soap.</li>
    <li> All the items seem to be of good quality. Considering that all of these items separately would add up to quite a bit more than what you&#x27;re paying for this seems like a smart choice for someone who is starting with nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine that I&#x27;ll keep using the brush and holder for a few years. The soap I will replace when it runs out, probably with a different brand (only because I like to try new things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied that my money was well spent and I would recommend this set to anyone who may be wondering where to start.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this set for quite a while now and have decided to leave my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The Good&lt;br /&gt;  The Brush knot is nice and full, if a little too floppy.&lt;br /&gt;  The Soap smells nice and it&#x27;s fit is perfect for the mug.&lt;br /&gt;  The Mug is probably the best part of the set with the windmill printed on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;  The Stand works as it should and is a step-up from my home made wire-hanger brush stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The Bad&lt;br /&gt;  The brush is quite floppy and loses hair like mad. Just today over 40 hairs came out (worse than the Van Der Hagen boar brush and that&#x27;s saying something!)&lt;br /&gt;  The soap, while smelling wonderful, barely foams and goes on as thin as hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this set as my favorite cheap brush is the Van Der Hagen boar brush (once it stops losing hair every shave and you soften it up, it works wonders for a boar brush.), but to say that this brush is low quality is insulting to low quality brushes, my $10 tweezerman badger brush works better, is less floppy, and hasn&#x27;t lost more than 15 hairs in its life time! This brush on the other hand, loses at least five hairs every shave. So today i decided to work out all the bad hairs I could from the knot, i got over 40 hairs to come out with little effort. Repeating the same process on my tweezerman yielded less than 4 hairs. For how long i&#x27;ve been using the brush it should have ceased to losing hairs at this point, and yet it still does. The soap smells decent, but when attempting to lather all I ever get is foam! Granted, I have hard water, but i&#x27;ve so many different soaps and creams to compare from and this is by far the thinnest, least lubricating shaving soap I own, this even includes the lowest end Van Der Hagen soaps! The only good thing to come from this whole set is the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I&#x27;m very, very disappointed with this purchase. If you need a brush for cheap either go with the tweezerman badger hair or if you want a boar, and can deal with tons of hairs falling out of the knot, get the Van Der Hagen boar brush. What ever you do, do not waste your money on anything in this set except, maybe, the mug.</li>
    <li> For a beginner this is a great deal. For experienced shavers this is still a really good deal. The mug is heavy, feels sturdy and overall gives a nice in hand feel. The brush is good quality, but will lose a few hairs to start with, but I&#x27;m hard pressed to find brushes that don&#x27;t. Keep in mind it comes witha a Soap and not a Cream. A soap will lather marginally less but glide better, so keep that in mind. I am not the biggest fan of the plastic holder, but that&#x27;s because my razor is chrome and it doesn&#x27;t fit well with the look. Great kit otherwise.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  since my initial review (below) I feel the need to warn those considering this item.  Yes, the mug is almost worth the cost... However, the soap doesn&#x27;t lather and moreover, the badger hair brush has not stopped shedding YET ( after nearly a month and a half of use)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every shave I end up with what I call &#x27;badger beard&#x27; since I have more badger hair on my face than of my own.  This endless shedding of badger hairs ruins the shaving experience when I have to stop mid-shave and pick badger hair off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money elsewhere.  I am glad to have the nice mug, but I&#x27;ve just ordered a cheap Tweezerman badger brush (which is reviewed favorably) and will promptly convert this &#x27;luxury&#x27; brush into a paint brush once it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just started with safety and straight razor shaving recently.  I thought I&#x27;d splurge on this &#x27;lux&#x27; set so I&#x27;d get off to a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the mug, feels like quality.  Stand is just cheap plastic (maybe acrylic?) and does the job, but is kinda unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush loses hairs like a shedding Shepard dog.  The irony is I&#x27;ve gone through all this expense of getting the closest, most traditional (and economical) shave I can, but I still have long hairs on my face at the end of the shave due to this brush shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews and only a few mention this shedding issue.  Not sure if that&#x27;s because &#x27;that&#x27;s the way all badger brushes are&#x27; or if we few got the lemons of the brushes.  And the soap really does not hold a lather well.  I bought a couple of different brands of soap, and this one is the weakest lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, i&#x27;ll be looking for another brush with which to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the mug&#x27;s nice, but this is no &#x27;luxury&#x27; set.  Save your money and get a more basic set elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I initially got this as a fairly inexpensive Christmas present for my boyfriend, trying to be creative and improve his life by buying a more luxurious hygiene item. He&#x27;s not a man who necessarily likes fancy things, so I was hoping the extra effort of using a brush and cup method wouldn&#x27;t turn him off the whole idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He decided to try it the other day and he absolutely loved it after he got the hang of it. He loves the smell, saying it is a very clean and manly smell. After shaving, he said he couldn&#x27;t remember the last time his face felt so smooth. He says the brush really stands the hairs on his face up for a closer shave and the soap was perfect for the gliding action of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, this is all with just using a regular disposable shaving razor. He now intends to purchase an old fashioned safety razor due to the large amount of people who claim it will take the shave on step further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great and simple, and the apothecary cup is very handsome and a generous size. The amount of soap will last quite some time. After one use, it&#x27;s difficult to see if a dent was even made in the amount of soap provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will probably buy again when the soap runs out!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for a gift.  He really likes it.  The brush has shed a bit but only like 5 hairs total.  He really likes that his dollar shave club razor fits in the stand.  It is a really good starter kit.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the closeness of the shave and his skin is smooth and baby soft plus I like to watch</li>
    <li> No happy at all with order 2 of 3 of the brush holder were broken no evidance o bad handeling by shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
    <li> Ease of use, and a quality package.</li>
    <li> I feel like a real man using this brush and soap. I am very impressed with the quality and it&#x27;s so much fun to use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He has really loved everything in the kit. He isn&#x27;t a beginner, but he has been using cheaper products-boar hair brush, coffee mug, cheap soap ect...This set is a big step up. Plus it looks nicer in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice product to shave . i recommended . five stars . I will buy again . definitely .</li>
    <li> The brush in this set is terrible. So stiff and rough, feels like boar hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the bowl seems nice enough, the soap is just ok. Overall I was unhappy, I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $20 at Target for this. i would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This set is great. The soap smells good, not too girly, but not like old spice. the brush is soft, retains water well, and cane help make a great lather. the brush did smell bad at first, but that only lasted for about two shaves. the stand has a nice spot for your razor (assuming you use one) right behind the brush which is really nice. the bowl is a bowl, not much else to say about that. overall, its a good set and i would recommend this to anyone that asked.</li>
    <li> Good soap, great brush and a top quality mug.  I really like the stand to.  Looks good with my razor.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! He has been using it for about 3 months now and really enjoys it. The brush is high quality. There is another version of the product that is the lower end so don&#x27;t be fooled. Get the one with the Boar Bristle Brush!</li>
    <li> Great prouduct for the price I have this set about two months now and it&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a set with a shaving bowl and stand for a while now and got this set for my self&lt;br /&gt;You get a quality looking bowl&lt;br /&gt;shaving soap which works and smells great&lt;br /&gt;badger brush which keeps the heat of the hot water expect the hairs on the brush to fall off when you are using it&lt;br /&gt;The shaving stand is made of plastic I did expect more but for the price I paid for this set I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> First the good news.  The mug is nice.  I like the handle, it works well.  The soap is pretty good, I get a good lather, it isn&#x27;t scented, gives a good shave.  The stand does a good job of holding the brush and my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad.  The tenth time I used the brush the knot came out of the handle.  I guess if you order this as a recurring shipment, you should go with twice a month, if like me you shave Monday through Friday.  If you shave on weekends, you might want to go with every ten days.  The bristles are great, they work well, but the glue that holds it together is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE BUYING IT FOR THE MUG AND STAND!  Of course you can get a similar mug for three bucks, a similar stand for a buck, soap for a buck seventy five and that leaves you with about eighteen dollars to get a brush that won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> Nice shave set and you cant beat the price.Try it,you will like it</li>
    <li> This shaving kit was meant to be a gift, so I didn&#x27;t use it personally.  I was worried about the soap being too perfumed, but it has just a light, clean scent. The brush is a little coarse and its bristles do tend to spry out but otherwise this is a great set!</li>
    <li> It is a great starter set. It gives a great lather. The soap lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is better than the same Van Der Hagen set sold in stores (Target, CVS).  The Van Der Hagen shave set sold in stores have Boar Brushes and this one has a Badger Brush as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the set about a 2 months and am actually quite happy with it.  I was looking for a quick starter set and it does the job. The brush has held up well and provides a comfortable feeling on my face with minimal shedding of bristles.  I soak it in hot water while I shower and it has not fallen apart.  The mug is decent and the puck fits perfectly in the bottom.  I find the soap to be very nice, the lather is fairly slick on my face and the scent is amazing.  It happens to go perfectly with my Marc Jacobs cologne....a very nice coincidence!!  The stand is basic but does the job, I&#x27;ll probably upgrade to something chrome.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad, along with a straight razor I found elsewhere. He uses it a lot and seems pretty happy with it. It was a cool little gift.</li>
    <li> The soap smells great and the mug is nice and heavy so doesn&#x27;t move much when you lather up the badger hair brush which is reason alone to buy this kit since a badger hair brush at my local men&#x27;s store was $50 Bucks!!!!!</li>
    <li> the perfume is great, the brush is soft and the shave soap mug is quite nice to hold when producing the latter</li>
    <li> Beautifully made items  AAAA++</li>
    <li> Mug broke and brush handle broke soap isn&#x27;t too bad only thing I use is the stand which hasn&#x27;t broke for a different brush I bought which is the tweezerman</li>
    <li> I converted from foam to brush a few years ago. This was a replacement and I bought it in part due to price. The bristles started out a bit stiff, and I was disappointed. However, after using it a while the bristles have softened up to a caliber you would expect in a more expensive shaving brush. I particularly like the mug. The little handle is easy to hold securely. The soap is pretty average and should be satisfactory to all but the most particular.</li>
    <li> Nice stand for the brush and razor. The included black bowl is nice as well. The brush has a nice quality feel to it.</li>
    <li> My hubby is active duty military and a stickler for always being clean shaven. After his entire life using regular razors I ordered this for him to try. He LOVES it!!! Says it&#x27;s the best shave of his life and very clean shave as well. He&#x27;s now hooked on this for life:)</li>
    <li> **the good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The brush does a great job at what it is supposed to do; building a lather and putting it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The stand holds the brush in the correct position for drying, and can hold any DE razor.  It has a cleverly positioned dimple in case your razor has an especially long handle, so it can slouch in the razor slot instead of hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The soap smells great, and does a decent job.  I have hard water, but this soap will still produce a serviceable lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The bowl/mug holds the puck of soap perfectly and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**the not so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This brush is infamous for being a prolific shedder.  You will be picking hairs out of your mug, your face, your razor, basically anything it comes in contact with.  Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The stand is made of lightweight plastic, and has a bottom that lays flush with your sink.  This causes it to slide erratically like a corvette driven by a teenager if it comes in contact with any soapy water, which is simply bollocks because it is designed to hold a shaving brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The soap has a manly, distinctive smell.  I rather like it, honestly.  It is, however, made with glycerine instead of tallow so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The mug is without fault.  It very nearly makes this package worth it, but not quite.</li>
    <li> I got this kit as a started set when I first started DE shaving. The brush is adequate for beginners but if you like using it, you may want to upgrade at some point. The smell is funky the first time you get it wet but that goes away after a few shaves and is normal for all badger brushes. My brush had a shedding problem though, and after 6 months of using it, most shaves I would still lose a couple of bristles out of it. The mug is very nice looking and has a good weight to it. As you upgrade the pieces of this set over time, the mug will probably still be used. The soap has a pleasant scent and lathers pretty good with the brush. As i experimented with different products, I learned I preferred creams to soaps but I still occasionally use the puck that came with this set. The stand is clear plastic or acrylic and holds the brush upside down to let it dry and also has a slot to hold your razor. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who wants to try out wet shaving without spending a lot of money to get started.</li>
    <li> Good kit for the price. This was my &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;. The cup is great and the soap worked well for me while learning. I did buy another brush but this one could have gotten me by fine if it had to.</li>
    <li> Got everything I expected and it all worked fine but at $30.00 I felt I spent a little much for the limited amount of items.  I thought the shaving soap would be bigger and that the stand to hold the brush and razor would be better quality but overall it is a good product, just a little over priced.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome set, great quality. The cup, while traveling, fell out of the back of a rental van and hit the pavement and did not break. Very sturdy. I don&#x27;t think another fall like that will be survivable but you can&#x27;t beat the quality. I reorder the soap because it&#x27;s fragrance is very nice. I have nothing bad to say about this product. I&#x27;ve had mine for approximately 7-9 months and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and a merkur razor to get started with wet shaving. I was not disappointed. The mug has a nice weight and feels solid. The handle is comfortable, and the windmill logo looks classy. The brush is nice for a starter brush, though it did lose a few bristles the first few uses, but this is expected and normal. The soap fits into the mud nicely and a little bit of moisture will seal it in. The whole thing looks clean and classy next to my sink on the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is great. It lathers nicely and gives me a comfortable, smooth, and clean shave. It smells nice and leaves me feeling refreshed after a good shave. I highly recommend this set to anyone who wet shaves, or is interested in getting started  wet shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit, the stand is perfect for what I need and the soap bowl works great. Love the way this soap smells too and it seems to work very well on my skin. That being said, you can get this same kit at Target for $20</li>
    <li> The down side and the reason for a 3 is the brush sheds. I read the other reviews and decided to try it even though some said the brush lost hairs. That&#x27;s an understatement. I keep thinking it will get better but it seems to get worse. The bowl is great and the holder is nice. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> A complete and competent shaving set.  Comes with bowl, soap, brush, and stand (holds brush &amp; razor).  The brush is what you want in a general kit - firm and wide, whips up a rich lather on the face, and hardly sheds.  A bit of a smell to it that disappears with 2 weeks.  The bowl is thick, and I like the peg handle,  which helps you palm the mug securely.  The soap generates a rich lather and protects my face well.  The acrylic stand holds the brush and a razor.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it!  It made him feel like a sir!</li>
    <li> Always wanted a traditional shave soap set, so I bought this one. It&#x27;s fine now, but the boar&#x27;s hair brush really stank at first - sickening odor.  It went away after a few weeks..  The brush still tends to lose bristles and leave them on your face while lathering.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using the shaving soap w brush. The soap smells n feels great. The brush is a bit rough but overall I love the product. The brush holder that comes with the kit can hold the brush but with its slippery pastic nature the brush easily falls off the holder when its tilted even slightly. But with its price I say this kit was a bargain. Great product</li>
    <li> The soap is SO much better than canned shaving creams, MUST TRY. Brush is good quality for the money, and caddy is handy, and soap bowl is a nice addition.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my man looooved it. Hard to lather at first, but has a good brush. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked every item included in this package, the brush was nice once it was used a couple times, the plastic brush stand is a little cheap, but does its job.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed when I went to a &#x27;red bullseye&#x27; store and saw this for 20 bucks. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice gift set, just found it cheaper elsewhere...</li>
    <li> I bought this as my starter set because it was cheap.  It&#x27;s OK. Research different quality of badger hair brushes, and soaps, neither of these products would get purchased on their own.  Spend the $50 bucks on a decent Silver Tip badger brush, and buy Proraso soap.  I used the brush and after I bought the Silver Tip, I couldn&#x27;t use that cheap brush again.</li>
    <li> My husband loved both the soap and the real badger-hair brush; he told me that it made shaving much more enjoyable and easier. He uses a vibrating Gillette razor and it worked well with the set.</li>
    <li> Works well and gives great lather. Easy to learn to use and the soap smells good. Will buy again when refil is needed.</li>
    <li> The mug and soap are pretty good.  The brush was good for a few months, but the bristles would come out when used and then the entire brush separated from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked for a little while, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy a shave set for this price.</li>
    <li> The first time I recieved this product, the mug had been shattered in transit. We had been having a string of really cold days (in Minnesota) and my guess is the cold made it brittle and that&#x27;s why it broke. The second one arrived in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product enough to give it 4 stars. The soap has a great smell and is hypoallergenic. The apothecary mug is of a good sturdy quality. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the brush is constantly losing hairs. As this is my first luxury shave set, I&#x27;m not really sure if it is something I&#x27;m doing incorrectly, or if the product is just weak in this area. Regardless, I think this gives you a great bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Decent set for the price, brush ain&#x27;t all bad. The best part about it is the stand, keeps the razor and brush at a good spot to dry.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Not much more to say about it other than hes been using it for almost 6 months with no complaints and doesn&#x27;t plan to go back to regular disposable razors. Using this kind of razor takes time and practice to get a technique down, but once you do he says its the closest shave you&#x27;ll get. Plus you save lots of money as the blades for this are like .10!</li>
    <li> The brush is excellent, and the soap that comes with it actually creates enough foam to shave a 2 day old beard.  A proper shaving brush is definitely one of life&#x27;s little luxuries.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. The brush loses a bristle every now and then, but this is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a great smell to it.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set to go with the Straight Razor Beginner&#x27;s Shaving set.  Husband loves the soap that comes with the set.  Soaps are generally not that easy to find.  Plus, you get an extra brush that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this in January and, as I was rinsing the bristles this morning, the head fell off. Trying to glue it back on and see how that works. Before this, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain at all, this kit is awesome. It gives shaving a style of its own. great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I mulled over the idea of ordering everything separately in order to get higher quality overall but in the end after realizing it was easily going to cost twice as much for whats included here and that satisfaction rate was very high by the existing reviews this was the way to go. Happy with everything I received, brush isn&#x27;t shedding excessively or smelling bad so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> you can pay a lot for this sort of thing.  fortunately, you don&#x27;t have to.  this set is perfectly adequate, and meets all my needs.</li>
    <li> I got my husband this set for our anniversary. He has very sensitive skin and I was worried this might irritate it, but based on other reviews I got it. He loves it and it has actually improved his skin! He doesn&#x27;t get razor burn anymore and the smell of the cream is fantastic. I really like the set and will consider buying other sets for the guys in our family.</li>
    <li> I got this shaving set for my boyfriend, and he uses it daily!  It has a beautiful design that screams class, and doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.  Plus, the little handle on the side of the cup makes it far easier to use when all wet and soapy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re interested in brush shaving, this is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, inexpensive way to test the waters. I had this set for about two months and here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not crazy about the mug. It&#x27;s a little too big for my liking, and takes up a little too much space on my sink (I know, a silly thing to whine about). So now I use a smaller bowl instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The soap is nice, but I actually prefer VDH Premium Soap. You might end up with your own preference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush eventually fell apart. It was shedding a little bit each day, and then seriously one day the inside hairs just popped out. Now all that&#x27;s left is an outer ring of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The stand is decent enough. The photos don&#x27;t show, but the stand does have a slot behind the brush to hold a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set does does look nice, though. So overall, not a bad way to try out brush shaving. But you&#x27;re like me, after a little while you might find yourself looking around for something a little better.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he just loves it! Uses it every day!</li>
    <li> for 35 this was a deal.  Great brush and doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s hair, but the stand is a bit weak.  The soap is quality but a little soft and runs out quickly. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush, holder, and cup for about a year now. I thought the brush wouldn&#x27;t last, but it&#x27;s holding up really well. It&#x27;s a great starter kit for those just beginning and becoming overwhelmed with the products available for wet shaving. I used the soap once, but I tend to prefer Proraso Shaving Soap. It&#x27;s really a personal preference though.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. I shave once a week so I don&#x27;t get to use the brush that much, yet the hair on the brush keeps failing off and eventually the whole brush head went off, I guess they didn&#x27;t use good glue, they weren&#x27;t expecting anyone to put it under water. if you&#x27;re to spend $24, you&#x27;re better off buying a high end brush for the same amount!</li>
    <li> This is a nice throwback to early 20th Century. It is so much more fun to use than squirting out foam from aerosol cans. Yes it takes a little more time, but you do get a feeling of a good clean shave. Thinking of getting a straight edge...or not. probably cut my throat.</li>
    <li> You can get this at target for 19.99. I found this out a day after I received it. I recommend going to the nearest target and buying it there</li>
    <li> The product is just as described, looks very nice in the bathroom. For the price and for beginners I think is a very good choice.</li>
    <li> The stand is plastic, but looks pretty nice. The mug looks and feels like it&#x27;s good quality. And the soap isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s not bad either. Good price for what you get.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this kit over the boar hair one due to the extra softness on the brush, the first few shaves using this brush it had a small amount of shedding that was expected, but nothing to drastic. The lather bowl is really nice and easy to hold while the shape keeps the lather from creeping up the sides. The soap I have only used once, and works well, but I prefer cream over soap personally.</li>
    <li> Update: I contacted Van Der Hagen and they quickly sent out a new brush. I have bumped my rating from 2 to 3 stars because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the set for the past week and the brush has already fallen apart. The handle completely separated from the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is nothing special, but is functional.</li>
    <li> Only issue is the badger hair falls out.</li>
    <li> For the price, I love it!</li>
    <li> Brush started coming apart after several months.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shave kit! I had very mediocre expectations for the price but it is very good. The soap smells awesome and lathers very well. The mug is very nice and the brush is better than my more expensive badger brush. The stand is ok but nothing great although it&#x27;s one of the only stands that fit my merkur future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used shaving soap like this before, but I would consider this a high quality kit. It smells great and my razor shaves so much nicer with this soap. I have been on a search and have tried all kinds of creams, gels, oils etc., but have never had a shave this nice. I have sensitive skin so shaving isn&#x27;t fun, but this soap really works great. I would buy it again, or recommend it.</li>
    <li> HUBBY LOVED JUST, WHAT HE WANTED</li>
    <li> The fellow I gave this to for Christmas really liked it</li>
    <li> I was researching some beginner wet shaving products and really planned on going with a Merkur handle and badger brush.  I wasn&#x27;t sold on the butterfly setup either and figured I&#x27;d want a long handle.  Well I came across this set in a Harmon Discount for almost the exact same price and I really couldn&#x27;t avoid the instant gratification that came with this set and the matching Van Der Hagen butterfly short handle.  I was apprehensive to spend $100+ on an initial setup and risk not enjoying wet shaving.  This set is great to dip your toe in the water.  I like the bowl well enough (it is larger than it appears), the brush is pretty junky but it gets you started... mine loses a lot of bristles and the lather isn&#x27;t particularly great with it.  The stand is very basic/cheap but works.  It has a poorly designed spot for the razor handle as well.  The soap is ok... maybe the soap lather sucks because of the brush but maybe its the soap.  I plan on changing both anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this is a great way to get started wet shaving just to make sure you plan on sticking with it.  After all is said and done, I will likely only keep the bowl and maybe the stand.  Brush will be first to go.  The Van Der Hagen butterfly handle was pretty good though (sold separately).  I was worried the head wouldn&#x27;t secure the blade tightly but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Was a really nice Christmas gift from my mom and pop.  By the time I got it out and shaved I was ecstatic bc I hadn&#x27;t used a brush in years.  That&#x27;s when the letdown began.  The brush doesn&#x27;t lather well and then the bristles are coming out in bunches.  I can&#x27;t make a clean swipe.  Really miss my art of shaving brush.  It was much better made.</li>
    <li> I have used this shave set for two weeks now. The soap smells great and has a great lather makes shaving fun and enjoyable</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested I try this kit, as he had recently purchased it and was thrilled with it. There aren&#x27;t many products these days where you feel like you paid less than you should have–but this is one. I was very impressed with the quality of all the parts, and the fact that it is an actual badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave, I noticed a &amp;#34;wet fur&amp;#34; scent that I can only assume is similar to what a wet badger would smell like. The good news is that it goes away after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product, and I will likely continue to use the Van Der Hagen soap once the included disc runs out.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of normal use, the brush&#x27;s glue joining the bristles to the handle wore out and the two pieces seperated. This was a good starter set but the quality is a little lacking.</li>
    <li> The mug and stand are both very sturdy, and the soap is very, very nice. The brush is very soft, as badger hair ought to be. However, there were some hairs falling out to begin with (which I expect is normal), and the glue holding the handle to the metal grommet (and thus the head of the brush) broke off completely within two weeks.I expect that this is an isolated incident, but some other reviewers were having problems with the brush as well. I would definitely recommend this, but only for the stand, mug, and soap.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boy friend and he loves using it. he is a little old fashioned and he enjoys the feel of the brush and using the mug. great gift for a guy.</li>
    <li> Quite disappointed with this. Soap is poor quality, and the handle on the brush came unglued within 20 shaves. Stand is even limited use.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present roughly two years ago. When I got it, it was a great set to have. The soap and mug are great; the soap lathers well and leaves the skin refreshed and clean while the mug has a comfortable grip and has held up well. the only issue is with the brush. The Brush worked amazingly for about a year. That is until it started shedding. It didn&#x27;t shed one or two bristles now and then, it just ejected the whole center of the brush. I still use the mug and the soap has lasted quite some time, but have since gotten another brush.</li>
    <li> So this is my long term review- I have had this set since I started wet-shaving 2 years ago. This set was and is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the soap is long gone- I still use the brush and mug. I have seen a few reviews of the brush falling apart and don&#x27;t want you to judge based on those few. As I said, I have used this brush for 2 years shaving every/every other day and had no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap was a great musk scent- something along the lines of TOBS Eaton College Scent shaving cream. Exactly what you expect a wet shave to smell like! I actually mixed my cream and this soap at first until the soap ran out. Great combination to use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is great. Love the look- Pretty durable as i have dropped it once and its still intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand is a stand. Easy to clean and stored my Merkur and brush just fine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great. Middle of the road as far as soft/hard which is good because I am not sure either would be better to spread lather while picking up your whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for travel- I went to Walmart and asked for a large pill bottle. Perfect for storing the brush when it in a dopp kit.</li>
    <li> I will never use shaving cream again. This shaving soap makes shaving an enjoyable morning ritual.</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive set with a real badger bristle brush. Great soap.</li>
    <li> Love it. Brush is worth it alone. Gotta work it a bit and get the smell out but the soaps scent will do the job.</li>
    <li> If I could just review the bowl, soap and stand separately, I would, but unfortunately the brush comes too. The bowl is surprisingly large and the soap shows very little wear even after a month&#x27;s use. The stand comfortably fits a razor and a small/medium brush and looks very nice next to its black counterparts. These three items together are worth the price. The soap is very neutral, but lathers well, and the bowl is pretty hefty at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is unfortunately pretty terrible. In the first lather, it was shedding hairs as if I was pulling them out. The brush also turned the water an unsanitary shade of brown for reasons unknown. I owned a Muhle $30 badger hair brush before purchasing this set and it did neither of these things. I also noticed that the brush wouldn&#x27;t keep its shape for any length of time after being wet, almost as if it was made of human hair. While it didn&#x27;t go completely limp, it never returned to a semi-stiff position until completely dry. If this brush was sold separately, I wouldn&#x27;t touch it with a 30 ft pole, but the other 3 pieces are absolutely worth it, and make up for the shoddy brush.</li>
    <li> The mug, soap and stand are great.  The brush not so much, besides losing strands everytime I use it, it also clumps up.  My this I mean when it&#x27;s wet it looks like I have six small brushes intead of just the one large.</li>
    <li> Looked great when it arrived, but within two weeks the handle had separated from the base. This is the second time receiving a deffective product from this brand.</li>
    <li> All youre really getting with this set is a mug, a stand and the shave soap. Every time I use the brush hair falls out and I am sure its a matter of time before it falls apart. So, for the money, no bueno. The soap smells good though.</li>
    <li> The bowl and the soap are great.  I have had it for two months now and I still pick bristles off my face.  I really think the brush is falling apart.</li>
    <li> Went back to safety razor and shaving soap. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this kit. Quality stuff!</li>
    <li> Nah it&#x27;s not. Sorry for starting this one off with a bold-faced lie. Anyways.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was a gift for myself from myself for being such a good guy last year. I had purchased a new shaving razor and wanted a stand for it and came across this. Taking a chance, I bought it and anxiously awaited it&#x27;s arrival. Ok that&#x27;s another lie. I bought it while at work on a Friday and went out all weekend charming girls and drinking alcohol. But alas, the Van Der hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set showed up and I got down to business.&lt;br /&gt;The set is real clean looking, plastic but it does what it says on the box. The soap holder is very nice but I&#x27;m going to get a cover for it because I don&#x27;t like having dust or anything on top of the soap I&#x27;m going to lather and place on my face. The brush is Badger hair, NOT boar hair which is good. I keep boar products limited to Boar&#x27;s Head deli meats and so should you.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is lasting a long time and applies very clean and works nicely. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which is good because you are literally going to slice it off your face with a razor blade anyways so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I give this 5 stars for a product that looks like it does on the box, works well, and is relatively inexpensive. I will deal with the mysterious Van Der Hagen company again in the future and I&#x27;m sure they look forward to it.</li>
    <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.  The soap doesn&#x27;t lather up very much and after about a half dozen uses the brush so far is still kind of course and loosing hair (about three to four each time) which is kind of annoying.  Based off of other reviews I&#x27;ve read there are a lot of better products out there, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to just get yourself into the whole wet shaving experience like I was when I purchased this kit, then this is perfect for you without investing a lot of money.  Now I have a better idea of what to look for when I upgrade!  The stand that came with it works well and the brush also fits fine in the stand I already had purchased.   After using the set for the past couple months now, the brush is holding up quite nicely and I&#x27;m loving it.  It only looses a hair or two once in awhile however this is normal.  I figured out how to make the lather and the soap is great too. As I said before I don&#x27;t think you can beat the price for this fine set.  Upgraded my original rating from a 3 to a 5.</li>
    <li> Do you shave? Yes? Then this is the product for you! The brush has a great capacity of water absorption and the soap smells incredible. The whole set is a fashion statement itself and deserves to have its own catalogue.</li>
    <li> I recently joined the ranks of safety razor shavers. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money to get started and this set provided that opportunity. I was really pumped to get a badger hair brush for this price. The brush did start shedding the first shave. A month later, it&#x27;s still going strong even though it sheds hairs every shave. I&#x27;m still on the soap puck that came with the set, but I&#x27;ll be trying something different when it runs out. Nothing against it; I just want to try something else. The mug and stand will last forever; even though the brush will probably last only six months, it was a smart buy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a set of a brush, soap, and a cup, then basically your options are this or the wally world version with the little green cup. This set is well worth the extra cost. I love the brush, it doesn&#x27;t lose much hair and does not smell at all after about the first 3 uses. The Mug works very well, I love having a knob to get a grip on. the stand works, but is too tall for the Lord Premium I use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well worth the extra expense, great intro set.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased a double edge razor and figured I would be getting a bargain just getting the set. I sort of regret it at this point after having it for a few months because of the low quality. Van Der Hagen tries to give you a bit of everything for cheap and thats where the mistake lies. Its too cheap. I can simply say that the shaving brush does not hold up at all. It actually has a bad glue/seal around where the hair meets the handle and came apart after very light usage. The soap is actually decent and lathers well. It also has a pleasant smell. The soap dish is good and pretty average. I recommend skipping this set all together and just buying a quality brush/soap/dish separate. The best soap to get IMO is the Proraso Shaving Soap that comes in the white color (sensitive skin) and since I didn&#x27;t feel like buying a $20 brush, I just picked one up for $1 at my local beauty supply store and it has held up just fine.</li>
    <li> Nice bundle deal for the price. I would recommend this to anyone starting out as a first time shaver for sure!</li>
    <li> The shave soap doesn&#x27;t really work for me, but my neck is sensitive. The brush however loses 5-10 hairs every use, so wont be long till its just a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/2013&lt;br /&gt;After a year with this set, using it every 3 days and sometimes less, I have been surprised the little brush held up. My original review didn&#x27;t think it would last long, however it slowed down losing hairs and now it hardly loses any. I prefer different shave soap but the cup and brush have done well. Because I often go 3+ days between shaves I sometimes need an cheap electric trimmer to shorten the hairs and minimize pulling but that might be the razor blade not the soap/brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good starter set.</li>
    <li> So I just made the switch from the usually bottle shaving cream to this shave set and I am never looking back. The brush creates such a lather that you really begin to enjoy shaving. The soap smells great and dries quickly. Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So I have had this kit for about two months and the brush does not stop loosing hairs! I can seriously pull out like 8 hairs whenever I pull on the middle. It is so annoying. I am surprised that this kit gets such good reviews. Unless I have a defective brush. However, if you look at the reviews of just the brush it seems like this is a common problem. So I guess you are paying 30 bucks for a bowl and a 2 dollar soap. Get something else for your money. This brush is absolute crap.</li>
    <li> Bought this set as a gift for my husband who wanted to make the switch to traditional shaving. He loves the mug and the soap. I bought him a tweezerman men&#x27;s shaving brush just in case he didn&#x27;t like the brush that came with it. I also bought him the Edwin Jagger Double Edge Safety Razor. The brush holder also holds the safety razor. He likes the mug and soap that came with it. He&#x27;s only used the brush that came with it and he seems to like it. It hasn&#x27;t been shedding that much and he&#x27;s taking it on a travel trip. The kit is very portable and a very good deal.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great set! The brush does need to be gently cleaned before use. The logo on the brush handle was barely visible and came off with the first use. The shaving soap that comes in this kit is also has a very mellow and calming sent.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The brush appears to be of good quality and the mug is a nice weight.  My son should really enjoy using this set.</li>
    <li> Good starter set for anyone new to double edge safety razor shaving.  Still have mine after a couple of years shaving with it though the brush seems to lose a lot of hairs every so often.</li>
    <li> The brush in this set sucked... It lost lots of hair during each shave. Other stuff was fine... Bad brush is a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Item purchased to be given as a gift.  I am sure that the recipient will enjoy using it in the near future and thereafter.</li>
    <li> Well, i have gotten this as a gift for a Friend, i pieced mine together but after seeing this in person i really wish i had just bought this, the Clear stand that comes with it also has a side notch to hold your DE Razor! Pair with our $30 razor and your into SE for under $60!!! I Say skip the $100 sets and do this! oh mug feels good in hand!</li>
    <li> This is my first brush, mug, and soap.  All have lasted flawlessly for about a year.  The brush is soft, the soap lasts forever, and the mug is a nice heavy porcelain container.</li>
    <li> As I was browsing the web for my first kit to the long lost art of wet shaving with a traditional de safety razor, this seemed like the cheapest way to get a mug, soap, stand for brush/razor, and badger hair brush. Badger hair brushes alone run for nearly as much as the price of this set, and the only difference between the brush featured here and the other brushes I looked at was the handle material. Yes this brush hand is made of plastic. No it does not matter unless you really really feel inadequate and chose to start wet shaving because you are a snob... I mean it&#x27;s not like I am rubbing the handle against my face when I shave, I am merely using the bristles which are indeed badger hair, which is all that really matters.</li>
    <li> Product was not delivered when promised.  Even though the snow storm that disrupted the logistics system occurred the first week of December, no needed changes were made to promised delivery schedules.  I hope that sellers that use Amazon and their logistics system apply needed pressure to ensure they do a better, more honest and realistic job in the future.</li>
    <li> Almost a year since I bought this, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough for those people that want to start a more classical approach in their shaving routine. There is still a lot of soap left, and I shave at least twice a week. The black jar looks nice and minimalistic and design and color, easy to clean. The brush also looks nice: just remember to rinse all the water after shaving.</li>
    <li> Its unfortunate that the brush smells... like a badger&#x27;s ass.  However the performance of lathering and applying is good.  Also, I have read many reviews about the brush breaking.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem yet, though I don&#x27;t doubt the cheap quality, so I would be careful not to place too much pressure on the brush when lathering...  there is no need to press the brush into the bowl, simply swirl the soap gently around the cup, taking care to add a few drops of water in as needed to build a &amp;#34;cool whip&amp;#34; consistency.  Also, there have been a few hairs that have fallen out, but nothing unmanageable.  UNDERSTAND, this is a basic, introductory set...  it gets the job done and for those buying this as a gift, your intended person can always upgrade/replace any of the items for something better down the road if they stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells great! But again, you loose that once you lather up with the brush so you don&#x27;t get the added effect of attracting your wife with a clean smelling face.  You face wont smell like a badger&#x27;s ass either though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is good... it has a place to hold your razor as well, however, the opening is somewhat too large for a safety razor but it gets the job done and the stand isn&#x27;t an eyesore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic bowl is fantastic!  It does well to hold heat when you submerge/fill it in hot water and then empty it to lather, which warms the lather giving you a more authentic shaving experience.  The look is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping of this set was very prompt... I received it two days after I placed the order... and a full day early, all with standard shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall pleased with this set and would recommend it as an introduction to classic shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a started set along with my first safety razor. The bowl and soap are quite nice, but the stand is cheap, and the brush had a smell for probably the first month before it went away. The brush also tends to lose hairs every time I use it so I question the quality of it. Overall its a good place to get started for the man looking to get away from shaving cream from a can.</li>
    <li> I just got into more traditional shaving products, and this set is great for a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; set. The badger brush is great for blathering, and the soap smells wonderful. Would definitely recommend this set to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it! he is going back to old fashioned shaving. He doesn&#x27;t like electric or disposable shaving no more.</li>
    <li> Decent soap, decent brush, nice mug, and a cheap stand. Good price. Gets the job done. You&#x27;ll want a stand for organizing, and to keep everything dry in the open, and most stands cost the same as this kit.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my son and he loved it. I would definately not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a good, inexpensive starter kit. There are a few things I&#x27;ll mention about it, now that I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a solid starter knot, but it&#x27;s a bit floppy. I think this is expected with a badger brush since the hairs are softer, but I&#x27;ve heard about brushes with stiffer knots, and I&#x27;ll be looking for one in the not too distant future. The handle is plastic and feels mostly empty and the Van Der Hagen logo has already rubbed off from the hot water and general use.  A dozen or so hairs have been lost from the brush, but nothing I didn&#x27;t expect. I&#x27;m a little disappointed by this, but wasn&#x27;t expecting too much for the price. If im still losing hairs in a few weeks, I&#x27;ll probably be looking to dump this one altogether. Still, it lathers really well and quickly. Overall, it&#x27;s an OK brush, but is within expectations given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the soap yet as I&#x27;ve been focusing on a Proraso/c.o. Bigelow tube. It does, however smell fresh and clean, and I don&#x27;t doubt it will do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the stand is surprisingly good for the fact that its plastic. It holds the brush and my Merkur 34c without any concern, and seems very stable. The arrangement of the brush and the razor in it together is slightly awkward, but this doesn&#x27;t detract from its function as a stand. Over all it allows both brush and razor to air dry as expected and does it looking better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is the shining star of this set. It feels good in the hand, looks sharp and keeps heat well. The flared top makes for easy mixing and the experience using it is just plain good. It may seem like a simple thing, but I really like the bowl. It will probably stick in rotation as my new hobby grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you get this set? Maybe. It really is just OK, but I rated it 4 stars because it really met expectations for the price. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever use the soap, there are too many other ones out there that are more appealing to me. The brush is probably looking to be replaced sooner than later. The stand is a good starter. If you&#x27;re looking to get something to get you started, this really is perfect for that. But if wet-shaving is something you&#x27;re going to be doing long term, you might consider putting together your own set of different parts. In that, however, you end up with some level of analysis paralysis as you try to weigh the higher end options at just the word of others. For me, this just stopped the analysis paralysis and allowed me to jump into wet shaving, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Over time, however, I&#x27;ll probably replace every item in this set, and I may not go back to them (that&#x27;s already the case for the soap). If you can be more decisive about some nicer gear and you&#x27;re willing to risk the money, I would jump at that.</li>
    <li> Dad like it and used it. Does have Does what it says. It was a good price and was a nice purchase. It is good for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> I bought the set for my husband for Fathers Day. He loved it! He has never used this type of shaving system before. He said he&#x27;ll never go back to his regular shaving crème.</li>
    <li> This is a great place for a beginner to start! The mug is just the right size and the soap is pretty darn nice. HOWEVER... after a few months of use, thick plugs of the brush&#x27;s bristles stuck to my face while I was applying the soap lather. After the first incident, the brush didn&#x27;t last two days of shaving until almost all of the bristles had fallen out and the brush was useless. If you buy this product and find that you enjoy shaving old school, you should quickly buy yourself a higher quality brush!!</li>
    <li> Badger brush lost some hair, but has broken in nicely. Shave soap works well with the right amount of water. Classic smell, The stand is a little goofy, doesnt fit my double edge quite right.</li>
    <li> I decided to jump into wet-shaving. So far, it&#x27;s been a great decision. I received a decent DE (double-edged &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor) and wanted to try it out. This set tempted me due to the cheap price and all-inclusive material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s served me okay, and it was a good stepping stone, but I wish I&#x27;d spent my money elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Soap. The scent is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Porcelain bowl/mug. Shape could be better, but it looks great and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Awful brush. Even months later, it&#x27;s still shredding. Very grainy and uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t create a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;-Stand is okay. No complaints, no compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an okay purchase. I don&#x27;t regret it too much, and it served me somewhat well, but I wished I&#x27;d just gone with a better brand or spent just a bit more for something more longer lasting.</li>
    <li> No problems with the shipment, it even arrived a day earlier than expected! The badger hair brush is very comfortable, rinses off easy and feels great on the face. The soap has a great fragrence, not over powering by any means, and leaves your face feeling soft and moisterized after the shave. the apothecary mug is comfortable to hold, and makes mixing the lather a breeze. Definitely glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> The cup was broken although my son in law didnt want me to know and glued it back together! For the money I paid I would expect it not to be broken.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really liked the idea of this shave set but when he went to use the soap, he said it was burning his skin badly.&lt;br /&gt;he threw the soap away but kept the rest of the set. Hoping to find a soap that wont irritate him so badly</li>
    <li> The brush stinks like a nasty wet badger.</li>
    <li> The soap that comes with this set smells very nice and lathers well. I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve finally jumped into this method of shaving versus the gels with no brush and virtually no lather.</li>
    <li> quick delivery - made it for christmas as promised son was happy with it but, received another one, nicer from girl friend</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shave kit for the money.  I love that it offers a real badger hair brush, though my brush does tend to lose a fair amount of hair during shaving.  The handle on the mug is a nice touch and the soap that comes with it is probably the best smelling that I have come across.  I would definitely buy this kit again if something happened to my current one.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy my boyfriend one of these for a long time. The kit is very manly and suave (haha) and I know he will love it. I actually like it so much that I am thinking about ordering it for my brother as a christmas gift. I highly recommend it for anyone who is trying to find a nice unique gift :)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he really liked it- has shaved a few times with it.  I also bought him a razor and blades to go with it.  He did need a separate shaving cream to soothe the skin afterwards (which I got at Body Shop) - he said he needs to practice a bit to get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The brush in this set is great! I use it every shave. The soap however does not lather up well. The apothecary mug and soap have been set aside.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a cheap brush and decided to buy this. The shave soap has a good smell that isn&#x27;t strong at all. Combined with the brush, it&#x27;s very comfortable on my face. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this shave set for me for Christmas and it was amazing! I have been wanting to start doing a straight razor shave for awhile now and what a pleasant surprise it was to get all the things I needed to finally start. Mind you this set does not come with a razor but it has everything else you need. The brush feels amazing and invigorates your skin giving you an even better shave every time. This is a perfect buy for any man who is looking to try something a little better for your face.</li>
    <li> Just started in straight razor shaving and this was a perfect set to go with it!  Brush is great, mug is stylish, and the stand does its job</li>
    <li> After years of using shaving cream from a can, I wanted to try the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; style shaving cream based on my friends recommendations. Everyone I spoke to said get a badger hair brush. Also needed a bowl of some sort. Already had some shaving cream in a tube. After much searching, decided to try this set as it also included a stand for drying the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been very happy with the quality of everything in the set. The brush works well and lathers nicely, although I did have to wash it a few times to get out the musky animal scent. I quite like the bowl/cup as it is large and sturdy. The handle on the cup allows you to grip it securely even with wet hands. The shaving soap has a nice smell and foams up easily. Stand is about what you would expect from a entry level set like this. It is just a plain piece of acrylic plastic but it doesn&#x27;t tip over and holds a razor fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: For the price you can&#x27;t beat this set. Great for a beginner to try out or give it as a gift to someone who uses canned shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I like that they had all four pieces of this set. It comes with soap, a soap dish, the brush, and a stand for the brush to hang upside down and dry on. Also with the stand, there is a slot that allows for a razor to fit! I was buying this along with a double edge safety razor as a gift for my boyfriend and it was great I could get all of these features in one set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He really likes the soap and bristle feel. Eventually I might replace the brush...but this beginner&#x27;s set has good bones to it!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty awesome, with one shortcoming - the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great, and holds my straight razor and the brush perfectly, just as advertised. The ceramic bowl is very solid, too - the only thing I didn&#x27;t realize until I opened it up is that the bowl is much larger than it appears from the image. Not a bad thing, though, as it fits comfortably in my hand and is easy to hold to get a good lather. I&#x27;m a fan of the soap too, which does everything I expect out of a shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is with the brush. I tried it and I really don&#x27;t like it. It isn&#x27;t stiff enough for me, which makes lathering and application of the soap very difficult. This may just be personal preference. All of the bristles splay out sideways upon any pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product that has a great appearance on my bathroom counter - lost one star due to the brush not meeting my standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad set.  Just received mine a couple of days ago, but just got back from Target where I saw one for $19.99.  That was their normal price.  Not unhappy with the product, just feel that it is overpriced here.</li>
    <li> I bought this since I needed a stand for my new DE razor.  This was a nice plastic one that looked like it wouldnt break (unlike the cheap metal ones I found online).  I havnet used this shaving soap yet, and will probably only use it when I have no other choice.  The brush is okay but hairs constantly fall out, it doesnt hold water or heat well.  For the price, you cant beat this combo deal.  Great for a wet shaver starting out.  I count the days until my birthday when I can finally splurge and get a nice badger brush.  The mug is really comfortable to use, but again, I dont need it and my wife thinks its junk on the counter.  No regrets buying since I bought it for the stand and the brush has been working for me.  Best way for a hot lather is to soak the brush in the mug with hot water while showering. Then use the cream to make a lather. Haven&#x27;t been able to use the bar soap for a nice hot lather fyi.   Update: 3 years later. Hairs only fell out for first month or two. I soak the mug and brush in hot water while I shower. It&#x27;s about time to replace the brush. Not bad but from my above review, I didn&#x27;t expect it to last this long. i use Taylor of old bond street in the tub. Put a dollop in the mug. Grab the nub with my knuckles and it&#x27;s great. The mug and stand alone are worth the price. The brush more than served the price of this kit alone.</li>
    <li> The group makes a terrific starter set. I got mine about a week ago and I could not be happier. The brush has a great feel and a great lather. The shave soap that comes with can make a great lather for the price. The stand looks clean and neat and also comes in very handy.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a birthday gift and fell in love with soap shaving.  It&#x27;s 100 times better than gel shaving.  Off the bat, I found the soap to smell really pleasant and the badger hair brush stimulates the whiskers to give a closer shave, plus it lathers the soap well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later, I bought the same set on Amazon for my dad (we share the same birthday month) and he&#x27;s been raving about it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Soap shaving gives a closer shave (you can go over the same area multiple times without having to re-apply soap) and the smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Badger hair brush helps lather and stimulate facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t like the mug nub to hold it.  It seems awkward.&lt;br /&gt;-Badger hair brush/razor shaver is cheaply made.  But you don&#x27;t need something industrial to simply hold a brush/razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement soap will fit in this mug.  Williams makes a decent shave soap (glycerin-based) and you can skip the brush altogether and just apply soap.  I&#x27;m a shower-shaver so to help cut down on space, I just apply the soap with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All negatives aside, BUY THIS SET for a fellow shaver and they will really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the quality of this set for the price. If you&#x27;re just getting into Safety Razor shaving, or picking it up again, this is a great set of accompaniment components that doesn&#x27;t require a significant investment. You may graduate from the shaving soap to something that works better for your beard, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it either. Likewise with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Todd</li>
    <li> for those that love a clean cut and shave this will help you out more than you can imagine.. the soap leaves a clean smell as the brush lifts those tough hairs right up..and the cup does a perfect job in creating a foamy and cream moisturizing lather .. hope you all will take the time and get one .. will help you save money in the long run ...</li>
    <li> The main reason I picked up this particular set was to get this mug.  I like the handle and the outwardly curving sides to allow me room to build a lather and keep it contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does shed a lot and I ultimately replaced it with a synthetic one that does not shed at all ([[ASIN:B0015POQ6I Beauty Strokes H.I.S Shaving Brush]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is hard, so it does not lather up well unless you pre-soak the soap before use.  This is where the good mug comes in handy.  The puck that comes with it fits nicely and it is easy to melt down future pucks (I add about 25% water first and microwave for 30 seconds) so that they fit to the edge.  There is plenty of room above the soap to hold some water and build up a good cream or foam with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put a little bit of hot water on top when I wake up in the morning and by the time I am done with my shower, I just take my brush (dry if badger, wet if synthetic) and swirl it around for about 40 seconds and get a nice thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then rinse out the brush, squeeze it dry and let it dry on the hanger.  It would be nice to have a heavier hanger so that it does not tip over quite so easily, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I started looking for such a set is that I made a decision that filling my childrens&#x27; landfills with disposible cans of shaving cream was inexcusable conduct on my part.  Maybe they are recycled, maybe not.  Even if they are, there is a large cost to create the product.  A simple bar of soap with a mug that will essentially last forever seemed a much better idea.  Now that I have tried it, I even prefer it (tho I simultaneously started using baby oil as a preshave oil and that may be some of the reason I prefer it as well).</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a fathers day gift.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great value for a starter kit and quality is actually really good. My husband likes it and has now mastered the art of shaving with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Got this kit and over all i am very happy with it. Just keep in mind that the soap provided it a bit difficult to lather for a new shaver, and the mug is a bit small for a shaving cream to mix. over all for the money, its a great set.</li>
    <li> I have been using my significant other&#x27;s shaving set for the past several months. We both love this set and I finally bought a second one so we can both shave at the same time. For the ladies looking to get into using the safety razor for shaving, I love it. It is the best shave I have ever gotten. This brush seems like it will last a long time, and as I said previously two of us were using the same brush. I like the handle on the cup for lathering the shaving soap. It is easy to hold, even with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We even got one of these sets to go with the safety razor we got my mom for Christmas, as she recently expressed interest in getting one. We are very happy with our purchase and would recommend this set for someone new to using this set-up, as well as some experienced practitioners.</li>
    <li> The mug, stand, and brush are quite functional and a good starter set.  However, I was very disappointed by the soap after I read the ingredients.  Several of the ingredients listed on the box were all wonderful things, but unfortunately the 1st ingredient is propylene glycol.  I don&#x27;t buy anything with that in it as I believe it is poison to the skin, our largest organ.  Ingredients should always be listed, as some of us pay attention to that information.  I will have to find another shave soap, because I will not use this one.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift last christmas. The stand is great, the bowl is awesome. Just throw the puck in there and make lather. The downside of this set is the brush..it sheds. I have used it for a year and I am now giving up and going synthetic. I hate having random hairs in my lather</li>
    <li> Minus the razor, this set comes with quite a bit to get you started for a shave.  This set gives you the old school feel of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving Mug/Cup/Bowl: Looks like it&#x27;s porcelian made.  Great quality bowl.  5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: The soap is actually really good.  Builds up a nice lather.  The scent is nice, but not overpowering.  I would buy this soap again down the road if needed.  Feels great on the skin.  5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush and Razor Stand: The plastic stand does the trick.  Two grooves to hold your brush and razor.  Just a heads up this stand won&#x27;t hold all razors so be warned.  Though it&#x27;s not the best looking stand, it does the job.  4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar Brush: An ok brush.  It works, but shedded a little when I started using it.  It still does the job, but I see myself replacing this in the near future.  I don&#x27;t mind spending a little money for a better brush.  2.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good shave kit.  Since this retails between $25-$30, it&#x27;s worth a try.  Good starter kit for someone interested in this style of shaving.</li>
    <li> I recently made the transition from Gillette Fusion to a double edge (DE) razor - the Merkur 34C. I needed the entire shave set and decided to try this set since it appeared to be more on the high end and had everything I needed to get started. The set was well packaged and appears to be made of good quality materials. The soap has a very mild, but pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t make a heavy lather, but enough to get a good shave. It&#x27;s a very good starting point to begin exploring other soaps for comparison.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of anything that I&#x27;ve bought for shaving, and it seemed like a great deal. When I got the kit, I was actually expecting a soap that smelled like old man, but it actually smells great! More of a modern scent (if that makes any sense), not like Axe, but something light.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is cool. Gets dirty kind of easily, but with a quick wipe, its clean again.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is large, and fits in your hand well. It if comfortable to hold, especially with the handle and the lip that flares out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> The brush is worthless. You lose several to many bristles during each use. It is going to have a very limited lifetime. The acrylic stand is top heavy when the razor and brush are mounted...easily tips over. My bathroom wall is Hardie board. I am seriously considering gluing the stand to the wall.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve bought two of these sets and one of them was great.  For the price you pay, you get a high quality mug and a good little shaving brush.  The problem I had with the second set that I ordered was that the bristles were not seated in the brushes handle and ended up falling out.  Other than that drawback, this is a good set for beginners.</li>
    <li> The apothecary cup is great, to hold and work up a lather.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great, but, did it shed!&lt;br /&gt;I was really annoyed by the amount of bristles I was losing with every use.  I was so unhappy with it, that after about a year of using it, I bought a different brush.&lt;br /&gt;But it looks like there is a break-in period for this brush, because, just when I had bought a new brush, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t shedding anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush stand is good, and functional and helps your brush dry out.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ve never really tried to hand up my razor on it, because, after using it, my razor is wet, and I like to dry each part out individually.  And I found it odd, that the stand did not account for something like that.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong and I should just have the razor dry out, and leave the blade out to dry.  I will probably try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a great deal for this price - to be able to get that cup, a brush and a stand to put the brush on and a razor.</li>
    <li> I got this on drugstore.com but I thought i&#x27;d review it here.. It is a nice mug! The stand is very nice, way better than the AoS stand for $6.. plus it has a razor holder which is an added bonus. The soap smells really good and is great in the mug, which is also very nice! This would make a good gift for anyone, I know I would like it. Oh, and Target sells this same exact kit for $19.98, too bad I didn&#x27;t know that before I bought it for $28. I still think it is a good deal for $28, even better for $20!</li>
    <li> Great set.  The brush and bowl create a pretty good lather.</li>
    <li> Was great purchase but i did find it cheaper after i ordered it.</li>
    <li> The brush/razor holder and foam cup are the two best things about this set, and just happen to be the two main items I purchased this for.  The lexan holder looks good and is perfectly functional.  The cup is quality construction, looks very nice, and is easy to clean.  The brush is adequate, but had a very gamey and unpleasant smell for the first few months.  With some aftershave dowsing and prolonged use of fragrant shaving cream the smell eventually went away.  The brush sheds about 2-3 hairs per shave.  The cake soap was OK.  It had a soft and pleasant smell, but not the richest lather in the world.  I prefer the shave and lather from a higher quality English shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I rate this product a good value for the money.  3-stars instead of 4 due to the smell on the brush.</li>
    <li> Soap- The soap is average. Not a very strong, or easy to determine smell. Lathers up best if you lather on the face. Lathering in a bowl was difficult, but it might be my water quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush- Poor.  This brush sheds about 6-8 hairs per use. I don&#x27;t expect to use it long before upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand- It&#x27;s plastic. Unremarkable, but expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mug- It&#x27;s a mug. Unremarkable, but expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good way for a person to see if they&#x27;ll like taking the extra time to wet shave like this. If you&#x27;re serious about it, you&#x27;ll want to upgrade from here.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price! The mug is nice and the brush seems decent. Is it the best brush out there? No. But it&#x27;s definitely a decent brush. My one recommendation would be to not be rough with the brush. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it seems to be doing well aside from a few lost bristles here and there.  The soap smells nice too and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the stand, yes as others have said it is simple, but it gets the job done. Honestly I don&#x27;t know why people make such a big fuss over this. It&#x27;s just something to hold you&#x27;re shaving equipment while it dries, and if it really bothers you that much, then go and buy another stand with the money you saved from this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this is a great value for the price. I would definitely get it as a gift for someone who is looking to start DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Good starter set for anyone who is new to making the switch.  Mug is big but not big enough to make lather(personal preference) but still big enough to hold shaving soap.  Stand is basic clear plastic but gets the job done.  My only complain is the badger brush, tends to shed a bit after every use</li>
    <li> The soap lathers well enough but I&#x27;m still trying others out to see which I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup is sturdy I&#x27;ve had no issues keeping a grip or working up a good lather within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is handy but my cat likes it too much so I have to hide it in my cabinet.  Still works nicely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has been losing a few hairs during my first 10 uses, but overall is still intact.  I&#x27;m not overly rough with it either as the soap gives a decent lather without too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very happy with the product considering the price.</li>
    <li> The brush is fine but it smells when gets wet (I guess it is from a real badger. You can buy this kit from target for $19. One problem is the the stand is too short for hydro 5 razor and it keeps falling. The soap is ok but not a refreshing smell. The bowl looks real classic. $19 is all it is worth.</li>
    <li> Brush came out of handle after two uses</li>
    <li> I bought this shave set about 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.The badger hair brush was fairly rough at first but it quickly softened and feels comfortable on my face. It shed lightly for a couple years, but it&#x27;s still as large and fluffy as the day I bought it.  The clear plastic holder looks cheap but performs its function very well. The soap lathers very quickly and smells great, I enjoyed the first one so much that I&#x27;ve been buying Van Der Hagen soaps since. The mug looks nice, but the knob is not pleasant to hold onto. Instead I just place the whole mug in the palm of my hand and it works just fine in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I spend a minute cleaning the entire set it looks like it did when it was brand new. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this shave set. It&#x27;s a great inexpensive shave set for beginners and experts alike.</li>
    <li> Soap is great! Brush, not so much. Sheds like crazy and not much backbone (doesnt feel like tgere are masy hairs packed in) but the brush is soft. Will definitly get you started if youre new!!</li>
    <li> CHEAP. Nothing &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sure- I kind of figured that since this is a &amp;#34;combo-pack intro&amp;#34; set that it wasn&#x27;t going to be amazing in quality or lifespan. But not THIS cheap! Others had complained about the brush having a horrible dead animal smell- thankfully mine did not. However upon the very first use, and within like the first 45 seconds mind you- the head of the brush came right off the handle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap, although not super bad isn&#x27;t that great- I threw it away after one use. I found the smell annoying and the lather/shave on the shaving cream I make myself from Noxzema and lotion is better. The mug is made for people who have crippled hands (no offense). I had to use a coffee mug from the kitchen instead. As for the stand .... it is what it is- a stand. You would really have to be ignorant beyond all decency to mess that up. The stand is decent- there I said it. It won&#x27;t wow you, you won&#x27;t walk into the room see it sitting on your dresser and click your mouth while winking and pointing at it while going &amp;#34;Ehhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy!!!!!!!!!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autopsy: NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Brush is very cheap, it will fall apart- even if you glue it back.&lt;br /&gt;- Mug is trash&lt;br /&gt;- Soap is bad but not super bad&lt;br /&gt;- Stand is a stand. Not worth it to buy this thing only for the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly by trying to save some cash by not buying these things individually I ended up spending more money that I would have. I essentially spent $25 for a stand. Well lesson learned I guess....</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed .......... The cup was broken  when I received it</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot.  I still haven&#x27;t ran out of this shave soap after months of shaving.  It smells nice, and protects my face well.  The brush still looks like new, and the rack it comes with holds the razor and brush well.  Great investment!</li>
    <li> I love this set. Very high quality for the price! I have been using it for over a year now, and it is still great!</li>
    <li> Shave soap and plastic brush holder are garbage, but the cup and brush are solid.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my fiancé and he loves it! some hair from the brush tends to come out but that&#x27;s expected with any brush. just take care of it and it will last long.</li>
    <li> The old way in this case seems to be the better way, I love it and will use as long as I can then ill buy another</li>
    <li> Soap was awful the brush was falling apart before I even used it once.  The cup was nice but I wasn&#x27;t about to keep the entire thing for a mug.</li>
    <li> I like this shave set, especially the brush and razor holder.  Looks real nice.  Only one small complaint, is the&lt;br /&gt;soap is not very sudsy, but that makes it easier for the razor to work, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I recommend this for any man who like the brush method of preparing to shave..</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the soap and it leaves my fiance&#x27;s face so smooth. The brush is wonderful. One question though, where can we get more soap????</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Valentines Day and he loves it. The brush is high quality. It looks nice sitting out on the counter and he really likes the soap. So much so that he ordered three more disks. But the first one has lasted a year so it&#x27;ll be a long time till we have to order more!</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem with ingrown hairs and irritated skin and was using one of the disposable plastic 5+ blade razors.  He tried different shave creams but nothing seemed to help that much so I did some research and surprised him with a Merkur safety razor to try.  I purchased this shave set and a sampler pack of blades to get him started with everything he would need.  The quality is very much appropriate, if not better than I would expect, for the price.  The plastic bowl and stand are a good sturdy plastic.  The soap smells nice, light and clean and it seems to be good for his skin.  The brush is decent, although it has lost a few hairs here and there, not annoyingly so.  The razor, blades and this set altogether have made for a more comfortable shaving experience for him although the ingrown hairs aren&#x27;t completely gone.  Even if he decides to try something else, I feel like we will have gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of this set (he&#x27;s been using it for about a month and a half now).</li>
    <li> Very good package for the price I use it every day and would highly recommend this to any one wanting a good shave</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product for the beginner wet shaver as it lasts. I have since upgraded but use it interchangeably and cant really tell the difference. I use the brush when using Proraso all the time so I dont get the waxy buildup on my good brush!</li>
    <li> Shopped a long time for a new shaving set prior to purchasing this one. I am glad I did the thick ceramic soap bowl feels good in your hand and the knob handle makes it easy to hold. The brush has yet to shed a single bristle after many months of use and the soap smells and lathers great. The plastic (or Plexiglass) holder was not to my liking so I replaced it with a Canhigh metal stand. Overall a good buy and better quality that I was expecting&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby as a present. He truly loves it! This set is compact and nice. I love the way the soap smells by the way. The soap smells delicate but manly and luxurious at the same time!!!</li>
    <li> this soap smells AMAZING. the brush is great. it really puts the fun back in shaving. makes is an enjoyable ritual again.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The brush, stand, and mug are excellent quality, and the shave soap is far more gentle on my face than the shaving cream from Art of Shaving and other higher end stuff. I highly recommend anyone interested in shaving old school buy this as a beginners set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Parker 99R safety razor and have enjoyed my morning ritual since getting used to the specifics of shaving with that type of razor.  I can&#x27;t explain how relaxing the morning routine is now.  The badger brush is like a face massage every time I shave.  The scent of the soap is the only drawback.  It is not unpleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t have a really good scent.  Apart from that minor complaint, I love this item.</li>
    <li> The mug is fantastic, the holder fits my Merkur Futur nicely, and the soap is just fine.  The brush, however, still smells like fresh wild badger even after many uses.  I&#x27;ve tried the tricks from Badger and Blade, but my particular brush doesn&#x27;t seem to get any better.  Fortunately, I still have my ultra cheap-o brush I got at the grocery store a while back.  It creates a foam that is equally lofty but without the smell.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice set , especially if you are a beginner. I have since added to my collection of shaving ,but still use this brush and cup. Soap is ok ,but does not compare to proraso shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> I must first start with the mug. The mug is of great quality, it feels good in the hand, and there&#x27;s just something about the flared mouth that makes it easier to lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is easy to lather. Some people are saying it won&#x27;t but they don&#x27;t realize that hard water has an effect on your lather. If you have hard water, try using distilled water. It&#x27;s either that, or they don&#x27;t put enough effort into the lather. The scent is great, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is nice because it has a slot to hold your straight or double edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the bad. The brush likes to shed. A lot. I suggest getting a &#x27;Frank Shaving&#x27; brush, or the cheaper option of an &#x27;Ecotools Bamboo Finishing Kabuki&#x27;, both of which can be found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bad thing, which isn&#x27;t so much to do with the kit itself, is the price. You can find this kit at Target for just $20. Sellers on Amazon are charging $27 or more, plus shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great kit, perfect for a beginner, except for the brush.</li>
    <li> At this price point I was expecting an inferior brush (usually you cant find a good badger brush under $60) but this brush is very good. It holds water well and lathers up soap or cream very fast.  The soap cup and stand are a great bonus. I did not give it 5 stars only because im not fond of the smell of the soap. Its not terrible and after I rinse my face in the end the smell is gone. Ill be sure to purchase my regular sandalwood cream/soap next time.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good set for me to begin with but I realized different as soon as i opened it. The quality sucks very much. It is cheap crap, even for a beginner. The Brush handle is hollow and light thin plastic and the bristles were already falling out as i ran my finger over it. The mug i could have bought from the dollar store. Right out of the box the plastic stand has a stress crack in the corner and it hasnt even been used yet. (See picture). Do yourself a favor and save up for a good kit. I want my money back :( I am baffled that this got as many good reviews as it did.</li>
    <li> Purchased locally at a big box store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a excellent introductory set for DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part of the set I didn&#x27;t like was the soap. Switched it out for a higher end product after using 3 or 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this is a great set to start with, but there are much better if you are willing to drop the cash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and his shaves have been much more thorough and lasted longer and closer and smoother.....&lt;br /&gt;He uses his favorite 3 blade shaver from the drug store with this.....he loves, loves, loves it.  Could not believe it was so much better than canned kind.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiance as a gift. He always liked the straight razor sets so he was excited to get one. He uses it almost every day and says its great!</li>
    <li> brush works very well.</li>
    <li> Solid look and feel but the brush only lasted a few weeks before the whole bristle unit came unglued and fell out.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I needed to complete the switch from the multi-blade razor to the safety blade. This mus is the perfect size and helps produce the right consistency of the foam.</li>
    <li> After years of using a brush and soap from Old Spice, I found that they no longer make it. So I went on the hunt for a replacement at my local drug stores only to find that they no longer have shaving brushes and soaps. So I went online to Amazon and found the Van Der Hagen products. After using this product for a couple of weeks I found it to be a fairly good product. It takes some getting used to though as the soap is different in how it lathers up compared to what I used before.</li>
    <li> If you were to go shop individually for a similar badger brush, a stand, a shaving bowl, and shaving soap, you&#x27;d easily be spending over $100.  So this is a good deal for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush:  It sheds...ALOT.  Seriously.  Every time you lather up soap, every time you brush your face, you will find stray hairs.  You can simply pull on the brush when dry and hairs will never stop shedding.  I emailed the company about this, but never got a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bowl:  I&#x27;m not sure if this is a classic shaving bowl shape or not, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.  It looks cool, but if you&#x27;re lathering your shaving cream, I like using more...umm...speherical containers, like a cereal bowl.  This bowl is too deep and narrow.  You&#x27;ll be banging the sides left and right with your brush/fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is pretty cool.  It&#x27;s honestly the only thing I still use since entering the shave-game.  It holds my double-edge and/or my straight razor nicely, and my new silver-tip brush fits like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use solid shaving soap.  I prefer creams instead.  Never used it, so no opinion on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you&#x27;re curious about old-fashioned shaving and you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a good start.  IMO, shaving is one of those more zen-like experience that can really be enjoyed, appreciated, and perfected by a man with GOOD QUALITY equipment (I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes stuff like carpentry and slow-pour coffee).  If you want to just get your feet wet in shaving, try this.  If you&#x27;re more serious and want something long-term, look at investing in something more high-quality.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my hubby, he loves it!  Saves money too!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a Valentines Day present and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Great kit and soap for shaving with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and a half and am very happy with it.  Thought I would offer my opinion as a long term user instead of the ones that have used it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is mostly about the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of people say that they quit using the brush after a while, but I don&#x27;t see a need to do that.  I shave 3-5 times a week and it is going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there nicer brushes out there?  I&#x27;m sure there are.  However, try this trick: In order to not lose this brush while traveling (about 6 weeks a year), I ended up buying a cheap boar brush from Van Der Hagen for $5.  I&#x27;ve found if I use the boar once every 2 weeks, that in comparison this badger brush from the set feels amazingly soft after-- good enough for me, I&#x27;ll use this brush until it is dead which is years away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the brush knot got loose and fell out of the handle (it was about 9 months old).  Everything was still in tact. I just used Gorilla Glue to put the entire knot back in &amp; its holding strong.  (If you&#x27;re confused, read up on the knots, you&#x27;ll see if it is intact you&#x27;re fine) I think better adhesives to hold the knot in.  To me, this shouldn&#x27;t have happened for at least the first 2 years.  However, with the Gorilla Glue, I don&#x27;t think it will happen again in 20. -- this is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even include that story because I don&#x27;t want to talk you out of buying this product.  However, I want to give the idea if it happens to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a starters kit, but it can also last you quite a few years if you want it to.  So 5-stars if you plan to use it a year or less -- 4 stars if you want it to last 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna keep this short.  I&#x27;ve used this for a while now &amp; while the soap does seem to take a little longer to lather than the other one I used it produces a good shave.  I will say if you&#x27;re looking to buy this I paid about $10 LESS at a major retail store that has &amp;#34;everyday low prices.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I gave this shave set 1 start because the the Brush broker after one month of normal use. By &#x27;&#x27;broker&#x27;&#x27; I mean the  entire BRISTLE part of the brush came a part from the Handle. It was just glued on to the handle and must of been a very low quality glue! And YES I did gently rinsed it and hung it to dry after every use. The brush is very cheap and of low quality, I would NOT recommend this. As for the Cup... it&#x27;s a cup! not much to say about it other than it looks ok and has a good handle and weight to it.</li>
    <li> I have recently started shaving with a safety razor and heard that if you want to do it right, you need to buy a badger brush.  So I looked into it and found this shave set.  Here&#x27;s the breakdown of what I&#x27;ve learned after using each item in the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush:  Overall its a great brush.  Its made of actual badger hair and does not shed very much at all. The quality of the brush actually surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl:  What can I say?  Its a bowl.  It contains the soap while you lather.  However I will note that the handle is nice when you have wet slippery hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap:  Smells great, and does not require too much effort to lather into a nice creamy texture.  Also feels great when you apply it to your face and gives protection during your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand:  Made of a heavy plastic.  Does its job and holds the brush and my safety razor.  I have had no issue with the stand tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Buy it. What I&#x27;ve found is that you can purchase this quality set for the cost of a brush alone, and its worth it.  Great as a gift for someone else or you can purchase it for yourself.</li>
    <li> One of the best sets out there. The price is right and no need to look any further...Didn&#x27;t I say don&#x27;t look for anything else and just buy it!</li>
    <li> My husband likes this very much.  Good lather.</li>
    <li> Good value overall.  The badger hair came out of the brush a bit for the first 3 or 4 times I used it.  That isn&#x27;t unreasonable, I suppose.  The brush holds water very well.  The soap fits perfectly down in the mug.  I will continue to use this and will buy refills of the soap.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> I found this set while looking for a stand, brush, and some shave soap.  For the price, this was the best deal I could find.  The soap is good, although I rarely use it having also purchased some higher rated soap.  The brush works great, the mug is excellent to have, and the stand keeps the brush dry between uses and the razor in a safe place.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loved it. He uses it all the time and I know it will last. I have purchased cheaper brushes and they didn&#x27;t hold up, decided to spend a little more and worth every penny! He loves the stand and so do I, its not laying all over the sink now!! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This set isn&#x27;t back the cup is nice and like the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cup is solid and holds nicely&lt;br /&gt;stand is an added bonus&lt;br /&gt;soap smell is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is not great at all, will need a new 1 within a year.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is a great starter kit for shaving. Some folks have complained that the brush loses too many bristles, but I have not had that issue. The soap forms a good lather and produces a generally good shave. The mug is ceramic and has a great vintage feel to it. The stand is cheap acrylic, but does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this on Amazon for $35, but ultimately returned it because Target offers the exact same thing for $19.99. Not sure if that was a special price, but win for me! I&#x27;d at least check that out first.</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart after only three or four uses, the handle came completely detached.  Not sure if this was just a lemon, but i would not buy again.  The amazon customer service people were great though.</li>
    <li> I remember my Dad using a brush, I wanted my husband to try one. He loves it, smoother shave. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> First, this shipment was received very quickly. Second, the quality of this product was superb. The soap was first class and provided a great rich lather ! I expect years of use  from this product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> excellent Shaving set,Amazing shave with this Brush,Great Looking,perfect packing and excellent service. If you want to buy perfect shaving set with excellent price and service than do not Look any where.Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Nice set. As described. It&#x27;s the only shave soap i&#x27;ve tried. It is drier than the creams and lotions that i normally use.</li>
    <li> At this point I&#x27;ve replaced a bunch of the items in this set, but I think this was a good starting kit.</li>
    <li> First impression: packaging is nicely done, the whole thing is in a nice box with plenty of quality foam padding and in todays world where some companies put a lot of thought into how their items present at unboxing I was impressed.  The mug feels solid and substantial, soap smells mild but pleasant, the brush is very soft right out of the box. Plastic stand but it looks nice and holds the brush as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Second impression: everything was great with the set, quality was good with one exception, the brush smells very bad when it gets wet. I can&#x27;t place the smell but it makes me think of musty-burnt hair.  I have washed the brush with shampoo twice, the smell is getting better and I will wash it a few more times before using it again. Some info I found online recommends soaking the brush for a couple minutes in a diluted vinegar &amp; warm water mix to knock down the smell - I hope that works well as the smell is very strong and sticks with your nose long after the shave. The stand is too short for a standard cartridge razor (fusion or mach3, etc) but works well with a short DE unit.&lt;br /&gt;IF the brush smell issue gets corrected with a good soaking I will be very happy with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: soaked the brush for 2 minutes in vinegar and hot water, rinsed it out, dried it a bit more by brushing it against a dry towel and the smell was much better this morning. It did lose a few more hairs this morning (about as many as I lose each day) but over time the brush should lose fewer and fewer (wish I could say the same for me). Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my boyfriend for Christmas. He said it was &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34; The stand is very nice to hold the brush and a razor. The brush is very high quality and super soft and supple. It spreads the shaving soap evenly across the beard. The cup and soap are also a very nice quality. All-in-all, a nice set for the money. The packaging is also more than adequate to protect the contents, as well as being attractive for gift-giving.</li>
    <li> The bowl is good. Hard to mess that up. The brush is terrible. The hair was not uniformly cut at all. Stunk terribly as well. All brushes smell for awhile but this one just wouldn&#x27;t quit and my face would smell like wet badger. The hair came out all the time. By stubble could pull the hair out. More badger hair than beard hair in the sink. The soap is just ok too. It&#x27;s soap. The stand is good, but really only fits large brushes well and there is no place to hold a razor. Don&#x27;t buy. Not worth it. Get a good brush and good soap.</li>
    <li> I use this every couple of days. YES it does have the shedding problem for like a few weeks and then once those bristles are gone it&#x27;s pretty great. It works really well and I&#x27;m not sure how well the more expensive brushes work but this one lathers up well. It&#x27;s easy to clean and then you hang it up to dry and it looks cool there on your bathroom counter. The mug thing looks nice and the soap smells great. I think it&#x27;s a really good buy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice looking set however my husband tells me that the brush is not very good. It will do but I think I will be looking for a better brush shortly</li>
    <li> The cup and the brush work we&#x27;ll and the soap smells fantastic. But when he opened the box on Christmas mor g, the handle the brush hangs on was broke it two.  It was packaged well with bubble wrap,which make me think maybe it was broken even before  shipping.  Everything is great except I&#x27;m missing a piece to the brand new set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I was in need of a new shaving brush. This got decent reviews, so, I thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks and order it. The bowl and stand are just &#x27;ok&#x27;. When it arrived the brush shed quite a bit. I figured it would quit shedding after a few uses. Several months in, though, and it&#x27;s gotten worse. It&#x27;s downright terrible in fact. Now, I can just run my fingers through the brush and pull out quite a bit with each pass. It&#x27;s ridiculous. So, I&#x27;m now ordering a completely different brush so that I can throw this one away which is probably where it belonged in the first place.</li>
    <li> Bought this for brother in law for Christmas. He really liked it.</li>
    <li> Husband is new to straight razor shaving but he LOVES the soap it comes with. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. The soap has a mild woodsy scent to it. The brush holder is a cheap little piece of s*** but hey, you can&#x27;t have everything. The hair hasn&#x27;t started falling out of the brush yet and he&#x27;s had it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> The bowl is perfect in size, weight and durability.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is pretty simple but a good for a beginner (non-scented). I microwave the soap in the bowl for 30 seconds to get a snug fit &amp; prevent water from collecting around the edges after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is solid in ever way but the build. The bristles fall out pretty easily when soaping up each and every time I use it. I&#x27;ve had this for over a month now so it&#x27;s not just a few early bristles. At this rate I&#x27;ll have to get a new brush before the end of the year (pretty unacceptable).</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor to replace my psychotically expensive cartridge razors and shave cream. All I can say is I am impressed. This makes shaving more enjoyable and my face has been clearer since using this for about 2 weeks now. It lathers up nicely, smells good and holds my razor all nice and neat on my bathroom counter.  I have linked the razor and blades that I think are best to use. [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]][[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]]</li>
    <li> The brush separated from the handle after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> My husband had mentioned that he would like to try to shave using a brush and soap.  I looked over just about every kit sold here on Amazon and read comments when I decided on this kit.  My husband LOVES it!  The soap last a very long time - 3 months and still plenty of soap left.</li>
    <li> This is a nice starter set for wet shaving. The soap fits snuggly in the bottom of the mug. The brush is a good brush for the price. I was able to whip up a good lather with this product which led to a great shave. The brush/razor holder was of excellent design and finish. I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> First off... my pack was incomplete (missing brush) so I ended up returning the whole thing. But here&#x27;s my review for the other components:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t open the soap (otherwise can&#x27;t return)&lt;br /&gt;The mug looks good and seems decent quality, but it&#x27;s just a mug. You can use anything. It&#x27;s not some high quality porcelain (just fyi)&lt;br /&gt;The stand is BAD. It&#x27;s some cheap plastic that is poorly milled. I could still see the residuals of the plastic from where it was formed. Also, the opening to hold the razor is really large, which makes no sense, considering usual double edged razor handles are about the thickness of a sharpie marker.</li>
    <li> I usually shave with water only in the shower using a disposable.  This is a pretty nice basic bottom line set  I like the stand, the bowl was only designed and not engineered making it somewhat less useful than a simple mug.  But it looks OK and the soap foams around all the hairs the brush leaves. so I guess it is not worthy of a 2  so 3 it is.</li>
    <li> A brush set for the price of just an apothecary soap holder. The soap holder is just what I wanted with a historical look however the stand for the brush is modern looking so I replaced it. The brush looks great and works well to get a great lather however something is a little loose in the brush but it has not come apart as some reviewers have mentioned. I haven&#x27;t used the soap as I have one that I was given as a gift but overall this will get you started on a budget and you can upgrade in the future on some of the pieces.</li>
    <li> Use this every day for the perfect shave. Looks very nice in the stand.</li>
    <li> The brush handle is smaller than I expected. The stand is not so useful, it tends to lean forward and fall down, it needs a better base and the top edge is slant which makes it easy to fall. Here&#x27;s my rating&lt;br /&gt;The mug : 4 / 5&lt;br /&gt;Soap:  4 / 5&lt;br /&gt;Brush:  3 / 5&lt;br /&gt;Stand :  2 / 5</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Nice black cup thingy. The stand is junk. I think you might be able to get a better deal on the separate brush and cup thingy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The brush is what gets the prize for this kit. I have not tried the soap since I use a preferred shaving cream. I dropped the plastic holder by accident and it broke. It was not a big drop which makes me thing the holder is not durable at all. Overall, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Good for anyone who is new to shaving with real razors. The hair brush gave up after 7 months of shaving 3 days a week. The top part separated from the handle, looks poorly glued but still great product. I would recommend it to anyone who is getting into real shaving &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stil have plenty of soap and the mug still going strong.</li>
    <li> Was broken when arrived.</li>
    <li> Great soap and nice cup. Unfortunately the brush came apart after a few months. The glue failed. I was able to wedge the bristle (assembly?) into the handle and kind of make it work for about a week before buying a new one.</li>
    <li> Good set but cheap brush it looses hair all over the place when you use it overall good deal if you want to try this kind of shaving.</li>
    <li> The brush fell out of the handle :(</li>
    <li> The quality of the bristles was not good. During the soap application process the shaving brush shed way to many hairs. Was not impressed with the product. Brush did not maintain its shape.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as gifts for the shavers in my family. They were very well received and my significant other raves about it! The brush has held up well over the last two years of regular use.</li>
    <li> The brush broke on me after 2 weeks of use. The shaving soap? It had a wet dog smell to it and didn&#x27;t work well at all. For the price I guess you will be spending it all on the mug which still is intact.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews that say the brush is cheap.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, and each time 10 or 15 hairs come out.  At this rate it will only last a month or two.  Also, when I rinsed the brush out after opening the package dirty water came out.  I don&#x27;t think they washed the hair after taking it off the badger.</li>
    <li> I have had friends purchase the Art of Shaving kit, and I think this has a good setup for beginners to shaving with a safety razor, like me. It has a nice stand, a bowl for the soap, and the soap smells good! The brush is great as well. Hghly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty ambivalent about this shave set. I&#x27;m new to using a classic shave set like this one, but it has some features that aren&#x27;t spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD Things:&lt;br /&gt;- A couple uses in, brush starts losing 1-2&amp;#34; hairs... Finding in the sink, on my face, and on the razor&lt;br /&gt;- Stand does NOT hold classic safety razor unless you&#x27;re very good at balancing things (was designed for normal razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD Things:&lt;br /&gt;- Bowl is sturdy and clean looking&lt;br /&gt;- Soap works just fine and smells pretty good&lt;br /&gt;- Stand holds brush wonderfully</li>
    <li> The stand base is not weighted therefore it falls over easily. The handle on the mug adds a nice look. The mug is also heavy enough you don&#x27;t need to hold the handle when working soap to a lather. The soap makes decent lather and is not strongly fragranced. The brush is a real piece of junk. I have used it for almost 2 months and it consistently looses hair every day. I am amazed it still has enough to work maybe it grows new ones overnight to be able to shed this much and still hair left. I am going to try a kingsley based on other reviews. I have had all the shedding I can take from this not so luxury van der hagen.</li>
    <li> I came across this set while looking for just a stand for my safety razor. After some research, I discovered that metal stands even above this set in price (without this set&#x27;s brush, cup, and soap) were prone to tarnish and/or  rust, so I decided to try the plastic stand, and I haven&#x27;t regretted it for a moment. The cup is solid, the soap is good, and the only issue I&#x27;ve had with the brush is losing a hair or two from it per shave (this hasn&#x27;t affected its usability at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone getting into wet shaving, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After looking at some of the shops in the malls, and finding similar products for over $100, this package is a steal.  Good stuff, and it will save me lots more in the future, a cake of soap for a couple of dollars every couple of months versus $5 for a tube of lotion every few weeks?  A no brainer.</li>
    <li> I had been in to The Art of Shaving a few times and looked at the products and was interested in trying shaving with a soap and brush, but didn&#x27;t want to take out a second mortgage to pay for their products. I had gotten the $9 version of Van Der Hagen&#x27;s shaving kit with the boar hair brush and thought it worked very well. I used the soap and a regular Gilette Fusion razor and was very happy with how close the shave was using the soap instead of the gel. I like how you get just enough soap on your face instead of getting maybe a little too much gel. The blade seems to work better with the soaps and I&#x27;ve been getting very smooth, close shaves. I wanted a stand for the brush and razor, so I updgraded to this kit and I like it even better. The badger hair brush feels better on my face than the boar, which seemed fairly coarse. Of all the shaving soaps I&#x27;ve smelled, I like this one the best. It&#x27;s a great kit and a good way to get a great shave without spending a lot of money. On top of all that, the stand and the brush and bowl look really nice next to the sink.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit.  The brush is decent (it works very well but sheds- otter hairs in your safety razor can be a pain in the rear).  Mug is really nice, and the soap is not bad either.  Don&#x27;t count on it lasting a long time, but well worth it as a starting point.</li>
    <li> The hair of the brush falls off a little bit. For this price though the set is great. The soap smells really nice and the stand and cup are great</li>
    <li> Want to start to wet shave? Look no farther, this is the best set up to start with! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> this is a Good kit that gets you started cheap.  everything seems of good quality. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Husband loved it for an anniversary gift! It&#x27;s going to take practice to learn but it&#x27;s a great manly gift.</li>
    <li> Value for money and a wonderful smell after.  Got this with the Merkur 180.  Purchase this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I own about a dozen brushes, from vintage nylon-bristle brushes to modern badgers. I&#x27;ve also used bunches of shaving soaps and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Van Der Hagen shaving soap is quite good, especially for the price. The bowl is also perfectly functional and attractive. The weakness is the pure-badger shaving brush. It doesn&#x27;t have much backbone, and it consequently doesn&#x27;t work well for lathering up a hard soap such as the one supplied with the kit. It works better on shaving creams. I just used it with C.O. Bigelow shaving cream (manufactured by Proraso), and the brush worked fine. It did shed bristles, but new badgers will do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;ve used the Van Der Hagen bowl and soap with stiffer brushes, including nylon, boar, and badger brushes, and it&#x27;s very good. Just pick up a good Omega or Semogue boar-bristle brush (they can be found at very reasonable prices), and you&#x27;ll be good to go. After you use the products for a year or so, you&#x27;ll have paid for them because of the reduced cost compared to aerosol foams or gels.</li>
    <li> The mug and bristle brush were excellent quality.  It arrived on-time.  The mug and brush holder have a great design to hold the razor.  It was the &#x27;old days of shaving&#x27; made new, with this perfect birthday gift for Dad.</li>
    <li> The set is great but the brush tends to lose some strands of hair every now and again but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s common. The soap smells real nice and the mug is good. 7/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good item, can&#x27;t complain. Works great and it has a nice smell. I fell is a little expensive and it does not come with a extra sope.</li>
    <li> Had been using an electric shaver for years after making the switch from expensive multi blade cartridges.  Through the years, I can&#x27;t say that I was every truly happy with the closeness or experience of dry shaving.  After thinking about going back to wet shaving, I stumbled into the recent movement of guys going back to DE Safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit intimidated at using this today, when it came in the mail, since I had never used a safety razor before.  I ordered it with the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor and took it for a test drive.  I was surprised at how little effort it took for me to get a good shave.  it did help to get some examples from Youtube on proper lathering and shaving techniques.  But wow, what an experience!  The razor doesn&#x27;t take that much effort to use.  You let its weight, angle, and the blade do the work.  The shaving soap is much better than anything out of a can, and smells great!.  I did three passes:  down, ear to nose, and up against the grain.  I didn&#x27;t get one nick on my face!  I&#x27;m a medium thickness beard kind of guy, and this shaving soap was perfect for me.  I have ordered and will be trying the Men&#x27;s Soap Company Shaving Soap next to get some different varieties in.  The stand is straight forward, and I have noticed some badger hairs coming off the brush in my first use, but the brush itself feels comfortable, and I appreciate the price for a starter kit for someone like myself who wasn&#x27;t sure if they would like DE Safety Razor Shaving.  The experience has been great for me, and I will be upgrading the badger brush in the future, and possible the razor/brush stand in the future.  The apothecary mug is great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I would recommend getting another small bowl to work your lather and load your brush separately.  Anything at home that you can use for this purpose will suffice, i.e. small ceramic kitchen bowl or cereal bowl should do the trick.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it, although the brush is not secured within the handle as well as it should be.</li>
    <li> Bought this in November of 2014 to try wet shaving.  I don&#x27;t wet shave much since it takes so much time, but when my beard gets thick, it&#x27;s easier than the electric.  All in all I&#x27;ve maybe used the brush from this set about a dozen times.  Today I went to use it, and the brush just dropped out of the handle.  No resistance no nothing.  It was like it gave up.  Can&#x27;t seem to get it to sit back in there right, pretty useless now.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this set.  Spend a little extra more and buy a better quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m at it, supposedly the hair is better quality according to Van Der Hagen, but since the first shave, I noticed the hairs were coming out of the brush even though I wasn&#x27;t pushing that hard on it when lathering up.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift, yet to be given. Product seems to be what is described. Happy so far with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Alright so I will cut straight to the point with my review. I love this, I did some research into DE (Double edged) shaving and in the process I looked into using brush and soaps for lather. I admit, at first I was really confused on how to do this, didn&#x27;t wash the brush and then added to much water when making my lather so it was all bubbly. It was not a pretty sight, but after more researched (also washing my brush) I found using this set to be quiet enjoyable, I like having a spot on the stand for my razor and it holds my brush pretty nicely. The soap, the soap is great. It has a great smell to it and once I learned what I was doing found it works pretty nicely too. The mug is what it is, its a mug. It looks good and gives me a spot to make my lather. The brush is not bad, for the total price of the kit I find the brush pretty nice. While I am sure I can get better out there for just starting out I think it does the job. I noticed at first it did shed a little and very rarly now I will see a single hair but so far its held up fine.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but it looks pretty sitting on the shelf. I could send you a picture to prove it.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my husband. He likes it overall but the stand for the brush was broken when he opened it. The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to be the best quality. I expect to replace it soon because I think the bristles will fall out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review with saying that I&#x27;m a huge fan of \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving with the DE razors brush and cream.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from electric, Mach 3 - fusion, cheap disposables just about everything and nothing has given me a closer more comfortable shave than a DE with a good quality blade, brush, and cream.  The quality of this set is \\&quot;serviceable\\&quot;  and nothing beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews that say this is great for beginners but in my opinion a cheap set is the last thing a beginner should be getting that&#x27;s a great way to end up back spending big $ on fusion cartridges or hacking your face up.  If you&#x27;re thinking about making the switch spend your $30 on a tub of Taylor of old bond street cream (one tub will last over 6 months if used properly and doesn&#x27;t require a bowl) and a decent brush (tweezerman has a decent $10 brush)</li>
    <li> Includes a stand, nice shave cup, and decent brush.  I like the brush a lot, but I have used it for more than two months now and it still loses strands for the hog hair each time I use it.  That is kind of annoying, but there is no other combination set like this out there unless you want to couple it with a razor.  If you buy this set, you have the liberty of picking your own razor.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I was wanted to experiment with double-edge shaving. This set helped me decide to invest in better quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush- terrible quality. Bristles come out every use which is annoying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap- average quality. I invested in proraso shaving soap and have enjoyed it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cup - good quality, but requires a soap bar as its a deep cup if you don&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> If you are starting the plunge into wet shaving this is a wonderful starter kit. For what it is, it is good quality and the shaving soap has a masculine and pleasent sent. The brush will need to be washed a few times to get the animal smell out but after a week it will be gone. This is due to the fact it is made from real badger hair. The brush does a good job at creating lather.</li>
    <li> I like the dish, even if the handle could be a little bigger, making it more comfortable to hold for longer applications. The brush is great. The soap smells quite nice, and seems to do a very good job. The stand sucks. Given the price for all of this though, it&#x27;s still worth buying this set; just get a different stand.</li>
    <li> The set is as advertised. The brush, however, is a little to soft and makes the shaving lather thin. It may be the soap itself, but I believe the brush needs to be a little bit more stiff. The razor holder doesn&#x27;t hold the razor firmly unless it&#x27;s put on the holder exactly properly. The razor falls off otherwise.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  I was excited to find a very reasonably priced &amp; nice-looking shaving set that contained everything but a razor ... and then we opened it.  There was no stand in the box.  I took all all the pieces out &amp; apart several times, thinking I&#x27;d missed the clear plastic piece -- the box is clearly printed as containing a stand. I&#x27;m not sure where one would even fit!  The other components were tightly packed in styrofoam pieces, and there wasn&#x27;t even an empty spot where a stand should&#x27;ve been.  I&#x27;m surpised to see recent reviews that mention the stand because I really can&#x27;t see where it would even fit in the box.  Without a way to properly dry the brush, the set has yet to be used. Missing a piece of the set was quite a disappointment, especially as a gift.  Since I can&#x27;t see where a stand would fit, I&#x27;m hesitant to try to return it for another &amp; it&#x27;s quite a bit of hassle for a small plastic piece.  The pieces we did recieve were pleasing &amp; I would&#x27;ve rated this 5 stars if I&#x27;d gotten all the items I should have.</li>
    <li> soap dries out quickly on the face.  badger brush hair is falling out.  not sure if this is normal.  it smells good though.</li>
    <li> I tried going to brush shaving a couple of years ago. To start out with, I bought a Burma-Shave synthetic brush and Williams shaving soap from Walmart and was underwhelmed. I could get lather, but only after a long time, and not the quality of lather I wanted either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a double edge handle and blades here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B003YJ70NY Feather Double-Edge Razor by Jatai comes with 2 Hi-Stainless Blades]]) and decided I&#x27;d have to get something better, preferably a badger brush. I&#x27;ve seen that green set going around Rite-Aid and Amazon, but reviews on YouTube have given it a mediocre rating at best. This set has gotten better reviews so I though I could give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the brush is very well made for what it is. It has a metal ferrule and no smell (they probably treat it or wash it prior to packing, good move). There was no loss of hairs and it held the water very well. Lathering was no problem, if anything, it made too much. The soap is nice, not overly fragrant, the cup is beautiful and the lexan razor/brush stand helps in keeping you organized. On this one, you&#x27;re paying for the brush and get the other stuff thrown in as a bonus. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> These items arrived before the time and I am very please with them. I learned to shave using a shaving cup and soap. I went back to them because of the cost of always buying shaving soap and blades.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these items. But be ready to relearn how to shave again.</li>
    <li> OK so it&#x27;s not that powerful, but I do feel manly after shaving with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap suds up very well with my badger hair brush, but does not leave a film on my face when done.  It has a great scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering.  This set was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone. The only value you&#x27;ll get from this is the bowl and soap. The brush broke (gentle use) within the first two weeks, and the stand is plastic. Buy the bowl and soap separately and save your money for something better.</li>
    <li> I like this set. The soap and mug are very nice, and the badger brush works well too. My main concern is that the hair on the brush are coming out more and more. I feel like it&#x27;s probably time to buy a higher quality brush. I would still recommend getting this set if your not sure if you want to shave with a brush and soap (or shave cream). It&#x27;s a good set to find out if you like it before you spend too much on something else.</li>
    <li> Lets start with the best part of this set, the soap mug. It is a nice peice, with a good weight, comfy handle and a handsome appearance. The soap that goes in the mug is nice as well. It has a pleasant aroma and can be made to produce a decent lather. The brush is where this set isn&#x27;t that great. The brissles refuse to stop falling out, and it only does a mediocre job of lathering. It&#x27;s decent for a first brush and lets you get use to that badger funk. The stand is cheap looking and is really more of an added bonus than it is a focus peice. It does let the brush dry correctly though so I can&#x27;t fault it much. All in all for the money its a nice set and will get you on your way to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father and he is very pleased with the shave set! The Brush bristles are very soft and the soap works well!</li>
    <li> Ordered this as part of a homemade gift set for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. The brush is really nice, even softer than ones we looked at together in a fancy upscale shaving store. The bowl is the perfect size for lathering in, or storing the soap. The handle also helps hold it steady for lathering. The soap does not irritate his somewhat sensitive skin, now does it dry his skin out. The brush holder also has a slot for him to stick his safety razor in, and has held up nicely since he got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked how well though out the packaging for this product was. It was cushioned but also compact.</li>
    <li> I like that the container for the shave lather has a handle and this is a great way to shave&lt;br /&gt;the item shipped fast and was as described</li>
    <li> The mug is great. The brush is ok. And the soap is well, I guess some people might like it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the mug. It looks nice on the counter, and it&#x27;s easy enough to work with.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has its moments, but my brush loses at least one bristle every time I use it to lather and apply. It&#x27;s pretty nice going on, until you have a badger bristle stuck to your face.&lt;br /&gt;The soap works well enough, but I was expecting something that smelled a little more manly, like a cologne at best, or at least like a can of shave foam. Negative. It&#x27;s more sweaty flowers than old spice. The good news is soap is available at some grocery stores.&lt;br /&gt;So you&#x27;re probably not going to be blown away, but you&#x27;ll be satisfied if you snag this on your way to transforming shaving from a daily chore to a relaxing ritual.&lt;br /&gt;And lastly,my tip for getting a good lather: patience. If its your first time you&#x27;re going to go at that soap for a minute or two and think you&#x27;re done, but all you&#x27;re going to have is a watery mess. Keep going my good man! You&#x27;ll be able to turn that soap into a rich foam - like a modern day alchemist - with just a little more effort and time</li>
    <li> The badger brush is good quality and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with hairs shedding. Soap and mug are just ok. I get a lot more lather using a more conventional shaped bowl. The clear stand works well and has a spot to hang you razor in the back.</li>
    <li> I liked the shave set, but, there were a lot of loose hairs in the brush, everything else was good.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT starter shave set.  I have extremely sensitive skin but very light hair growth and have always struggled getting a quality shave.  I&#x27;ve tried every fancy razor, disposable and after spending loads of money decided to give wet shaving with a double edged razor a try.  Not wanting to waste a lot of money I scoured the internet for what would be the best value and quality for a beginner.  I settled on this set as it came with everything I wanted (mug, stand, brush and soap) and a Weishi razor (also from here on Amazon).  So for $35 I got started.  I LOVE IT!  The mug is perfectly shaped for the soap pucks.  The soap lathers easily once you get the hang of it.  Less water at first gives a better lather, as does lathering in a separate bowl.  I use this mug only to hold the puck and load the brush.  I actually love the soap so much that I buy it from a local store and use it as my shower bar as well.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell but it is GREAT!  The brush is soft and had little smell when I got it.  My only complaint is it has shed a few hairs but that&#x27;s about it.  The stand holds the brush well and has a cut out for a razor as well, though the razors I have don&#x27;t want to set too well and can easily be knocked out so I use a different stand for the razor.  I am 100% satisfied in this purchase and got everything I wanted and they were quality items.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy if you&#x27;re a beginner.  This along with a decent razor and blades will give you the confidence to wet shave!  Can&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
    <li> I used to hate shaving, but now it&#x27;s a least more fun and different.</li>
    <li> Only downside it that the brush is constantly shedding. Otherwise I would have given a 5.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get started in double edge, or safety razor,  minds the razor. I&#x27;d recommend this set to those starting to shave with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> it enables the user to apply other shaving products aside from the soap.it [the bowl that holds the shaving soap]could also be used for shaving gel or foam.</li>
    <li> This was my starting shave set and it works as advertised.  Doing further research the stand for the brush is unneeded and because it is light plastic a little awkward to use.  Brush, Bowl, and Soap are all excellent starter pieces</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razor shaving and I purchased this set to use with a new Merkur 33C safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially looking the set over when it arrived I noticed that with the exception of the shaving soap, the rest of the set is made in China. Here are my thoughts on the rest of the set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Mug - Good heavy duty shaving mug. Quality seems to be decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush/Razor Stand - Kind of cheap feeling acrylic or plastic of some sort. It is nice to have the stand to allow the brush to dry in an inverted position and to have a place to store your razor. However the razor slot doesn&#x27;t exactly hold the razor securely. It sits in there ok, but it isn&#x27;t the most secure. Just don&#x27;t bump it or your razor might fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush - Molded plastic handle with logo. Feels ok in your hand. Would probably be nice if it were a little heavier weight. I have been shaving with it for a few weeks and have had some bristle loss. About 8-10 the first time I used it and I lose a few every time I use it. Not really a big deal in my opinion. The bristles are quite soft, but I only have a cheap boar brush to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap - Soap seems ok and has a nice scent. Not sure if it is my technique or my hard water at home, but I never seem to be able to work up enough quality lather. I leave the soap in the plastic container, load the brush tips for a minute and work into a lather in the shave mug. I always seem to need to go back to reload the brush at least a second or third time. Otherwise the lather is too thin and disappears half way through the shave (on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I think it is a good set. Buying a cheap mug, brush/razor stand, brush and soap idividually would cost way more than the $32 that I paid for this set. I think it is a good starting point to get into safety razor shaving. Try it out and then purchase better quality things when you figure out exactly what you want.</li>
    <li> The mug is the best part of this set. The brush is just ok it is a little stiff handle i good. The stand is cheap but it works for now. The soap smells ok but not the best. And it is hard to get a great lather from it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas as I have begun to delve into straight-razor shaving. I think overall I would get this again as a pack. However, I noticed the lather was very, very difficult to work up. I ended up purchasing a separate lather that I am very happy with and is much easier to use and am keeping the lather they gave as back-up in case I can&#x27;t get some more lather for a period when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and to just start out, I think it is a great little pack. Everything is decent quality, and even if you use a cartridge razor, I would very much recommend using a brush and lather for your shave. The only thing I caution is that you may need to get some added lather, but of course that is your choice.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband he loves it and left skin nice and soft!! Works great would recommend to anyone looking for some</li>
    <li> I got this set as a gift for my boyfriend. It looks great, just like the day I bought it (over 6 months ago). It looks sophisticated, even nicer than the popular chrome one that I almost bought (which I think would have been a little too fancy/prissy looking for my boyfriend) and its also significantly cheaper than the chrome (and the reviews for the chrome made it seem like it wouldnt wear well.)</li>
    <li> my hubby loves this shave soap set, the soap last three times as longer than canned shave cream, and is much better on sensitive skin, it has a badger hair brush which holds lather and water much better than others, and comes with a beautiful porcilin soap bowl, and razor/brush stand.</li>
    <li> Performs great. No issues with the brush like some have said, I have used this for almost year and really like it.</li>
    <li> Work great awesome close shave</li>
    <li> I got this as a Valentine&#x27;s gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!!  The nice thing with going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; with the shaving kit is the simple fact that shaving soap last so much longer than shaving cream in a can.  Not only that, but in my opinion, I think there is something kind of &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; watching my guy shave old school style.  I purchased a straight edge Merkur razor separately as one does not come with this shave set and is a nice addition to the kit.</li>
    <li> I was going to get a cheaper brand of a kit like this and I am glad I did not. This soap smells like the best soap I have ever smelled before. It is great. The bowl is plenty large enough. The brush is superb. The stand needs a little work, but it does fine. For the value of this thing, you are getting a great deal. I have just switched to double edge and ditched the name brand ones that cost just as much as this kit for the blades. Do yourself a favor and grab this today.</li>
    <li> broke the plastic brush hanger but everything else works ok</li>
    <li> I use this set most mornings as I shave my face and scalp.  The soap lathers adequately but not as thick as some other soaps.  Yet. it still works well.  I would continue using it as it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> The whole kit is very good; the soap is a thick hypo allergenic lather, and does a superb job of softening the beard and lubricating the face.  I liked it so much, I gave a set to my son as a &amp;#34;non occasion&amp;#34; gift.</li>
    <li> I picked this kit up at the local Walgreens due to the local availability and the price. I looked it over really good in the store (removed from box / packaging) and I have to say their soap is excellent and smells great, and I really liked the mug. Their mug is very similar to the Edwin Jagger (Probably made by the same company in China, wouldn&#x27;t be that far fetched). So for less than the mug sells for by itself online, you get a keg of soap and a brush. The stand is ok that comes with it, nothing special just a clear piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con for the set is that the brush is not the greatest, kind of cheaply made brush. There are brushes out there that are nicer in the same price range. But that really didn&#x27;t bother me because I figured that I bought the kit just for the mug and the rest was a bonus. Having this cheap brush has convinced me I want a good badger brush, really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their soap, my skin is no longer irritated by shaving, and it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Instead of using the recommended safety razor I used another brand&#x27;s strait razor. Im new to these types of razors and this is my first kit and here is what I can tell you after three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Shave One) Took me forever because I was being super cautious. Nicked my cheek once but nothing that didn&#x27;t close up in a couple of minutes. But the lather felt/smelled nice and the kit makes any sink set up look classier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Shave Two) Before lathering I pre-washed my face with a moisturizing face wash first. It went far smoother and no cuts but there was about a dozen brush hairs in the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Shave Three) was fast and easy with all the benefits of shave two but I found my self constantly picking brush hairs out of the strait razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can say that I do not regret this buy but due to the deteriorating state of the brush I will have to go with a higher quality product later on down the road. But this is great for first time users such as myself.</li>
    <li> Love this shave set. The cup fits perfectly in my hand while I lather up. The stand is perfect and I love the brush also.</li>
    <li> My aunt bought this set for me. I am relatively new to this style shaving, and I love it. The brush is nice, the bowl is heavy, and the soap smells great. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> and broke at the base .... too light weight for normal use... but other than that,,, the soap, mug and brush are good quality and just plan on throwing the stand away</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice set, especially the bowl, which is really what I wanted.  The brush is decent, but not top drawer, and the ultra cool polymer (plastic) brush stand is not really going to fit in with the rest of my stuff.  Soap?  Not worth writing about.  Just like any soap that comes in a set like this, it&#x27;s probably best to save only as a backup.  It&#x27;s an ok deal, but I think I probably overpaid a little for what I actually received.  YMMV, but I really thought it would be a little higher quality for being more than $50 for this little set.</li>
    <li> Great combo for the money.  The badger brush is better than I expected, the soap is pleasant and the mug is balanced well.</li>
    <li> If you have realized how much better it feels to shave using the classic methods then this something you&#x27;ll love. The mug is perfect, the handle is easy to grasp and it makes lathering up a breeze. And the brush is great as well. The badger hair helps create a very nice lather and feels great on your face. The soap in my opinion is just okay. I don&#x27;t really care much for the scent  (I&#x27;m more of a bay rum sort of guy) but it seems like it gets a decent lather and that is what it&#x27;s made to do. Overall I&#x27;m really glad I got this set. I love it and it looks great.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this. The first set did not come with the brush, so I contacted amazon and had a hassle-free exchange. This plus his new razor has him swearing off cartridges.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend- good starter kit with simple but hood looking plastic stand for brush and razor. Only complaint is that the brush sheds just a but which is alright considering the price</li>
    <li> I like this set, its worked perfectly for me over the last few months. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant amount of hairs falling off the brush, it&#x27;ll last me as long as I want to use it.  Update: 10/2015 - Brush is still in great shape with daily usage. Highly recommend this product for beginners.</li>
    <li> The kit was incomplete, it does not have the soap. I do not what happen but this situation is very disappointment</li>
    <li> meh...I should have bought a nicer kit...nothing wrong with this, but nothing great either</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift along with the matching safety razor. Its a great starter kit that isn&#x27;t too cheap or too expensive. I wasn&#x27;t sure if he would even like this kind of shave but he really loves it and the soap smells great! I like that the stand is plastic because metal in a bathroom always leads to rust.</li>
    <li> The mug is great. I love the soap too. It lathers nice with a masculine scent. The lather is rich and not too dense. Provides a decent cushion and an ok glide. The included lucite brush and razor holder is very nice. What brings the score down is the terrible badger brush included. Not good at all. I was expecting some shedding like on my tweezerman and escali beginner badger brushes but this thing sheds way too much.  I prepped it beforehand like all my badger and boar brushes but the Vander Hagen brush is terrible. It dyes the water when I soak it and it dries way too fast when I attempt a face lather. Badger brush claim to fame is the water and heat retention. This brush does none of those things. Not made for soap shaving. Cream only on this thing. I gave it 6 attempts. For break in. But it only gets worse. The only redeeming quality on the brush is the nice shiny black handle and the Van Der Hagen logo. This brush alone can put off beginner DE safety razor folks. I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I ordered another set to see if it was just some random QC issue with the brush. It&#x27;s a great price for the set. So I will give it another  chance.</li>
    <li> Wish I read these reviews before purchasing. Like everyone else has said the brush hairs fell apart the moment I used it. Plus the hairs themselves are so long the brush is unusable as they splay out and actually end up going up your nose. Even the logo on the brush handle was coming off when I opened the box. The bowl and soap is nice and smells great but the brush is just rubbish. Sending back. My advice is do not purchase this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set for the money. The value of the mug and soap is worth the price. I like the Van der Hagen shave soap better than any I have used. The design of the apothecary mug makes working your lather a breeze. The brush is OK. I used it for quite a while with no complaints. A nicer, high end badger brush is better, but this brush performs very well. The plastic brush/razor stand can be tossed in the trash; otherwise, this set is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Bristles came out of handle after a couple of uses. Couldn&#x27;t glue back in.  Will keep dish but going to buy a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> The shave set is nice, the rack is cheaply made and that is my one and only thing i could find to be wrong. The shave soap itself isnt too bad it doesnt smell the best or anything but it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
    <li> The soap smells good and hubby likes the shave he gets with it. I think price compared to shaving cream this is better, but after we received this we found it a few other places for about half the listed price. Nice sturdy bowl, don&#x27;t think it would break if dropped. The boar brush is very soft and lathers smoothly.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my son. He loves it</li>
    <li> First time wet shaving. Pleasant aroma, brush shed a little, stand accommodates my razor(does not come with a razor!)and the brush well. Bought it for the brush, stand, and mug. Soap works very nicely, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> ITS VERY GOOD MY FACE SEAMS TO BE VERY SOLF AFTER A WEAK OR SO. IT BEATS THE SOAP IN A CAN BY A LONG SHOT</li>
    <li> Nice Kit. Shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Great starter set.  The ceramic cup is easy to hold and retains heat nicely.  I use it to whip up a thick lather.  The brush lost very little hair during break in.  The shaving cream smell nice and provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> The stand is not very good.  The plastic holes does not hold my razor very well.</li>
    <li> The only reason i gave this package a 2 star rating is because if the mug and soap werent as good as they turned out to be, this would be a no star and definitly not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;the brush loses its bristles very easily all the time.</li>
    <li> I love to surprise my husband with gifts throughout the year and this was probably the most popular.  He was so appreciative of this product and has commented many times on how glad he is to have it and has used it everyday since he got it.  The best thing about it for me was the price....very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Cup is nice an sturdy and the soap works great for a smooth shave. My biggest complaint and The main cost that you are paying for is the brush. It is cheap and the thing has been falling apart after only half a dozen shaves. My recommendation is to look else where.</li>
    <li> Great price on sale&lt;br /&gt;Good soap&lt;br /&gt;Awesome mug&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stand&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is the brush. Very cheaply made. No matter how many times you use it hairs will fall out and its very hard to get rid of the smell. It is real badger though. I figured the brush would be garbage and really bought it for the other 3 items which on sale is a great price for soap, stand and mug of this quality</li>
    <li> Set for the money was a great deal. The brush is not bad although if doesn&#x27;t hag great on the brush hanger, the soap is not bad, lathers rather good. The cup with handle makes it easier to use. Overall a good deal</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving kit and overall I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I received it roughly a year ago and haven&#x27;t had any major issues.  The badger hair brush feels great on the skin, though a number of hairs have fallen out and are visible in the lather.  Again, nothing major but I felt it was worth mentioning. The stand, although useful, is also quite bland.  It&#x27;s simply a clear plastic stand with notches for the razor and brush.  I know a stand doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy, but something slightly more elegant would&#x27;ve been more than welcome, such as this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K04Q13Q?psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I love it, and the issues I listed above are very minor and don&#x27;t affect my overall experience or enjoyment while using it.</li>
    <li> The brush and soap dish are nice. The stand is very cheaply made</li>
    <li> The bristle part of the brush separated from the handle as soon as I opened the box.  They used a poor quality glue that dried up and didn&#x27;t fill the gap between bristle and handle.  Since I only bought this as an intro to blade shaving, I will just use the bristle without the handle a few times and then upgrade to something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the soap smells nice, it&#x27;s a strong scent and it would be better if the cup came with a lid.  The scent will fill up your bathroom and more - I like smelling it while shaving but I don&#x27;t want to smell it all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> With the price of shaving cream, I wish I would have bought this years ago. Awesome lather and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Wanted to upgrade my hubby&#x27;s shaving brush and this set was perfect! The acrylic holder keeps the sink area neat. Since he chipped his last suds cup the mug was a necessity. The soap smells great. He likes it alot. Good price, great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good starter set especially for the price.  The plastic stand looks cheap but does the trick.  The brush has held up so far with only a few of the bristles coming out.  It feels soft and gives a good lather.  The soap the comes with the package isn&#x27;t all that great but does the job.</li>
    <li> Great starter set, does the job well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue</li>
    <li> I bought this set in order to shave my head as I need to use an electric trimmer to shave my beard or else I turn into one giant shaving bump. I do however use the shave soap as an after shave (just lather it up and apply as usual).&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t in your face aftershave and does make my head and face feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;The cup/bowl is heavy enough to break a toe if it fall on your foot. For the folks saying it&#x27;s hard to hold, your thumb hooks over the knob and the bottom rest on your fingers and about half of your palm.&lt;br /&gt;And now, the brush. A couple shaves in, it stopped shedding. And a few shaves after that clumps started coming out. Tonight, after a half dozen shaves, fully half of the bristles came out the middle of the brush. It was nice while it lasted but I would suggest an upgrade.</li>
    <li> The product is pretty solid for a beginner&#x27;s shave set. However, I found the exact same set at Target for $19.99. Also, the brush in this set is not quite as good as some others that you can get individually on here.</li>
    <li> This is an OK way to start wet shaving if you have no idea what you are doing. It&#x27;s not the best kit and you can get a lot better stuff for around the same price. The cup is good and the stand is OK. I really hate the brush out of this kit though. It&#x27;s very scratchy and sheds hairs. I would change out the brush ASAP.    If you want a cheap brush, I recommend you replace the brush with something else like:  Omega Shaving Brush #10048 (chrome) or #10049 (black)  Very large boar brush with a huge knot, 28mm knot. Unclipped and will get softer with time.    Omega Shaving Brush #20102  Large boar brush with a 27mm knot. Unclipped and will get softer with time. Very comfortable handle.    Omega Shaving Brush #10065 (many colors to choose from) or #10066 (faux ivory)  Medium size boar brush, 24mm knot. Unclipped hairs that get softer with time.    Omega S-Brush #S10065 (many colors to choose from) or #S10019 (black and clear)  Medium size synthetic brush, 24mm knot. Not made from animal hair and thus very low maintenance. No break in required. Good firm feel but still very soft tips.    Vie-Long #12705  Medium size horse hair brush, 23mm knot. Horse hair is fairly soft. No break in required.    Semogue #1470 (wood handle) or #1460 (painted wood handle)  Small size boar brush, 21mm knot. Nice feel of the wood handle. The hairs are also unclipped and will get softer with time.    Notice I didn&#x27;t recommend any badger brushes? This is because there are virtually no good badger brushes in the $10-$20 price range. Good badger brushes start at around $30. Most good cheap brushes will be bore hair, horse hair, or synthetic.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a pretty good deal. I&#x27;m happy with the overall value and it&#x27;s got me shaving but there are some good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic holder is a non-issue. It&#x27;s actually quite nicely shaped and works as designed with no tip over or fall over issues. Being clear it will fit any environment it&#x27;s in. The apothecary mug seems pretty well made and I&#x27;ve been using it without issues thus far. The soap seems decent but I&#x27;m just starting so I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad and the ugly.&lt;br /&gt;The brush, oh the brush. It looks great but it&#x27;s shedding big time. I followed guidelines on badge and badger for initial prep of the brush and went to use it. It works just fine to spread the cream, soap or gel but leaves behind strands. I&#x27;ve tried the proper cleaning as well and still no luck. No matter what I do the brush keeps shedding so I&#x27;ll end up buying another brush from a different brand. Too bad because it looks real nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after deciding to try a more economical way of shaving than the Mach 5-blade cartridges. I really enjoyed using this product for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush felt nice against my skin. It wasn&#x27;t hard or too flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;2. The soap smelled really nice. I didn&#x27;t get a great lather out of it. But like I said..this was my first time, and I probably just used too much water.&lt;br /&gt;3. Finally, I am very pleased with the overall look and quality of the set. It looks nice and organized with the stand. The mug is nice and heavy with a glossy black finish to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product serves its purpose perfectly well. I definitely recommend this inexpensive set for those looking to try wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this set about 6 months ago, and it is perfect. I recommend to any beginner or as a gift.</li>
    <li> it is nicer than I expected and plan to continue purchasing .</li>
    <li> purchased as a christmas gift. item was as described, price was not bad, and was liked.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the hairs from the brush keep coming loose and getting in the mug, every after many uses.</li>
    <li> I bought the Van Der Hagen shave set a month ago, with the rest of my shaving essentials, and it&#x27;s clear that this shave set is an essential. It comes with a badger brush and stand with a place for your razor(only big enough for one razor though), a bowl with handle and a block of shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: extremely cost effective, nothing else will be this cheap but still do the job. The soap smells amazing. The bowl looks dope as hell, the Van Der Hagen logo on the side makes it look legit. The stand hasn&#x27;t fallen over yet, and I doubt it will at any point soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the brush sheds quite a bit more than I would like. The stand is just clear plastic, and stands out from the rest of the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you are new at wet shaving, this set will serve it&#x27;s purpose, at a low cost, for 9-12 months. After a year I would suggest getting a new brush and obviously more soap, and depending on how much you care, a new stand at some point would be nice.</li>
    <li> The price for this set is excellent, considering all the goodies you get. The soap is very good and so are the mug and stand.  The brush however is of inferior quality.  I have owned this for about a year and the brush keeps shedding bristles non-stop.  It has gotten so bad recently that it interferes with the shaving process as the bristles get in the way of the razor sliding.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son-in-law and wanted another for myself.  It is not an inexpensive set but it is well made and looks solid.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving set for a beginner like myself. I was actually amazed of how well of a set it was for a beginner. Great price and even came with a badger brush instead of a boar brush like most do. A must get set! Super fast shipping also!!</li>
    <li> Good deal and nice quality. Major problem is that the bagder brush stinks. I mean it, it smells like they collected the hair off of the badgers ass. It smells like urine and wet dog. Shampooing it several time and it has gotten a little better.</li>
    <li> Overall very nice. Soap makes a good lather and fits in the provided cup very well (although microwaving for 15 seconds will make it seamless). Cup is good quality (for being made in china) and the handle is sturdy. The Brush is where this kit really shines, soft and well made, creates a fine and rich lather. The stand is good, clear quality plastic that will fit in with pretty much any decor.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like adding the time neccessary for lathering the soap but, the shave is worth it and the process takes maybe 30 seconds.  The brush sheds. I have used it 12-20 times and it is still losing hair.  I use a single blade disposable and get a great shave.  I have fine whiskers not heavy.  6-5-13  The brushed stopped shedding. I use canned soap only when traveling and miss this system when I do. Infact, I purchased a premium razor that accepts three blade cartridges. I do believe both have spoiled me.  I really do recommend it.  2-13-15 still no shedding and the brush works well</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This set is beautiful! The stand, the brush, and the mug that came with it was all packaged nicely and securely in the box. The soap that came with it smells nice and the mug feels really good in your hand, it has some weight to it and looks amazing. The brush is badger hair which I heard was a must have for shaving. Overall great set, totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great, quality set. Works well for my needs, but the badger hair brush &#x27;sheds&#x27; a bit more than I would like. Otherwise a great quality overall.</li>
    <li> This stuff lathers up really good and fast. Feels really nice on the face. The brush is losing some bristles but I would expect that from any brush. Its not falling apart or losing so many where I cannot use it but some are coming off.</li>
    <li> My husband had never used a straight edge razor so we needed to buy everything.  I really love the smell of the soap that comes with this set, and the brush has yet to fall apart so that&#x27;s always a good thing!  I wish he had a way to store his razor in the stand since I believe this is made for a safety razor, but that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s problem but ours :)</li>
    <li> Overall I did enjoy this set. The bowl and stand where the two main reasons I purchased this set since it was difficult to find a stand that held both the brush and razor. Any stand I found was $15-$20 for the stand alone. An additional $12 for the bowl, brush and soap made this the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is with the brush quality. Not with the quality of the badger hair since that seems to be of a high quality, but, with the glue used to hold the hair into the handle. The brush hair and handle glue contact area is very small and after a little more than 3 months of use the brush handle and the brush hair came apart. I now no longer have a brush that I can use but I will be looking into the Tweezerman as a replacement soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want a cheap entry level set, buy this, but be prepared to buy a new brush soon.</li>
    <li> First I had hair on my face, but now I do not! Far superior to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Just recently switched to shaving with a d.e. safety razor. While looking for the necessary supplies I came across this set. In deciding between buying everything separately for up to two or three times more than the cost of this, it was simply a no-brainer. While the quality of the brush itself is not necessarily on par with other badger brushes, it still gets the job done. Love this set.</li>
    <li> Pretty good bang for the buck here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap produces a slick creamy lather and has a pleasant aroma. It&#x27;s very lightly scented which I appreciate. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavily perfumed products, I don&#x27;t enjoy smelling like the urinal in a Portuguese cat-house so the soap is a winner for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is high quality. It holds the soap puck perfectly and it looks really nice on the bathroom counter. It&#x27;s sturdy and heavy duty but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to hold while loading the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is clear acrylic. Not top shelf but you&#x27;re not paying for top shelf with this package. It&#x27;s sturdy enough that it won&#x27;t tip over and it&#x27;s clear so it doesn&#x27;t stand out, it just does it&#x27;s job. I could see upgrading to a nicer stand in the future but for now this one is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback of this kit is the brush. It&#x27;s not all that bad, it just sheds a lot. I don&#x27;t have a problem working up a decent lather with it and it feels good enough on my face but it&#x27;s kind of a pain picking little badger hairs out of the soap puck to keep the aforementioned good counter looks up to snuff. Of all the things in this kit the brush is the first thing I&#x27;m going to replace. I&#x27;m not in a huge rush though, it works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this kit to people getting into the wonderful world of wet shaving but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re set for life with this stuff. After getting the basics down you&#x27;ll start longing for higher quality gear but don&#x27;t let that sway you from using this to get your foot in the door.</li>
    <li> he love this, and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set for myself about a year ago and have been very pleased with the quality of the brush, soap, and mug. Purchased the same set as a gift for my dad and he likes it as well. I feel that my skin is far less irritated when using this in lieu of a gel or cream.</li>
    <li> Aesthetically, I like it. The cup looks very nice, it is easy to hold (not sure what people are taking about....). The stand is a cheapy, clear acrylic-- but it doesn&#x27;t look awful and serves its purpose. The soap is nice and works. My biggest issue is the brush. Extremely low quality, the bristles fall out from the first use. Bristles all in the soap cup, on my face, and in my sink when rinsing it off. The brush ruins this set. If you already own a brush, the set does look nice and may be worth getting.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet shave kit, so I am no expert, but I know quality when I see it, and I see it here. I have used this product for over six months now, at least three times a week consistently, and I have been pleased every time, not once returning to the pressurized foam or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the plastic stand. It is strong. It works. I have dropped it on the floor numerous times, and it will not break. Its not pretty, but if thats what you want, you are barking up the wrong the tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the mug. It is hefty and sturdy. The volume is sufficient. I have never dropped this thing, but it is ceramic, so it might break. Be careful about that. If you a clutz, plastic might be the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the soap. It was nice and lasted about three months. Not bad, not bad at all, considering a can of the goop costs at least $2. I replaced it with some generic soap I found at CVS, and it was less than $1. This is the economic way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, last and most important, the brush. I love it. It is smooth and gets a good lather. It exfoliates the skin just fine. The handle does its job. Up to this point, about 50 or so hairs have fallen out. Out of the thousands that are one there, that is nothing. It feels just as full as it did the first day, and I believe it is full enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. Probably no need to spend any more on this type of product than necessary. In my opinion, one of the key points to the wet shave is economy.</li>
