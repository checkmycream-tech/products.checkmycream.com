      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Not as good it used to be...</li>
      <li>The formula does lengthen and holds a good curl for well over 10 hours, though for stubborn lashes I would still recommend curling your lashes beforehand.</li>
      <li>I would have loved it if not for the irritation it caused.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as I thought it was.</li>
      <li>and it does a superb job at smoothly taking this mascara off.  </li>
      <li>Save your money and buy a good drugstore mascara.</li>
      <li>good product</li>
      <li>Fair warning</li>
      <li>I recommend the Lash Out Butterfly from Loreal, Telescopic also Loreal or anything from Rimmel if you want good mascara.</li>
      <li>It is a fiber mascara, but the formula is so great that I honestly didn&#x27;t notice the fibers until I looked closely at the brush.</li>
      <li>This mascara does a really good job at the lengthening part.</li>
      <li>Adds good length and maintains throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It smudges under eyes by the afternoon, and requires good eye make up solution to remove.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job lengthening.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need a good eye makeup remover to take it off, but you won&#x27;t have raccoon eyes, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The shape of the brush is perfect (it is curved, so it is easier to apply to individual lashes) and the consistency of the mascara is incredible.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT !  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and i can&#x27;t acheive the amazing lengths i had purchased over there.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I really liked it, it made my lashes look amazing</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>Works amazing with a thickening mascara.</li>
      <li>My lashes look amazing now.</li>
      <li>, it will not rinse off with just warm water.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have a REALLY GOOD makeup remover.</li>
      <li>The brush is nice.  </li>
      <li>I kind of wanted to disprove it because I was a hardcore Lancome snob.</li>
      <li>I have suggested it to all my friends and now they all have their own bottle of it.</li>
      <li>It went on nicely</li>
      <li>No clumping &amp; it separates my lashes nicely.</li>
      <li>the waterproof version (in the brown bottle) is way better but make sure you get a good makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>But it is easy to apply and quite good.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very easy to remove but it also doesn&#x27;t get oily either.</li>
      <li>This mascara looks beautiful on; it really lengthened my eyelashes and made them pop.</li>
      <li>Just use a dual-phase makeup remover or some kind of cleansing oil, and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>&quot; look, one coat is fine - no clumping, lashes stay separated nicely, but they are evenly coated.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>They seem to have the time and the money to really explore some great products.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>The search for that perfect mascara has finally ended!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>But on top of that, I cannot find a mainstream mascara that won&#x27;t smudge underneath my eyes, waterproof or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I receive most of my beauty updates and tips from my college students.</li>
      <li>I still have one more bottle to go through.</li>
      <li>but i imagine a cotton ball saturated with eye makeup remover would probably do a better job.</li>
      <li>And when it does, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>, this mascara make them stand out for sure.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Ok so, I am a make up artist</li>
      <li>so well I am able to wash my face before bed and sleep with it on.</li>
      <li>It had great reviews, so I had high hopes for it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this mascara is pretty good at not clumping your lashes together.</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>but once it dries out, it&#x27;s makes my lashes look awesome, long, separated and curled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even forgotten to remove my makeup before taking a nap, and woke up to find my eyelashes still looked like it was freshly applied!!</li>
      <li>It even made my eyelashes fall off more easily.</li>
      <li>Love the smooth consistency.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Adds good length and maintains throughout the day. It&#x27;s a bit tough to remove at the end of the day, but they actually sell a remover for the mascara as well which should make that much less of an issue.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The shape of the brush is perfect (it is curved, so it is easier to apply to individual lashes) and the consistency of the mascara is incredible. I have found that when I curl my lashes and apply this mascara, it stays put for 12+ hours. The only downside is that it is very hard to get off. I just soak a cotton ball in argan oil and apply it to my lashes for 20-30 seconds. It almost completely wipes off after that.</li>
    <li> This requires waterproof eye make up remover to remove. It&#x27;s definitely waterproof, which I love. Waterproof formulations are the only kinds capable of holding a curl. It doesn&#x27;t dry like a curling formula might, but when it&#x27;s waterproof, and in combination with the brush, it works very well. Works amazing with a thickening mascara. It&#x27;s definitely lengthening more than volumizing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years and it has always been such a hassle trying to scavenge through a local Japanese market to online retailers to locate this item. I was so thrilled to finally see this product on Amazon. I had to do a double take because of the new packaging (from old burgundy bottle), but looked like the same item to me so I took the plunge. When I tried this product upon receipt, it felt a little &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; - maybe it&#x27;s the new formula but it seemed like it was less lengthening than before. Still, this is the only mascara out in the market that does not weigh down on my naturally short and downwardly grown lashes. Recommended for people with similar issue as my lashes.</li>
    <li> When they say this stuff lasts....they mean it! I actually had a hard time getting it off which kind of irritated my eyes. Not bad...I&#x27;m just sensitive I guess.</li>
    <li> This mascara make your eye lash looks very good. Black color not come out while you are using very strong water proof. But I need to use eye remover to take off. It is not easy to come off.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara a lot. It lengthens, thickens, goes on well and looks glossy black. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t come off with normal eye makeup remover. I spend at least 15 minutes massaging with warm oil, rinsing and repeating and I will still have residue.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it dries so quickly. After a week, I can no longer use it... But it is easy to apply and quite good. I think I will try this brand again.</li>
    <li> love how long and defined my lashes look with this! I have issues with EVERY kind of waterproof/smudgeproof mascara that I&#x27;ve tried (which is about 30 kinds - from cheap to expensive), and this one lasts all day with only slight smudging at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used. It is dark and stays for a long time. It isn&#x27;t very easy to remove but it also doesn&#x27;t get oily either. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I scoured through reviews for this product on both Reddit and makeupalley.com and decided to purchase. When I first used it my boyfriend at the time (whose only other comments about my makeup were how long I took to put it on) said that my lashes looked super long. I put it on in thin layers and have had no issues with clumping or flaking off onto my face. The product is a bit more difficult to remove than regular mascara, but I just use oil to remove it. I read in other reviews that others have had to scrub to get the product off and lost lashes in the process, but it seriously doesn&#x27;t need to be that difficult. Buy some baby oil, or if you use the oil cleansing method, use that. I sometimes layer this on top of my Tarte mascara and it looks like I have fake lashes on. Really great stuff! I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply but hard to take off...won&#x27;t get off even after swimming...</li>
    <li> This mascara is very dark and has excellent staying power. So much so that I can never wash it all off. I use cold cream to get most of it off, but I can never seem to get it all off right away. That being said, is applies very nicely with the wand and looks great on.</li>
    <li> The best mascara EVER. I have tried them all from Dior all the way to drugstore and this mascara leaves long separated lashes. It is resistant to water so be prepared to use excessive oil remover.</li>
    <li> Trying out this mascara as my previous brand is no longer available. So far it&#x27;s working great and really stays on!&lt;br /&gt;I can see that my lashes are longer and it gives it a slight curl. Definitely covers nicely without clumping and if there are any as long as it&#x27;s still wet you can sweep them out. Barely need two coats. I do need to use waterproof eye makeup remover to get it off though, it will not rinse off with just warm water.</li>
    <li> I used my friend Miss me Mascara one time and I felt it much better than my former Mascara! So I bought it immediately. Love it!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much even though it broke my heart to tiny bit sized pieces. My eyes have some sort of allergy to it. Whenever I wore it, it made my eyes feel dry, look glassy, red, and all puffy. It even made my eyelashes fall off more easily. I wouldn&#x27;t want this to happen to anyone else so be aware guys! Look at the ingredients and take care of your eyes :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I could see this mascara being amazing for people who&#x27;s lashes have a hard time holding a curl. Mine don&#x27;t. And this mascara gave me almost too curled lashes. Which was kind of strange. It is also very waterproof. So no smudging. But it was also impossible to take off and I lost a couple of eye lashes. And I have very good mascara remover.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything crazy, like the rave reviews said it would. It actually made my eyelashes clump together even more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting mascara to apply to the eyelashes on my right eye for whatever reason. Usually not even 30 minutes after I put a product on, it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup there anymore. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mascara is completely different. It stays on ALL day--I&#x27;ve even forgotten to remove my makeup before taking a nap, and woke up to find my eyelashes still looked like it was freshly applied!! It&#x27;s fantastic, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove even with great makeup removers. Just be careful/gentle when removing so you don&#x27;t damage your eyelashes, and you&#x27;ll have no problems!</li>
    <li> An excellent product! I use it every day. It is water-proved. But a little bit hard to remove. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever irritated my eyes like this did. It is waterproof (I walked in the rain one day, and it didn&#x27;t budge) and it does hold a good curl, but sadly, an ingredient in this mascara must be the culprit. Your mileage may vary, so consider my review with a grain of salt. I would have loved it if not for the irritation it caused.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but it&#x27;s better after it&#x27;s dried out after you open it.  It&#x27;s a little too wet for me at first but once it dries out, it&#x27;s makes my lashes look awesome, long, separated and curled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into the whole &#x27;my lashes but better&#x27; look, so this mascara looked too unnatural for me.  And that&#x27;s not even because I achieved dramatic lashes; rather, it was clumpy. I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the litter fibers that comes in mascara.  While the fibers can extend the length of your eyelash, it also can look really clumpy and messy.  Also, this mascara also makes my eyes water just by holding it to my eyes.  I do not react this way to any other mascaras that I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t think my eyes are particularly sensitive.  This causes me to think there is some sort of chemical irritant that&#x27;s too strong for some people&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know which ingredient is the culprit but my eyes are sensitive to it. This is the first eye product which my eyes reacted badly to. Plus, it didn&#x27;t really work for me as well as I&#x27;d hope. The only plus point for me was that it didn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes do not hold a curl. I used to have to resort to curling (gasp!) after my mascara had dried to ensure a curl. That along with touch ups throughout the day helped me hold a sad little curl. That&#x27;s where Kiss Me Heroin Make Long and Curl came in and saved my life. I can curl before I apply mascara and the curl stays! My lashes look amazing now. The curl stays all day. I adore this mascara and will purchase again and again! The search for that perfect mascara has finally ended!</li>
    <li> Only mascara I will use! Works as well as the covergirl marathon mascara that was discontinued. This is rock solid!</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly! This mascara was a Godsend!  I had just spent $30 for another brand that was horrible and I had lost hope that something like this existed. This holds a curl like no other. My stubby lashes look so long! I&#x27;m a BIG fan now!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to take off. Does not make lashes any longer than they are. Just an everage mascara adn any other drug store mascara. Not impresses.</li>
    <li> First, it is water proof. So it is hard to remove. Second, it gives lashes long curling effect only after 2 times application without clumps.</li>
    <li> This is my new favourite mascara.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are long, dark, and don&#x27;t hold a curl. I like my mascara to enhance my natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I only wear one coat of this mascara! It gives me an excellent curl without having to use an eyelash curler. I don&#x27;t find this mascara to be clumpy even though it provides me with a bit of extra volume, which is a bonus for me! It also doesn&#x27;t stick my eyelashes together, which is something I hate; the wand allows me to comb through my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY waterproof and doesn&#x27;t flake! This is great because I always rub my eyes. The only downside is that it is very difficult for me to remove; I usually wake up with black smudges under my eyes. Also, if you accidentally get some product on your eyelids when applying, it is a headache to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;STILL, this is the only mascara I plan on using. My eyelashes look so beautiful when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I was hopping this would be another good Japanese beauty product of convenience store grade. I have a long thick eye lashes and had a high hopes of Japanese mascara will do a trick, but meh.. The curvy brush is made with these spikes that pocks your waterline and does not help to push up your eyelashes any higher. It smudges under eyes by the afternoon, and requires good eye make up solution to remove. I had to use two cotton pads front and back plus cotton swab to make sure they are completely removed. It is truly convenience store grade. With this price you may want to go with else something you find in Target and Walmart.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply but super hard to remove.</li>
    <li> My holy grail mascara. My lashes look awesome and make my eyes pop. Must buy the makeup remover because this stuff doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
    <li> I receive most of my beauty updates and tips from my college students. They seem to have the time and the money to really explore some great products. I was a bit skeptical when a student introduced me to this mascara, swearing that it never smudges. Having been on a quest for such product and seeing that he price was very affordable, i gave it a try and love it! I honestly will not be able to use other products. Because this is a waterproof product, it is definitely difficult to erase at the end of the day, but with a good makeup remover, it does come off. I haven&#x27;t had a raccoon eye ever since I&#x27;ve been introduced to this product.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, although it is a little dry.</li>
    <li> Was shopping around for a product containing rose hip oil to replace my discontinued MAC Studio X Mascara, and this seemed to fit the bill, at least according to its description.  Oh well; live and learn.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to mascara! I was initially given this as a gift a few Christmases ago, and been hooked ever since (replacing it every 6 months though, of course). What I love about this mascara is that it works really well in holding your lashes up; I have Asian lashes that are very straight and sparse, but this helps elongate and accentuate my lashes (and gets me the occasional compliment). I find that with other mascaras (even expensive brand-name ones from Sephora), they just don&#x27;t do as good a job as Kiss Me Heroine. The only con with this is taking it off is definitely more difficult since the mascara is waterproof (I use Neutrogena eye make up remover, and that does the trick). The quality and price is something you can&#x27;t beat. Definitely check it out.</li>
    <li> This mascara stays on for days. I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
    <li> This goes on very well. It only takes one application and makes the lashes very full. This saves time when you&#x27;re trying to get out the door in the morning. I have to knock it one star though because it is difficult to clean out afterward (it&#x27;s a trade-off).</li>
    <li> Terrible. It was like water and did absolutely nothing for my lashes.  Drug store brands make my lashes long and thick but I thought this would make longer. It&#x27;s a ripoff!  Throwing away!</li>
    <li> Wow. This mascara. I have the token Asian lashes that grow out downwards and require copious amounts of force and heat to keep curled for more than 30 minutes. After being let down time and time again by mascaras marketed towards people blessed with thick, curly lashes, I finally turned towards Heroine Make, which I heard was one of the bestselling Japanese mascaras around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. The formula does lengthen and holds a good curl for well over 10 hours, though for stubborn lashes I would still recommend curling your lashes beforehand. The trick lies in the way you brush the wand through your lashes, which they describe in a cute graphic on the backside of the package. The wand itself is pretty flexible, but can clump a little bit, so I would recommend wiping off the excess mascara before using it or running a mascara comb through your lashes before the formula dries. And when it does, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara doesn&#x27;t budge. It doesn&#x27;t flake. Take this to your summer pool parties, your sweaty amusement park days, a long day at work. Your eyelashes will look fresh, dark, and curly by the time you come home. (For those with sparse, flat lashes that disappear into the lashline, YOU WILL ACTUALLY HAVE LASHES. AMAZING.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Heroine Make Mascara Remover in conjunction with this product after reading cautionary (but raving) reviews about the mascara, and trust me, it will be worth your money. Don&#x27;t trust the regular waterproof makeup removers (unless maybe it&#x27;s the Shiseido eye makeup remover which also removes everything under the sun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN SUMMARY: Buy this mascara. Buy the remover. Buy the Thick and Curl version and layer them (thicken then lengthen), or layer them with any of your favorite volumizing mascaras. Either way, if you are struggling with limpy lashes, this will save you. YOU WILL REGRET NOTHING.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this mascara. I have oily eyelids and was looking for a mascara that could stay on all day long. This mascara looks beautiful on; it really lengthened my eyelashes and made them pop. However, they smudged and flaked by the end of the day, leaving me with seriously dark under-eye circles! And because of its super-strong formula, it&#x27;s hard to remove unless you use a really good eye makeup remover so I couldn&#x27;t really remove the under-eye smudges in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have an oily eyelid issue, then this mascara could work well for you.</li>
    <li> One of the best mascara I&#x27;ve used it does curl and lengthen well. Use every day. Is a bit drying. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The title is not an exaggeration. It literally does not clump like some other mascara that specifically design not to clump. It last what seems like forever! Most importantly it holds your curls exactly the same as when it is originally applied to when you take it off your lashes will still be curly after you take mascara off with makeup remover (only Lancôme facil can take this mascara off or he like). If you curl your lashes like me, only after you wash your face will the lashes go back to stick straight lol</li>
    <li> best mascara i have ever used!!! my only problem though is i&#x27;m not sure if the formula is exactly the same as the one i got in japan...it seems this has less fibers and i can&#x27;t acheive the amazing lengths i had purchased over there. still better than any other mascara product i have used anyways!</li>
    <li> My lashes are straight, grow straight down, and they are sparse. I&#x27;m not asian myself, but I have the same problem with most mascaras in that they don&#x27;t hold curl or make my skinny lashes look better without adding a lot of bulk. But on top of that, I cannot find a mainstream mascara that won&#x27;t smudge underneath my eyes, waterproof or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my sister was going to Japan, I did some research on the best Japanese mascaras, and this was recommended very highly. It has absolutely exceeded my expectations! Holds a curl superbly, doesn&#x27;t smudge or run at all, and looks beautiful. It is a fiber mascara, but the formula is so great that I honestly didn&#x27;t notice the fibers until I looked closely at the brush. And yes, it is more difficult to remove than a non-waterproof mascara. That&#x27;s the point. Just use a dual-phase makeup remover or some kind of cleansing oil, and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality for the price. Seems to smudge a little on my super oily skin but not sure if it&#x27;s the liner or the mascara smudging! LOL</li>
    <li> It smudges a lot during the day.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes grow out straight and have always repelled the many mascara&#x27;s that i have tried. This works; it curls lashes and adds some length. It does not move until you take it off.</li>
    <li> One of the best mascara&#x27;s out there! Just make sure you have a REALLY GOOD makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for about two years now and I have nothing but praise for it. Not only is at a decent price, but it&#x27;s amazing and like no other mascara on the (American) market. I have suggested it to all my friends and now they all have their own bottle of it. While it does stay on all day, it can be hard to wash and thus, can stay on for more than 24 hours after vigorous washing. I would recommend just a normal face washing and using drug store eye makeup remover religiously with this product. Other than that, enjoy it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other great reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is normal to oily. I work 12 hour shifts, and no matter what brand of mascara I bought, even the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; kinds, I would end up looking like a raccoon 8 to 10 hours into my shift. NOT with this mascara! It lasts the whole 12 hours and then some. Some reviews mention that it&#x27;s hard to take off, but I use Estee Lauder&#x27;s \\&quot;Take It Away\\&quot; makeup remover, and it does a superb job at smoothly taking this mascara off.  ([[ASIN:B00DU0QA5Q Lauder Makeup Remover Lotion Samples]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It layers very nicely. If you want a dark black but more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look, one coat is fine - no clumping, lashes stay separated nicely, but they are evenly coated. If you&#x27;re going for a more dramatic look, layer away. I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and have had no fake looking clumpy clown lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Definitely a LONG lasting mascara. Works great for long thick lashes. My lashes are thin so removing it did thin out my lashes over time. I stopped using it because of this, and I don&#x27;t want to purchase the special makeup remover for it either. I would recommend this product if you have thick lashes.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really does live up to its reputation, it separates every lash and really give them length, I look like i got falsies on, it holds the curl throughout the day, and it is seriously water proof, i mean that&#x27;s what its marketed for but man i wish it wasn&#x27;t SOOO waterproof to the point taking it off is almost a hassle lol. Makeup wipes definitely takes a WHILE to get this thing off but i imagine a cotton ball saturated with eye makeup remover would probably do a better job. But anyways back to how the product works, it truly is amazing, despite how hard it is to get it off i would still use this when i want to make a statement with my eyelash, this mascara make them stand out for sure.</li>
    <li> I have stick-straight eyelashes that are really difficult to curl and keep curled. I have tried tons of mascaras and am always on the lookout for something that works well and isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive. I&#x27;ve pretty much stuck with Maybelline&#x27;s waterproof versions of Full and Soft and Lash Stiletto, but they tend to flake on me after a while. After looking around some, I decided to try this. This first time I wore it, I went to a concert in the dead of summer in a building with no air conditioning. By the end of the night I looked in the mirror and noticed the mascara hadn&#x27;t budged one bit. I was extremely impressed!&lt;br /&gt;This holds a curl very well, adds length and a bit of volume, and lasts a long time without flaking or smudging all over my face. It can also be layered a few times without getting too clumpy. It&#x27;s waterproof and difficult to remove. I have not tried the coordinating mascara remover, but Pond&#x27;s cold cream has worked well for me. I have extremely sensitive eyes that are red half the time because everything irritates them. This does irritate my eyes just a little, but no more than other mascaras and definitely less than Maybelline Full and Soft (in case anyone wanted a comparison). I totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Cheap mascara, waterproof, lengthens/volumizes.  Works as good as Majolica Majorca IMO, and gives those expensive fiber mascara a run for their money.  I have been a DJV fiberwig fan for a long time and have bought several of those until I switched to this (in rotation with the MM).</li>
    <li> Amazing! this is my holy grail mascara -ive tried high end, low end, western and asian mascaras and this one surpasses it by far. Not only does it lengthen and volumize, it also holds a curl all day and night. It is difficult to remove but I just use Etude Houses lip and eye remover which does a great job.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this mascara.  It had great reviews, so I had high hopes for it.  But each time I used it, it really didn&#x27;t do anything special for my lashes.  It didn&#x27;t lengthen or add volume.  I could accept it if it only accomplished one of those important functions.  However, it merely coated my lashes like any other mediocre mascara.  It did contain fibers, but the fibers seemed to clump, rather than add length to my eyelashes.  Again, I had high hopes for this mascara.  And perhaps I received an old package or something. It just did not give me the look I wanted from a mascara.</li>
    <li> It is the same price as drugstore mascara but works like $50 Chanel mascara. No clumping guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Short stubborn lashes be gone! The Isehan mascara is here and will cure all that ails you. My lashes aren&#x27;t super short but they do get weighted down very easily and due to my dewy (ahem oily) skin, I find that mascara tends to smudge quite easily on me. This mascara does neither and it will really curl your lashes too. Worth every penny. Be warned however that waterproof remover is required. This stuff will not budge. I have the volume version in this too but like this one much better as I find it clumps less.</li>
    <li> I like it so far, you just have to work with it at a quick pace because it dries so fast!</li>
    <li> Good, but not great. Can get a very natural look if I use a light hand, and quite waterproof (great for humid, rainy weather, even the beach), but for a daily look, a bit meh, and definitely not over the top for going out. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with curling my lashes, though, so I can&#x27;t comment as to that.</li>
    <li> the waterproof version (in the brown bottle) is way better but make sure you get a good makeup remover.  it has some serious stick!</li>
    <li> This mascara rivals Lancôme!  It is wonderful.  Love it.  It stays put, gives you really long, separate lashes and really makes them full and black.  You need remover to get it off... It&#x27;s serious stuff.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews on Makeupalley.com. I kind of wanted to disprove it because I was a hardcore Lancome snob. Yeah, this is totally my go to now and has left my Lancome&#x27;s and Estee Lauder&#x27;s in the dust. Fair warning - it&#x27;s a little sticky and takes about half a dozen tries to get used to it, but seriously stick with it. Also try warming it up before using it - run the blow dryer on the outside of the tube, or stick it in your bra while you get ready for your body heat to warm it up. People think I have fake lashes, but more importantly - I put my make up on at 6:30 this morning. It&#x27;s now almost 9 pm. I&#x27;m writing this review because I looked in the mirror and realized that it looks like I just put my mascara on. I use the Neutrogena oi-free eye makeup remover to get it off. You&#x27;ll need to use a good remover - I tried the Estee Lauder one (got a big sample bottle) and it doesn&#x27;t do the job so keep that in mind if you order it. Getting my second tube after I finish this review.</li>
    <li> It has the fibers that can lengthen the lashes (not that dramatic). It doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and can hold the curl all day long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never gotten complemented in mascara till now lol</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!! I have stubbornly straight lashes and I&#x27;ve tried every mascara under the sun and most US brand mascaras are too heavy and after I curled my lashes and put the mascara on, the heaviness and wetness of the mascara ruins the curl and weighs down on my lashes. I end up having to go back with my curlers, which I hate to do when I&#x27;m wearing mascara, as it damages the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, while vacationing in Japan, I bought a mascara at a Japan&#x27;s convenience store, and LOVED it! The mascara had a much drier formula and fibers that made the lashes look longer while maintaining the curl! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find something very similar online (as a trip to Tokyo isn&#x27;t cheap!).</li>
    <li> I got the oldest crustiest looking mascara imaginable. The plastic on the outside surround the cardboard information label and mascara had turned completely yellow with age and the mascara itself smelled terrible. I angrily threw it out. I bought this when I was young and stupid way back then, and I didn&#x27;t realize I could have returned it. I just assumed that since I opened it, I had to pay for it.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It does everything advertisements claim - it curls lashes and keeps them curled. It lengthens and thickens without clumping the lashes together. I live in coastal NC (USA) where the humidity is terrible. I&#x27;ve not worn it through the summer months yet but so far it has not smudged, which has been a real problem with other mascaras, even those claiming to be waterproof. I read reviews in which reviewers said it was difficult to remove. However, I use Almay Moisturizing Makeup (Mascara) Remover and it comes right off. If you use an oil-free mascara remover, it is more difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> This stuff is serious. It makes you look as if you have on falsies if you apply correctly. I would recommend a oil based eye makeup remover with this to avoid damaging your lashes. This stuff has major staying power and breaks my lashes off when I don&#x27;t use an oil based remover. Only 3 stars due to loss of lashes. Don&#x27;t make this your daily mascara.</li>
    <li> Does not come all the way off with my make up remover!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what it is about this mascara but whenever i put it on after using a curler, my lashes extend really far out.</li>
    <li> I have extremely short and thin Asian eyelashes. This made my eyelashes actually visible and made me feel gorgeous! Also,  it&#x27;s extremely water proof, which I love. I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying this a second time. This is my new HG  mascara.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day, really stains. Too hard to remove though</li>
    <li> Clumpy, sticky and impossible to remove. Didn&#x27;t do anything more for my lashes that my Maybelline lash sensational can do ten times better. Save your money and buy a good drugstore mascara. Your lashes will thank you.</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing was truly waterproof. It went on nicely but I need to learn how to apply it so my lashes curl. It did NOT want to come off my eyes, I recommend you use make-up remover before washing your face.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara the only one i use!!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be. DOES NOT COME OFF! Not with makeup remover, not with soap. I thought this was going to be like the other fiber-based lash extenders, that add length after mascara. This is like black glue. Maybe that is what some people are looking for (big criers, people who work in water/rain). Not for me.</li>
    <li> Not for me,,, smells like black oily tar.  Clumpy  wet formula straightened my lashes instantly.  Very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Because it had such high reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Dolly Wink Volume, and I would recommend the Dolly Wink one over this one. I didn&#x27;t notice a smell in this mascara as mentioned in over reviews. I agree that this is super similar to the Lancome mascara, which doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my lashes. I have short, sparse lashes, so this didn&#x27;t really do much other than darken them. I also didn&#x27;t notice any lengthening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this mascara is pretty good at not clumping your lashes together.</li>
    <li> To be clear, the one star isn&#x27;t because the product is particularly bad or anything, because as far as I can tell, I&#x27;m the only one with this problem. The product and I simply aren&#x27;t a match made in heaven like everyone else. The mascara was supposed to be the &amp;#34;Chosen One,&amp;#34; so imagine my sadness when my short Asian lashes had an hour of glory as fierce eyelash lionesses that turned gradually turned into dark rings of mascara smudge around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tested the mascara out in a variety of situations, always resulting in me turning into a panda or raccoon. It just doesn&#x27;t like my oily lashes or my monolid lids or maybe my personality - I don&#x27;t really know. Onwards with the mascara search!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It makes my eyelashes thick and long. The only thing is you really have to scrub to get it off.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight lashes that point down and won&#x27;t hold a curl unless I wear super waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s the curse of Asian pin-straight hair :P I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of waterproof mascaras, both drugstore and highend, and they&#x27;ve always done a decent job at keeping my lashes curled for most of the day with a little bit of smudging by the end of the day. I recently moved to a new place with hotter climate, which made my lashes lose it&#x27;s curl almost immediately, no matter what waterproof mascara I used. I saw great reviews for this mascara on an Asian beauty supply website, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Holy cow, I&#x27;m so blown away by this product. Not only does this hold my curl like no other mascara out there, but it gives me length that I never thought I could achieve! It&#x27;s got little fibers in it, which helps with the lengthening, but if fibers usually irritate your eyes then I would stay away. This has become my go-to mascara, and the only mascara I need now! No more layers different mascaras and brand anymore! I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up like crazy because I don&#x27;t think I could live without this in my life!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple of months now. I am very pleased with this product. It does not clump and delivers everytime I apply them onto my not so long Asian lashes. I would re-order in the future! I still have one more bottle to go through.</li>
    <li> Really long-lasting and seldom smudge.</li>
    <li> one of the best mascaras i&#x27;ve ever used! stay curl the whole day. the only down side of this would be it&#x27;s hard to wash it off</li>
    <li> This mascara curled and lengthened my lashes. I love the little fibers that make my own lashes that much longer. Best I&#x27;ve ever seen my lashes look! The only downfall is it took me 4 days to get it off without ripping my lashes out. This stuff is like waterproof x10! I did not purchase the Isehan mascara removal but if you buy this product I would highly suggest it. I haven&#x27;t worn this mascara again b/c of how hard it was to remove.</li>
    <li> It is waterproof mascara yet i got a black spot whenever i cry.&lt;br /&gt;I dont agree with other reviewers.cedd&lt;br /&gt;Ddd</li>
    <li> Only need one coat. Love that this mascara keeps my curl and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my lashes like so many other mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. Does not smudge. Easily remove it with eye make up remover as soap and water will not do the trick.</li>
    <li> this mascara makes your eyelashes get fuller, longer, curler. more importantly, it&#x27;s not a burden on the lashes. good product</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as I thought it was. It definitely makes my lashes more longer, but its weight kind of push my lashes down a little bit so I don&#x27;t feel it actually helps to curl my lashes or keep my curly lashes in a good position.</li>
    <li> Not as good it used to be...</li>
    <li> This stuff really does make you look like you have false lashes. I personally haven&#x27;t had a problem with clumping as I have applied it very slowly and lightly. Incredible performance if used carefully.</li>
    <li> This is very nice mascara. No clumping &amp; it separates my lashes nicely. It&#x27;s a little hard to remove, but I guess that&#x27;s what makes it stay on so well. You&#x27;ll need a good eye makeup remover to take it off, but you won&#x27;t have raccoon eyes, that&#x27;s for sure! Nice dark black color! I&#x27;d recommend this mascara!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT !  I use both the Long &amp; Curl and Volume &amp; Curl together. Its true, this Mascara goes on and Does not budge, Does not Flake, You need the KissMe Heroine Make Mascara Remove to get it off. and its not heavy Like American waterproof Mascara. I have  Hooded  oily eyelids and non existent eyelashes (horrible combination, I know)  this works like a dream on them. And the length it gives, gets me giddy. Once this dries it is not a flexible Mascara, But I don&#x27;t care because I have eyelashes after I apply this.</li>
    <li> I think the subject line says it all!  It was a great surprise for it to show up in time for my trip!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I love it! This is the only mascara that i use but do not feel any uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I read about this being so great and so I had high hopes.  The brush is nice.  The product is dried out and flaky. Main reason I don&#x27;t like it is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off.  The lashes and eyes are very sensitive and I don&#x27;t like to pull and tug to get my makeup off.  I like a mascara that washes off with soap and water.  I washed my face last night and noticed this morning that the mascara was still on.  Ugh!  Took lots of makeup remover to get it off.  I recommend the Lash Out Butterfly from Loreal, Telescopic also Loreal or anything from Rimmel if you want good mascara.</li>
    <li> I have the typical Asian eyelashes. Long but very hard to maintain the curl.&lt;br /&gt;I just curl my lashes with an eyelash curler, and then put this on. It doesn&#x27;t clump, keeps my lashes curled, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge like many other waterproof ones. The only other one I like as much as this one is L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic mascara in waterproof formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know removing this mascara is tough. I use Sonia Kashuk eye makeup remover ($9~$10 from Target). It&#x27;s super easy. You don&#x27;t need to buy the &amp;#34;remover mascara&amp;#34; from Kiss Me.</li>
    <li> I really liked it, it made my lashes look amazing only problem I have with it is that is so hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Great item. Makes my eyelashes curly and long all day,and never messed up by hand or tears. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the smooth consistency. Does not clump of smear.</li>
    <li> if you want mascara to wear all day, lengthen your lashes, and not smudge, this is for you! SUPER waterproof. there are fibers in the mascara that cling to your lashes for added length but they do not shed AT ALL. only con is that removing it is a pain in the ass lol definitely not for every day wear especially if youre someone like me that likes to go home at the end of the night and head straight to bed w/o any hassles.</li>
    <li> Ok so, I am a make up artist and I can tell you now that this is probably the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;On my first use I put it on at about 8 in the morning and had it on for a good full day I came home and had a shower and even cleansed and exfoliated my face and when I looked in the mirror my lashes were still perfect and not a smudge to be found! it didn&#x27;t clump and it went on smooth.  It made my lashes longer and thicker then they&#x27;ve ever been without false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;You will need waterproof make up remover to take it off, don&#x27;t try to rub it off or it will just hurt your eyes. Put some of your waterproof make up remover (I use Garnier clean sensitive 2 in 1 ) on a cotton pad and place it on your eye and leave it sit to eat away at the mascara for about 10 seconds or so before you try to remove with any rubbing.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara after reading a review on it. It&#x27;s a really good mascara! I use it, along with another mascara, to plump and lengthen my lashes. This mascara does a really good job at the lengthening part. It has little fibers in it that stick to your eyelashes-- something I hadn&#x27;t been warned about., I thought I had a bunch of what I call &amp;#34;fuzzies&amp;#34; in it and was wondering how they got there since I wasn&#x27;t wearing clothing that shed too much. I really like this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something else I wasn&#x27;t warned about: it&#x27;s water proof, and most asian mascaras and eyeliners are, so when shopping keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your eyelash game is week and fragile (like mine can be), this is not an everyday product for you since removing waterproof eyeliner requires some rubbing and general irritation of the eyelashes.</li>
    <li> you have to wait for a about less then a minute to apply a second coat if you don&#x27;t the mascara gets too watery. But it does stay for a long time and removing it is not that easy.. I do have to give it crited for the fack that it is really black and is waterproof.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It definitely is water proof! I wore it all day to a wedding event outside and inside and not once did it dribble off or flake off my eyelashes. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This is on par with the great &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; cosmetics: Diorshow mascaras, Laura Mercier Secret Camo concealers, Armani foundations. Let me preface this review by saying I am a mascara fiend, It seems I have tried them all. I wear glasses sometimes (bifocals) and contacts during the day, so I need mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate or flake while hanging in for the long haul. i have slightly oily skin so smearage is a problem; Isehan doesn&#x27;t budge ALL DAY.  It goes on thick, even, and wet, and amazingly dries fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t smear at all. Defines, lengthens, thickens, makes lashes glossy. Bottom lashes too, without looking weird. One coat is daytime fluffy, two is lush and borderline falsies, and three is just insane. You will have to use a dedicated eye-makeup remover to take it off, but nothing crazy. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me or what, but this mascara is a homerun. Not terribly expensive either. Will repurchase to have extras immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It lengthens my lashes and holds their curl and my lases don&#x27;t feel overly brittle. It also really stays on well. It stays on so well I am able to wash my face before bed and sleep with it on. I have had no problems with flaking however it will smear if you rub your eyes. My other favorite mascara of this type is Diego Dalla Palma but it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job lengthening.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for short Asian lashes! This is my favorite mascara. It makes my lashes look SO much longer and fuller, and it holds a curl well too. I can layer on coat after coat to build length and thickness, and the mascara still looks great!</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful! It makes your lashes long and curl, without using an eyelash curler. The only downfall is that it does not come off unless you use a makeup remover, which is an easy thing to go about. Highly recommend ladies!</li>
</ol>
