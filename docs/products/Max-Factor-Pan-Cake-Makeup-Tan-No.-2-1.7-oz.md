      <li>We hope it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear.</li>

<li> I still have 4 Pan-Cakes left, but am in the process of checking other companies to find a similar product.</li>
<li> but it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not easy getting natural sponges any more but drugstores sell artificial ones.</li>
<li> I think I will have to look for some other product.</li>
<li> i have extremely oily skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other foundations</li>
<li> Yes, the makeup was what I expected, what I&#x27;ve used for the past 50+ years!  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is impossible to purchase in the stores and I am aware that it can be purchased over the internet.  </li>
<li> Was not able to find it anywhere as I was told Max Factor is no longer being sold in the US.  </li>
<li> Have been using max factor pan cake makeup for years, however have had a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
<li> I know prices are not what they use to be, this is ridiculous.</li>
<li> i guess ill be searching again for a foundation for really oily skin again :(</li>
<li> However it has become very hard to get.</li>
<li> IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately Max Factor packed up and moved to Europe.  </li>
<li> Why oh why has it become so expensive?  </li>
<li> it is so outrageously expensive, I can no longer afford</li>
<li> now so expensive</li>
<li> I just wish it was not so expensive as it is on the internet..</li>
<li> I must have hit wrong button, but ordered the wrong makeup for wife.</li>
<li> I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed that it</li>
<li> $129.00 for one compact is outrageous.</li>

    <li> I must have hit wrong button, but ordered the wrong makeup for wife. E-mailed the company and sent it back, they replace it immediately, no questions. Thanks, John</li>
    <li> its ok i guess, i expected more coverage it doesn&#x27;t really cover and the matte finish doesn&#x27;t really last. i have extremely oily skin maybe its because of that. i guess ill be searching again for a foundation for really oily skin again :( until now i cannot find one. anybody let me know which one i can use, i appreciate it. no i wont buy it again..</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been looking for a good cover up make up and when I found Max Factors pan cake makeup I stop looking. This is a great product covers up all my imperfections and does not break me out, it goes on smooth and feels natural on my skin. I also will continue my future purchases with the seller which by the way was also wonderful with my order.</li>
    <li> Have been using max factor pan cake makeup for years, however have had a hard time finding it in stores. This makeup has great coverage on imperfections and uneven skin. Easy to apply and always feels light and natural.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this anyway anymore - think they stopped selling in the USA.  Anyway this is exactly what I wanted and I love this stuff.  It is the most natural looking foundation I have ever worn in my life.  Very easy to apply without looking like you are wearing makeup.  I have never been able to use liquid foundation because I feel like I look like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.</li>
    <li> Yes,yes, yes ...because i&#x27;ve used max factor pan-cake makeup tan #2 for over 40 years and i love it!  never stop offering it, please!</li>
    <li> Bought for my 78 year old wife who has been using this same product for 63 years.  Unfortunately Max Factor packed up and moved to Europe.  My wife used to buy this product for $4.00 -- now it is almost unaffordable at $30 - $40 each (if you can find it at all).  Hope there is some way in the future to purchase internationally at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I love the Max Factor make-up as I have been using it for years.  I just wish it was not so expensive as it is on the internet..</li>
    <li> My girlfriend looks beautiful in it, but this make up is Way too expensive now! I would pay $20 for it and buy multiple...$80 is outrageous..if you lower the price you would sell more.</li>
    <li> I have been using Max Factor Pancake for almost 60 years.&lt;br /&gt;I used it when I was in show biz in NYC, and for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;It was always wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is so outrageously expensive, I can no longer afford it.&lt;br /&gt;Why has this product increased in price so dramatically?</li>
    <li> Perfect for my skin tone ... easy to apply, no streaking, difficult for people to tell if I even have it on</li>
    <li> Exactly what my sister wanted.  She has a hard time finding this in stores, so she was glad there was a way for her to get it without having to run from store to store.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yes, the makeup was what I expected, what I&#x27;ve used for the past 50+ years!  Although I ordered TWO and only received one (and was only charged for one) I will reorder again, soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a timely manner and was received in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using Max Factor Pan Cake Makeup for almost 60 years.  It is a spectacular product.  It does last all day &amp; night.&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to purchase in the stores and I am aware that it can be purchased over the internet.  Why oh why has it become so expensive?  Because the Hollywood stars use it?  I used to buy it for under $10.00.  I know prices are not what they use to be, this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I have used this make-up for decades. I like the fact that it is water-based and I can wash the sponge each time I use it. It looks natural when it&#x27;s on my face. It&#x27;s not easy getting natural sponges any more but drugstores sell artificial ones. Also this make-up is being discontinued so the price is going up. At some point I will have to switch but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> This make up goes on so smoothly (with a make up sponge) and uniformly. I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed that it&lt;br /&gt;is now so expensive but it lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve tried other foundations but so many of them are oily. This one is&lt;br /&gt;not.</li>
    <li> Love it, but it has become too expensive.  I think I will have to look for some other product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always used this foundation since college!  it&#x27;s been plenty, plenty of years since then and this is the only one that i still use as my foundation.  not the easiest to find so glad it&#x27;s here on amazon!</li>
    <li> We really like this makeup for our chorus performances.  I hope that we will be able to find more because our chorus is growing and each member will need their own.</li>
    <li> Like some of the others, I&#x27;ve used Max Factor Pan-Cake Makeup for years. When I noticed the price going up (and after hearing rumors about the product being discontinued) I stocked up--at $9.00 per compact! I refuse to be bullied by the manufacturer. I still have 4 Pan-Cakes left, but am in the process of checking other companies to find a similar product. $129.00 for one compact is outrageous. If everyone were to stop paying so much, we&#x27;d no doubt see the price come tumbling down. Quickly.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MAKE - UP AND AM SO BUMMED IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND.  IT STAYS ON THE ENTIRE DAY INTO NIGHT.</li>
    <li> Love this product have used it for 48 years.  Am devastated they left the U?S?, and now have stopped manufacturing it.  Do not understand why companies do that.</li>
    <li> Great product. On-time delivery. Excellent!</li>
    <li> All the Pan Cakes came together.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery. Although the price is very high, but no choice for me because, I guess, this color was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I love Max Factor&#x27;s Pan Cakes, cause I have oily face and these Pan Cakes make my shining go away.</li>
    <li> I have used this make up during the hot, humid summers in Memphis for many years.  It is water-based, light, and provides good overall coverage. It makes my skin feel good and doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge in the heat.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Have used this product since my teens and I am now a senior.  Was not able to find it anywhere as I was told Max Factor is no longer being sold in the US.  However, I found it on your site.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Sorry that the company moved out of our country but glad I can still get the product!! I have shared this with many friends that use it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for theatre purposes in the past and was glad to find it online and available. I didn&#x27;t like the cost though, since it has gone up in price substantially.</li>
    <li> Yes it made my mother very happy as it has been a staple in her make up cabinet since 1962. However it has become very hard to get. We hope it doesn&#x27;t completely disappear. We don&#x27;t know what she&#x27;ll use if it does.</li>
