      <li>Thanks Amazon for rescuing me again by carrying a favorite product!</li>
      <li>I bought light brown</li>
      <li>I almost cried when I couldn&#x27;t find the Light Brown in any store.  </li>
      <li>I have stubborn gray espeacially at the temples, and this product while color seemed to stick better than the regular Nice &amp; Easy</li>
      <li>I absolute love this product.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for having those things we fall in love with and can no longer get.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive hair skin that make my hair fall very easily.</li>
      <li>Comes quick and I like that.</li>
      <li>It smells the same or better than most.  </li>
      <li>This was the only brand that&#x27;s been good to my hair as it was very gentle.  </li>
      <li>I was willing like you to pay for it at 3 times of its original cost here at this seller at amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>At any rate, this product is overall 100X better than L&#x27;Oreal Excellence and regular Nice &#x27;n Easy for coloring gray.  </li>
      <li>Love the pre-treatment for gray hair; seems to work better than any other dye i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It is the same as our good  as the old &amp;#34;Gray Solution&amp;#34;:  </li>
      <li>It is the best hair color for partially gray hair, covers gray very well and lasts quite a long time.  </li>
      <li>My luck seems to be that my favorite products all quit being sold in my local stores...</li>
      <li>I was so worried at first when I learned it had ben discontinued.</li>
      <li>I can no longer find this hair color in local stores, so was glad to find it here.</li>
      <li>The Cairol Gray Solution is perfect for my hair, and I am sorry that it has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware that the color of the solution is not an indication of the color that your hair will be after waiting and then washing your hair.</li>
      <li>The pre-treatment included is the magic that lets my hair hold the color for 4-5 solid weeks.  </li>
      <li>The only hair color I&#x27;ve tried that was really able to cover my grays.</li>
      <li>Had high hopes for this product but have gone back to my regular Nice &#x27;N Easy.</li>
      <li>Nice&#x27;nEasy Gray Solution is the only product that covers my gray and lasts more than a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>but I was surprised how quickly it lightened up and the shocks of gray broke through again.</li>
      <li>and she really loves using it.</li>
      <li>And it hits a home run, after trying so many different products (including the 10-minute types) in leaving my hair really shiny and soft, and the color NEVER, EVER fades.  </li>
      <li>This also covers better than the other brands.</li>
      <li>I am able to just color my roots each month, then in shower move it through all my hair with a little water and leave for 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t bother with anything with ashy cool tones or it will accentuate your gray, or red tones because they just don&#x27;t take properly or last well at all!</li>
      <li>When I first applied this, my hair was much darker, as other reviewers had noted.</li>
      <li>I do recommend that you go with the color closest to your natural color and leave it on 30-40 minutes (as directed by my hairdresser to do).</li>
      <li>Then I use Medium Brown NNE Root Touch-up Kit, so my roots are just a tad bit darker than the rest, as that would be naturally.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft and silky.</li>
      <li>If in doubt, choose a color shade lighter than your natural color.    </li>
      <li>As with any hair color, if you have lots of gray/white, you should stick to the basic Neutral shades, or Natural, as they are sometimes called.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hair color that truly lives up to the hype, \\&quot;completely covers gray\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>At 4-5 weeks I use Gray Solution again to get all my roots, but hardly ever have to refresh anywhere else because the color stays so true, which helps my hair stay healthier as well.  </li>
      <li>So ladies don&#x27;t waste your money at this buyer without trying the &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; solution first.</li>
      <li>For those of us who have gray, white or salt and pepper hair, it works very well, and looks so natural that you&#x27;ll look years younger (or at least your hair will).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sorry that this item was discontinued by Clairol :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair at home for over 20 years, and now have lots of resistant white--not gray--hair at 47.  As with any hair color, if you have lots of gray/white, you should stick to the basic Neutral shades, or Natural, as they are sometimes called.  Sometimes, the warm golds work alright, too.  But don&#x27;t bother with anything with ashy cool tones or it will accentuate your gray, or red tones because they just don&#x27;t take properly or last well at all! I think a lot of people out there don&#x27;t realize this.  At any rate, this product is overall 100X better than L&#x27;Oreal Excellence and regular Nice &#x27;n Easy for coloring gray.  It works in 25 vs. the 45 min. total time needed for those others.  It smells the same or better than most.  It&#x27;s creamy, not drippy.  And it hits a home run, after trying so many different products (including the 10-minute types) in leaving my hair really shiny and soft, and the color NEVER, EVER fades.  I only need to re-color when my roots become noticeable--they&#x27;re so white, that&#x27;s about 2 1/2 weeks. Then I use Medium Brown NNE Root Touch-up Kit, so my roots are just a tad bit darker than the rest, as that would be naturally.  At 4-5 weeks I use Gray Solution again to get all my roots, but hardly ever have to refresh anywhere else because the color stays so true, which helps my hair stay healthier as well.  I absolute love this product.  I feel like I have my hair back from my 20&#x27;s, with shine and body.  Try it, it will make you feel great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t buy this at my local wal Mart. Love the pre-treatment for gray hair; seems to work better than any other dye i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this hair color in local stores, so was glad to find it here. The package of 3 boxes arrived in great condition and on time.  It is the best hair color for partially gray hair, covers gray very well and lasts quite a long time.  Thanks Amazon for having those things we fall in love with and can no longer get.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother and she really loves using it. The color is nice and it is one of the best gray coverage product.</li>
    <li> The Cairol Gray Solution is perfect for my hair, and I am sorry that it has been discontinued.  I am trying to purchase as many as I can before they are all gone.  This is one hair dye that leaves my hair, which is very fine, quite manageable, and the color is right for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this on clearance at a local pharmacy chain. The color absorption is very good after application and the color retention is excellent after several weeks.  My hair is soft and silky. This is not a glamorous product, but it is a good value and a quality product.  One of the features is the included color seal pre-treatment for your entire head of hair - not just the roots. In addition, there is an excellent weekly conditioner included. For those of us who have gray, white or salt and pepper hair, it works very well, and looks so natural that you&#x27;ll look years younger (or at least your hair will). Just be aware that the color of the solution is not an indication of the color that your hair will be after waiting and then washing your hair. Happy Coloring!</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars u would! I bought light brown which is what I purchase with other hair coloring products. The color came out very dark brown and made my hair dry. Since I bought a 3 pack now I am stuck with 2 additional boxes</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dye for people like me who have resistant grays. Sadly clairol seems to have changed their formula and is not distributing this to many stores. Yay for Amazon that they still are able to get it. For those of you who have resistant grays and have tried everything like me try this one it&#x27;s excellent</li>
    <li> I have stubborn gray espeacially at the temples, and this product while color seemed to stick better than the regular Nice &amp; Easy it still was a problem covering these grays and I needed to put additional color on this area for longer than box recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color for gray coverage.  No longer available in the stores!</li>
    <li> My luck seems to be that my favorite products all quit being sold in my local stores...this one too. I can only use Clairol products as the others have some perfume in them that gives me a migraine. This also covers better than the other brands. I&#x27;ve had greying hair since I was 16 and have been coloring since I was in my 30s...that&#x27;s over 20 years. This color covers the best and matches the best of any that I&#x27;ve tried...including expensive salons. Why pay $85 or more for hair color in the salon when I can get better results myself for around $8 ??    I do recommend that you go with the color closest to your natural color and leave it on 30-40 minutes (as directed by my hairdresser to do). If in doubt, choose a color shade lighter than your natural color.    If you use the specifically formulated shampoos, etc. for color treated hair, this will last a long time and not turn brassy. Thanks Amazon for rescuing me again by carrying a favorite product!</li>
    <li> Nice&#x27;nEasy Gray Solution is the only product that covers my gray and lasts more than a few weeks.  The pre-treatment included is the magic that lets my hair hold the color for 4-5 solid weeks.  I almost cried when I couldn&#x27;t find the Light Brown in any store.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  I had it in 2 days, just in time for traveling.  This is the only hair color that truly lives up to the hype, \\&quot;completely covers gray\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> love it but now its out of stock AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I love using Clairol Gray Solutions it covers all of the gray and lasts for quite a while.  Glad I can always find it on Amazon as I can no longer find it in the stores.  Comes quick and I like that.</li>
    <li> The only hair color I&#x27;ve tried that was really able to cover my grays. I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s out of market! :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful solution for over 10 years, I love it. I have a very sensitive hair skin that make my hair fall very easily. This was the only brand that&#x27;s been good to my hair as it was very gentle.  I was so worried at first when I learned it had ben discontinued. I was willing like you to pay for it at 3 times of its original cost here at this seller at amazon.com.  However, I went to the clairol web site and found that they had made this product even better called now &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s available at amazon.com too at $8.99. So ladies don&#x27;t waste your money at this buyer without trying the &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; solution first. It is the same as our good  as the old &amp;#34;Gray Solution&amp;#34;:  it has a pre-treatment, and the other 2 solutions and the conditional. It seems to be the same only with the name changed and improved.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product but have gone back to my regular Nice &#x27;N Easy. When I first applied this, my hair was much darker, as other reviewers had noted. That was fine but I was surprised how quickly it lightened up and the shocks of gray broke through again.</li>
    <li> I love this line of clairol color.  It DOES NOT wash out.  I am able to just color my roots each month, then in shower move it through all my hair with a little water and leave for 5 minutes.  Perfect every time and it lasts!  I hope Clairol never stops making this product.</li>
    <li> I have to color my hair so often now</li>
