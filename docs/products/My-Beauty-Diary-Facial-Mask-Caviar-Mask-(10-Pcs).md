      <li>I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying.</li>
      <li>I have purchased 5 different kinds and have been satisfied.</li>
      <li>This mask is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more from this brand very</li>
      <li>I bought this after stumbling upon MBD and lusting after their Macaron &amp; Earl Grey Tea masks for many months.</li>
      <li>My skin is super supple and soft after just one use.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Fast ship/delivery.</li>
      <li>As a big fan of mybeautydiary, I&#x27;ve tried almost each one of the masks available in Hong Kong or here on Amazon.us</li>
      <li>They smell like chemicals and don&#x27;t do much in terms of skin care.</li>
      <li>very moisture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more and trying other MBD items.</li>
      <li>I love facial care product in general and masks in particular.</li>
      <li>I just use warm water to rinse dry, pat and apply a decent facial oil or moisturizer afterward.</li>
      <li>I have really fair skin and can get redness in various places especially in winter, but after using it my skin had no redness and looked younger.</li>
      <li>(in the past it was love ;) and will continue to use them.</li>
      <li>The mask is a fabric type mask that you wear for about 20 minutes (or until most of the moist product has dried on your skin a bit).</li>
      <li>but I do not tend to break out each time I try a new skin care</li>
      <li>I actually take the pack before I open it and kind of squeeze down gently almost like you would a tube of toothpaste</li>
      <li>This one makes my face brighter and soft!</li>
      <li>This mask is really good for the tired skin, used that twice a week, you will find out the totally difference on your skin, thanks for the service and products.</li>
      <li>I input the codes carefully,and it got approved but on their website, it states so clearly that the verification codes can be falsified as well.</li>
      <li>Also, it tightens and makes the skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I left it on the whole night since I dozed off to sleep without meaning to.</li>
      <li>I have mildly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this facial mask to do much for me.</li>
      <li>I took mine off after fifteen minutes and it was still pretty wet</li>
      <li>However I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my face is much softer, pores feel smaller and my skin tone has evened out a lot.</li>
      <li>I recommend using it whenever your skin needs a really major boost of moisture.</li>
      <li>Go to their English site, search My Beauty Diary and filter by price: low - high.</li>
      <li>The pad itself is much wetter than the pads of other varieties of the mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve received a fakery since I got the exact same kind from Sasa beauty shop in Hong Kong when I went back for the past Chinese New Year.</li>
      <li>a little tingly, very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Since I stare at myself in the mirror all the time, I can&#x27;t really tell if it improved my pore size or not,but, I can tell you that when I wake up in the morning, my face looks rejuvenated and does not look tired!</li>

<li> Having washed and dried my face, I opened a pack and started applying it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, my face erupted over the course of the following week.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Simply best moisturizing mask for the great price. 3 times a week for 20 min and your skin looks different.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product.Fast ship/delivery.</li>
    <li> best product in the market for beauty mask, highly recommend!! I have purchased 5 different kinds and have been satisfied.</li>
    <li> When you are 25 years old or more, you should care more about the loosing of facial muscles. That&#x60;s why I chose this one.</li>
    <li> One word: opulence. Yep. You&#x27;ll feel absolutely spoiled by this mask!! My skin is super supple and soft after just one use. The mask is a fabric type mask that you wear for about 20 minutes (or until most of the moist product has dried on your skin a bit). It&#x27;s not overly complicated. I just use warm water to rinse dry, pat and apply a decent facial oil or moisturizer afterward. I notice my skin is better hydrated, has a glow and looks healthier in general after using this. I&#x27;ll be buying more and trying other MBD items. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love doing face masks and love all things skincare in general! I enjoyed this mask, as it fell cool on the skin and did not irritate it. This mask fit my face fine. It also has A LOT of serum in it... I actually take the pack before I open it and kind of squeeze down gently almost like you would a tube of toothpaste and and then open and apply mask. It will still be PLENTY moist with serum... (ugh, the word, moist! eek!) What is left in the packet I save and apply to my neck and decollete. You can also transfer the extra to a container and save up for later use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different Beauty Diary masks over the past few years and I think their formula is changing as it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as it was in the past. Having said that, the BD Caviar mask was no different and average for me. Either that or the weather is a lot dryer now which could be the case. I still like the masks (in the past it was love ;) and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Love MBD masks! This one makes my face brighter and soft! Masks smell great too! Love it! It&#x27;s a great buy</li>
    <li> My face is  in a discombobulated state of flakiness, dryness, and outright oiliness so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this facial mask to do much for me. However, I like the thought of pampering myself at home without the exorbitant prices of spas and salons. With that in mind, I purchased this box of facial masks. The day I received the package, I wanted to try it before bed. Having washed and dried my face, I opened a pack and started applying it. Constant &amp;#34;oohhs&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;aahhs&amp;#34; where sighed, as I patted down the mask into the corners and curves of my face. I left it on the whole night since I dozed off to sleep without meaning to. The next morning, my face felt softer and moisturized. I did not see any more flakiness on my face. As a moisturizer, it works but not by any miraculous means. I am satisfied with this product because my expectations were limited and I derived more satisfaction from the process itself, not the end result.</li>
    <li> This mask is really good for the tired skin, used that twice a week, you will find out the totally difference on your skin, thanks for the service and products.</li>
    <li> I have huge pores. After using this three times in the first week, my friends noticed that my face have this natural healthy luminous \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. Since I stare at myself in the mirror all the time, I can&#x27;t really tell if it improved my pore size or not,but, I can tell you that when I wake up in the morning, my face looks rejuvenated and does not look tired! These masks have better result than My Beauty Diary-Collagen Mask, but I can imagine that it takes longer time and consistency to regrow skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my friends can notice it, that means it works!</li>
    <li> I uses it before bedtime. Feels cool, moisture, clean and  refresh. I really liked it. Would continue use this product.</li>
    <li> As a regular user of sheet masks, I am not of the caviar masks. They smell like chemicals and don&#x27;t do much in terms of skin care. You&#x27;re better off buying a different variety or a nice moisturizer instead.</li>
    <li> very good product and great price! I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying. I will definitely buy more from this brand! Happy buying.</li>
    <li> This mask is exactly what I was looking for.  It hydrates without leaving the skin greasy.  Also, it tightens and makes the skin soft.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Ingredients, packaging and cotton mask were good. My skin felt very smooth immediately after using. Unfortunately, my face erupted over the course of the following week. I have mildly sensitive skin but I do not tend to break out each time I try a new skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the remainder of the package to my BFF&#x27;s cosmetic-&amp;-skin-care-crazy teenage daughters.</li>
    <li> I am a mask fan and I have lots of masks. I have to use masks every week and it become my favorite mask. I really like this product. my skin looks tight and it looks do good after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love facial care product in general and masks in particular. I have tried dozens of brands, including some quite expensive ones. However, no facial mask can compete with My Beauty Diary line of products. The moisturize skin beautifully and leave it radiant, soft as a baby peach, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the varieties of the mask are very good but they all are a little different from each other. The Caviar Mask, in my experience, carries a lot more moisture. The pad itself is much wetter than the pads of other varieties of the mask. I recommend using it whenever your skin needs a really major boost of moisture. There will be quite a bit of excess moisture in the foil packet. Don&#x27;t discard it! Just apply all the excess product to your hands and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a phenomenal product that is incredibly cheap for the value it delivers.</li>
    <li> very moisture. I like it. After I use it, my skin feel very smooth and chill, I love the ingredient too</li>
    <li> Loved them..great value</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. The best I had ever used.</li>
    <li> smelling too strong, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I like this mask it relaxes me and it feels great just like a regular mask you&#x27;ll find at a store</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve received a fakery since I got the exact same kind from Sasa beauty shop in Hong Kong when I went back for the past Chinese New Year. The second I saw the product, it looked weird. The color of the box is lighter than I remember. The caviar picture with the spoon is so blurry. Besides, the upper-left shiny sticker on the wrap is even smaller than the picture shown on your product info on Amazon. Before I decided to leave this review, I went to mybeautydiary official website to check with the verification code. I input the codes carefully,and it got approved but on their website, it states so clearly that the verification codes can be falsified as well. As a big fan of mybeautydiary, I&#x27;ve tried almost each one of the masks available in Hong Kong or here on Amazon.us so I know something&#x27;s wrong when I see it. Maybe they changed the package or design but I just want to make sure what you carry is the real things and as a consumer, I&#x27;ll be happy with what I pay for. I&#x27;m not going to risk using it before you can provide proof for me. If I don&#x27;t receive any response from you, I&#x27;ll go ahead and require a full refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this after stumbling upon MBD and lusting after their Macaron &amp; Earl Grey Tea masks for many months. Next I&#x27;m going to get that one as well as Royal Jelly, Natto, and Pearl Powder at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know you could leave the mask on as long as it was moist. I took mine off after fifteen minutes and it was still pretty wet--I wish I had left it on longer. However I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my face is much softer, pores feel smaller and my skin tone has evened out a lot. I have really fair skin and can get redness in various places especially in winter, but after using it my skin had no redness and looked younger. The mask smelled incredibly nice coming out of the package and felt really pleasant on my face too. I could feel my pores shrinking and the skin felt cool and a little tingly, very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this mask five stars was the effectiveness combined with price. When I could shop at Asian beauty stores usually the sheet masks were around $4 to $6 per mask. For someone with such little disposable income at the time, $5.99 for a mask was just not a justifiable purchase. $1.20 to $1.70 per mask is MUCH better--as cheap as the bargain masks you can buy at Wal-Mart and a lot better quality and lower maintenance. I will definitely be buying more from this brand very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, you can buy 1pc masks by My Beauty Diary on sasa.com. Go to their English site, search My Beauty Diary and filter by price: low - high. This is a great idea if you want to try the various kinds before committing to one kind. The ones they sell by themselves are Aloe, Natto, Southern France Apricot, Sake Yeast, Pearl Powder, Red Wine, Arbutin, Chocolate Truffle, Collagen, Earl Grey Tea &amp; Macaron, Hyalruonic Acid, Mixed Berry, Q10, Royal Jelly, 2-step Spring and 2-step Winter. However the 10pc packs aren&#x27;t always on sale there like they seem to be on Amazon, so I buy them here. Happy buying!</li>
    <li> I first saw this mask when I was traveling in Asia and then found it on Amazon, my boyfriend and I both love it so much, my skin turns very smooth and has a nice glow after applying it after shower.</li>
