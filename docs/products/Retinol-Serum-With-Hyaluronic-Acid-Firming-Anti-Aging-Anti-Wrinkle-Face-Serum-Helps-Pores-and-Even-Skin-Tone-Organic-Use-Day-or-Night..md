      <li>These products are great, too, but I definitely noticed a difference when I added the Retinol Serum to my skincare regimen.  </li>
      <li>This was a free trial in exchange i needed to give a review.  </li>
      <li>I did not get this for free in am exchange for a review.</li>
      <li>and if I see any reduction in lines which is my primary purpose for purchase.</li>

      <li>After a true test of 3 months this product may merit a 5 star rating as it takes time for results to manifest.  </li>

      <li>iit&#x27;s early but so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I love the way the other product lifts and this one seems to add moisture on top of that.</li>

      <li>The product seems like a good natural one except for the pentylene glycol, polysorbate 20, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and ethyl hexyl glycerin which can be possible allergens or irritants.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Sano Firm &amp; Lift  makes my skin feel soft. I really like this.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my skin since I was a teenager. I have learned that something that really works you can notice even the slightest difference the following day. I noticed a small difference in my wrinkle above my eyebrow, it wasn&#x27;t at deep. I also noticed that my skin appeared smoother and had a younger look to it. I will continue to use this, I apply it at night and in the morning. It&#x27;s not greasy so it works perfect under makeup. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This product really gets the job done. You may experience some breakout in the beginning. I would imagine this is because it is doing it&#x27;s job of clearing dead skin to reveal new. Still getting so many compliments on my skin. I am very happy with all of SanoNatural products!</li>
    <li> Very special formula, the serum does not make me break out or peel like retin-A.  It has improved the overall texture of my skin, and has changed the appearance of fine lines.  I won&#x27;t go to bed without using it.</li>
    <li> Absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t have any smell - no breakouts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved using the all natural Sano products! This retinal firm and lift serum is light weight, non greasy and fragrant free!!</li>
    <li> The texture and application is great. Works as a REALLY GOOD primer before applying makeup too!  But I get super oily skin throughout the day and it did not do a good job and regulating that. I think this product should be used before bed for skin like mine and the Sano Hyauronic Acid Serum+ for the day time.</li>
    <li> I love Sano products. I have very sensitive skin and can not use many popular skin care items.&lt;br /&gt;The Vit C serum and retinol both have been great for results without any burning or itching. I love&lt;br /&gt;the way this serum smooths my skin and reduces fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s, with sensitive, oily skin.</li>
    <li> MADE IN THE USA - VEGAN - AND they have excellent customer service! I don&#x27;t think you will find a better product for your money. This product applies smoothly and easily, not at all runny. I would suggest you apply it thinly with a &amp;quot;less is more&amp;quot; approach; a small  amount will cover most of your face. The Retinol percentage is perfect! Absolutely no irritation from this combination of Hyaluronic acid/Retinol . It works very well with any combination of concealers, powders and blush that I have tried. My skin really does look and feel softer, fuller, less wrinkled especially on my neck &amp;amp;  décolletage.  Do I look any younger ?  well that is a tough one to honestly answer, but my students often mistakenly call me Mom NOT Grandma, which I most definitely am !</li>
    <li> Nice pump dispenser, more hygienic than the droppers.  No scent.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Nice, silky feel, wrinkles softened noticeably within a week-10 days . A drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using the retinol serum for a few days and so far, I am enjoying the benefits.  My skin feels and looks smoother.  I am almost afraid my skin will become addicted!</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me as a free sample. The product seems like a good natural one except for the pentylene glycol, polysorbate 20, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and ethyl hexyl glycerin which can be possible allergens or irritants. Otherwise, I really like their natural ingredients and it does moisturize the skin making wrinkles less visible for the time being.</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Simple packaging&lt;br /&gt;I can see and feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issue with the packaging. My item arrived very well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to review after ordering three of their other products that I had to stock up on. I wanted to give it a few weeks minimum before leaving my review. I use their hyalauric acid serum and just adore it so I figured I would give this a try. I applied the hyalauric acid serum first, then applied the retinol serum over it every night. I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks now. At first, I did begin to peel a bit around my nose so I stopped applying much around that area so it wouldn&#x27;t look as if I&#x27;d just had a cold. I also had one or two blemishes and I don&#x27;t normally get those. I have heard that switching any beauty product can do this and to give it time so I did and I am glad I gave it a shot! I love the way the other product lifts and this one seems to add moisture on top of that. I figure I can use all the lifting I can get and I always get compliments on how young I look. It is a relatively inexpensive serum and it was definitely worth a try to me. I use it in combination with my night lotion when i take the time to do it and I feel that it works just as well as some of the $40 products I have tried. I will continue to use it! Loving their products so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this awhile and I like how soft it makes my skin and it shrinks my pores and helps me to apply my make up better. Of course the affects aren&#x27;t long lasting because when I stop using it my skin is dry again lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over their brand of the vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****If my review or my photographs have helped you in any way, please vote yes.******</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok could not tell it did anything for me</li>
    <li> Been using this for approximately two weeks.  I usually have a problem with retinol products leaving my face feeling sunburned but the SANO Naturals Retinol Serum has not.  My face has shed the dead skin to leave it refreshed and glowing.  I recommend this product and will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m 56 yrs old and need all the help I can get!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  My skin is smoother firmer and feels amazing.  I would totally buy this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. and feel comfortable recommending it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and I can honestly see improvement in my skin. First off, I simply look healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of sun damage showing up in the past two years (I&#x27;m 68) having been a sun worshiper since I was in my teens...paying the price now. Not bad in the wrinkle department, fortunately, but I have light brown patches,like big freckles, now.  The Retinol Serum is actually fading them. I know they&#x27;ll never disappear, but they are MUCH less noticeable.I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so I&#x27;m delighted that this product is doing such a good job.</li>
    <li> A great product with immediate results.  I don&#x27;t usually like retinol products, but this one I like</li>
    <li> This had leaked in the package when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their Vitamin C Serum+ is as effective, and, I find, easier to use.</li>
    <li> Great strength and addition to your product line. I am using and interchanging all products , I love the Sano products and heavy into anti aging products used every night. 2.5 strength is brilliant and love the look and feel after one week. My regimen interchanges is vitamin c serum,  the hyaluronic acid serum, the rose hip oil, and now the retinol 2.5, how can I go wrong. thank you sano, my skin is smooth and clear at 52</li>
    <li> I recieved this product like two weeks ago and I am very pleased like I am with the rest of the sano naturals products. I can fill the tightening lifting efects. Definately will buy again.</li>
    <li> Sank makes amazing products. This is another great one in their series.</li>
    <li> I have used Sano Naturals Retinol Serum 2.5 nearly three weeks, and I am really impressed with the results. My complexion is glowing, and I have also noticed that my under eye circles are gradually diminishing. Obviously I am doing something right because I have noticed my teenage daughter as well as my husband raiding the bathroom for my clay mask/ apricot scrub etc.  Hence they think this is my secret to my youthful looking skin. Ironically I was out shopping and I mentioned to the cashier that I have three children, and she looked surprised. So I asked how old do you think I am, and she stated, “I thought you were 22”. I smiled and said that is very flattering, however I am 34!  Ladies before I tried this product I did not think I would get any results because I have tried so many products only to find out that they take months to work, (with minimum results) if they work at all. I am talking about products that cost $30.00-$ 94.00 for 1 ounce. Ironically before I purchased Sano Retinol Serum 2.5 I spent $100.00 on a Lancôme Visionnaire gift set, yet after using the Sano Retinol Serum 2.5 I decided that I will no longer need to spend $100.00 to obtain and keep youthful skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for several weeks and find much to like about it.  It is odorless and has a fine, silky texture.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that interfere with makeup or sunscreens.  I have noted that some products result in pilling.  After a true test of 3 months this product may merit a 5 star rating as it takes time for results to manifest.  I have already noticed some improvement in the appearance of fine lines and my skin appears tighter (in a positive way). I am looking forward to further benefits with time.</li>
    <li> Sano Natural Retinol Serum:  Is fantastic. It hydrates eases my fine lines and helps prevent blemishes.</li>
    <li> The bottle came opened and most of the product was just everywhere. The little bit I did have left did nothing for my skin besides add a small amount of moisture</li>
    <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. A little goes a long way however, after consistent use for two months I did not benefit from any of the things advertised on the list of&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What you can expect&amp;#34;.....&lt;br /&gt;- Diminished appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, hyperpigmentation &amp; pores&lt;br /&gt;- Natural, organically derived antiaging skincare&lt;br /&gt;- Brighter, softer, smoother looking skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it has the particular ingredients it does and that it is vegan...</li>
    <li> I love Sano Naturals!! This Retinol serum is everything!!! Sano has not disappointed me with one thing yet! Their products are affordable, natural and effective. I cannot say enough. Jusy try them, you may not see immediate results, but give it some time. I did. I had to use this product on 3 different occasions (by itself) to really appreciate what it can do. I put it on at night by itself after cleansing and I swear my skin looks refreshed and hydrated with less visible signs of aging. Just give it some time, you will see a difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I am very happy with the results so far.  I notice improvements with the lines on my face and neck. Also, improved texture! Great price and performance!</li>
    <li> This was a free trial in exchange i needed to give a review.  Let me say, I love the way my face feels when using the serum...iit&#x27;s early but so far, so good.  I also use with their serum with vitamin c, love it too.</li>
    <li> Love is product, this was a refill!</li>
    <li> Just got it, loving it already!! I can literally feeling the difference. Great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sano Retinol Serum for the past week, and I&#x27;ve noticed my face is smoother and somehow looks firmer.  I&#x27;ve only been using it every other evening, followed by either Hyaluronic Acid or a moisturizer because I also use Vitamin C serum and Niacinamide on my face.  These products are great, too, but I definitely noticed a difference when I added the Retinol Serum to my skincare regimen.  I believe that Sano&#x27;s Retinol Serum is a wonderful anti-aging measure to take to keep your face younger looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I have noticed line reduction and more firmness to my skin and neck. Not sticky or greasy, and odorless. You won&#x27;t be disappointed ....and the cost is very reasonable.  I WAS paying $75  or more an ounce for different products, and was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this because it is all natural, and of course, the price! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I did not get this for free in am exchange for a review. With that said, yes, I would buy again. I wear this at night after washing my face and using a toner.  I have seen an improvement and change in the pigmentation of my skin so definitely worth it. Wrinkles around eyes have decreased too!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin glow and feels quenching. I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I cannot testament to any dramatic results after using it for two weeks but I can state that I am glad that the product is free of toxic ingredients as far as I know and I have not had any reactions to it (my skin is very sensitive).  I like that there is little to no scent as well.  I will continue using the product to see.</li>
    <li> love this stuff - my face feels much more hydrated the more I use it.</li>
    <li> This is everything I hoped it would be. My skin is much more firm and fine lines are disappearing. My skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> I only received this product just a couple days ago but I must say so far I&#x27;m loving the way my face feels after application, refreshed and hydrated. I&#x27;ll continue to use this and see how my skin/face improves and if I see any reduction in lines which is my primary purpose for purchase.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product. Been only a few days but already lightning things that have been there for awhile. I scar very easy when I break out. Retinol works well to clear your skin but is usually extremely drying and makes a mess of your face. This stuff works great. It is pulling out some of the crap in my face and healing it at the same time.It is exfoliating those bad spots but not making my entire face peel like a derm strength would. Im only 35 but have some forhead lines and dark spots from breakouts. In days it has significally lightened those spots.I works well under makeup also.Ive tried under my eyes and entire face an no problem.I have very sensitive skin and things generally break out quick. Seems to be a do it all product with quick nice results.Hydrating,clearing,firming,lightning, and makes your skin look dewey.Dries almost immediately and extremely cheap.Give it a try. You would spend way more on a drugstore product with crap in it that smells like perfume. I received this product through Sano&#x27;s Vip offer for my review. I really like their products so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have really noticed an improvement in my skin,  smoother and firmer. I will definitely reorder before I run out of what I currently have.  Do recommend it.  Thanks for the opportunity to try this product at no cost to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple of months now, and I get a lot of compliments on how young my skin looks (I&#x27;m 35). Seems to be helping to fade a dark spot on my cheek, too.</li>
    <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a consumer of Sano products for approx. 2 years now, &amp;amp;  I have to say I really love their serums! I recently started using the Retinol Serum +, &amp;amp; I absolutely love it! My skin glows &amp;amp; looks as though I&#x27;ve been out in the sun. People have been telling me how good/clear/healthy my skin looks (I have scaring from acne as a teen). I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am loyal customer of SANO. I use their product daily and mix with my foundation. Keeps you skin hydrated all day. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very clean feeling product. I have sensitive skin and very cautious when choosing skincare.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I can see an immediate plumping effect. I like to use this at night and the vitamin C serum during the day, both under my moisturizer. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Sano is my go to brand for my face. My face looks illuminated and smooth. I enjoy the Vitamin C serum as well. The overall costs of these products is minimal when compared to  CLARINS , which  I was using. This Retinol is superb and I feel and look younger. Thank you SANO, I will continue to use and try all of your products.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product I have ever tried.  My skin is so happy. I will definately reorder this product.&lt;br /&gt;very good company.  Price is excellent for what it offers</li>
    <li> This product in combination with the SANO Vitamin C is amazing!!! I love the combo and I will buy it again. It not only clears the discoloration but it also reduces the look of your wrinkles. Especially, around the eyes! Very pleased with these two items.</li>
    <li> Sano Retinol Serum does it job! My skin is looking much healthier, smoother and brighter. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Lines around mouth are less definitive. Face fells and looks smooth. Great price. Shipped as promised. Will continue to use Sano products. I also use the Vitamin C serum. Highly recommend.</li>
