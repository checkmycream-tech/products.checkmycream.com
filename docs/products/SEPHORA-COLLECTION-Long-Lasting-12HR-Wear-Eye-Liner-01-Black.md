### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>IT&#x27;S THE GREATEST EYELINER</li>
      <li>At $11, it&#x27;s a very good quality eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product otherwise.</li>
      <li>Great eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye liner!!</li>
      <li>I love my eyeliner! !</li>
      <li>Good quality ..</li>
      <li>Loved not having to go to Sephora for this product.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the brush on this!</li>
      <li>If your eye waters at all, this will smudge off, so keep the bottle handy if you think this may happen.</li>
      <li>It does stay on for a full 12 hours, which is great.</li>
      <li>I will say this probably isn&#x27;t the best for beginners however because it is a VERY sensitive brush.</li>
      <li>Nice tapered felt tip for easy application.</li>
      <li>I was going to get the Kat Von D liquid eyeliner until I tried it on my hand and found that it smudged a lot more than the Sephora brand.</li>
      <li>Better price here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t try the waterproof version because I wanted to be able to wash it off easily, but it&#x27;s probably better for someone with water eyes</li>
      <li>The tip is very fine and allows you to be really detailed with your application.</li>
      <li>It came in a package that had a super cute note with it(: i LOVE this eyeliner, it is a bit pricey</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Was easy to apply and stayed on all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-relatively cheap for the brand&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;-goes on smooth</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the hugest downfall since it&#x27;s such a great eyeliner otherwise, but it&#x27;s something to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t good at applying liquid eye liner, then I would go for a different brand.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the sample:)</li>
      <li>The liquid itself has a great consistency  that isn&#x27;t watered down.</li>
      <li>I finish it off by going over it with a black eyeshadow just to keep it flawless and classy!</li>
      <li>This is the first liner I have used that the tip doesn&#x27;t fray!</li>
      <li>I would say the matte brown works the best (which I have found with other brands as well, interestingly enough).</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s thin and makes it super easy to make cute wings :3</li>
      <li>I first bought this eyeliner a year ago.</li>
      <li>The purple and green are good for a fun night out and a change from the normal routine.</li>
      <li>I do, however, apply the gold over the black and that has a nice effect for evenings.</li>
      <li>My remedy to that is to gently pull my skin to be a bit taut and then glide the brush along my lash line.</li>
      <li>but you really won&#x27;t find any eyeliner like this one</li>
      <li>This is not the best eye liner in the world, but I have definitely used worse.</li>
      <li>The brush applicator is really easy to use, and never really clumps or anything.</li>
      <li>I would definitely avoid this one and invest a bit more money in a different one.</li>
      <li>, this liner is only 0.82 oz of product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very small case, which is great for your purse</li>
      <li>and it does work really well, but don&#x27;t be surprised by the size</li>
      <li>While the wand is perfectly fine, I found that you need a few strokes over the same line in order to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>I am a professional make up artist and use it almost every time i work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far my number 1 go-to eyeliner now.</li>
      <li>Compared to other drugstore brands I use, it goes on extraordinarily smooth and stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>The ONLY downside to this, which is something I normally look for when buying eyeliners, is that it is not waterproof.</li>

    <li> Nowhere does it say that this eyeliner is glittery. I didn&#x27;t pay $25 to buy glittery eyeliner on purpose. I should&#x27;ve bought it from Sephora, where it&#x27;s half the price and and not glittery.</li>
    <li> It came in a package that had a super cute note with it(: i LOVE this eyeliner, it is a bit pricey but you really won&#x27;t find any eyeliner like this one, it&#x27;s thin and makes it super easy to make cute wings :3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using drugstore brands for quite a while now, and one day decided to pop into a Sephora and check out what they had. I ended up buying this liquid eyeliner in black because it was the cheapest liquid liner they had. At $11, it&#x27;s a very good quality eyeliner. Compared to other drugstore brands I use, it goes on extraordinarily smooth and stays on for a long time. The brush applicator is really easy to use, and never really clumps or anything. The ONLY downside to this, which is something I normally look for when buying eyeliners, is that it is not waterproof. I&#x27;ve had a few days with teary eyes where my makeup ends up running quite a lot. This isn&#x27;t the hugest downfall since it&#x27;s such a great eyeliner otherwise, but it&#x27;s something to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-relatively cheap for the brand&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;-great brush applicator&lt;br /&gt;-lasts long throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not waterproof</li>
    <li> I was going to get the Kat Von D liquid eyeliner until I tried it on my hand and found that it smudged a lot more than the Sephora brand. I&#x27;m a firm believer in paying for the quality, but I took a chance on this one. IT&#x27;S THE GREATEST EYELINER I HAVE EVER TRIED. It&#x27;s by far my number 1 go-to eyeliner now. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts all day. I got the one that wasn&#x27;t waterproof, and it comes off if my eyes tear up, or if I rub my eyes while washing my face. I didn&#x27;t try the waterproof version because I wanted to be able to wash it off easily, but it&#x27;s probably better for someone with water eyes or if you know you&#x27;re going to be crying. I will say this probably isn&#x27;t the best for beginners however because it is a VERY sensitive brush. My remedy to that is to gently pull my skin to be a bit taut and then glide the brush along my lash line. I finish it off by going over it with a black eyeshadow just to keep it flawless and classy!</li>
    <li> My go to liquid eyeliner!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner.  Was easy to apply and stayed on all day.</li>
    <li> I only wear this and have for years. Better price here on Amazon. Stays on until you take it off. Nice tapered felt tip for easy application. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love my eyeliner! !</li>
    <li> Good quality .. Thanks for the sample:)</li>
    <li> I have oily skin maybe that&#x27;s it other then that I have to re-apply alot</li>
    <li> It is NOT 12 hour wear and it is terrible. I would definitely avoid this one and invest a bit more money in a different one.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this! If your eye waters at all, this will smudge off, so keep the bottle handy if you think this may happen. It&#x27;s a great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> In case you didn&#x27;t notice the shipping weight of 3 oz, which would include the net wt of the liner 0.82oz&lt;br /&gt;plus the case plus the shipping materials/envelope etc, this liner is only 0.82 oz of product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very small case, which is great for your purse and it does work really well, but don&#x27;t be surprised by the size&lt;br /&gt;when you get it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner!! I am a professional make up artist and use it almost every time i work. I first bought this eyeliner a year ago. The tip is very fine and allows you to be really detailed with your application. The liquid itself has a great consistency  that isn&#x27;t watered down. This is the first liner I have used that the tip doesn&#x27;t fray! I recommend this to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> You expect sephora twelve dollar 12 hour eyeliner to stay on for even one hour, but no. As soon as it dried, it creased and smudged and looked really bad.</li>
    <li> My wife says thus tends to flake off...</li>
    <li> This is not the best eye liner in the world, but I have definitely used worse. The black is less dramatic than I desired. It does stay on for a full 12 hours, which is great. If you aren&#x27;t good at applying liquid eye liner, then I would go for a different brand. While the wand is perfectly fine, I found that you need a few strokes over the same line in order to get the full effect. Taking this eye liner off is incredibly easy, but somewhat annoying. It comes off in clumps, even if I use an eye make-up remover. This makes it difficult to adjust if I get the angle wrong on my original application. C&#x27;est la vie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Colors:&lt;br /&gt;I have this eye liner in four other colors. The other colors (brown, purple, green, and gold) are all decent. I would say the matte brown works the best (which I have found with other brands as well, interestingly enough). The purple and green are good for a fun night out and a change from the normal routine. The gold you cannot even see, so that&#x27;s disappointing. I do, however, apply the gold over the black and that has a nice effect for evenings.</li>
    <li> Loved not having to go to Sephora for this product.</li>
