      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>and maybe I need to do more than one application</li>
      <li>If i could get it ,i need  more product of seacreat  </li>
      <li>I had use this for about 6 months, since then I feel my skin much better, I had seen results, I agree with you guys, prices are to hight , but  that is why I buy as a preferred customer through - agent .....  </li>
      <li>but this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>And the fact that you can get it here for such a CHEAP price is awesome!</li>
      <li>On top of that they make you feel obligated by staying overtime and giving you a special deal for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>but I did before and after pictures and did not see a huge difference</li>
      <li>We ordered overnight shipping to arrive before the photo shoot, but we paid mightily for shipping as well.  </li>
      <li>There is a reason it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>Recovery Masque age day Masque, which i love it and was the first of my order.</li>
      <li>I used Recover Masque and love it so much.</li>
      <li>And if I were to buy it online, I would only do so with the expectation that it may a good product but is no substitute for fillers, botox,  or surgery.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did a close up before and after and the difference was AMAZING, even weeks later.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset about this as all I originally was interested</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset about this as all I originally was interested</li>
      <li>This product delivers...used it just before a photo shoot to help smoothe fine lines and it not only helped the fine lines, it even made the dark under eye circles better looking.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
      <li>but then they did this whole sales pitch and my Christmas miracle has turned into a Christmas nighmare.  </li>

      <li>but then they did this whole sales pitch and my Christmas miracle has turned into a Christmas nighmare.  </li>
      <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>Decided to buy for MUCH less on amazon and am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just creases mainly.  </li>
      <li>a high quality anti-ageing mask that  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
      <li>It makes your skin tight, plump, so very soft and more youthful looking.  </li>
      <li>I feel bad for the people who weren&#x27;t as happy with their results as I was!!</li>
      <li>Is there anyone  who has actually used a whole box of the day and/or night masques as well as any of the other supportive products?  </li>
      <li>After speaking with him, I saw a new ad that was selling the Recover for about $349 but had not one review.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to that.</li>
      <li>They insisted their $800 product is not only lasting, but their natural ingredients are safe and that in the long run would save me higher ongoing costs of fillers, Botox and surgery.  </li>
      <li>and it did make my hands and arms feel very soft and</li>
      <li>and it did make my hands and arms feel very soft and</li>
      <li>I know it drys much faster if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions and wet your face first</li>
      <li>; I don&#x27;t believe these are imitation because if that were true, why isn&#x27;t the company doing what Dr. Oz does and warn online customers and explain why their cost is 7 times what they are paying online; however, nowhere do I see a retail price of $800</li>
      <li>I am thinking the product must be old, and considering the price, it makes sense.</li>
      <li>Buyers Beware!is product is the Real Seacret and actually selling online for $40</li>
      <li>If this product is the Real Seacret and actually selling online for $40, there&#x27;s no way it is going to lift your face and soften wrinkles permanently.  </li>
      <li>and i had to return one of them because it was really old.</li>
      <li>I have used this before so I can tell this is really old.</li>
      <li>Now a friend told me this is a multi-level company and this is why there is no quality control as far as expiration dates</li>
      <li>Even getting me to believe that I found special miracle product not available anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>I saw the demo on youtube and that woman was majorly wrinkly</li>
      <li>I also want to add that I am 65 years old but often get mistaken for up to twenty years younger and don&#x27;t have deep lines or feel I have unreasonable expectations.  </li>
      <li>For the price, though I am not sure if it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product before and it was very creamy - this seemed a little dry, so it may have been old</li>

<li> After buying this product and the eye cr&amp;egrave;me and serum plus other related products at a kiosk in the mall on Christmas Eve, this morning, my eyes are itching plus the side of my face doesn&#x27;t look any different</li>
<li> A complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Wonder how long this product has been on the market?</li>
<li> There was no expiration date showing but the box is all scratched and the cream was very dry.</li>
<li> Because of the salt from the Dead Sea, even with the mixed reviews, if a seller would guarantee me unexpired products, I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying it at what some said is a \\&quot;pricy online cost.\\&quot;</li>
<li> but I have no way of finding out because today is Christmas and everything is closed.  </li>
<li> I am not much on miracle products</li>
<li> Beware!on me at a vulnerable moment on  right a closing time on Christmas</li>
<li> I was going to purchase that with a basket of other products for $100</li>

<li> I called the seller and he told me the online products were imitation.  </li>
<li> (if this is indeed an imitation, do they allow this? )</li>
<li> When I got home and looked up the Seacret products online Christmas Eve, all of the Recover Masques were selling for around $40 and average of 3 ½ star reviews from 11 people.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m thinking it is my Christmas miracle to get it at half price when that is actually 7 times the usual going rate!  </li>
<li> It would be a waste of money at $1.00 per packet, much less over $20.00 per packet.</li>
<li> and I saw little difference aside from a little bit of a tightening feeling while the mask was on.</li>
<li> The two sellers are from Israel and I trusted them when they showed me pictures of themselves at the Dead Sea with this mud on them</li>
<li> This product is like a miracle mask because you can visibly see the difference once applied &amp; it lasts for a few days thereafter.  </li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and their product is totally different from what the people here on Amazon are buying</li>
<li> was the sea salt for this terrible mysterious itching on my upper arms.  </li>
<li> however, there&#x27;s no way I am not going to demand my money back as I can not afford to risk trying out some stupid overpriced cosmetic Dead Sea gimmick.</li>

    <li> I had high hopes for this and maybe I need to do more than one application but I did before and after pictures and did not see a huge difference</li>
    <li> made face feel good but did not do what was advertised&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again if I can get it for the same price as before</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference...just a tightening effect..but I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just creases mainly.  I saw the demo on youtube and that woman was majorly wrinkly but she looked amazing afterward..maybe I should try 2?</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes and i had to return one of them because it was really old. There was no expiration date showing but the box is all scratched and the cream was very dry. I have used this before so I can tell this is really old. There is a reason it&#x27;s so cheap. Not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used Recover before and experienced amazing results. This however was powdery as soon as I put it on my face and I saw little difference aside from a little bit of a tightening feeling while the mask was on.

    <li> After buying this product and the eye cr&amp;egrave;me and serum plus other related products at a kiosk in the mall on Christmas Eve, this morning, my eyes are itching plus the side of my face doesn&#x27;t look any different so the Recover didn&#x27;t even last even overnight.

It is unconscionable for them to tell me this is a permanent solution and an alternative to fillers and Botox.  I told them I had tried facials, Dermawand, Galvanic spa, and even Matrix laser and had reached the point where I felt the only answer would be fillers or Botox.  They insisted their $800 product is not only lasting, but their natural ingredients are safe and that in the long run would save me higher ongoing costs of fillers, Botox and surgery.  If this product is the Real Seacret and actually selling online for $40, there&#x27;s no way it is going to lift your face and soften wrinkles permanently.  I&#x27;m going back to the mall today.  He took my picture and he can take another picture and see that there is no change after his demonstration treatment on one side of my face.  I&#x27;m very upset about this as all I originally was interested was the sea salt for this terrible mysterious itching on my upper arms.  He did a demonstration of that and it did make my hands and arms feel very soft and I was going to purchase that with a basket of other products for $100 but then they did this whole sales pitch and my Christmas miracle has turned into a Christmas nighmare.

    <li> My wife love it so much, it&#x27;s great product, and price is good. Shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> Love it I look 10 years younger!!</li>
    <li> I feel bad for the people who weren&#x27;t as happy with their results as I was!! I LOVE the recover mask! I did a close up before and after and the difference was AMAZING, even weeks later. I know it drys much faster if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions and wet your face first (meaning your face is dripping, not just wiping with a damp towel). And the fact that you can get it here for such a CHEAP price is awesome! Compare it to the seacret site!! OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  You can see results immediately, I just wish my skin would look like that days later. I have used it twice a week for 4 weeks and am hoping I will see a longer effect. It does come out a little dry but it helps to massage the package before opening. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I had use this for about 6 months, since then I feel my skin much better, I had seen results, I agree with you guys, prices are to hight , but  that is why I buy as a preferred customer through - agent .....  seacretdirectkrose14.com  I had save a lot of dollars. I&#x27;m thinking to become an agent since I use this a lot.... Remember Always buy as a preferred customer you guys will save a lot of money 50% off on prices and you will make the order  yourself.  and seacret will ship it to your house. Try it this way... Hope,this help......  Seacretdirectkrose14.com</li>
    <li> I used Recover Masque and love it so much. Please may i know why i got my 2 order but couldn,t get Recovery Masque age day Masque, which i love it and was the first of my order. If i could get it ,i need  more product of seacreat  to order it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Happy holidays. Ziba Bavi</li>
    <li> This product is like a miracle mask because you can visibly see the difference once applied &amp; it lasts for a few days thereafter.  The pricing on this item is awesome &amp; affordable because it cost much more elsewhere.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and it was very creamy - this seemed a little dry, so it may have been old</li>
    <li> It is ok. For the price, though I am not sure if it is worth it. Maybe someone else has had a different result.</li>
    <li> I am not much on miracle products but this is pretty good. I can see and immediate difference after the use.</li>
    <li> I tried some of this with a tempered expectation. It didn&#x27;t live up to that. This stuff does absolutely NOTHING. A complete waste of money. It would be a waste of money at $1.00 per packet, much less over $20.00 per packet. Do not get caught up in the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; claims. Might as well use a wallyworld product.</li>
    <li> thr Seacret recovery mask a high quality anti-ageing mask that  I feel gives a refreshing skin result that is noticeable.</li>
    <li> I tried the masque originally from a distributor and loved it.  Decided to buy for MUCH less on amazon and am glad I did.  There are definite results seen after the masque peaks and it lasts.  I will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> This product delivers...used it just before a photo shoot to help smoothe fine lines and it not only helped the fine lines, it even made the dark under eye circles better looking.  It makes your skin tight, plump, so very soft and more youthful looking.  I was impressed.  We ordered overnight shipping to arrive before the photo shoot, but we paid mightily for shipping as well.  Would we pay that shipping price again?  No.  Lesson learned, but would definitely order the product from shopquickonline again.</li>
