      <li>I had no idea that Patti LaBelle had a perfume out till I was on amazon.com doing some browsing and searching and then came across this wonderful smelling perfume,I bought it for my mom as a gift</li>
      <li>Love It!!!!!</li>
      <li>I also ordered Girlfriend fragrance and it is wonderful also!</li>
      <li>Perfect scent...lasts all day</li>
      <li>But it has a great aroma.</li>
      <li>Seems better worn in the fall &amp; winter months, because of it&#x27;s great sillage.</li>

      <li>I love it, so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This I think is more appropriate for evening wear, and only when you&#x27;re in the mood to be bold.</li>
      <li>Just a couple of sprays on the pulse points is almost too much for me.</li>
      <li>This has a very musky floral mature smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely, delicate scent...to be worn gently.  </li>
      <li>cause she is really into perfume and has like a zillion bottles of all different kinds of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>If you can last 4 hours wearing this it becomes quite engaging &amp; a somewhat comforting scent, but only after the dry down.</li>

    <li> This has a very musky floral mature smell. If you can last 4 hours wearing this it becomes quite engaging &amp; a somewhat comforting scent, but only after the dry down. Seems better worn in the fall &amp; winter months, because of it&#x27;s great sillage. Just a couple of sprays on the pulse points is almost too much for me. It&#x27;s a heavy white floral with notes of gardenia that scream out. I do smell hints of tangerine &amp; lily from time to time. This I think is more appropriate for evening wear, and only when you&#x27;re in the mood to be bold. Otherwise, this may be offensive to some, especially if worn in the spring or summer.</li>
