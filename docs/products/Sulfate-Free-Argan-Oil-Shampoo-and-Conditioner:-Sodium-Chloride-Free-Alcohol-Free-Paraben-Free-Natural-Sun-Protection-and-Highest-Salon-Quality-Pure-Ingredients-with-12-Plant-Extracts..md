<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife has been using it for a couple of months and loves it. She&#x27;ll be ordering again soon! She&#x27;s told her mom and sisters about it as well.</li>
    <li> Actually my wife ordered the shampoo and conditioner for her; however, we have both used it and we feel that our hair looks and feels healthier in the two weeks that we have used the products. So far we are pleased with the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G and I</li>
    <li> Very impressed with both these products! I am recovering from massive hair loss caused by another product that I had used for a very long time. I had totally forgotten what shampoo I used to use, and I am now coloring my hair regularly, so my needs are slightly different. I ordered this duo after trying several others. I am very please! No hair loss or breakage when shampooing. Fresh scent. The shampoo leaves my hair in the kind of shape it used to be in when I was younger - I almost don&#x27;t need a conditioner, but I use it anyway, and between them, my hair is silky! I&#x27;ve used these 3 times since I last had my hair colored (I&#x27;m a red head!), and my color looks bright and shiny, as well, after I dry my hair. I am particularly impressed with the consideration shown by the manufacturers of this product. They contacted me directly via email to establish a relationship, and a way to contact them with any questions. This is almost unheard of anymore! I will be back for more. My only suggestion is that these might be either unbundled and sold separately, or packaged with a two to one ration. I will run out of shampoo long before I run out of conditioner. It only takes a small amount to smooth out my hair. My hair is slightly shorter than shoulder length. I will definitely keep using these products!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about a week now and I really did not expect much.  So many products do not provide advertised results but this one does.  I am almost 60 years old and have done everything in the book to my hair from perming to coloring, highlighting  etc. I have always had good hair despite all of that.  Over the past year I have noticed my hair becoming coarser in texture and believe it or not curly (I don&#x27;t perm anymore) on one side of my head.  Every morning I would have to go thru the process of either shampooing or wetting down my hair and blow drying it straight,.  The only suggestions I was getting from my stylist was either cut my hair extremely short or use more product.  I do not like using a lot hairspray, gel or similar products.  With this product I can now go two days without the curls taking over and my hair is softer and more manageable.  I am hoping for continued improvement and if so I will be a fan for life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great shampoo and conditioner.  I have wavy hair and I like something that leaves my hair soft and manageable and this seems to do the trick.  I am very, very picky about which products I use and this one is a winner!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling very soft. The best!</li>
    <li> These products are very good for my often frizzy hair...they do not seem to strip my hair or overly weigh it down but leave it manageable and healthier feeling.  It indicates you only need a very small amount of the product which should last longer than larger products.</li>
    <li> I am new to using argan oil and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. The products my hair dresser tells me to use are expensive, smell weird, and tangle my hair. I feel I break more hair when combing wet when compared to the top selling mainstream hair care products I&#x27;ve used prior. After trying different kinds: Pantene, Herbal Essences, Suave, organic products, salon sold products, etc., I had little hopes for yours. (Just being honest). I&#x27;m open to change, so I gave it a shot. I didn&#x27;t like the price verse quantity, but I was prepared for that because I understand you get what you pay for. So price wasn&#x27;t a big issue here. After using it for one week (today), I do like it so far. I like the gentle lather from the shampoo, which is non-existent in organic products I&#x27;ve used and the more I use the conditioner, the easier it is to comb my hair after getting out of the shower. I have to wash my hair daily and straighten it, so I need something that can protect my hair. So far I think your product is right on. I have no regrets for spending the money I did on it. Thank you for your follow up email. Your interest in your consumers shows and that&#x27;s very important to us.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth hair!  Wonderful smell!</li>
    <li> Big thumbs up to you folks!! This is a fantastic product and I have already recommended it my friends. I see a phenomenal improvement in just a couple of applications. I would certainly be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Great products but costly</li>
    <li> I have tried higher end brand under the sun and was hoping by the reviews that I would have to stop looking.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately not the case for my type of hair. I do keratin straightening so the sulfate free was a plus but it actually made&lt;br /&gt;my hair pretty dry and super frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is 100% amazing though and refunded my money right away. Since this product comes with a money back guarantee, you really have nothing to lose by trying it out. I only wish it had worked for me.</li>
    <li> I used many other organic and natural product but this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Great for my extensions</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my wife. She has used it for almost a month now and her hair is so soft and shiny! It truly does what it says. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this product wouldn&#x27;t clean my hair well. It was recommended by the salon who did the Brazilian Blowout for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I did not use as much product as I would have with my previous shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels so soft; the frizz is nonexistent. Consequently, my hair looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> I do like it and I&#x27;m a returning customer. I think I am seeing a difference. My scalp was very dry and uncomfortable and I was looking for some relief. The shampoo is lovely and my hair looks great. The itchiness has diminished, so I&#x27;m hopeful for the Argan Oil&#x27;s effect to take place over time.</li>
    <li> I have loved the Vizeri Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner!  I have fine curly hair, and I don’t get chemical treatments and rarely even use heat to style my hair.  So I wasn’t sure if I would notice any improvement in my hair with this product.  But from the first day of use my hair has less frizz, is stronger and more shiny.  I was concerned the product would weigh my fine hair down and look greasy, but it hasn’t.  And the “Love Your Hair” ebook taught me some tricks, like combing my hair in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair, and not towel drying or brushing my hair when wet, that have also helped with frizz.</li>
    <li> I had a keratin treatment a while ago and was told to use sulfate and sodium free shampoo to keep the keratin in.  There are not many shampoos out there that are both sodium and sulfate free.  Most are either one or the other.  I found a couple.  Was not thrilled with any of them, so kept looking.  When I looked on Amazon for one, up came Vizeri so I gave it a try.  The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it almost seemed to make my hair very dry but I couldn&#x27;t understand because so many people were saying how great it was.  I gave it another try in a couple of weeks.  The next time I tried it I loved it and then every time after I loved the results.  It left my hair manageable and soft but not to soft and a very interesting thing was that I felt like my hair stayed cleaner longer.  I am not sure what happend the first time but I must say if anyone tries it and doesn&#x27;t like the result, please try again.  I usually wash my hair every other day. Wihile I used the Vizeri I could actually go another day after that and it still looked and felt clean and smelled fresh.  I am not sure how that is possible but I definitely saw that difference.  I am glad I gave it another try.  I only wish the bottles were bigger and less expensive because I would love this to be my everytime shampoo and conditioner but I have so much hair and I went through it way too quickly.  I don&#x27;t think I could afford to use it everytime.  For this reason I took off the one star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and from day one I knew I was going to love it!  A pleasant smell and soft healthier looking hair has been my experience so far.  I have dark hair and have been bleaching to color it for the past three years.  This has left my hair severely dry and damaged.  I honestly thought I was going to have to chop it all off for it to recover, but this shampoo and conditioner have been a little miracle for my hair.  I no longer have to buy the numerous hair products I had to use to give my hair some semblance of life.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was soft and manageable, and I thought &amp;#34;Oh my!  I have finally found the solution to my fine, thin, fly-away, hair&amp;#34;.  However, my excitement was not long-lived!  Subsequent washes have left my hair in an unruly state.  I was expecting much more after reading all the other reviews (which were the reasons I purchased these highly priced prodcts)!</li>
    <li> I have keratin treatment applied professionally.  And as part of treatment is shampoo and conditioner recommended by keratin mfg.  Your product is soooo much better.  Even tho it&#x27;s been 4 mths since the treatment, your shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling like I just had the treatment.  So soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vizeri for 6 months now and I must say that I love it.  I noticed after the 1st wash with both the shampoo and conditioner a huge difference in the appearance, and texture of my hair.  My hair feels much softer and silkier than before.  It&#x27;s also much shinier. I love this product and will continue to use it.  My only complaint is that I have had difficulty purchasing the conditioner by itself.  It seems to be sold as a set.</li>
    <li> This was a decent shampoo.  It lathered well and cleaned as expected.  The smell is OK but not something I personally liked.  I live in a climate that is really dry in the winter.  I had hoped this shampoo would give me added moisture and body since the dry air sucks the moisture right out of my hair.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference from any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a few months now and they work great on my keratin straightened hair; soft and frizz free. Only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to sell the shampoo and conditioner separately. I use more of the shampoo and tend to run out quickly.</li>
    <li> Previous to this purchase I was using the Keratin Complex line for my hair as I do have my hair treated with keratin. I can honestly say this product has definitely been an upgrade as from my first use my hair felt much softer and much easier to manage. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it will help with the brittleness of my hair but I am definitely happy with the soft results thus far. The smell is nice, it reminds me of an orange creamsicle which is not the usual clean smelling shampoo I like, but its nice. My only complaint is the small bottles it comes in, I thought I would be getting a little more for the buck. I will definitely continue to purchase this line though.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this shampoo and conditioner for my wife, she uses high end shampoos only. Especially ones that are sulfates and  parabens free. Every time she gets one she really likes, it gets discontinued or is very hard to find outside of her salon. So I gave it to her for Christmas, and she loves it! She even uses a little on our son&#x27;s curly hair and it does make a difference.  She has a lot of hair but it is fine, wavy and color treated, also has issues with dry scalp and can not just use any type of shampoo.  She has used it for a week, she says a little goes a long way, and conditioner is amazing. I think her hair looks greats and feels really soft. I know my picky wife defiantly recommends this shampoo if you have ever used any type of sulfate free shampoo. This one is top notch and not a bad a price for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner has made all the difference with my hair. I have thick, curly hair that I&#x27;m always straightening and so there&#x27;s lots of damage and dryness. After just one washing with this shampoo and conditioner, it became instantly light and soft. Before this I was using drug store brands like Pantene and Garnier...NEVER GOING BACK! Maybe if I had thin, straight hair it wouldn&#x27;t matter as much, but as a girl who has lived in Hawaii for 15 years in crazy humidity, you need products like this! I also like that there is no parabens (been reading up a lot on this) and is sulfate and sodium-chlorine free. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is smooth and shiny. I have fine hair and not abundant and ever since I started using these people have complemented my on the volume of my hair.  It&#x27;s definitely shinier and less frizzy.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends and two of them told me they were going to place an order.</li>
    <li> Excellent product already see a diffrence in my hair texture! I love it! And the shipping was so quick! Overall extremely satisfied !!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner. After a bad dye job I had to dye it again and my hair was very dry. Been using this and my hair is very soft and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy/curly hair, and a lot of it too, and tend to need a leave-in conditioner in order to keep my hair settled.  With this shampoo and conditioner I can rinse out both completely and still my hair stays manageable and curls stay full and soft.  I can feel my hair as healthier since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/conditioner, there is a shine to it that was not there before.  I am very happy I found this product, it suits my kind of hair very well.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels!  I will recommend this shampoo/conditioner to all my friends.  It smells great and my hair looks beautiful.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather well and I have to use a lot of it on my thick hair to get my hair clean.  They should make a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like the products.  The scent is wonderful and it controls the frizz which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Really like the shampoo and conditioner. Wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I am loving the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel like straw</li>
    <li> Am very satisfied with the quality and definite positive improvements I can see and feel in my hair! I have noticed more shine, less brittleness, more softness, am impressed with the reduced color fade and the orange/cream smell is nice. I would definitely recommend! I have used other organic products and Vizeri out performs the competition!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have ordered it 3 times as it is the only shampoo and conditioner that helps my very dry ends and keeps my hair smooth and soft.  I will continue to order it!  It&#x27;s a little spendy, but it only takes a little bit of each to get the job done.  Well worth the money if you want a good product that works!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel super soft without weighing it down - gives volume and shine.</li>
    <li> I am a female with medium length hair. I first ordered this shampoo/conditioner while working in Afghanistan.  I work outdoors most of the time and the weather/sun is harsh on my hair.  I love the fact that these products are sulfur free, and my hair stayed soft and shiny for the past 3 months I have been using them. The scent is also amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the gentle cleanse and smell. The conditioner leaves the hair well moisturized and regenerated.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the original $40-$50 and I read great reviews on it so I was really excited about it and felt it was worth spending the money, but I used it for about a week and my hair was getting very oily while using it. I read good reviews that it was good for thin fine hair and my hair is finer so I thought it would make  it have more volume, but it did the opposite for me, it made it greasier and flatter. I looked to see if I could return to get my money back, but unfortunately it says I can&#x27;t return anymore.</li>
    <li> I am really glad that I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner. It has a very light scent and leaves my hair looking and feeling in the best condition. I will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner - hair feels healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t make commits on items I buy, but this this shampoo is delicious.  Smells like orange ice cream, makes my hair fuller and shiny.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My hair is amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another person that usually doesn&#x27;t write reviews, but this is one of those products that deserves it.  I already knew the benefits of sulfate free shampoos and conditioners, but I had stayed loyal to a local store and a natural brand that worked great until they were bought out by another company that silently decided to add sulfates into it(!).  So recently I had gotten lazy and just been getting whatever sounded good at the supermarket and realized my hair was getting horribly dry and just rather unpleasant in appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I needed to get back on the sulfate free train and started shopping around online.  After reading the glowing reviews of this product I figured it was worth a shot. Just after the first day of use I noticed a massive difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s now very soft and silky and almost light feeling which I could honestly never say before even with previous sulfate free hair products.  I have naturally thick and wavy hair so for it to actually feel light is pretty amazing.  It smells great and like others have said it is a pleasant orange cream fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI for people buying the small bottles, a little goes a long way with this product.  I think once I make it through these I am going to be buying the much larger bottles.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the products</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I just received my shampoo and conditioner yesterday, and I can&#x27;t begin to say how beautiful the packaging is, and I used it for the first time yesterday and my very dyed and overprocessed hair came out unbelievable, and it looks amazing the next day, it&#x27;s soft and manageable. So far I am loving this product! from start to finish, I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I keep coming back to this brand! Smells delicious and the conditioner makes my hair feel baby soft. The only product I&#x27;ve tried in the last 6 months that&#x27;s worth the money. Does great on my colored hair!</li>
    <li> I got a keratin treatment and was looking for a new sodium chloride, sulfate free shampoo - this one fit the bill. I was really looking forward to this duo given the rave reviews, but have sadly been sorely disappointed. The shampoo does NOT go very far (I think this bottle will last me 3 weeks, washing my hair 3 times per week), even after using the conditioner my hair is matted and extremely hard to comb through when I get out of the shower. It smells like peaches and cream which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it was the wonder shampoo the ratings make it out to be. Overall very very disappointed, will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This set arrived amazingly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was just treated with an american blowout and needed to have a sodium laureth sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I like that this comes in a set and was convinced buying it by the reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;These products work for my hair treatment and I like the smell of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again</li>
    <li> Excellent! It has a mild smell. It makes my hair soft and doesnt weigh it down. Great for everyday use. I have a long colored hair,</li>
    <li> The shampoo is way too watered down and does not do a good job at cleaning my hair. The conditioner is great! However, I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again as the shampoo just is not a good hair product. The product smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I really love it! My hair is so shiny and I have less less breakage. The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather as much as I was used to, but it left my hair feeling clean and smooth. The conditioner leave my hair feeling like silk. And everything smells like orange sherbet, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner weighed my hair down. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  Makes hair clean and soft with just a little bit of product.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Bought it because it was sulphate free, which was necessary for maintenance of my Straightening procedures.  Has a great sense and leaves my hair feeling fantastic.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> makes hair soft.... but causes enough hair loss for me to not buy it again!</li>
    <li> Smells &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t mind the scent....very light.  Not noticing any difference from other sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for several days and really like it. It keeps my hair looking healthy, shiny, and full without making it too &#x27;puffy.&#x27; I get keratin treatments a few times per year, and I think this shampoo/conditioner will help me extend the time between treatments a little longer. It seems to keep my (erratic) natural waves under control.</li>
    <li> I only shampoo my hair every three days, so haven’t had much time to experience your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;But, I have used it twice and am very impressed with the difference it is making in my hair. Previously, my hair had a lot of fly aways and I don’t see that happening now.&lt;br /&gt;And, I am noticing that my hair doesn’t take as long to dry and doesn’t need as much time with the flat iron because I am able to maintain my hairstyle with just a few minutes with the blow dryer! Definitely a plus for a busy morning!&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing more improvement with my hair as I continue to use Vizeri shampoo and Conditioner!</li>
    <li> Awful. Immediately made my hair feel severely coarse, I had to condition it before I could continue to wash it. I have never had probems with my hair tangling, until I started using this shampoo/conditioner. I gave it three different tries, I ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner every other day for about a week and I must tell you it is absolutely fantastic!  I am a 62 year old woman with thinning hair and a severe allergy to sulfates in shampoo. I was drawn to the product because I wear my hair long and it is colored  dark blonde with highlights so I wanted something that would shine and make my hair silky when I swing it around. I&#x27;m in a band so long hair is a must for me. That&#x27;s a tall order for chemically treated  thinning hair.  Your shampoo and conditioner have made my hair thicker silkier and a lot prettier. In fact people have stopped me to ask about my hair!  Really??!!  That has not happened for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love and am ordering more right away. I especially appreciate a sulfate free shampoo that makes my hair look good. I suffer from peri oral dermatitis caused by sulfates and fluoride so I haven&#x27;t found a sulfate free shampoo (until now) that looks  this great.  I will be bragging about this set of shampoo and conditioner to everyone I meet. I may even send you a photo of my amazing hair!  Thanks so much for the product. I&#x27;m a true believer and your biggest fan.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping I would like these a lot more than I did. 1st off, the bottles are very small. I colored my hair red and wanted a shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t make my color fade. Well not only did it fade in around a week and 1/2, my hair felt like it had a silicone residue on it. Not oily, but slimy and slippery. The only good thing about this shampoo conditioner is that it smells awesome. But for $40, not worth the money at all for me</li>
    <li> This is the note I wrote to the president of this company:&lt;br /&gt;I have just used your product for the second time. The first time I followed your suggestion and only washed once with it. Although my hair felt a little better, it did not yet feel soft and wavy, which is the natural state for my hair. Today was different. I washed twice and left the conditioner on for a couple of minutes while in the shower (have to be short ones now; California is under drought). My hair has a new lease on life! It is soft and silky and bouncy with waves.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Love these products!  My hair feels like silky hair instead of a haystack!</li>
    <li> In simple words: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp;#60;3 the best part is that it is Sulfate Free!!! My hair looks amazing every time I use this products... I highly recommend this to every woman who wants to treat in a nice way the hair</li>
    <li> The conditioner is five stars and the shampoo is two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If looking for a shampoo that is safe for keratin treated hair, I did not think that this was one was that great.  I found the shampoo very hard to spread because it doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  I am ok without a lot of lather since many keratin safe shampoos don&#x27;t lather well.  But with this one, I had to use so much shampoo to get my hair cleaned because it was so hard to get spread throughout my hair.  I thought that the Theorie shampoo was much better.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I2ELY60/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner on the other hand has a great orange smell and feels great going in - making it feel smooth and detangled.</li>
    <li> Product clearly states on the bottle it is color safe, sulfate free, and paraben free. If I had paid more than a dollar for this I would have been furious for the fact it almost literally dropped the color out of my hair as if it were fresh color. I had never rinsed so much color out of my har in one wash. Smells like orange creamsicle, also orange in color. Probably not that best product for heavily bleached or foiled blondes. I would not recomend if you have color treated hair period.</li>
    <li> Finally found a shampoo and conditioner that works for long hair.  Most shampoos leave my hair dry and brittle.  This shampoo gives depth and leaves your hair thoroughly conditioned.  Also helps with dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Just OK. I see no difference in my hair with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars!  I feel like I have been searching forever to find a decent shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate and paraben-free.  I&#x27;ve tried several at Whole Foods but they don&#x27;t foam well and my hair just feels kinda limp after.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  Not only does it smell incredible (kind of like an orange creamsicle!) but my hair looks amazing afterwards - lots of volume, easy to style and so much less frizz than normal.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find another sulfate/paraben-free product that even comes close to this.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the set. My hair I such softer and feels healthier since I&lt;br /&gt;made the purchase. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different jn regards to my&lt;br /&gt;color but I recently colored it so may be too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I like the design of your bottles and the smell.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Well worth the price. Made my hair shiny and soft! And the company emailed me to make sure I got it!</li>
    <li> Am very happy with the shampoo and conditioner. It really helps maintain my keratin treatment for a longer period. My hair appears in control and ease of frizz after use</li>
    <li> I have Only have used this product a couple of times but I can tell a difference in softness and shine.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Highly Recommend! Thank you!!!!!!  The Conditioner smells great as well, I just wish there was more in the bottle.  Hair is super SUPER soft with this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great and smells just like orange/vanilla popsicles!!  For people who enjoy using Wen but, like me, must have a shampoo, this is the answer!  The customer service is superb and the product is definitely legitimate.  Very happy with this purchase and will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few Shampoo&#x27;s and Conditioner&#x27;s out there that I have tried that helps keep my hair in control and not dry and frizzy.  I will continue to use this because sometimes I ran out and had to buy something local and my hair was right back to dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I recieved my order on time and so far have really liked what I&#x27;m seeing. I have not used shampoo without sulfates and all of the extra added chemicals, so it is going to take me a little bit to get used to the fact that it does not lather much. It makes my hair very soft and I love the smell :) I was also very impressed with the wonderful customer service that I have received from the seller. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my hair after only the first use. I have extremely frizzy, dry, and damaged hair. I color my roots every three weeks and use a very hot dryer and iron every day to control the frizz and curls. I have used so many other products that claim they can control the frizz, but a short time after their use, the frizz always comes back. Not so with this shampoo and conditioner. I was amazed that even with the high humidity, my hair stayed frizz free the entire day and my hair really did feel it had more volume. The product did not weigh my hair down or make it appear greasy. It was smooth and soft and looked really good. I was hesitant about trying it because I have so many unused bottles of shampoo and conditioner in my cabinet but I am so glad I tried this. It really works.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the use of the Vizeri shampoo and conditioner.  As a follow-up to my keratin treatment I truly believe this has been the best product that I could have used. Did notice just this week that sometimes shampooing twice before using conditioner made my hair &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like I was getting it cleaner. Created more suds with second shampoo. Physically combing through the conditioner before rinsing also worked wonders.  Wonderful product. Will definitely buy more. Thanks for such wonderful customer service too.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner, loved it immediately. I am a senior and have gray and white hair.  I was having an issue with my scalp and read about your product. I really like the feel, softness and shine.  I will definitely stay with this product.  Thanks so much for your interest.&lt;br /&gt;Nancy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The shampoo had more lather than I expected it to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Original message ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi Tim, I received the shampoo and conditioner, loved it immediately. I am a senior and have gray and white hair.  I was having an issue with my scalp and read about your product. I really like the feel, softness and shine.  I will definitely stay with this product.  Thanks so much for your interest.&lt;br /&gt;Nancy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The shampoo had more lather than I expected it to have.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have very thick, curly, color processed hair, a little below my shoulders. My hair was very dry and frizzy before I began using these products. After using them only about five times, I definitely see improvement in my hair. It is much softer, shinier and less frizzy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally impressed with this product and with the level of customer service.  Their concern for my satisfaction is top notch. I&#x27;ve received two personal emails directly from the company and I&#x27;m impressed with their personal touch. I&#x27;m very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner. I have keratin treated hair and have been using Coppola shampoo/conditioner for a few years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried another brand and I will be a repeat customer.  I like the fragrance and it works well with my fine hair.  I would like the option to purchase the 33 oz size for both and I don&#x27;t believe I saw that size on Amazon.  But other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased and will order again.</li>
    <li> Great effective product! I highly recommend it! Made my hair soft and shiny. I will definitely reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> One of the best sulfate free shampoo/conditioners I&#x27;ve used. Smells lovely, but is a light sent so you don&#x27;t reek all day which I like. I use on my toddlers hair as well.</li>
    <li> Not bad. I  like it because is light and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
    <li> The order arrived promptly and perfectly. It was a gift for my grown daughter who has colored hair (currently black with blue beneath).&lt;br /&gt;She loves it...please see her thank you:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;it is SO GREAT! I used it yesterday and it was so yummy smelling. my hair is really soft and no color rinsed out. thank you so so much for giving me the shampoo!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love it! I have naturally curly hair and the argan oil makes my hair soft and no frizz! I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Love this product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved the personal touch of an email from the company after purchasing. And now that my daughter and I have both used the shampoo &amp; conditioner, I can absolutely say this is the BEST we have ever used. Will definitely recommend and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great product but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying that I have long, fine/thin color treated hair.  I&#x27;ve always been happy with the color I want to be but very frustrated with having dry/damaged/frizzy hair that just looks terrible until I wash it and still not happy with the results.  I tried numerous &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products over time and nothing was working that claimed it would and wasting money as well.&lt;br /&gt;I started coming across articles in magazines talking about Moraccan Argan Oil and over the holidays I got a gift card to use with amazon.  I remember coming across Vizeri Moraccan Argan Oil hair care line and was impressed with the reviews and decided to give your product a try.&lt;br /&gt;My first use I was very happy but with my past I felt I needed more time to try the product out and I use the line 3-4 days a week and have been for the past 2 or so weeks and &amp;#34;LOVE IT&amp;#34;.  Your product is true and does exactly what the reviews and your website says it will do.  My hair is restored/healthy/no frizzy hair and is actually fuller and nice and shines alot.  In fact I had my husband order two more sets of your product and will continue to support your company.  My hairdresser that I&#x27;ve been seeing for a few years even said this is the best she has ever seen my hair; since it is usually dry/damaged/split ends and with fine hair, etc....&lt;br /&gt;Thank you once again for making a product that actually does what it says and I can&#x27;t thank you enough for actually loving the way my hair looks. :)</li>
    <li> I have hair that tends to get frizzy in the humid weather. This shampoo and conditioner are good for that type hair. Very good product I will order again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner is ok, but the description of the product is false.  It is listed as alcohol free.  However,  the 2nd ingredient in the conditioner is cetyl alcohol.  I spent this much money on this product because of the description.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for fine curly/wavy hair. It has helped keep my curls defined and kept the frizz down.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo &amp; conditioner for 4 days.  I need to wash my hair daily because it is sparse and fine&lt;br /&gt;and becomes limp and matted in the AZ heat.&lt;br /&gt;So far I do like that my hair is &amp;#34;squeaky &amp;#34; clean and that the conditioner is light -- no heavy, coated feeling.</li>
    <li> Smells great hair is soft and shiny. I use after keratin treatment with no problems. Also cruelty free! Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought those shampoo and conditioner to use as hair care after the keratin treatment. First I&#x27;ve tried them before I went to the salon and it works even without any additional hair care. My hair became so smooth and shiny! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have to say, when I ordered this shampoo/conditioner set online...I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. OMG...I am blown away with this product! My hair had become quite brittle as I&#x27;ve aged and this is like a miracle. My hair transformed. It&#x27;s lush and strong! All I can say is give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vizeri...I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> Thank you most sincerely.  This SHAMPOO and CONDITIONER has done women a great favor.  This softens  my dry hair..  I have wavy hair and since elementary, extremely dry. I can&#x27;t get over it...it is a small miracle for me.  My.first use and my hair was, smooth and soft.  You really don&#x27;t want to miss this especially if you have curly or wavy hair or any kind.  Thank you for this wonderful product. Lynn</li>
    <li> I love the smell but I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between it and store shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have waist-length naturally wavy/curly hair, which (due to a recently discovered vitamin deficiency) is so dry it feels like it&#x27;s going to break.  I was using Lea Journo at thirty dollars a bottle, and then found the rave reviews for this.  It&#x27;s just not great.  I&#x27;ve used drugstore brands that were just as moisturizing, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I initially received this shampoo and conditioner as a prize in a blog giveaway. I had never heard of it before, but when I tried it I knew that I had to find out where to buy it.  I have extremely long hair and have always had difficulty finding quality products that are suitable for my hair.  I noticed a bid difference right away after using these.  My hair has never been as soft or as shiny as it is now. I had to make sure I bought more before my first bottles ran out.  I feel confident that I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo and conditioner again. Oh, it smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like peaches and cream&lt;br /&gt;Hair super shiny&lt;br /&gt;Hair super soft&lt;br /&gt;Added bounce the day after washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair went flat 24 hours after washing&lt;br /&gt;Hair was greasy 24 hours after washing&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels like straw in shower between shampooing and conditioning&lt;br /&gt;A little pricy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heavy, straight, and fairly oily hair; never needed conditioner. Over a year ago I switched to shampoo bars because I could go up to 4 days without washing again. I wanted to try shampoo/conditioners again in hopes I could gain back some shine and curl (only in humidity...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Vizeri made my hair super shiny and soft, it became weighed down and greasy after the first day, requiring more washing than I would like. I tried using it all different fashions: Just shampoo, shampoo + conditioner all over, shampoo + conditioner only on the ends, etc etc. None seemed to do the trick. If it could last 3 days, I&#x27;d be 5 staring this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t fit for my hair (or scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the bottle until empty. I would hope after a month I would have the entire affect, but if not and something changes, I&#x27;ll update!</li>
    <li> Love that there are no harsh chemicals. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my hair, made it to heavy .. but the company IS AMAZING to work with if you need to return it. It&#x27;s worth a try and I gave my bottle to a friend to try and she loves it for her hair she puts heat and bleach on.</li>
    <li> Smells like a creamsicle! (Orange and Vanilla). I have tried plenty of other BPA/SULFATE free products, and others don&#x27;t lather well, or leave my hair feeling great for a a day, but very greasy the next day. This product has not. Hair is soft and smooth. (I have fine, curly hair). I have only had it for a week, and try not to wash my hair every day, but so far it&#x27;s a winner. Thank you!</li>
    <li> People, this is seriously the best product for keratin hair that I&#x27;ve found out there! I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products, and my hair is super dry. These people really care about their product and take the ingredients seriously.</li>
    <li> This Product works great.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with the product at all. Made my scalp itch all the time. Their customer service was great, I just have been too bust to get  back with them, however, and this is no lie I went out and purchased the least expensive Pantine products (i.e. shampoo, conditioner, and oil) and my hail and scalp recovered very quickly. I would not recommend the use of these products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to feel deceived (who does?).&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s exactly how I felt when I was using this product and read the label.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t mention the ingredients and they are everything but Sodium free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo (I&#x27;m writing them in the same order the bottle shows): Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropylamine Oxide, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Acrylates Copolymer... and so on and so on... until they get to: Oh! Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil... and a bunch of other Sodium chemicals after that including RED-55, ORANGE 4/CI... etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Water, Cetyl ALCOHOL, Dicetydimonium Chloride, Stearyl Alcohol (alcohol again!), Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Fragance (I must say, it does smells delicious! Both Shampoo and Conditioner), Hydroxyethylcellulose... Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil shows up and another 50 other ingredients (I counted them) some of them natural and some other chemicals. The conditioner (skipping the alcohol part) sounds better than the shampoo (ingredients wise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid Whole Foods (mostly to save money) but this is going back and I&#x27;ll get straight up Argan Oil there.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t cheap anyways, 40usd for 8oz!? This won&#x27;t last more than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve to say, a little bit goes a long way (as they stated) and my hair was very smooth after but I also started to get pimples all over my hair line (which I never ever did before, not even when going through puberty!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, I had high expectations reading all of the other great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 1 start because of their costumer service and that sweet email they sent after I bought the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It has completely rescued my hair. I have thick naturally curly hair. I have never had a product that has worked this well. I will never use regular shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not do anything different for me than any other normal shampoo.  HOWEVER.  I received multiple emails asking about my customer satisfaction. As soon as I responded to the 4th email in the series and said that it did nothing for me and I would not buy again, they promptly asked if I wanted a refund and delivered very quickly!  So it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what has prompted all of the rave reviews except that the company contacts you and asks for reviews and feedback. Seems that customer service on these products would be very good--the company is eager to please. As for the products, I&#x27;m not wowed. My hair isn&#x27;t remarkably softer, more manageable or less frizzy than usual. Maybe a little bit, but I&#x27;m not sure, so it&#x27;s not better enough that I would put up with the sickly sweet perfume of this shampoo again by re-purchasing. I know we were warned about the smell...that it smells like creamsicles...but it&#x27;s even sweeter than that. Like creamsicles dipped in orange-blossom honey. It just can&#x27;t be natural--other argan-oil hair products at my local natural foods store don&#x27;t smell like this. Luckily, the odor doesn&#x27;t cling too strongly on your hair after the fact.  Also, my head has been itchy, which happens when I use conventional shampoos but not when I use more natural ones. All in all, I much prefer the natural ingredients and scents of products such as Shikai, Avalon, and Acure&#x27;s argan oil shampoo/conditioner (though that left my dry hair a bit heavy/greasy), and the rich but sulfate-free lather of Shikai.</li>
    <li> I have been having hair loss issues this past year and after reading the reviews, I think I my expectations for these products was a little high. I am 57, I go to a very reputable hair salon, use the best hair products, have seen a specialist and take thyroid medication. My hair still looks the same after using these products for a week. I&#x27;m not going to stop using them to give them a fair chance and will definitely let you know after a month.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  It made my hair very silky and soft.  I am looking forward to using it often.  My hope is that it will improve some of the damage that I he done over the years.  We will see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  actually for my wife  and she absolutely loves it. EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;We are definitely going to order more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.....</li>
    <li> I like the product. Thanks Gail</li>
    <li> Love your product! Works extremely well on my dry frizzy hair without buildup and without making it greasy. Definitely improved manageability and more shine. I do not have color in my hair so I cannot speak to that but I do really love this product and will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say, I DO NOT rate products, give critiques, etc….  However; that being said, I am making an exception to my rule.  Your product is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist lectures me constantly because I wash/blow dry/flat iron and constantly brush my hair on a daily basis.  My hair is very thick, but very fine.  It is also very brittle and dried out from all of the above, along with coloring. I have frizzies galore in my hair…Or, should I say, I did until using your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use the shampoo and conditioner, do not add a smoothing product as I had to before. My brush just flows through my wet hair, which is completely tangle-free (that’s never happened before). In addition, it seems that your product has cut my drying time in half.  My hair doesn’t seem to hold the water as much as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and will give your product 10 out of 10 stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have 1 complaint:  Is the 8 oz. bottle the largest bottle you have for sale?  I am continuing to wash my hair every day, and your product (even though I use very little) will not last me long at that rate. If you don’t sell anything larger, perhaps you should start with me, as I DO NOT want to run out of this amazing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks the same as it did when I had a keratin treatment – smooth, shiny, soft, (I don’t even have to flat iron most of the time) and not breaking as it was before…. And I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have come up with a hair Miracle Treatment! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the vizeri shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an argan oil and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for several years.&lt;br /&gt;So I was already used to the light airy feeling you experience using this kind of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After using vizeri for 1 week.... I think I like it better. I love the smell and I love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would however like bigger bottles. I have long hair and it takes quite a bit of conditioner for me.&lt;br /&gt;I think my hair does seem a little stronger already. Maybe. I also think it has helped with frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> smells great, hair feels healthier and shinier.  i will be a return user</li>
    <li> I think I just found the PERFECT hair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner!!! I have &amp;#34;menopause&amp;#34; hair that has taken it&#x27;s abuse over the years through coloring, flat irons, blow drying, straightening, etc., etc. and NOW thinning, breaking and falling out due to menopause. After only one use of the shampoo and conditioner that I am seeing a 90% difference already? THANK YOU VIZERI, you have a customer FOREVER!!</li>
    <li> When I bought your product I bought it for my lovely wife cause she needed something for hair, I have no hair but that&#x27;s not what this is about, as per my wife, she is very satisfied with the product, she has seen a great improvement on her hair, very shine, manageable and clean. She would definitely keep using your product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great products I have damaged hair from highlights made my hair less frizzy and easier to style</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo/conditioner combo with Amazon Prime in a slightly desperate situation.  Had just splurged on a Keratin Express treatment at the salon and did not realize that afterwards would have to use hair products without sulfates and sodium chloride. The smell of shampoos/conditioners is really important to me for some reason- I think I have a sensitive nose.  For me these smelled like an orange creamsicle.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just somewhat unexpected.  That being said, I did like the way my hair felt after using these products.  Soft and definitely less frizz for my hair.  It&#x27;s a little hard to say how much of this is due to my Keratin treatment (was my first time having one) but I think I would keep using this sulfate free stuff even after the Keratin wears off.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to write you and tell you how awesome this shampoo/conditioner is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have probably not even used this shampoo a full week, but I wash my hair every day :/  So I take a toll on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having post menopausal (old lady Hair, as I call it! lol), my hair was so dry and damaged from not only coloring it, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from styling irons, and blower dryers, it was literally getting shorter and shorter, just from breaking off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a difference in just a few days.  Which is awesome!  It doesn&#x27;t feel like straw anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely love love love it!!</li>
    <li> This product smells like an orange creamsicle! So far, it has made my usually coarse, frizzy, curly hair which I regularly straighten to be shiny, silky and soft. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but so far so good! I should also add that I only need to wash one to two times a week because of the nature of my hair! I should also add that I have an oily scalp with dandruff and so far, it definitely has diminished the oiliness but not the dandruff. We shall see what it does for that!</li>
    <li> I swim at least 2 times a week Nd this product keeps my hair healthy !</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Leaves your hair very clean and shiny with no oily or waxy residue. Get a professional wash like you went to the salon.</li>
    <li> I got my shampoo and conditioner today.  I live in South Carolina and my hair is always so thick and wavy the humidity is crazy high here. My hair always looks similar to a dandelion no matter what product I use.  After my shower, I could not believe how smooth and different my hair looks.  It is unbelievable and I was not sure what to expect since using practically every product at the drug store.  I can&#x27;t wait to share my experience with my family and friends.  Thank you for such a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the shampoo did not work well for me.  I had high hopes for it after reading many good reviews, however, it didn&#x27;t work well for my highlighted, baby fine, stick straight hair.  It seemed to &amp;#34;over clean&amp;#34; my hair and left it tangled.  Of course the conditioner helped with that, but my hair didn&#x27;t behave well afterward (styling, etc.) with these products.  I&#x27;m sure they would be good for people with better hair than I have.</li>
    <li> I love using this shampoo and conditioner for my color treated hair.  I noticed a difference after one wash. I continued use and still feel the way I did after my initial use. I love it! My previous dyed, frizzy, and fried looking hair, now looks healthier than ever.  The results are amazing, leaving my hair looking as if I&#x27;d stepped out of a salon. Can&#x27;t say it enough...I love it!</li>
    <li> These appear to be good products, so far my hair seems to like it.  I have only used the product for a month, but will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just got it in today and tried it. My hair felt so soft! I would recommend this to anybody. It is a must have.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I tried this product because I have used salon quality shampoos &amp; conditioners have been pleased with those.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with the shampoo &amp; conditioner but after a couple weeks of use (every other day) I can tell that my hair is shinier and is stronger.  My hair was becoming dull and lost its sheen due to years of coloring my hair.  This has brought back the youthful shine I always used to have.  I read reviews where it doesn&#x27;t suds up well and it&#x27;s intended to be that way.  A lot time what makes shampoo sudsy also strips the hair.  Suds don&#x27;t make a product clean any better.  I feel like this is a pretty good product and will be buying again.  I recommend to others to try.  Plus the good thing is that there is a guarantee if you are not satisfied.  So there&#x27;s nothing to lose.  How many hair products give you that guarantee?  This is a first for me.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it was supposed to be color-safe and had all the recommendations my colorist said to look for.  However, the shampoo is not color safe.  I had my hair dyed mermaid purple, which means it&#x27;s several shades of purple, and every time I wash my hair streams of purple flow down my body.  I&#x27;m only washing it twice, maybe three times a week.  It shouldn&#x27;t be loosing this much color.  The conditioner is lovely, but for the price and size, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth it. The picture is the two bottles I received next to my iPhone 4s.  Update: The company contacted me after this review and offered me a complete refund without having to return the product.  It was unexpected and welcomed.  For that, I have increased my star rating from 2 to 4.</li>
    <li> just tried it once and then packed both for a  trip to France.  On this try I like the shampoo and conditioner. I have a Brazilian straightening and am careful which shampoo to use but your shampoo cleaned my hair well and it was nice and shiny when dry.Thank you.</li>
    <li> I tried this just because it has argan which I use on my skin. I must say it is the best shampoo. I&#x27;ve used Aveda and this is just as good, but I think the effects last longer. I surf, circuit train and swim so my hair gets demolished and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t even need to be used daily to stay up on it. I only wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> Really helps manage my frizzy hair and I love the smell.  My favorite shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering/using this shampoo and conditioner for about a year now -- terrific product!! Originally I was looking for a sulfate and sodium free product after a brazillian blowout and this had great reviews.  Vizeri leaves my hair shiny and strong and feeling great. Only problem has been discount codes not working (the stuff is good - but pricey) and products being out of stock.  Overall, he customer service is good and the product is great -- just wish large sizes at better prices were regularly available (would be even better with a pump top) and that they were on the Amazon automatic re-order thing... now that would be great! Oh - btw - I also have their boars bristle brush and love it!! Thanks, Vizeri!!</li>
    <li> I have received the shampoo/conditioner.  Thank you.  It is a wonderful product.  My hair feels silky and, after rinsing, like it has been left with a protective shield over each strand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and notice some customers stating a difference in hair loss as well as hair health, so I decided to try your product since this is my main concern right now. I wash my hair every other day, so it&#x27;s only been a little over a week that I&#x27;ve been using your product. So far, I&#x27;m not noticing a hair loss difference but love the condition my hair is in.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Moroccan Argan Oil set for awhile now, and I love it!  The conditioner not only makes my hair feel great, but it also detangles, which I really need.  I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> OMG THIS IS A GIFT OF GOD, THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER IS THE BEST IS LIKE HITTING A LOTTERY, I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO LOOK ANYMORE  FOR NOTHING ELSE, I JUST FOUND IT THE VIZERI PRODUCTS. THANK YOU WHOM EVER  MADE THIS</li>
    <li> Have used this product exclusively for my most recent hair washing (3 times).  My first opinion of this product was very favorable.  My hair seemed fuller and less dry.  After my third use I am sold on this product.  My hair is fuller, more manageable, less dry and so much softer looking and feeling, not too mention the shine is coming back.  I have used another sulfate-free shampoo in the past and although I knew I was using a shampoo system that was better for my hair it left me wanting something more, something better.  &amp;#34;When&amp;#34; I used this other sulfate-free shampoo it required so much product and so much time and my hair just did not seem very clean or in that much better condition.  So when I stumbled onto this line &amp;#34;Vizeri&amp;#34; I was unsure if the product would be what it claimed to be.  To my surprise and pleasure this shampoo has truly proven itself.  I will use this product exclusively from this point forward.  Thank you Vizeri for making such a quality product.  Oh, and by the way, both the shampoo and conditioner have such a wonderful smell; clean with a slightly sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I received this product three days ago and in the first wash I saw an amazing difference. I have Indian frizzy hair, wavy curly. I couldn&#x27;t go to work without straightening because it looked so disorderly, bedroom hair. This product calmed my hair down like a brazilian blowout, which costs tons and doesn&#x27;t last. I could feel it relax immediately just as I put it on the first time. Then again, the second time it had the same affect. I love this product and i will no doubt be buying it again. You have a customer for life! I&#x27;ll be buying their other products too. Btw, i get out of the shower, spray some oil protectant on it, and my hair is good to go. It stays down, calm, curls form beautifully, and I can wear a suit with it and look great. Highly recommend, it&#x27;s life changing for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.  My hair seems to be eaiser to brush or comb out after using it.  I have fine, curly/wavy hair and I like how my hair feels softer and fluffier.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  The only problem is that it makes the top part of my hair look frizzy, so I have to use my straightener to smooth it out.  It looks great after that.</li>
    <li> This is the best sulfate and salt free shampoo and conditioner I have tried.  I would rather not have the added artificial colors,though.  I also don&#x27;t know if I would consistently spend $40 on such small bottles.</li>
    <li> The end result comes out ok, however, after using another product THIS shampoo leaves my hair very dry and tangled before I use the conditioner. I would not purchase it again since I have other options.</li>
    <li> The product is not packaged nicely as pictured; it arrived in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like orange dreamsicles, yummy!&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product it is NOT COLOR SAFE as described.  It stripped my hair color with only one wash!</li>
    <li> I have been on a search for a sulfate and nasty stuff free shampoo and conditioner for a while.  My search is finally over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have damaged hair or over processed hair.  I do have a problem with certain shampoos that they bring me out with dandruff (gross!).  I also find that when I&#x27;m straightening my hair that I have plenty of fly away hairs towards the top part of my head and no matter what I do they always stick up - drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway after using the shampoo for the first time I was a little skeptical.  You only need a tiny bit of this stuff.  Smells like orange creamsicle which is very nice.  I followed the directions on the hair care book which is given after the purchase and OMG my hair is so soft afterwards, like silky smooth.  No fly away bits of hair that sticks out either.  And no dandruff!  Love it!  The other thing I noticed, I was washing my hair every other day.  I got to day three and my hair still looking fresh.  It was only out of my own personal hygiene that I decided to wash my hair, I&#x27;m sure I could have got to day 5 without washing but the thought of that was too gross for me to entertain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it you will love it!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does the same job as the stuff my salon was selling me, but at such a lower cost. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> So far, I love it for my processed naturally curly hair.  Not only does it smell amazing, but it cleans good without stripping all the natural oils thus feeling like straw.  I can wash my hair every other day and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy either.  I really hope that it&#x27;s anti-fade representation holds true.</li>
    <li> I have had the chance to use these product about four times now.  I am following the directions on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working really well I do notice my hair now has a shine to it by just washing and conditioning it with these product.  I don&#x27;t have to add more products or conditioners to my hair after washing.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. leaves hair softer, and easier to dry. As advertised---you need to use very little. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Great product, very happy I found this!  Will continue re-ordering!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a month and a half and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shinier, more volume, less frizzy, easier to style and it helps  maintain my hair color longer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vizeri!</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I asked for..  Leaves the hair hydrated and soft!</li>
    <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t take the time to write a product review, but I have to say - this product does not disappoint! I had been searching for a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair feeling soft and &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; (I have struggled as many other sulfate free conditioners haven&#x27;t done that for my hair - I have thick wavy hair). I had no luck in my search until I found this product. Not only does it smell amazing, but both the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling smooth, silky and all around fantastic! Well worth the price. The Vizeri argan oil has been a wonderful addition to my hair care routine as well! I would have no hesitation to purchase any and all Vizeri products in the future. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The scent of these products really do smell great. The shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the way my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year now.  I just wanted to add that I recently changed to another Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner in the interest of saving a few dollars, and like I stated in my original review - you get what you pay for!  The cheaper stuff left my dry ends feeling like straw, whereas the Vizeri softens and hydrates them.  I learned my lesson:  I&#x27;m sticking with Vizeri!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this shampoo and conditioner.  I bought them several weeks ago and to this day they continue to leave my hair feeling sleek, glossy, and soft.  I tend to have very frizzy hair, but this combo really tames it, especially when used with the Vizeri 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.  I also have sensitive skin and these do not aggravate it in the slightest.  The scent is like others have stated, like an orange creamsicle.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I&#x27;m a firm believer in getting what you pay for, and Vizeri doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> For years I have been looking for the right shampoo/conditioner combo and I believe I have finally found it.  My hair is normally dry, brittle and ridiculously frizzy. These products have helped to make my hair much more managable, soft and smooth. Although I have only been using it for a few weeks, I have seen improvement and plan on continuing to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS AMAZING for my frizzy hair but wont buy again - sooo pricey.</li>
    <li> I am back and forth with these products. First of all, it&#x27;s so great that the company is very considerate, understanding, and not evil like the rest appear to be, thanks Vizeri!&lt;br /&gt;Next, this product is awesome. I will try my best not to seem hypocritical or ungrateful, but I must admit a few of the ingredients cause me suspicion. I will address that later, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me focus on the greatness of the product. Yesterday, I received my Vizeri Beauty package (which also included my coconut oil) and I HAD to brush my hair (which the brush is amazing BTW), and I was excited about that. I went to sleep with coconut oil in my hair planning to shower with my new shampoo and conditioner in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The smell and consistency are impressive. It smells of an orange creamsicle, which is not my preference (I wish you could choose different fragrances!), but of course I will live with it. Reason being, the consistency is very independent and impressive. It doesn&#x27;t run all over the place, it&#x27;s fluffy, and very &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feeling, if you can understand what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo went in easy, it did not glob up in your hair (resulting in overuse of product) nor does it cling to your hair on a mission of ruining your hair oils. With my thick hair, I usually need 2 quarter sized dabs of hair product, but with this one, I used a nickel size and it covered my entire scalp and roots, which is all you need shampoo for. After a few seconds, I washed the shampoo out and I was shocked! Have you ever used a shampoo that literally stripped your hair of any moisture and left it feeling dry and stiff even in the shower? This shampoo leaves your hair feeling comfortably moisturized while it awaits it&#x27;s best friend, conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I am petting my wet hair as I say this, the conditioner leaves your hair airy and silky smooth. I admit, I thought I felt my hair feeling more airy, or voluminous (or fluffy!), when I was still in the shower, but I thought it may have been psychological.&lt;br /&gt;NOPE! Vizeri Beauty hair products DO NOT LIE! Even in the shower both shampoo and conditioner will leave you moisturized and voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have time any longer, but I did look up some ingredients that were in the shampoo. Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (which is deemed 100% natural) and Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate (it is neither good or bad. It isn&#x27;t organic but it isn&#x27;t a regular chemical either. It is not bad for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- leaves hair healthy, conditioned, airy, and voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;- impressive ingredients that I had found.&lt;br /&gt;- amazing company, very considerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- (for me) the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;- the 8 fl oz. measures approximately 7&amp;#34; / 18cm tall&lt;br /&gt;- to minimize product waste, Google how to appropriately apply shampoo and conditioner. The information I know is: shampoo your roots (it will run down the rest of your hair upon wash), condition from the ends to the scalp (mind your roots). Start with a quarter size amount and build up if you need to.</li>
    <li> I am just getting started with these products.  They feel great and I am very happy so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed and that&#x27;s not so easy to accomplish. My hair was noticeably better conditioned without the flat greasy look you get with so many well conditioning products. I was totally sold on another brand that I couldn&#x27;t get immediately so I tried this one, Oh My Gosh, what a find! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!!! Conditioner is fabulous...my hair length is just past my shoulders and found that only a little really conditions my hair.  Smells great too! My hair definately feels fuller and softer and looks fabulous.  A definate reorder!</li>
    <li> Shampoo makes my color run more so than when I used sulfate free shampoos but conditioner has no wash out. Product leave my hair SUPER soft so benefit is worth a little extra hair dye down the drain!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good.  I used to use the Coppola Keratin shampoo but never liked the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I like this a lot better.  My husband even said yesterday “your hair smells so good”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like it conditions my hair and helps with frizz/humidity problems.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the products! I have definitely noticed that my hair is more manageable/less frizzy as well as shinier. My color also does not seem to have faded much since I got it done a few weeks ago. When I use the shampoo and conditioner, my hair feels great after! I only wish the bottles were bigger. Besides that, it is a great product and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love the shampoo and conditioner. It leaves our hair so shiny and silky. We never feel like our hair is being stripped of nutrients....it feels infused with nutrients.</li>
    <li> As a shampoo it isn&#x27;t supposed to lather and it did so I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this.</li>
    <li> Really is a great shampoo/conditioner.  Scent is citrusy.  Great for hair treated with keratin.</li>
    <li> My hair has a mind of its own--at war with most shampoos and conditioners.  A redhead all my life, I must rely on expensive trips to the salon for my auburn now.  I had read all the reviews.  Some said they watched the color run down the drain with their first shampoo.  Most reviews praised the shampoo.  For days, I agonized over my decision to order the shampoo and conditioner.  Red fades so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color treated REDS take note.  NO WASHOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!  No red running down the drain.  No red on the old white towel I wrapped around my wet head.  My auburn was shinning and red, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next problem my hair seems to have is a sensitivity to conditioners.  Most conditioners are too r heavy.  I travel a lot.  As soon as I arrive at the hotels, my hairstyle falls and my hair clings to my head.  It is an ugly sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with fine, limp hair take note.  My bobbed hair was fuller than it has ever been and STAYED full for five days, even in the hotel.  Most of the blow drying was done with my hands and finished with a round brush.  It was unbelievably easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hair products were the same, except for the Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner.  I can only attribute this beautiful hair to the shampoo and conditioner.  If you are agonizing, like I did, just hit &amp;#34;order&amp;#34;.  Your hair will love you for it</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have color and keratin in my hair. This has helped to maintain it.</li>
    <li> I am very much enjoying the product I have purchased through VZ Solutions.  To specifically address specific items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Increase in brilliance - I don&#x27;t shampoo everyday, but I do use the conditioner everytime I wet my hair and I do notice an increase in brilliance.  My hair appears to be more shiny and healthy than when I use my alternative brands&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced brittleness - My hair has been heavily process over the years so this will take time to notice.  However, the strands of my locks do appear to be more full and perhaps stronger&lt;br /&gt;- Improved manageability - this is perhaps what I have noticed the most.  I use less product and my blowdry time has been cut down as well.  Healthy hair needs less manageability.&lt;br /&gt;- Less frizz - This too has been a noticeable change.  I ususally use my straightener to calm frizz and I find I only need it for the really unruly pieces after a couple of weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;- More shine - As I stated above, my hair appears to be more shiny and continues to be so as I use the conditioner more regularly&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced color fading - My hair had fresh highlights when I purchased the shampoo and conditioner so I&#x27;m not sure color fading per se would apply to me, but the toner used over my highlights has not gone brassy which does tend to happen with my highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with my purchase.  It did exceed my expectations and I will likely continue to use the shampoo and conditioner going forward.</li>
    <li> sulfate free as recommended by my hair sylist to protect color. Nice fragrance and hair feels soft after using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo and conditioner twice but so far I am loving everything about them and my hair. The scent is amazing, the shampoo is thick, and the conditioner is so effective. The amount needed for my thick, medium length hair is much less than I expected. No tangles, soft to the touch and full of body without frizz. Worth the price.    It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks - Update  My hair has never been more lovely. No tangles, no frizz, no knots, soft and easy to manage. So thrilled!    Try it and see if you agree.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best ever!  My hair was really dry and brittle.  I had been using a knock off brand and my hair actually started falling out.  After 3 uses of this shampoo and conditioner, my hair is much more manageable and is breaking less,  Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I just got out of the shower and omg!!! My hair feels incredible.I did wash my hair twice and left conditioner on for 3 min then rinsed it out. I&#x27;m definitely buying this product again..and I also. Got it in two days! I ordered it on Sunday and got it on Tuesday( today). Awesome fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Arrived the same day and then received  a follow up email from the seller reminding me that I could return the product if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  That was a really nice touch, they have the 30 day guarantee advertised on the posting, but it was nice to hear again from the actual seller.  They even offered and even offered a discount on my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s a fantastic shampoo and conditioner.  I recently had my hair straightened with a Keratin treatment and initially was given the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner and that just made my head itch, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I then embarked on a ton of research and found the Vizeri to be highly regarded, and with the 30 day guarantee, I felt comfortable giving it a try. What a huge difference, both the shampoo and conditioner are great products and leave my hair super soft.  The Keratin treatment is holding up, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ve been recommending this to my friends and family, so we&#x27;re all using it now.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of scent, and was pleased to see that while the scent is pleasant, it&#x27;s also very mild and not something that even stays in your hair during the day.  That&#x27;s another big plus in an otherwise great product.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Sorry it has taken me so long to respond concerning my recent first time purchase of your Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. It truly has been the best product I have ever tried to take care of all my hair issues. softness, no frizz, shine etc.... I personaly really appreciate that I no longer have to use a leave in conditioner. I do switch off with other choices as I want it to last longer. I spend a lot on my hair and if I can stretch a dollar I will.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner work as advertised. Leaves hair soft and shiny with no feeling of a pasty residue. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell but after just two days I grew to love it. The orange vanilla smell is great and I look forward to using it. Also Vizeri  is committed to their product and customer service guaranteeing complete satisfaction or your money back Great product will continue using.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this as well as how amazing my hair feels after I wash it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair, this shampoo and conditioner is wonderful, my hair feels great, I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Bought shampoo for my keratin treated hair.  Shampoo worked great.  Would use a little at first and really scrub my scalp, rinse, and repeat with a little more so that my hair was thoroughly clean.  The conditioner (had to buy together) smells good but is TOO much.  It is hard to rinse out and left my hair limp and almost sticky.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair dresser recommended it after I had a Brazilian blow out.  It made my hair feel really clean and the smell was great.  I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Great combo that left my hair soft and easy to comb through!</li>
    <li> I love both products,my hair feels more soft and looks very shiny. Awesome service and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I was a little skeptical as it seemed a little spendy however my hair is shinier, less frizzy, and very soft.  I&#x27;m hoping to get some bigger bottles that will last longer.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair feel health and soft after using these products. The conditioner smells like dreamsickle ice cream!</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time and saw a difference. My hair had a lot less frizz and felt smoother and healthier. I didn&#x27;t need to use my flat iron after I blow dried. I did use their pure Argan oil as well and maybe put a bit too much cuz I noticed it in my hair which was a bit too greasy looking for me. I think if I use a lot less it will be great. Overall great product and can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner it makes my hair feel so soft and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> It really results/benefits your hair a brilliant and nourishing effects.</li>
    <li> I hate the way this smells...I wanted to send it back but didn&#x27;t get it in the mail soon enough for the return policy.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been super dry from swimming in the ocean and being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, it was already much silkier!&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back was that it took more of the product than I expected to get my hair to lather (its long).</li>
    <li> When I received my Argan oil Shampoo and Conditioner, I used it, immediately.  My hair is so soft and silky.  I like that it is sulfate free and contains Argan Oil.  It is a bit pricier than I usually pay for hair products but I think it will be well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have received my products and so far I&#x27;m am very, very pleased. It&#x27;s been 7 days and I&#x27;m already seeing less hair loss and I absolutely love the way the product makes my hair feel. The product smells great as well. I can already tell a big difference in the texture of my hair. It&#x27;s very soft, no frizz, and very manageable. I will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> I purposely looked for an Argan Oil product to improve my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Your product is the only one that has done so.&lt;br /&gt;I am 71, have always had good hair, but have colored treated it since age forty---In recent years it has become dry, dull, and because it&#x27;s thick, rather wild looking.This product has provided a great improvement.Of course, it won&#x27;t be what it once was,but my hair is much improved and it doesn&#x27;t look like&amp;#34;old hair&amp;#34;any longer</li>
    <li> My hair is very manageable and the products are very gentle.  I have seen that my color and my Brazilian keratin treatment have stayed very well this last week or so, which usually isn&#x27;t the case with other products.  There is little to nothing on the market that is sulfate, sodium chloride, and paraben free, while not testing on animals and having smoothing ingredients in them (like argan oil), so your product is truly one of a kind.  Plus, it smells great!  One suggestion: 1.  Can you please make bigger sizes?  I realize a little goes a long way, but I will still go through that small bottle in a matter of a couple of weeks.  I also loved that the owner actually sent me a personal email asking my feedback and thanking me for purchasing!  I am a TOUGH critic, and I will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> The product smells great. Takes a little getting use to the shampoo not lathering up like regular types of shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair got more shine now after using this set even without expensive ironic dryer.  Less frizz however, not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You can feel the change in your hair with the first wash. I have used many different types is shampoo but this product actually works.</li>
    <li> I bought this a little skeptically, thinking it looked like a good price and a comparable product to some of the other argan oil products out there. I have naturally dry, curly/wavy (depending on length) hair that is color treated and highlighted, so lately my hair has been looking dull, dry and honestly crispy. I have now been using this product for two weeks, and it has changed my hair texture and health drastically. My hair has become incredibly soft, pliant and healthy, without losing out on texture. What I really liked is that it moisturized without weighing the hair down at all. Even in the shower, after application, my hair already feels great, and the shine and bounce are there whether I blow dry or air dry my hair. I also like that it has a pleasant but subtle scent - hair just smells clean but not perfumed. I truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for 10 days now and my hair feels amazing. It has made my hair silky smooth and healthy. It only takes a few drops in your shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me awhile to write this review. I wanted to use the products for a few months to see if the results were long standing. Happy to report My hair feels great! Initially the shampoo was slightly irrititating to my scalp but I continued using it alternating between my previous shampoo. Now it&#x27;s better but I may continue alternating. Seems products just perform better when used this way.  I think the conditioner is really the magic bullet here and I&#x27;m using it without alternating and love how it leaves my hair feeling. Wet to blow drying I can feel the difference. Quality products and great results. Pleased 😃</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different argan oil shampoo/conditioners and this is by far the best one. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, controls fly aways  (which are always a problem for me), leaves hair shiny, silky and healthy looking, nice scent. I DON&#x27;T have to use any other products.....serum, pomade etc!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; actually kept my hair less dry / frizzy than compared to other traditional shampoos</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this product, but it leaves my hair a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy this shampoo and conditioner!  From the first time I started using it, my hair felt soft and manageable even while wet!  Even my 9 year old mentioned how much she likes it! LOL  My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t in a larger size bottle!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually a licensed cosmetologist in the state of Washington. I have used your products three times now, as I wash my hair every 3 days or so. Your product appealed to me because I have over processed hair that is both lightened and colored. I have to say, I was sceptical at first, but I really like it. My hair feels very soft, it&#x27;s shiny, and it smells amazing! Of course, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, being as it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the normal detergents, and unfortunately I have really long hair. So, I have to use a bit extra shampoo. But, that&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s healthier that way! I do really enjoy your product. But, I have to say, I won&#x27;t be continuing it because your prices are pretty high for only 8 oz bottles... I understand why they are expensive, they contain high quality ingredients. The price just isn&#x27;t right for me though. Especially because of the length of my hair... Wish you luck with your product.</li>
    <li> I did receive my shipment and started using it last week.  I have serious problem hair and I can definitely see a difference already.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.my hair never felt so smooth and frizz free .i have only used it twice but I can already feel such a huge difference.this is an awesome product</li>
    <li> I have been trying this shampoo for a month now. The shampoo and conditioner does not have too much effect on my hair yet. I do see some reduction in dandruff though. I am using argan oil along with the shampoo and conditioner. Hopefully constant use and care will improve the signs of abuse on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of different shampoos and conditioners from top brands. None of them even come close to this product.  This product  is amazing. I have colored, thin hair, that were not shiny no matter what I have been using. After first time I washed my hair with this shampoo, they look healthy, silky, shiny.  I love it and will be using again and again!</li>
    <li> I hope this will help repair my ends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, it worked ok for my hair. The only objection is the price, it is very expensive considering the size of the bottles.</li>
    <li> Its okay but my hair did seem a little greasy after a few days.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner! I have shoulder length naturally wavy hair that I usually straighten daily. My hair has been so much more soft and manageable, that I wear my natural waves much more often. I have not used my blow dryer since I started using your products. My hair is silky and full even when I do use my flat iron. I am a very happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change one thing without harming the product, I would enjoy a better scent. My hair smells clean so it&#x27;s no big deal but I am a fan of floral scents.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used the products only twice but I am very happy with the way my hair feels even after two days.  I was looking for a new argan oil shampoo to change up my usual DemaOrganic brand (also argan oil and excellent).  This shampoo and conditioner was just what I was looking for.  I wanted a sulfate free product because this 50+ hair is colored and heat styled, and I believe the argan oil and sulfate free properties keeps the color from getting brassy.  I have noticed that Vizeri stays &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; after two days without frizzies.  I have straight/slightly wavy hair and I get frizz if my hair gets slightly damp from the weather (in Seattle, its always!).  So far, no frizzies.  I recommend it.  I really appreciate the card and email from the Vizeri folks.  They took and extra step to touch base, and inform me that the product won&#x27;t suds up like products with sulfates.  Good to know.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful but really did not work with my hair type</li>
    <li> Used for the first time and very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, like the brush!&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two week&#x27;s now. After only two uses I noticed a 50% reduction in hair loss. My hair is also much softer and healthy looking. For those who have not tried it yet do not be alarmed at the lack of suds when you use the shampoo. It is a much different feeling than when you use over the counter shampoos. That sudsing effect we&#x27;re all so used to is what can actually cause the damage (loss, etc.) due to the chemicals added to the product. What a relief to have finally found an all natural shampoo and conditioner that is actually making a difference. Oh and yes the previous reviews are right on the money when they say it smells like an orange creamsicle. Another benefit....a reminder of summer!</li>
    <li> Pros: I can wash my hair and let it go 2-3 days without washing it again. I&#x27;ve never been able to do that before with other products. My hair seems thicker and fuller. No static (hate that during winter in dry Utah).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t lather very well so sometimes I feel like I have to use more product to get my whole head/hair clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different kind of shampoo... I used it and it does make your hair feel soft and curly and all that good stuff but the bottles are so small... I think they need to be bigger...This will not last me even 2 months or more... However it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner but so is curly sexy hair as well.... So it&#x27;s  a good way to try something new...</li>
    <li> I used it twice so far. It has a very good citrus aroma to it and hair feels smooth. I recently got keratin hair treatment and this brand seems a good quality one for it.</li>
    <li> I love Vizeri Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, my hair is shiny and silky and feels so much healthier. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my daughter. We have both had Brazilian Blowouts done and so needed a paraben and sulfate free product. I had mine done overseas so I brought the Chi Enviro products back with me, however I love Vizeri so much more. I am trying to only wash my hair twice a week I apply the shampoo once rinse and then shampoo again then condition and my hair has never looked better and my color hasn&#x27;t faded. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair that only grows wide not longer.  After only using this product for 3 days I am convinced that I finally found something for my unruly hair that is good for it.  I love it and love the feel of my bouncy curls.  Thank you so much for a wonderful product that I will continue to use forever... 7/1/15 Update. I have been using this product for almost a year shampoo same order as original as I only wash my hair about once a week and condition daily.  I ordered the larger conditioner within a week after the original purchase and am just now almost out of both bottles.  I love love love this product. It may be pricey but in the long run I have not had to purchase anything for my hair care for almost a 11 months so I don&#x27;t consider that pricey..</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful and leave hair soft and manageable. I contacted the seller regarding cruelty-free status of the product and his response was prompt and courteous and he assured me that the product is cruelty free, meaning neither the final product or any ingredients are tested on animals. Great transaction experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner every other day for about a week now, and my hair feels very clean and soft.  I was looking for both a shampoo AND conditioner that was alcohol-free (I already found plenty of sulfate-free shampoos/conditioners-and I couldn&#x27;t find a combo that were both free of alcohol).  My hair dresser was saying how her hair is completely different since going alcohol-free on her hair. She uses Kerastase, but it is way too expensive, and their conditioners have alcohol. I&#x27;m excited to see this product&#x27;s continued effects on my hair!</li>
    <li> It did not lather up at all and hair did not feel clean. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I love the products. Minimal lather doesn&#x27;t bother me and the conditioner leaves&lt;br /&gt;my hair feeling very smooth. I have received several comments in my hair&lt;br /&gt;recently and can only attribute that to my new products!!</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  Increased shine, smoother texture and less frizz.  The creamy texture and smell of the products are a great bonus.  i feel like I am giving my hair what it needs and highly recommend.  I am very happy to have found a more natural product in Vizeri.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner is amazing!! my hair feels amazing after getting out of the shower. i can brush/ comb through it with absolutely NO tangles. it provides better shine and manageability than any other combo ive ever used. i would recommend this combo to anyone looking to use safe, sulfate free products that deliver healthy beautiful hair. (my hair is mid-back length)</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this shampoo and conditioner for my dry, fine hair.  The first time I used it, the conditioner made my scalp oily.  The next time I used it, I did not condition my roots, which kept my scalp from getting oily, but then my hair still felt dry.  I had high expectations for these products considering I paid $30.  Very disappointed.  I have had better results from drug store shampoo and conditioner.  I would also like to say that it seems like this company (Vizeri Beauty) is very concerned with customer satisfaction (according to the emails they sent right after my purchase) but their products are junk.  Waste of money.....</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have really long, gray silvery hair and it started thinning and frizzing about a year ago.  I have since tried all kinds of products to help me with this problem, and I even discussed the issue with my doctor.  He recommended 10mg of Biotin which may or may not help with my thinning hair, and of course, it did not work for me.  I saw a TV show that talked about different types of sulfates that are routinely added to shampoos/conditioners that do damage to your hair including thinning and frizzes.  I then searched for &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner products on Amazon, and I found this one.  I have used the product now for about 5 washes and it has done wonders....not thicker overnight, but very silky and feels thicker with each wash.  I would recommend to anyone; thanks Vizeri.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, as I heard that Moroccan Oil was good for the hair and skin.  I thought all Moroccan Oil was the same. After using the Vizeri Shampoo and Conditioner, I bought another product. The new product made my hair very dry and dull.&lt;br /&gt;The Vizeri Shampoo and Conditioner, made my hair soft, lusterous, healthy and  manageable.  I will continue using the Vizeri product. Shipping was quick, and well packaged.  I recommend this product to anyone who has dry, unhealthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> Been trying it for a couple of weeks, it does leaves my hair kind of soft, but I don&#x27;t feel the difference as with any other shampoo. I have fine long (very long) hair and I don&#x27;t have to use a special shampoo to make it soft, as my hair is easy to manage. I just don&#x27;t think this shampoo has anything special. Is not bad and it smells good, but I don&#x27;t think is anything out of the ordinary</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It&#x27;s thick and my hair feels nice after washing it.  I like the shampoo and conditioner but I like them both separate.  I like using the shampoo with a different conditioner (catwalk) and I like using the conditioner with my other shampoo for curly hair.  Both great but I like to match them with other shampoo/conditioners.</li>
    <li> I love it... kept my hair moisturized and soft! Smells great also.. I&#x27;ve washed my hair more than normal.just to use it over and over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </li>
    <li> This product is Awesome. Smells good enough to eat! Like a Dreamsicle! Very grateful for the special on this. Wish family &amp; friends took advantage of this much sooner. Love that it&#x27;s paraben free &amp; sulphate free. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> LOVE the shampoo and conditioner!!  Great product!!  Has made an incredible improvement in my hair, all of the one’s listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Increase in brilliance&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced brittleness&lt;br /&gt;- Improved manageability&lt;br /&gt;- Less frizz&lt;br /&gt;- More shine&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced color fading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And more…. Am 66 yrs old, thought one shampoo was just as good as another but Vizeri Beauty Moraccan Argan Oil Shampoo proved me wrong… Am finding out it is most important to have top quality products to achieve top quality hair performance.  Love the product, will continue to use and plan to recommend to others.  Thank you for the low cost introductory offer, really opened my eyes as to what good products can produce!!..</li>
    <li> I have Lyme disease and the texture of my hair has gotten horrible...It never use to tangle and now it tangles easily...However these products have helped my hair more than anything I have found.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the email. I just wanted you to know that I have used the shampoo and conditioner products and I love them! I have curly hair that is fine and I sometimes have trouble finding products (particularly conditioners) that clean my hair and condition/moisturize it without weighing it down. These products did all that and more. My hair is soft, shiny, and my curls are bouncy and full of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your fantastic products! I will continue to purchase them!</li>
    <li> Thank you for writing again, it shows how dedicated your company is to customer satisfaction. I am almost finished with my first bottles of shampoo and conditioner and I promised I would write again when I had used your product enough times to give you feed back. First, Let me start by saying that my hair is transformed and looks great &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; with minimal styling. I haven&#x27;t been able to &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; for quite a few years! I had to use many leave in conditioners and styling products to achieve the look I wanted in addition to using a blow dryer or other appliances. Now, it is a matter of air drying with a few spritz of beachy wave spray...What a time saver. My hair is soft, shiny, manageable and looks healthy. I love that it works so well and that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that ruin hair. What a difference! I have gotten quite a few compliments over this time period and have given out the name of my new favorite hair care and how I ordered it to a few friends that have asked. I am so happy that I did my search and made the purchase. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I just used the products today and I really do see and feel a great difference already!  Perhaps after a month of continual use, I&#x27;ll be able to color my hair again.  I had been turned away for that salon service due to how brittle and dry my hair appeared to be. (Years of sulfate shampoo damage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to purchase more of these products!  I love them already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a superb job, Vizeri!</li>
    <li> I found this product on Amazon due to the excellent reviews. So when I ordered the shampoo/conditioner, I expected this to be my answer to all my hair troubles. My first day using this product, I noticed that more hair was going down the drain than usual. Now I&#x27;m not saying that the product itself has caused this, but no other shampoo or conditioner I&#x27;ve used recently had the same effect. Also I would like to note that the fragrance of this product was not desirable to me. I usually use Moroccan Oil Products in the blue bottle, so I expected the fragrance to be similar although I know they are not the same product. I was disappointed overall with my purchase. The only positive thing I can note is that the conditioner was light weight and worked well at detangling my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered your Argan  Oil shampoo and I love that is is sulfate free and really works. We are in our 60&#x27;s now and love that it cuts down on frizzy hair too and still keeps your hair looking full and healthy. Thank you so much for offering this product. Its the best!</li>
    <li> I just received my second order of Vizeri argan oil shampoo and conditioner.  I am 55 years old and have been coloring my hair for years.  Recently I experienced a lot of breakage and thinning of my hair.  After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to try it.  I have used salon quality products for years, but this beats them all!  My hair looks and feels so much healthier since using this line.  The breakage has stopped and my hair is thicker and softer.  All my friends have asked me what I have done to my hair!  This product rocks.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. My only complaint is that I wish it car in a bigger size. Other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner on my color treated hair, my hair was definitely  more soft and shiny than with the other products I had been using.  I feel that my hair is more healthy and will purchase these products again!</li>
    <li> I honestly love this shampoo and conditioner!  I live in the desert southwest on a ranch.  I have thick, heavy hair which is ravaged by the sun, wind and dust every day.  My hair looked and felt dry and damaged even after using more than a handful of my old conditioner which is organic and &amp;#34;super hydrating&amp;#34;.  With the Vizeri products I am able to use a very small amount and my hair is beautiful, shiny and manageable.  Because I have so much hair I have always found it necessary to use a lot of shampoo and conditioner but I followed the directions and tried using a small amount and I am delighted with the results.  Therefore, I feel these products are a very good value.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best! It smells great and leaves my hair silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> My hair was  thinning out from last many months and try so many different products,finally decided to try this Moroccan Argan oil shampoo and conditioner and it works like magic. Noticed very few hair on the trap after only first use. Thank you Vizeri.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this shampoo and conditioner. So hydrating and it has a nice scent. I use it every two or three days.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair feels and smells  great buy</li>
    <li> THANK YOU! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Vizeri shampoo and conditioner. In fact….all of my friends are now interested in your products as well. My hair feels incredible and is healthier than it has been in years. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Not sure I will purchase again or not.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My hair has never felt so soft or looked so shiny! Also, I was loosing quite a bit of hair due to stress and I have noticed that it is not happening as much since I have been using the shampoo and conditioner. I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner make your hair feel clean and full of body. I also like the fact that it seems very gentle on my colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the products is citrus, but not over powering.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus scent.  This product leaves my hair shinier, smoother and more manageable.  At last, I&#x27;ve found a shampoo/conditions that I can stick to.  I will certainly recommended to family and others.</li>
    <li> Gently cleans and deeply conditions my and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have baby fine, straight hair, and she has thick, coarse, curly African hair. Despite trying every shampoo/conditioner without regards to price, we&#x27;ve never been able to share the same shampoo and conditioner successfully until now. It leaves our hair soft, manageable, strong, and with a very light citrus scent. Since ordering the smaller size, we have now ordered the largest size offered as I want to make sure we always have this on hand. I&#x27;ve used others that I loved in the short term, so I waited until I&#x27;d used this a few months to post a review. We&#x27;re still loving it as much as the first use and the condition of our hair has improved with continued use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been having trouble finding a good shampoo/conditioner to use on naturally curly but color treated hair. My curls are bouncy and not stiff and my hair smells wonderful. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this duo and have been using about a week. I have long fine hair with blond highlights. My hair gets damaged from the highlights. This set had made my hair less brittle and dried out. The consistency is a bit thick and does weigh my hair down a little. I do however like the benefit of my hair being less damaged. Argon oil is a great healer of damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I am 52 and will never stop coloring my hair. I have wavy; thick and somewhat coarse hair. Or at least I USED to! Now with Vizeri Moroccan Argan Oil products; my hair is so soft; frizz free and very manageable. I was on the fence about chopping my hair off; but will keep it now that it&#x27;s so pretty and manageable. Thank you for a great product! It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! It leaves my hair feeling soft and thick. It smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> Love how this made my hair feel and look. Will never go back to drugstore brands or overpriced salon products. Very gentle on my color and highlights. Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently had a keratin smoothing treatment and needed to find a shampoo and conditioner without sulfates or sodium chloride.  This looked like the perfect choice to me.  At first, it’s a little odd to use because there is minimal sudsing like I’m used to.  But it does an excellent job at cleaning your hair and leaving it nice and hydrated.  To my surprise it completely got rid of my dandruff, which I’ve always been very self conscience of.  I very highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair soft and has less frizz. It smells really nice, which is a big plus! Only have used it a few times and it makes my hair color wash out, that is not so good. I have very long hair so I need more shampoo than most people.  I would like a larger bottle of shampoo. The conditioner is very nice. I hope to see the improvement others have with continued use. Right now I am giving 3-4 star for less frizz, nice scent and seems like it conditions well. Will review again after further use.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner but not the shampoo, it made my hair hard.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for three years.  I was having problems with it an switched to Vizeri.  I really like it.  My hair is very soft and has body.  I only wish they were in a larger size with the conditioner being larger.</li>
    <li> Im a waver and this is the only shampoo that leaves my hair moisturized without leaving it feeling stripped. The scent of these products really do smell great. The shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized. IM HOOKED!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just used this shampoo and conditioner for the first time and I can already tell I will buying more of this product.  I have very dry frizzy hair.  My hair is also colored treated  and I use hot tools.  Not a very combination to try and avoid frizz.  I read the reviews on amazon for these products and thought I had nothing to lose.  After the first use I could already see a huge difference in my hair.  It wasn&#x27;t frizzy and is very soft.</li>
    <li> Conditioner contains GLUTEN. I did not think I was sensitive to beauty products that contain gluten, but have been proven wrong. The conditioner contains hydrolyzed wheat protein. NEEDS TO BE LABELED NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased your Argan oil shampoo because I have been dealing with an itchy scalp for the past several months.  I am at the point in my life where I color my hair every 4 to 5 weeks, and highlight it every 2 to 3 months.  I wear my hair on the shorter side (above my shoulders) and have it cut/trimmed each time it&#x27;s colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen after using your shampoo and conditioner for the past three weeks.  My hair is shiny, very soft and the color looks great.  I&#x27;ve felt some improvement in itchiness, where the sensation seems to come and go now, instead of being constant.  So, while the products haven&#x27;t solved my problem completely, they have certainly helped.  I intend to keep using them and perhaps after a period of time, the problem will be resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that I might try the Argan oil in addition to the regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just had a Keratin straightening treatment and googled the best shampoos to use. Bought the Vizeri shampoo and conditioner and so far am extremely satisfied. My hair is shiny, silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Both of these products are terrific. They work wonderfully, and though pricey, are entirely worth it. I can go longer without shampooing and preserves hair color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and conditioner a couple of times, but so far am very pleased with it. I like the scent and my hair seems to like the products.</li>
    <li> I did receive the product and I am very pleased with it. I have &amp;#34;gone blonde&amp;#34; and I noticed that since doing so, my hair was starting to appear dry and fly away. The product (after one use) transformed my hair to silky smooth and sleek and had everyone asking me what I had done. Several people thought I had a keratin treatment. It smells wonderful and a little bit goes a long way. It is pricey-that being said, it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this due to coloring my hair red and was told needed&lt;br /&gt;product with no sulphates so my purchase was based on this. I have been&lt;br /&gt;using the product have not seen color fade so happy with that. Hair is&lt;br /&gt;still frizzy so unsure why. it is very manageable as well. over all i am&lt;br /&gt;happy with the purchase</li>
