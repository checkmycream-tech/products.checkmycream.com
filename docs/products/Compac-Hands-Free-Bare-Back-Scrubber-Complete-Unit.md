      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This time I made sure to do so, and it&#x27;s ON there.    </li>
      <li>You will need to purchase a suction cup bath mat so you can grind into this scrubber without slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product that after a couple two three times you will be glad you purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best thing for scrubbing your back I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>We both use and love it.</li>
      <li>I have found my tree and fallen in love with it.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>so glad I found it--</li>
      <li>Love it though.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t make me laugh!!</li>
      <li>It requires a smoother surface to adhere, but is the perfect way to get a clean back if you shower alone.</li>
      <li>Easy to mount,</li>
      <li>The Velcro in which holds in onto the plastic backing is SO STRONG that it tears up the pad.</li>
      <li>I liked the first one</li>
      <li>DO be sure you have a clean smooth surface for that</li>
      <li>just fine</li>
      <li>easy to clean and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful for seniors or disabled, who can stand upright.</li>
      <li>and it is great to help scrub my back!!!!</li>
      <li>My back feels great, never been cleaner or smoother.  </li>
      <li>do enjoy the way the scrubber works, BUT, I do have one CON to announce.</li>
      <li>prime is fantastic.</li>
      <li>it worked okay the first time</li>
      <li>Clean the wall, no seams, and don&#x27;t go thinking that MAYBE it will stick to a porous surface.</li>
      <li>so much I purchased two more.</li>
      <li>The scrubber is magnificent, otherwise, so to address this defect, I am considering peeling off the original HARSHLY GRABBING Velcro, and then attaching a much much lighter Velcro.</li>
      <li>The shape of the scrubber does not design to fit the body curve, and the cover does not have the right texture to rub the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled my entire life to scrub my back thoroughly, and this product does this trick effortlessly!!! :D    </li>
      <li>It adheres to the shower wall with 5 large, strong suction cups.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this product!!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!  </li>
      <li>This thing is exactly what I have wanted for 20 years!  </li>
      <li>I already figure the new Velcro will not want to stick to the Plastic Backing very long, so I will use a real strong adhesive or powerful but safe glue.</li>
      <li>I already figure the new Velcro will not want to stick to the Plastic Backing very long, so I will use a real strong adhesive or powerful but safe glue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only a 1 because the surface of my shower walls have a very fine texture and it will not stick to it.</li>
      <li>attaches easily, instructions clear.  </li>
      <li>It fell apart quickly and does not dry easily.</li>
      <li>the suction cups under hot water in your bathroom sink, let them soak in the sink and get flexible is the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Your back pressure on it holds it in to place, but you would not be able to leave it up after you use it or it will eventually let go.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly as I hoped.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Bax Scrub (see my other reviews) one of the suction cups wasn&#x27;t so effective on the unit I got,</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t because it gets used gently, we scrub vigorously.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this one is the whole thing or just the cover.</li>
      <li>I dont like the fact that it sticks out from the wall so much.  </li>
      <li>This item works well but take to heart how much room you have in your shower before you purchase.</li>
      <li>The only trick is that the tile really does need to be squeaky clean in the area where the suction cups are placed, and I don&#x27;t need to tell anyone that you should not think or hope that the suction cups are goping to stay in place if you place them on a seam.</li>
      <li>It allows you to ensure your back is clean.  </li>
      <li>I have a problem with my shoulders and cannot thouroughly clean my back when i shower.</li>
      <li>Next - Use rubbing alcohol and paper towel and really clean the tile area you have</li>
      <li>As one reviewer stated, it is a rough Buff-puff type material, so if you&#x27;re not a fan of that, then it might not be for you, but I&#x27;m a big fan of the texture; I feel it exfoliates/cleans very well, so I love it!    </li>
      <li>This back scrubber is really cool.</li>
      <li>He was having a difficult time washing his back in the shower and this is the perfect item for him.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re having trouble with it sticking, be sure to scrub/clean your shower wall very well.  </li>
      <li>Also, despite the clever photos and packaging, it&#x27;s just a rectangular cube of foam with a scrubby cover attached to suction cups.</li>
      <li>Yes I love what it can do but it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape to hold tight to your shower or bath wall.  </li>
      <li>We would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
      <li>It only needs to be held in place, not a destructive adhesion.</li>
      <li>The inventor of Compac Hands Free Bare Back Scrubber had me in mind.  </li>
      <li>It only needs to be held in place, not a destructive adhesion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would have liked to give it a chance, but the fact that it won&#x27;t stick to my shower forced me to return it.</li>
      <li>Free Bare Back Scrubber Complete Unit</li>
      <li>the scrubber part is fine, but depending on your tile pattern (if any) this thing will land at least one suction cup right in a grout line meaning it&#x27;ll flop around on you like a dying hooker.  </li>
      <li>Just saying.peeling off the original HARSHLY GRABBING Velcro, and then attaching a much much lighter Velcro.</li>
      <li>When you attempt to clean it with your other whites with some bleach, the plastic around the cloth starts to crack.  </li>
      <li>A normal back scrubbing brush works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Whereas the back brush bristles feel invigorating, rubbing against this pad was a muted and far less satisfying experience.  </li>
      <li>A 4 year old could assemble it.</li>
      <li>so ultimately I couldn&#x27;t give it much use</li>
      <li>) Step into the tub and affix the suction cups and then turn around and lean your back into this device to flatten out the cups, take your time to really lean then lean again.</li>
      <li>So far it has not fallen off the wall.</li>
      <li>wow--</li>
      <li>My husband actually prefers to use this only with the rough foam pillow, he says it works better than the cover cloth.  </li>
      <li>The size is nice, big enough but not huge.  </li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll hear from me again, and it will be to announce that I will dispose of the back scrubber and go back to a basic back brush, which is always available.</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll hear from me again, and it will be to announce that I will dispose of the back scrubber and go back to a basic back brush, which is always available.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the suction cups are strong enough, it slides around after a few strokes.</li>
      <li>We put it on the wall of the shower and it works exactly like we expected....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  You will have to wash the cover every now and then.</li>
    <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t stay on any surface. I&#x27;m handy, I know. It&#x27;s garbage, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this product years ago.  I tell everyone about it.  Perfect for someone with shoulder or arm injuries or issues.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Did not perform as stated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obvious this was purposely made not to last.  The cloth easily becomes hard and likes to mildew.  When you attempt to clean it with your other whites with some bleach, the plastic around the cloth starts to crack.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks, and both the cushion and the cloth looks like they need to be replaced.  This is a bit of a money sink.  I&#x27;m sure you can make your own clothes for it that would work 10x better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product!!  I&#x27;ve struggled my entire life to scrub my back thoroughly, and this product does this trick effortlessly!!! :D    As one reviewer stated, it is a rough Buff-puff type material, so if you&#x27;re not a fan of that, then it might not be for you, but I&#x27;m a big fan of the texture; I feel it exfoliates/cleans very well, so I love it!    If you&#x27;re having trouble with it sticking, be sure to scrub/clean your shower wall very well.  I&#x27;ve had issues with suction cup things sticking in the past, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t scrub the wall prior.  This time I made sure to do so, and it&#x27;s ON there.    I highly recommend this product!!!  I&#x27;m going to stock up on the replacement pads just in case it&#x27;s ever discontinued!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I was hoping for an experience like the one I would get using a back brush.  That, unfortunately, was not the case.  Whereas the back brush bristles feel invigorating, rubbing against this pad was a muted and far less satisfying experience.  It&#x27;s back to the brush for me.</li>
    <li> If you have tiles in your shower area, don&#x27;t buy this as it won&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t think the suction cups are strong enough, it slides around after a few strokes.</li>
    <li> I bought this just out of the blue because my husband is always complaining about his back itching. I put it on my tub wall (which it tile) and it hasn&#x27;t come down yet and it isn&#x27;t because it gets used gently, we scrub vigorously. My husband is rough when he uses it on his back and it just stays there. This is the best investment I have ever made. We both use and love it. Don&#x27;t try to take it away from us because you&#x27;ll have a fight on your hands. I want to buy one for my son in law if I can find one. I don&#x27;t know if this one is the whole thing or just the cover. So for anyone who has never used one of these wonderful things, get it and try it and you&#x27;ll never go back to the old way I can promise you.</li>
    <li> came without suction cups useless</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have had a little trouble with it moving around on the wall. Somehow I cannot get a good hold for it. So far it has not fallen off the wall. It does work as it&#x27;s supposed to but you have to work with it.</li>
    <li> I adore this scrubber.  My only concern is whether or not you can find a replacement pad for it.  It requires a smoother surface to adhere, but is the perfect way to get a clean back if you shower alone.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product, like this, for years. It is sturdy, stays on the wall and is effortless to use. A momma bear, scratching her back on a big tree, could not be any happier than I am. I have found my tree and fallen in love with it. I highly recommend the Removable Cover Scrubber to anyone has trouble reaching their back. It is wonderful for seniors or disabled, who can stand upright.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my grandfather. He was having a difficult time washing his back in the shower and this is the perfect item for him.  He loves it and it is very easy for him to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only a 1 because the surface of my shower walls have a very fine texture and it will not stick to it. I also have a foot scrubber that attaches to the wall just fine The difference is that the foot scrubber has 31 very small suction cups and the back scrubber has just 5 very large suction cups. In this case more is best. I never got to use the back scrubber.</li>
    <li> I am an ALS patient and this product has improved my life in a big way. Due to my condition, strength and mobility make taking a shower difficult. This scrubber solved that problem. If you have arm weakness or mobility issues, this should be an awesome addition to your daily routine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  He only has use of one arm, and needs a product like this to help him in the shower wash his back, and other places his arm cannot reach.  The back scrubber is definitely heavy duty, built to last.  It adheres to the shower wall with 5 large, strong suction cups.  The size is nice, big enough but not huge.  The plastic part that hooks to the wall has little teeth like velcro on it.  You stick a rough foam pillow on the teeth, then cover with the towel-like cover cloth, that goes on with elastic.  My husband actually prefers to use this only with the rough foam pillow, he says it works better than the cover cloth.  It works, for what it is needed for.</li>
    <li> Awesome. A couple tips on applying to your shower wall (no way will this scrubber attach to a shower door without catastrophic results):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do a trial run without attaching the scrubber - Line up the suction cups to avoid grout lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Now - Heat the suction cups under hot water in your bathroom sink, let them soak in the sink and get flexible is the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Next - Use rubbing alcohol and paper towel and really clean the tile area you have chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Step into the tub and affix the suction cups and then turn around and lean your back into this device to flatten out the cups, take your time to really lean then lean again. Look at the cups and you will see they are remaining tight and no air shows from their releasing from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) This might take a couple times to get it affixed. You will need to purchase a suction cup bath mat so you can grind into this scrubber without slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product that after a couple two three times you will be glad you purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by lining up trial run. SUCTION CUPS WONT STICK TO GROUT LINES HIT AS FEW AS POSSIBLE- THE CENTER SUCTION CUP IS THE ONLY ONE IN MY SHOWER THAT GOES OVER A GROUT MARK.</li>
    <li> Already reviewed this item by seller . attaches easily, instructions clear.  nice touch to have anti slip strips included. works as expected!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother who has difficulty reaching her back in the shower/bath.  This feels so good!  Easy to mount, easy to clean and easy to use.  I&#x27;m ordering one for my shower.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal! I only have use of one arm and it is great to help scrub my back!!!!</li>
    <li> Junk...  very big and bulky in the shower.</li>
    <li> Been looking for something like this for a long time--so glad I found it--prime had it delivered on Sunday--wow--prime is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for scrubbing your back I have ever tried. I liked the first one so much I purchased two more. I also got some extra pads.</li>
    <li> We put it on the wall of the shower and it works exactly like we expected....without the cover, it&#x27;s great for a back-scratcher too!!!</li>
    <li> Good service and product.</li>
    <li> This item works well but take to heart how much room you have in your shower before you purchase. We will use it and it will well serve the purpose but probably will not purchase another due to the size.</li>
    <li> My husband and I absolutely love this product! We would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I miss my Yugoslavian slaves but with this I can almost bring myself to forget about them, oh but the Russians, it will never replace the Russians</li>
    <li> The inventor of Compac Hands Free Bare Back Scrubber had me in mind.  This is GENIUS.  My back feels great, never been cleaner or smoother.  I&#x27;m all for this!  Oh, and you can use it to apply lotion too.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for any person with limited flexiblility.  It allows you to ensure your back is clean.  It works best in a shower with a hand held device.  This allows the user to rinse the soap after use without pulling on the velcro each time.</li>
    <li> It is a great idea. However, the design takes to too much space in my shower and the suction cups do not allow instant move up and down. The shape of the scrubber does not design to fit the body curve, and the cover does not have the right texture to rub the skin. A bad purchase. I will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love It!! Just want I wanted.</li>
    <li> This thing is exactly what I have wanted for 20 years!  No more itchy back or annoying pimples!  Can&#x27;t believe how perfect this is.</li>
    <li> It fell apart quickly and does not dry easily.</li>
    <li> my husband enjoys this in the shower  it is great</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my shoulders and cannot thouroughly clean my back when i shower. I was even trying to invent something myself. When i saw this back scrubber it answered my needs. I have had my back scrubber for about 5 months now and i love it. My scrubber has never come off my tiled shower wall. I am so happy i purchased it. I usually don&#x27;t give reviews but this is a winner.!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well HOWEVER, we did have to purchase industrial/commercial strength Velcro to attach it to the tile shower wall a it was NOT smooth tile therefor the supplied suction cups would not work by themselves.</li>
    <li> Compac Hands Free Bare Back Scrubber Complete Unit.......I am always frank with my reviews. This back scrubber is really cool. A 4 year old could assemble it. It sticks to my porcelain tile shower wall quite well. The only trick is that the tile really does need to be squeaky clean in the area where the suction cups are placed, and I don&#x27;t need to tell anyone that you should not think or hope that the suction cups are goping to stay in place if you place them on a seam. (I have read comments about it sliding around and not stable) That&#x27;s just plain poppycock! Clean the wall, no seams, and don&#x27;t go thinking that MAYBE it will stick to a porous surface. Don&#x27;t make me laugh!! Only a dunderhead would EXPECT a suction cup to work under the aforementioned conditions. The cups span 4 1/2 inches by 15 inches (4 corners and 1 in the middle). DO be sure you have a clean smooth surface for that footprint.&lt;br /&gt;The cover removes easily to rise and squeeze out to let dry w/o soap scum or other buildup. The pad sticks a bit to hard though. Am afraid it might come apart too soon. Nevertheless, you&#x27;ll throw out your old back brush. I recommend this product to anyone with a heartbeat and the need of a shower. And get 2 of them. One for you and the Mrs (at adult height), and another for the ankle-biters (your little runts). Buy this product!! And that&#x27;s all I have to say about that, for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF DAILY USE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the way the scrubber works, BUT, I do have one CON to announce. The exfoliating pad self destructs. The Velcro in which holds in onto the plastic backing is SO STRONG that it tears up the pad. It actually rips chunks out of it EVERY TIME you take it off to rinse the soap out of it, which is every time you use it. If you try leaving it on, you can NEVER get ALL the soap and water out of it, PLUS it becomes a bacteria factory, which is really bad. The scrubber is magnificent, otherwise, so to address this defect, I am considering peeling off the original HARSHLY GRABBING Velcro, and then attaching a much much lighter Velcro. I already figure the new Velcro will not want to stick to the Plastic Backing very long, so I will use a real strong adhesive or powerful but safe glue. It costs $6.00-7.00 to replace the pad every time. That doesn&#x27;t need to be. It only needs to be held in place, not a destructive adhesion. The exfoliating pad would last WAY longer.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this update helps somebody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***THIS IS THE SAME DAY I WROTE THE UPDATE, ABOVE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ATTEMPTED to place a refill order of the Exfoliating Pad Refill (2 Pack) from Amazon Prime Shipping. They don&#x27;t stock the refills and I have to wait up to 5 weeks for delivery...and I&#x27;m a Prime Shipping customer.&lt;br /&gt;I will go to Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement to see if I can find a material to replace the unavailable refills. If I can&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll hear from me again, and it will be to announce that I will dispose of the back scrubber and go back to a basic back brush, which is always available. The only reason I tried the back scrubber out was because I have a hand disability and am unable to grip very well and always have to sand the varnish off the wood handled brushes and rough up the wood to make it grippier. No way can I use a plastic handle. But this is my personal problem. Just saying.peeling off the original HARSHLY GRABBING Velcro, and then attaching a much much lighter Velcro.

    <li> the scrubber part is fine, but depending on your tile pattern (if any) this thing will land at least one suction cup right in a grout line meaning it&#x27;ll flop around on you like a dying hooker.  it worked okay the first time but it moved around on me, and I dont like the fact that it sticks out from the wall so much.  I prefer the Bax Scrub (see my other reviews) one of the suction cups wasn&#x27;t so effective on the unit I got, so ultimately I couldn&#x27;t give it much use</li>
    <li> I think that unless you can not use your arms at all, this is completely pointless and useless. and if you cant use your arms, it will suck to reattach like every 3-4 days.... plus it takes up a lot of room.</li>
    <li> Yes I love what it can do but it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape to hold tight to your shower or bath wall.  It has 5 suction cups on the back and usually at least 2  will let go.  Your back pressure on it holds it in to place, but you would not be able to leave it up after you use it or it will eventually let go.  Love it though.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as I hoped. Hold firmly to my shower wall and is a pleasure to use. Makes me want to stay on my shower longer....</li>
    <li> I have a standard vinyl sided shower-in-a-box. The cups refused to stick to this. Also, despite the clever photos and packaging, it&#x27;s just a rectangular cube of foam with a scrubby cover attached to suction cups. Didn&#x27;t get the chance to use it, but don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve like it anyhow. A normal back scrubbing brush works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have liked to give it a chance, but the fact that it won&#x27;t stick to my shower forced me to return it.</li>
