      <li>I use it morning and evening; it&#x27;s fine under makeup.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product for the impressive ingredients and expect to see further positive results.  </li>

      <li>This facial moisturizer is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Will this prevent wrinkles, probably not, only God and a good dermatologist can do that --- if you are lucky.</li>
      <li>There are so many other creams that are just ok that look and smell better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that results show up quickly on my hands, so I have used on hands, neck and face.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied, this is my second order</li>
      <li>very overpriced for something that feels like cheap hand lotion.</li>
      <li>Skin feels fresh and plumped.</li>
      <li>It cannot be absorbed by the skin</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall product is worth the money I invested</li>
      <li>Great product,I am very satisfied,I saw results very soon,I am not a very young person,that means I know what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>and they corrected the problem with the cream and sent it out right away.</li>
      <li>I touch the surface and just the right amount adheres to my fingers.</li>
      <li>going on my skin, I love the smell, I love the slight tightening I feel</li>
      <li>I am surprised that it received so many positive reviews, maybe it was just my cream.</li>
      <li>I was able to keep the extra serum</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product in December 2014.</li>
      <li>I do not want any more of this anti aging cream or any further charges.</li>
      <li>Have only been using this for 3 weeks morning and night, mostly nightly.  </li>
      <li>but it looks more youthful and pores are much smaller for 50 years old not bad  </li>
      <li>After using for a month I absolutely loved this product and reordered in January only to find out the company had changed their formula because of  some of the prior feedback.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m not even sure how long it takes to see results.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines are gone and deeper lines getting smaller every day &amp; pours are shrinking.</li>
      <li>but it really does encourage moisture.</li>
      <li>but this time I was very dissaponted of the product.</li>
      <li>and this product is really</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I stay out of the sun, gently cleanse makeup off each night, use sunscreen, and drink plenty of water.  </li>
      <li>Collagen in this product is a real plus.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t nourish much at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy at all and melts right into the skin.</li>
      <li>the main ingredient is wax.</li>
      <li>why the content of the jar was not full to the top, it was about 1/8 less.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend product and company to everyone showing signs of ageing.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommended to others..</li>
      <li>Winter 2013-&#x27;14 is a little more bearable.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way thank you so much for putting out such a great product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m usually very prone to pimples since my young age.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really dry skin and this cream dried my skin to the point of peeling. It took several days of moisturizer to fix my issues :(</li>
    <li> Was shipped promptly and like the product.</li>
    <li> I am a 64+ year old grandma who has essentially good skin for my age but hate the feel of heavy, sticky, oily face creams. I absolutely love this cream!  I love the feel of it going on my skin, I love the smell, I love the slight tightening I feel and I love the glow that my face has after I use it. I also love the texture.  I touch the surface and just the right amount adheres to my fingers. It is a bit pricey for my semi-retired budget but it seems to go a long way. Please keep making it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smell so bad.i did not like it at all😡</li>
    <li> My face broke out and felt dry and scratchy using this product</li>
    <li> Love it.  Easy to use and great results a half the price of what I was getting.</li>
    <li> I will order this product again!</li>
    <li> Great anti ageing cream.  Works really well on hands as well!!!</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderfully soft as soon as I apply my Cleopatra lotion.  I am extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for skin moisturizing and creating a more youthful feel to your skin.  This company is also very good to work with.  Amazon accidentally sent me two serums instead of the serum and the cream.  I was able to keep the extra serum and they corrected the problem with the cream and sent it out right away.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes the product and would re-order same soon.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using it. Probably the best cream I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used many! We bought it and the serum together. Very good</li>
    <li> I have not yet used but I know I will love it!</li>
    <li> Good product and works fair.  I do not know at this time if I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This facial moisturizer is amazing!  I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman who&#x27;s searched for a product to revive my drying skin:  Anti-Aging Cream works.  I use it morning and evening; it&#x27;s fine under makeup.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Winter 2013-&#x27;14 is a little more bearable.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so always unsure how I will do with a new product. I rarely go outside the box. When I read the reviews on this cream I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. I&#x27;m amazed after a few weeks of using this. Lines have softened, my skin is softer yet more taunt and I never broke out. It&#x27;s not a large jar but a little goes a long way. I use both morning and night. I will definitively keep using This cream!</li>
    <li> Very small amount for the money and  the main ingredient is wax. Do they tell you the ingredients? No. Don&#x27;t buy these magic beans. Stick to glycolic acid with a fragrance free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It arrived recently and it looked a  it &#x27;clotted&#x27; and dark tan-ish.  However, it seems like a really good product.  I&#x27;ve not used it long - a few weeks - but goes on and absorbs right away.  I&#x27;ve found that results show up quickly on my hands, so I have used on hands, neck and face.  Hands are looking WAY better.  I&#x27;ve been using it everywhere - on arms where I have a scar or two, even.  I&#x27;m ordering another today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m on a quest to put my skin&#x27;s &#x27;house&#x27; in order so I&#x27;m using more products than this, but right now, the combo is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 14 May 2014  This product leaves skin (and keeps skin) incredibly moist.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the hyaluronic acid.  It cannot be absorbed by the skin but it really does encourage moisture.</li>
    <li> this anti- aging cream did not work for me.I am not happy with this cream.it does not do anything for you.save your money it is a waist over all I am not happy at all this cream is no  good .did not like anything about this cream at all</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s making a difference on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if my wrinkles are improved for short time I have been using it.. but it looks more youthful and pores are much smaller for 50 years old not bad  :)&lt;br /&gt;I noticed if I apply in the morning and the evening that I&#x27;m developing a small pimples but I&#x27;m usually very prone to pimples since my young age. So, it is very rich and I&#x27;m gone reduce it to once per day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall product is worth the money I invested and I would highly recommended to others.. I like something natural like this product. Never liked any Botox, injections or more aggressive products. I even shared with my 79 years old mom and she feels the difference on her skin too.</li>
    <li> This is the most gross looking cream not sure if mine was expired  or not.  Thought it just might look and smell bad but work great.  No it just sucks it is going to the garbage pile.  This cream did not even make the drawer of unused products.  There are so many other creams that are just ok that look and smell better.  I hate to be negative on a ski care product, because creams work differently on everyone, so who knows.  I am surprised that it received so many positive reviews, maybe it was just my cream.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this product is really moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy at all and melts right into the skin. Too soon to&lt;br /&gt;tell if it is helping with the anti aging ingredients yet. It does have&lt;br /&gt;an odd consistency and color but it smells good.</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic feel to apply the product. Skin feels fresh and plumped. I could feel a change on the surface of my skin, it felt tightened.</li>
    <li> Loved the cream , my face glows. I Would buy it again. The cream looks ugly yellow, but smells wonderful. I use it under my eyes and neck  and I feel it tighter.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m not even sure how long it takes to see results.  Perhaps it is too soon to form an opinion.  I will be using it all up and then see the results.  I hope it works!!</li>
    <li> I do not want any more of this anti aging cream or any further charges. Thank you. Brenda Lindes</li>
    <li> Not sure because I have not used it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Its so light. Not greasy. Your skin absorbs it like a sponge. Its like the fountain of youth in a jar. It truly is amazing. Ive tried every moisturizer you can think of and this stuff has All of the ingredients needed for mature or aging skin.  Its incredible. I finally found thee perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my Wife</li>
    <li> Felt nice on my face.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Have only been using this for 3 weeks morning and night, mostly nightly.  Goes on smoothly, extremely moisturizing.  In my 60&#x27;s, I still have very few wrinkles; however, moisture is the key.  I purchased this product for the impressive ingredients and expect to see further positive results.  I stay out of the sun, gently cleanse makeup off each night, use sunscreen, and drink plenty of water.  Collagen in this product is a real plus.  The only caveat is that it isn&#x27;t loaded with Vitamin C, which is wonderful for the face.</li>
    <li> I was A Little disappointed with the product when taking it out of the packing. The package was not sealed and the amount is less than half the bottle. : (</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in December 2014. Once I received I did see what some other reviews were stating about the consistency, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. After using for a month I absolutely loved this product and reordered in January only to find out the company had changed their formula because of  some of the prior feedback. I&#x27;m not sure what changed but it doesn&#x27;t work for me as well now.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum, the hyaluronic acid and the collagen for about a month now and I am really happy with how it is working.  I think I actually look younger and it has made my skin very soft.  Good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream because it had all of the ingredients that are recommended for skin improvement and the reviews were outstanding!  However, I&#x27;ve had this cream for a week and, to date, haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin color, hydration or texture.  Perhaps the next week or so will reveal some noticeable improvements.  I was initially &amp;#34;turned off&amp;#34; by the color (oatmeal shade) and consistency (like paste) of this product.  It reminds me of a cream that had spoiled or was old.  Since there&#x27;s no foul odor and I haven&#x27;t anything to compare it to, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s just a characteristic of the product.  Keeping my fingers crossed for some positive results in the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> This cream is great; I could see the difference in my skin after the first use. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product trying to reduce the puffiness from under my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now, nothing has changed. I still have puffiness under my eyes. But I can say this anti aging cream feels very nice when I apply it on my face and neck. I guess,  I need to have patients and continue to wait.</li>
    <li> I am wondering why Hyaluronic Acid ingredient on the jar is the the last ingredient instead of the first as itbis indicates above the bar code paper glued to the bottom of the jar. I expected it to be the first ingredient mentioned to be the best, most effective and be considered the highest quality&lt;br /&gt;Also why the content of the jar was not full to the top, it was about 1/8 less.&lt;br /&gt;So far I can only rate it as one star, may be in six weeks time, my opinion will change if I see good results.</li>
    <li> Great product, as described my skin looks and feels younger &amp; softer. Fine lines are gone and deeper lines getting smaller every day &amp; pours are shrinking. Will definitely buy again when I run out. A little bit goes a long way thank you so much for putting out such a great product. Fast shipping. Highly recommend product and company to everyone showing signs of ageing.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints</li>
    <li> After just a couple of days I saw a difference. Glad I ordered 2 jars at one time!</li>
    <li> The cream is runny and I am not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> My product did arrive and I have been using it for a little over a week.  It&#x27;s hard to rate a product like this until you have used it for about 30 days or more.  So far I have not seen any great changes in my skin but I have really great skin already.  I&#x27;m just trying to smooth out the wrinkles some.  I will continue using this product until it&#x27;s all gone and at that time, depending on the results, I will probably re- order.</li>
    <li> Did not see any changes.</li>
    <li> Did not give the results I expected from reviews I had read!</li>
    <li> Just now I can not writte about it completely because I am using it only one month, but is goin to &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about beauty products because there are so many out there, it&#x27;s an industry all in itself.  However, I decided on my 50th birthday It would be a great idea to start to reverse any signs of aging....and this product ROCKS!!!  It only took a few applications and I could SEE a difference.  After a few weeks I looked younger!  I will continue to purchase and use this product!</li>
    <li> Great product,I am very satisfied,I saw results very soon,I am not a very young person,that means I know what I was expecting.It exceeded my expectations,I ordered more .I use the serum 2x dayly and this cream 1x dayly.It is great.I am completely satisfied.regards,maria</li>
    <li> I was using another cream with Hyaluronic Acid, but it did not brighten the skin.  My skin looks much better after using it for a couple of months.  It is less expensive than other products with HA.</li>
    <li> This product was received in its original packaging, however when I opened it, its appearance was bad.  It seems as if it was old.  I did use it a couple of times just to see if it could be used or not.  Not sure if I should or not so it sits in my medicine cabinet.  I am sad.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I also bought hyaluronic serum which is so much better.  This didn&#x27;t nourish much at all.</li>
    <li> The color and smell of the product is awful!!! A useless cream!!!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail very quickly. So far I like the product. It&#x27;s light, absorbs well, and I can tell a difference in the way my face looks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say one way or another if it actually does anything but I haven&#x27;t seen anything that would make me want to buy this again.  Also, the cream looks like someone plopped some creamy oatmeal into the container and shipped it.  Clumpy looking consistency.</li>
    <li> I order this anti aging cream for my self and my surprise when I receive the product it was nothing like the picture they show to sell the cream. It does t have a label or instructions is only a small labeling the bottom of the jar. Not even a smell like they said. I won&#x27;t recommended this item to ppl. Looks like they made it at home or put some cream inside the jar. To expensive for this.  but this time I was very dissaponted of the product. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> very overpriced for something that feels like cheap hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, this is my second order and I love the Cream !  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> While a cream this is very fluid a characteristic I like in a cream.  The mission of all these face creams is at the very least to retain moisture. Therefore, it is best to start with a cream that is moist to begin with, I think.  Will this prevent wrinkles, probably not, only God and a good dermatologist can do that --- if you are lucky. Well you gotta believe that adding moisture to the skin is a good thing and this cream does that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Hope springs eternal &amp;#34; .  All of these face creams aimed at women, and aren&#x27;t they all, embody that adage. Dream on my friends dream on .</li>
