    <li> Great price, and great product!  My hair gets better now!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for my fine, weak, color-treated, heat styled hair!  Plus it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this as a once-a-month treatment. Work in the conditioner, put on a shower cap, wrap your head in a towel, then apply heat with a blow dryer for 10 minutes, leave on your hair for a total of 30 minutes, then rinse.  It&#x27;s like magic.  My hair is curly and kind of fine, and I fight frizz.  I blow dry my hair straight once a week or so, and using this conditioner makes my hair unbelievably silky and bouncy after a blow dry.  I was out of my regular conditioner once several months ago, and I used this one, left it on for 2-3 minutes before rinsing.  The effect was so terrific that I actually use this once or twice a week now.  The texture of my hair is just so perfect when I do.  It&#x27;s absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years and was always happy for the results. You don&#x60;t need to use a lot, so it last really long, which helps given the price of it. Hair gets shiny and soft for sure. However I would recommend taking breaks using it cause after using it non-stop I felt like the results weren&#x60;t as GREAT so maybe our hair just needs a break from a certain product sometimes...</li>
    <li> Always liked that product line, after I started using my hair has greatly improved. Approve and recommend for those who have weak hair with little volume</li>
    <li> I have super dry fine hair and a very sensitive scalp.  This conditioner makes my hair light and shiny.  It is very moisturizing, but not greasy.  And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and still love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quality.</li>
    <li> Great product but I won&#x27;t repeat buying it... too pricey... too expensive for the product it is.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It Is everithing OK. Tks</li>
    <li> Great product, leave hair soft, shine and beautiful. This product last for many massages on your hair. You would not regret to invest in this product.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!! THis is NOT Kerastase, they are diluting it with something. Thank goodness amazon took care of me!! Shame on you Beauty Just For You. It actually IS just for us, I am sure each batch you whip up has different amounts of whatever it is you are using to cut the real product!</li>
    <li> Kerastase is simply the best hair product out there on the market. I&#x27;ve tried many and keep coming back to Kerastase despite the cost. I especially love the Masquintense for fine hair. It&#x27;s the right amount of conditioning for my fine, chemically treated hair. You don&#x27;t need very much of it; a little goes a long way and the results are great.</li>
    <li> this bottle came un sealed and half empty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using kerastase masquintense for over two years. It makes my hair very softy and very easy to blow drye after all. I have a very drye hair, but with the right product, I have had an amazing result. If you are looking for a good hair product, kerastase its the best of all.... You will not regret!</li>
    <li> This product leaves hair full and manageable and my hair is shinier, softer and fuller&lt;br /&gt; I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but this is the best conditioner for my fine, natural wave/curly hair.  I color treat so need extra moisture daily to combat the dryness.  You don&#x27;t need much, so it goes a long way.  If you buy at the salon or Keratase&#x27;s website - it&#x27;s $60 for 6.8 ounces.  This is $72 for 16.9 ounces.  Easy decision and this is the real product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It keeps my hair beautiful! I just wish the price would be more affordable to use this product all the time.</li>
    <li> i had high expectation on this and but it was a huge disappointment. wouldn&#x27;t buy it any more from anywhere else other than Kerastase&#x27;s official website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it in the beauty shop but it&#x27;s much cheaper to have it at home as the ideal is to use it every week.</li>
    <li> Very well indeed! It was delivered on time and exactly what I had expected.</li>
