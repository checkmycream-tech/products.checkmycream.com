      <li>Super soft and warm!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i was satisfied, long wait but no complaining. only thing is it had a weird smell but i washed it.</li>
    <li> Took this on a fall trip to New England, it was perfect. Kept my head nice and warm and was great for bad hair days too. Haven&#x27;t washed so not sure about that.</li>
    <li> I love the hat, but shipping took like a month and a half so that sucks</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I ended d up buying three, black, Brown, and cream. My daughter took over the black one and was wearing it all day at school. It is starting to pill from the wear. I kept the brown one and gave my mom the cream. I like the way it drapes. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this hat, very stylish and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Love it! I get complimented repeatedly.</li>
    <li> It came before expected date and is great quality and I wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a warm and snuggly hat, but it&#x27;s quite smaller then I thought it would be. It still fits, but it tends to slip off a bit. Nevertheless, I am still thinking about buying another one. It is well constructed and made of quality materials, it just doesn&#x27;t fit like in the picture. Maybe I just have a big head.</li>
    <li> Im sure this would have been the most AMAZING hat I have EVER owned had it arrived at some point in the two month shipping time frame they allotted themselves. Im sure I would have been nothing short of amazed at the quality and attention to detail, not to mention the fit and color choice I made on the products we never got the privilege to enjoy. I cannot begin to explain how extremely happy I am at the amount of warmth in my heart I have for these products. I find this ironic being my head has been freezing awaiting their arrival all this time. I think its spectacular that a company has such amazing invisible products that I have enjoyed so much.</li>
    <li> I love my hat and i get so many complements on it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting bigger and thicker but it is very soft and very nice.</li>
    <li> The hat is smaller than represented in the photo but still enough material to get the slouch look. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Fits snug for my head but my niece loves it.</li>
    <li> Well made. Fit is good. Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> This hat is soooo adorable. I get complements on it every time I wear it. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Thin knit and on the sloppy side. Does not look as good as picture on. I Don&#x27;t wear it</li>
    <li> The hat fits perfectly and it has great quality. I would order it again for a gift for my family.</li>
    <li> Big, Cozy, Adorable, Soft, Tan, Comfortable. Awesomeness.</li>
    <li> Love..Love... Love.. the hat and I will put them on and still look great in my clothing on a bad hair day</li>
    <li> Cute, warm and well made. Very good deal. I have three so far, and wear them all the time. Totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! I get tons of compliments on it, and it is well made!  I highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the cream color one and it has a strange pink tone to the yarn. Very disappointed in the color.</li>
    <li> I did not expect much for the price and it did take a long time to arrive but the quality is great, they are thick and soft but not too warm/wintery.  They are also really cute and slouchy.</li>
    <li> I bought this in brown a few months ago, loved it, and decided I needed it in white. It is more of an oatmeal/cream color but I like it more than if it had been true white.</li>
    <li> It is design for fashion. Love it. Very cute and affordable.</li>
    <li> its ok for the cheap price but took over 3 weeks to reach my door.order it in summer if you want it for winter</li>
    <li> Love this hat, its very cute! and fits in a good cute way! loose and sits well!</li>
    <li> I ordered multiple colors because of the low cost, but the fit is somewhat awkward.  I felt like it fit on my head with more of a beret look than what is pictured, a cute fitting cap.</li>
    <li> My lady love these Beret, we actually bought 5. Planning to buy some for my sister and niece, great product.</li>
    <li> great quality product, I absolutely love this beenie and I have received a tons of compliments already, It holds on head, I like to wear it with my hair in low bun and that way it holds even tighter , recommended purchase</li>
    <li> fits a smaller head, but soft and nice and a nice pattern. will try to use hair clips with it.</li>
    <li> very nice people complement a lot , I told them I bought it in amazon.. hey always sell me good stuff</li>
    <li> These hats are fantastic and very well made. I don&#x27;t know why they are so inexpensive because I could easily see these selling at Nordstrom for $40 or more. They yard is very soft and thick and has the perfect slouch in the back. It does not feel cheap at all. The gray hat is more of a grayish purple and it&#x27;s beautiful. I wish they made more colors because I would buy one in every color! The long delivery time didn&#x27;t bother me because of the previous reviews warning about this. Delivery was probably about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Very warm looks just like the picture! Very happy and worth the money spent on it</li>
    <li> I really like these hats! I ordered three since it seemed to be a good bargain.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it would be too small since it seemed so when I first opened it, but they&#x27;re not. They are not HUGE so if you have a bigger noggin that average, they may not give you the slouchy look as indicated here, but for me, they&#x27;re just right!&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that I can tuck under the back of the hat, which is a plus in snow country.&lt;br /&gt;Not the colors I expected but I&#x27;m not fussy about such things for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a it more slouchier and bigger, but this still good overall!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for someone with alot of hair and has trouble finding hats....she loves it</li>
    <li> I loved it! It looks exactly like the picture, fits perfect and I like the material. It also arrived sooner as expected.</li>
    <li> Very cute! Great price!</li>
    <li> Cute hat, doesn&#x27;t sit the way it does in the picture. Super soft and warm!</li>
    <li> Very soft, warm, and it fits perfectly! It will be perfect for winter months!</li>
    <li> Love love it! Its warm and very cute! I would suggest this product tp anyone....fits very well and super cute</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Great fit! Love the way it stays on! It works for me.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product! Fabulous!</li>
    <li> nice slouchy hat thats actually slouchy. not as warm as I would like but very fashionable and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a cold winter, so for fun I gave a couple of these away as holiday gifts.  Gave one to a college student and another to a grandmother.  Surprise, surprise they both loved this beret-style knit cap.  Much more stylish than typical knit caps.</li>
    <li> Love this hat, it fits perfect! It was Slow to arrive, but a great purchase all in all. Reccommed the hat.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture and fits perfect! Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I have never been able to wear this type of hat, but this was one that worked well for me because it was a loose fit. I got many compliments while wearing it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hat! Very warm and very cute! I will probably end up buying other colors!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hat I got the mocha brown one would buy more</li>
    <li> Too small to achieve the &amp;#34;slouchy&amp;#34; look</li>
    <li> It fits well and is super soft. Love the color. Goes with everything.  The pattern is also a pretty cool one</li>
    <li> This hat looks a lot better in the picture. It came a few weeks early, I&#x27;ll give it that, but I was disappointed with how the hat actually looks. It&#x27;s too big for my head and slouches in a strange way, not in the cute slouchy beanie style. The color wasn&#x27;t as pretty, either. It looks like something my grandma would wear.</li>
    <li> I love this hat. very cute, fits well over my thick hair. the more i wear it, the more it stretches out, which hopefully will not be a problem, but totally cute</li>
    <li> love this knitted hat! It isn&#x27;t quite as big as the pic makes it look, but I liked it enough to order 4!</li>
    <li> Way smaller than stated! Poor product, can see the elastic all through the band! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> beautiful, well-made hat! I&#x27;ve received many compliments. The cream color is especially nice on dark brown hair :)</li>
    <li> This hat is sooooo perfect! It was a great fit, made from very soft quality material that is also warm! I got the tan color one. It fit perfectly and looks even better in person than the photos shown here. I am a girl rocking natural hair, and some days this hat works as a perfect accessory. Other days, it makes a great hat for concealing my bad hair days! I love it and will definitely be ordering more colors. The shipping was very fast, It came within about 3 days.</li>
    <li> very cozy crochet-style hat. nice price, and VERY fast shipping. I&#x27;d order another hat from this company because I know what to expect now. Could use some other colors of the same hat :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 100% Polyester and if I had known that I would not even spend one dollar on it.  It takes a second to list what it&#x27;s made out of and save people from buying something they hate.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM, SOFT AND A GREAT HAT... ORDERING MORE....</li>
    <li> Got this hat a few weeks ago for my mother.  She loves it.  It is soft and fits loosely over her head so that she can pull it down to cover her ears if she wants.  It is cream color just as the picture shows on Amazon.  It was shipped directly from Hong Kong.  It took about 3 weeks, but I was in no hurry.  It is not cheap looking and seems to be well made.  Can’t think of anything negative about it.  Great deal and I am about to order one for myself.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Even though there was a small hole in the top, I still wear it very often.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was worried when I read some of the reviews about how this hat was made of cheap material and how it wasn&#x27;t the same color as the picture shows and so on, but when I finally got the hat in the mail I was thrilled! the hat was not only exactly hat I&#x27;m looking for but the material was great! it&#x27;s warm, thick knitted, and the color is adorable. I have received many compliments already for the hat :) the only downfall was that it took really long to get delivered, but other than the waiting game, I highly recommend this hat !</li>
    <li> I love my hat! I can&#x27;t remember the delivery time, but when it got her it was handcrafted very nicely..</li>
    <li> I have a pretty big head, and finding cute hats like these that actually FIT has been a long, hard journey for years. I too was worried about being able to fit this hat thanks to the reviews, but decided to give it a chance. I also have poofy hair, so it was yet another test to be contended with. The hat doesn&#x27;t have extreme stretch, but it fit my head beautifully when my hair was twisted up AND when it was loose. This is such a beautifully crafted hat, well worth the wait to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kept my head pretty warm in the Chicago cold, so I&#x27;m VERY pleased to have something fashionable AND functional to wear here and there. Will be purchasing again, as this was an affordable purchase that beat name brand stores hands down. Wonderful craftsmanship on the hat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little dissapointed. I loved the way it looked online but when I received it and opened the package it does not look like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Would recommend buying</li>
    <li> A little bulkier of a knit than expected but very nice quality</li>
    <li> I received this pretty fast and it looks great!</li>
    <li> Same as the gray one, except cream color.. SO gorgeous.. looks like hand made! I got 2, but i may be ordering a couple other colors too! Are made so well.. not falling apart.. and really soft, and look so pretty!  Hope they will be warm.. don&#x27;t know yet.. But they sure are beautiful!! Thanks Evermarket ,for a lovely product, and great prices, too! :)</li>
    <li> Cheap material, a little scratchy. Wouldn&#x27;t it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This hat is so soft and warm. I love it and will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I love this beanie. I ordered it a while back, but didn&#x27;t start wearing it until recently as the weather has gotten colder. It didn&#x27;t smell, as I&#x27;ve heard that many of them do. It&#x27;s a little on the pink side, but just barely. I wear this with almost anything.</li>
    <li> Item looks bigger in the photo, really it looks like a regular warm weather hat...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always nervous to order from overseas due to poor past experiences, and not to mention how long it takes to actually receive the item I purchased. This hat did come before it&#x27;s estimated shipping dates but still was close to a 3 week wait. As for this hat itself, it&#x27;s good quality. It looks great on. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes, the wait is Long..., but I Love this hat! I ordered the cream-colored. It is extemely soft, perfect size. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Looks just like the picture and fits well.  Shipping took a long time though, just glad I got it to wear this winter.</li>
    <li> Super but doesn&#x27;t stay put very well.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and I love the loose fit, it&#x27;s not tight on my head like some other hats</li>
