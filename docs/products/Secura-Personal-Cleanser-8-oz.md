<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product for personal clean-up. Use it for my mom who is bed bound. Nice fresh smell also.</li>
    <li> Like others I read here, it was sent home with my stuff from the hospital.  I found this in my box of stuff and started using it to get really clean after using regular bath tissue...lol.  You might not be able to figure out how does a person use this stuff.  Well, the third use of bath tissue, you hold it up (unused, of course) and spray this cleanser on it.  I probably get it more wet than need be, but after it&#x27;s wetted the tissue, you go ahead and use it, the wet tissue.  I like its cleansing and feel fresh all day!  No more poo-poo undies! LOL!</li>
    <li> Using the Secura Personal Cleanser to clean the skin area along with the Secura Extra Protective Cream helped heal bedsore.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  As a cancer patient I am always looking for products to make my life easier.  This is very simple to use.  Just spray on skin or washcloth and wipe clean.  It leaves me feeling fresh and clean with no sticky residue left behind.  The scent is refreshing, but does not linger.</li>
    <li> i was introduced to this product in the hospital after surgery when i could not shower for a few days. they sent me home with a bottle and i have been ordering ever since.  that was 8 years ago.  i would never shower without it.  it is unbelievably good.  it  makes you feel clean and fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well and moisturizes while it neutralizes odor.  I highly recommend it to everyone in hospitals, nursing homes or for anyone wanting a clean body or bottom without showering. 5*&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I first used this product for personal cleansing while recovering from total knee replacement. You cannot shower, and I am always concious of any personal odor. I had always used a washcloth, or baby wipes for \\&quot;freshening up\\&quot; This product has a pleasant odor, is not soapy, requires no rinsing, and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. Would be great for  bedridden elderly, or incontinent persons.</li>
    <li> Product came highly recommended for personal cleansing. I would recommend this product.  Have used for several weeks. . Medical facilities use this product for patients.</li>
    <li> I saw the recent reviews so I decided to purchase this cleanser. Prompt delivery, I have used this product and it is great, leaves you feeling fresh and clean. Order this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I have ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Hernandez</li>

The company I ordered it from was also very helpful when my order was lost in the mail. Handled it quickly and professionally.</li>
    <li> When I had my hip replacement, the staff would spray my incision with a product similar to this before they applied the dressing.  I purchased this so I could provide safe wound care at home.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend tis product. This will seriously keep your loved one or patient clean and does not have a medicinal smell</li>
    <li> A hospital in PA used this product for my mom and we naturally wanted to keep using it.  It works great easy to use and keeps any unwanted smell away.  it is terrific.  We also use the foam wash.  Can&#x27;t get a better product.  We strayed 1 time to try something else.  Threw it away and re ordered this.</li>
    <li> Very good antimicrobial cleanser. We had been given a bottle to clean a family member&#x27;s incision site and when we ran out we ordered more from Amazon.

    <li> my doctor and hospital recommended this product.  no rashes or skin irritation.  sorry it does not come in a larger quantity</li>
