### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It worked great!  </li>
      <li>Nair used to have a roll-on microwaveable sugar wax that worked great, but they discontinued it.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Clean up was very easy with warm water and a wash rag.</li>
      <li>I sometimes wish that the manufacturer would include more of the cloth strips with the wax....</li>
      <li>dont know who gave it more than 1 star.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am going to try nair brazilian cream looking fwd to better results.</li>
      <li>I heated more</li>
      <li>I read the instructions more than 3 times thinking maybe i skipped something.</li>
      <li>This roll on wax would be even better if they introduce refills.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to not have stubble in the morning!</li>
      <li>This waxing kit is incredibly easy to use: 15 seconds in the microwave, roll it on, apply a strip, and remove.  </li>
      <li>But still, it was cheaper than in the store, and this product is not always that easy to find in stores.</li>
      <li>The product was new and in good condition, I followed the instructions to the letter...</li>
      <li>Normally I make my own wax at home and when I&#x27;m feeling spoiled, spend 50 or more bucks on getting a brazilian.</li>
      <li>Being cheap I bought this.</li>
      <li>In addition, its incredibly easy to clean up.</li>
      <li>This is the best waxing product I&#x27;ve ever seen.super easy,fast and no mess compared to old fashioned stick applying.</li>
      <li>I have a special weekend planned and want to be baby smooth.</li>
      <li>I did my reach and learned that hard wax is the best</li>
      <li>It was more of a production to get everything ready and set</li>
      <li>I am a professional waxer and found this product ok, you have to text it, I found that 10 seconds in the micro wave help the wax roll easier, it did the job.</li>
      <li>The wax stays warm for a long time</li>
      <li>it was to hot and no postive results.</li>
      <li>Soak the sheets in hot water n</li>
      <li>I always take off the screw-top applicator, replace the safety cap, and rinse the roller off with hot water.</li>
      <li>and cleaning up the roller head was a snap, just turned it upside down while I cleaned myself up and let the wax return to the bottle and cleaned under warm water.  </li>
      <li>It seemed easy enough but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend this item to a nyone who wants to try waxing.  </li>
      <li>It makes me really upset that this didn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>-Very</li>
      <li>I bought the Nair ready to use roll-on wax with some hesitation as I hadn&#x27;t used wax before.  </li>
      <li>tadaa they are ready to reuse.</li>
      <li>THANKS AMAZON for still selling it...</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend Nair Roll on Wax!</li>
      <li>No mess in your drawers!!</li>
      <li>From my hands , directly to the trash basket.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the was doesnt come out even after keepin it in hot water for long time.</li>
      <li>the product I received was obviously old.</li>
      <li>It seemed like the wax was old as well; the wax had clumps in it.</li>
      <li>i could have just saved my money and gone to the salon to have it done professionally.</li>
      <li>Sticky mess, mild discomfort, and no hair removal whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>but since I have had much practice, I can make the strips last, and for me this is not too big of an issue.  </li>
      <li>This product is the most convenient, fast, and least messy product I have used.</li>
      <li>Seems great and easy to use and while it kinda is... at least for me, left me with lots of painful residual in-grown hairs, as I used it for a bikini wax.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> the product I received was obviously old. It had permanent stains on the lid. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again with all the nicer products out there similarly priced</li>
    <li> worst wax I have ever tried. It seemed like the wax was old as well; the wax had clumps in it. complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is the most convenient, fast, and least messy product I have used. I don&#x27;t know why stores like Target, Walmart etc stopped selling this. I have used this product for the last 10 years at least. THANKS AMAZON for still selling it...I&#x27;d be lost without it!  I sometimes wish that the manufacturer would include more of the cloth strips with the wax....but since I have had much practice, I can make the strips last, and for me this is not too big of an issue.  I HIGHLY recommend Nair Roll on Wax!</li>
    <li> Leaks if you don&#x27;t use all of it. Not impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> This product spreads on very liquidy and does not adhere to the hair, thus making it useless.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems great and easy to use and while it kinda is... at least for me, left me with lots of painful residual in-grown hairs, as I used it for a bikini wax.    It was more of a production to get everything ready and set but I guess it could be worse but I rather pay the $[...] buck and not deal with the in-grown hairs and scarring that I went thru.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I am a veteran waxer. I have waxed everything, everywhere on myself. Normally I make my own wax at home and when I&#x27;m feeling spoiled, spend 50 or more bucks on getting a brazilian. Point being, this product was messy, did not pull out the hair no matter how thick or thin, hot or cool. The strips are worthless. Nothing but an AHHHHHHH! frustration week for me trying to get this product to work.</li>
    <li> I bought the Nair ready to use roll-on wax with some hesitation as I hadn&#x27;t used wax before.  It worked great!  Followed the instructions and zip the hair was gone.  I was worried about the pain but it wasn&#x27;t anything.  Did both legs and the bikini line and seem to have about 1/3 rd of the bottle left.  I did find that you have to pull oppisite the direction of hair growth, if you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t work.  Clean up was very easy with warm water and a wash rag. and cleaning up the roller head was a snap, just turned it upside down while I cleaned myself up and let the wax return to the bottle and cleaned under warm water.  I would reccomend this item to a nyone who wants to try waxing.  Looking forward to not having the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; in a couple of days. lol</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  like this product at all cause it would not come out! My be it could have worked if I microwaved it like the other users have suggested. I would not use it again!</li>
    <li> Simple review: It doesn&#x27;t work.    The product was new and in good condition, I followed the instructions to the letter...and it had no effect.  Sticky mess, mild discomfort, and no hair removal whatsoever.  Tried it on different lengths of hair and on different parts of the body out of curiosity, and same result.    Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> I am a professional waxer and found this product ok, you have to text it, I found that 10 seconds in the micro wave help the wax roll easier, it did the job. It is a little messy.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I tried heating it to get the wax flowing. But nothing helped it. Once i finally got it on my skin, when I pulled the strips off, only a few hairs came off. It was a dissapointment. I was really excited to not have stubble in the morning! But I still have it... Don&#x27;t waste your money on this prodeuct. I was confused about the mixed comments and decided to just try it and see what happened. But that was a bad idea... It makes me really upset that this didn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t know whether to try Nair anymore because i tried another product of their&#x27;s that didn&#x27;t work either. -Very Upset</li>
    <li> I just bought this product today and i must say i am very disappointed! Thats an understatement because I paid almost $12 for this piece of crap! I read the instructions more than 3 times thinking maybe i skipped something. Heated the damn wax again and it still did not even remove one single hair on my leg or arms or underarm...so I went to youtube. watched numerous vids...followed them step by step..nothing. a waste waste of my money. now i have to go and try veet wax strips. maybe that would do something. i could have just saved my money and gone to the salon to have it done professionally. Obviously this product was not tested properly on thicker hair. What a big disappointment. I already adviced my friends who wanted to buy it not to. waste! I cant emphasize on that enough. wish i could just throw d damn thing out!</li>
    <li> This product does not adhere to the hair, so it is useless. Nair used to have a roll-on microwaveable sugar wax that worked great, but they discontinued it. The options they have now, this cold wax and the microwaveable in a jar don´t work.</li>
    <li> This waxing kit is incredibly easy to use: 15 seconds in the microwave, roll it on, apply a strip, and remove.  The wax stays warm for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to re-microwave it in the middle of a leg. Leaves a few stray hairs, but really, what wax doesn&#x27;t? In addition, its incredibly easy to clean up. Sugar wax is water-soluble, so all you do is wash it off afterwards. I always take off the screw-top applicator, replace the safety cap, and rinse the roller off with hot water. No mess in your drawers!! I like that I don&#x27;t have to touch the wax too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is sappy and doesn&#x27;t work at all. I was highly disappointed in this product and will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> But still, it was cheaper than in the store, and this product is not always that easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> From my hands , directly to the trash basket. My bikini zone is red and hurting and NO ONE HAIR has been removed. It&#x27;s sticky and useless. Never again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is the best waxing product I&#x27;ve ever seen.super easy,fast and no mess compared to old fashioned stick applying.It comes with 10 sheets... Soak the sheets in hot water n dry..tadaa they are ready to reuse.This roll on wax would be even better if they introduce refills.</li>
    <li> Being cheap I bought this. I have a special weekend planned and want to be baby smooth. I did my reach and learned that hard wax is the best but I saw this in Walmart and thought ind give it a try. Well it was a bust! It seemed easy enough but you get what you pay for. I was red, bleeding, and hairy. I tried different body parts and it still didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m going to stick with the salon for now...</li>
    <li> very -2 bad prodcut.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know who gave it more than 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt work at all or i got a wrong piece.&lt;br /&gt;all it does it create mess.&lt;br /&gt;the was doesnt come out even after keepin it in hot water for long time. even if it does it does not&lt;br /&gt;spread evenly</li>
    <li> Will just leave you with two words.... HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Came in hard as a rock . Had to throw it away</li>
    <li> I heated the wax roll on. When I apply the wax it was messy. I use the strips no hair removal. I heated more it was to hot and no postive results. I am going to try nair brazilian cream looking fwd to better results.</li>
