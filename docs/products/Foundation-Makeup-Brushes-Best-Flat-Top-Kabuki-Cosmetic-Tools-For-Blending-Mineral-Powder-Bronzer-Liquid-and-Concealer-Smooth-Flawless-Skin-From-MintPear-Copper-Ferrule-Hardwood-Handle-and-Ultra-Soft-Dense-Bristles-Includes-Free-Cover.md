      <li>, it applied my liquid foundation on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I generally clean brushes by wetting a bar of soap, then rubbing the brush bristles over the soap until the pigment disappears, then rinse.  </li>
      <li>I only use Bare minerals foundations as it has proven to be the best fit for my problem skin.</li>
      <li>It is a spendy product and each type of their foundation has a special coordinating application brush to go with it.</li>

      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>This brush helps me to apply a perfectly even, thin layer of cover up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fun to use.  </li>
      <li>(On the other hand, the performance is pretty good so the trade-off may be worth it for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast and it was well packaged.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to any one that needs full coverage on their makeup.</li>
      <li>and this is exactly what I get with this brush every time.</li>
      <li>When I compare it to other Kabuki brushes I own</li>
      <li>I think it performs in line with other popular lines like Sigma Beauty, Crown, and Morphe.</li>
      <li>So easy to apply makeup and no loose hairs falling off.</li>
      <li>and they are super soft.</li>
      <li>The whole thing is put together well -- all the bristles are even and none are loose, and they are safely connected to the metal part and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does give you that &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>I really like this foundation brush.</li>
      <li>I have cleaned it and it held up very well.</li>
      <li>but it was set at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I actually had two people ask in the first weekend after ordering the brush if i got new makeup, because after using the brush the coverage was so smooth</li>
      <li>Very soft yet the bristles are strong enough to apply my cream foundation.  </li>
      <li>It covers my acne better than any other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>quality is most definitely a 5/5 and is her daily brush.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but hold their shape very well.</li>
      <li>brush picks up a decent amount of pigment (I was using pressed powder) and the bristles are soft and non-scratchy against the skin.  </li>
      <li>Dense but very soft blender.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very soft on my skin when applying my foundation.</li>
      <li>Very soft and well made brush.</li>
      <li>I use it to powder my face and distributes it evenly, making the make up look very natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this foundation brush. It&#x27;s the perfect size and it&#x27;s very soft on my skin when applying my foundation. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I use it to powder my face and distributes it evenly, making the make up look very natural. I received a discounted product in exchange of my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Soft and great quality. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products that they have!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Normally I don&#x27;t like applying liquid foundation and how it feels thick on my skin. This brush helps me to apply a perfectly even, thin layer of cover up. It really does give you that &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; look. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as an impulse because it looked nice, but I already had the bareminerals brush.  This brush is a million times better than the bareminerals one.  The bristles are unbelievably soft, yet firm enough to apply the makeup evenly.  The bristles are stiff and dense, so you don&#x27;t waste makeup.  It all stays on your face and doesn&#x27;t get lost in the brush.  It&#x27;s similar to the Sigma brush.  I thought I would keep my bareminerals brush and just use this one occasionally, but now I use this one every day.  I can tell it&#x27;s really high quality and will last forever.  It&#x27;s really fun to use.  It covers my acne better than any other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  I use it with bareminerals foundation powder, and then I use the Mint Pear blending sponge for bronzer.  I need to mention one more time how good the brush feels, it&#x27;s like painting your face with velvet.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush which easily applies powder blush exactly where you direct.  Bristles are soft and so pliable.  Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am in very impressed with how great this brush is. I have been using it with a colored foundation and it performs beautifully.</li>
    <li> This brush is nicely-suited to applying foundation.  I use it primarily to apply powder foundation or setting powder on top of a layer of liquid foundation.  I mostly put the powder in my T-zone to help control oil (I have combination skin), and this brush allows me a fine level of control and a good compromise between that and amount of coverage gained from one brush stroke.  This can be used similarly to a stippling brush but with a larger surface area if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush picks up a decent amount of pigment (I was using pressed powder) and the bristles are soft and non-scratchy against the skin.  The whole thing is put together well -- all the bristles are even and none are loose, and they are safely connected to the metal part and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder applied with this brush distributes evenly without caking.  I got a nice finish from using it.  I generally clean brushes by wetting a bar of soap, then rubbing the brush bristles over the soap until the pigment disappears, then rinse.  That worked here with no trouble at all.  The bristles were still very soft after a washing.  Because of the density of fibers, be prepared for this to take a little while to dry.  (On the other hand, the performance is pretty good so the trade-off may be worth it for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, a nice, effective brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this brush. Great quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very soft and well made brush. Comparable to more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Well-made. Dense but very soft blender. Love it, recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great service&lt;br /&gt;Great value</li>
    <li> I loooooove this brush!! This is @theGivingMom on Instagram and I am so happy with this brush, it provides a flawless application in much shorter time than I used to take using just my fingers! I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality and how luxuriously soft it feels on my skin! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed like a lot of other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past!</li>
    <li> This Flat Top Kabuki brush is ok. When I compare it to other Kabuki brushes I own I think it performs in line with other popular lines like Sigma Beauty, Crown, and Morphe. The only con I have about the brush is that I did not like the strange smell of paint form the handle of the brush. Flap</li>
    <li> this brush is amazing.  it feels like velvet on my face.  I use bare minerals makeup and I can apply very nicely.  I LOVE this brush!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kabuki. Don&#x27;t know how I managed without it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this brush. It is sturdy and very soft it also holds the makeup well. I would defiantly purchase this again even.</li>
    <li> A couple of bristles came out when I washed it, other than that, it applied my liquid foundation on smoothly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great Kabuki! It is soft so it feels amazing while applying make up to your face. I am so happy with the flawless finish that this brush leaves. I like a great clean look and this is exactly what I get with this brush every time. I got compliments from friends who have now purchased the brush, if you are in the market for a Kabuki brush and want one that will give you a flawless finish, this one is the one to get.</li>
    <li> This is a very good brush, considering it&#x27;s very affordable price. The bristles are strong but not too stiff or sharp as some less expensive brushes are. It is soft to the skin and gives perfectly as you&#x27;re blending.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. The bristles are soft but hold their shape very well.</li>
    <li> Good size.  I like that its not really long.  The wide handle makes it easier to hold and easier to use.</li>
    <li> I never review products, ever!!! But this brush worked wonders that I felt like I needed to share. Not only did this brush out perform and other makeup brush but it was set at a reasonable price. At first I was skeptical about using this product because I have a lot of acne scars and had never used a flat top brush for my concealer. But now I am never going back!! This brush evened out my makeup with no streak marks and a matte finish. I HIGHLY recommend this product to any one that needs full coverage on their makeup. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is very soft but I would like it to be more dense. Overall, it was a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I am writing this non-biased review in lieu of getting this item at a reduced cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife uses this every day with her other makeup brushes I bought her.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is most definitely a 5/5 and is her daily brush.</li>
    <li> Love it!  So easy to apply makeup and no loose hairs falling off.</li>
    <li> Very high quality - helps deliver very smooth, flawless coverage for either light wear or heavier coverage.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! I use it to apply concealer and it prefectly blends in together. Must buy!</li>
    <li> Well crafted tight brush! Great for all curves on your face to blend makeup</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She says that she loves using it, and that it is much higher quality than the Sigma ones she has used in the past. Shipping was very fast and it was well packaged. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BRUSH! This is a must have! I love how it feels on my face!</li>
    <li> I only use Bare minerals foundations as it has proven to be the best fit for my problem skin. It is a spendy product and each type of their foundation has a special coordinating application brush to go with it. I currently use the Ready compact foundation and the recommended application brush for it is very similar to this flat top kabuki brush , so I purchased this brush as a back up and replacement! I am very happy that they are so similar in design and this brush is so much more affordable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! It is the perfect size for my powder and blush. The bristles are perfectly conure and they are super soft. I have cleaned it and it held up very well. I didn&#x27;t notice any bristles coming out during the cleaning. This has become a part of my beauty collection.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I use it to apply my pressed powder that I have used for years.  It applies it much better than the sponge.  It provides almost an airbrush finish.  The brush is also a great size, even for travel.</li>
    <li> I Love this brush. I love the flawless coverage i get while using it. I love the buttery smooth texture of the bristles on my face, It is SO soft! I actually had two people ask in the first weekend after ordering the brush if i got new makeup, because after using the brush the coverage was so smooth and I wasn&#x27;t the only one to notice. What a great find!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. Will use it well.thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> Very soft yet the bristles are strong enough to apply my cream foundation.  No streaks, better coverage than using the sponge that came with the foundation!</li>
