<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product twice, both times I used it for just over a year and both times after warranty it stopped working. I feel there is something wrong when it happens twice. I like the product and figured the first time that it could just be a fluke that it quit after a year, but when it happened the second time I felt it was made to break down after warranty. I am hesitant to purchase another for another year and then it breaks down again, I would like to know if anyone else has had this issue.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about it. Leaves my skin smooth and helps alleviate morning puffiness. I was having dry skin and a small breakout issue before using, within 1 week all dryness was gone and all breakouts healed. My skin is now pink, hydrated, and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I got this product for my self and my sister and one more for my friend , they all loved it</li>
    <li> This the second one I have purchased.  Much more sophisticated than the Mia 2.  Would highly recommend.  Sleak and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job cleaning your face.  I gave it four out of five stars because the brush heads do not last long.  Within three weeks the bristles started to look frayed.  I use the product every other day and expected a longer lifespan on the brush.  The number of stars also reflects my skepticism about the price.  I previously used a drug-store brand spinning face brush (not sonic) and it did not perform quite as well as the Clarisonic, but it was not drastically worse.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great purchase!I should have gotten it long time ago. It is a worthwile investment. I use it every night and if time allows in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I use the Aria every morning on my face and it feels so good.  I feel like my face gets so much cleaner than with soap and water alone.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product with many attractive features.  I love the fact that you have a one or two minute option and there are different brush textures for different skin types!</li>
    <li> Perfect item but KNOW YOUR SELLER after a bit of name calling and bad sales tactics, i used my clarisonic and it worked perfectly. it is in no way a fake, nor a knock off....but the guy i bought it from clearly fell off the back of a truck!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he loves using it. His face is clearing up. Dermentologist recommended and I found it at a better price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I received my Clarisonic Aria in a timely manner and it is terrific. It was far cheaper than other sites and I really did a search.</li>
    <li> Cleaning on the go - Less powerful than the regular one, but good enough for a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;- i found this to lost power when off for a long time for some reasons. So beware, don&#x27;t think you can charge it one day and come a week later for your cleaning session.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that. Just good</li>
    <li> wonderful purchase - really do think it makes a difference to my skin!  have been using this for over two years now, moving from the sensitive to the cashmere brush, since I have mature skin (and yes, the cashmere brush does do the job) - very few issues with my skin, at an age when my peers aren&#x27;t all looking quite so good!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous tool. buy it if you can manage to do so.</li>
    <li> My parents bought this for me last Christmas.  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.  If I did, maybe I&#x27;d &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it instead of &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and definitely makes a difference on my skin. Can use it in the shower too.</li>
    <li> afer first  use your skin will  look like its glowing.I use it twice a day and take it with me when I travel. Thanks for making such a great product</li>
    <li> My wife is smoking hot! Don&#x27;t think that is all due to this product but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. She loves the way it works. She is happy and I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years now and receive frequent compliments on my skin!  Tip:  During my last visit to the salon, an esthetician told me this works best when used with LIGHT pressure.  The vibration of the brush is what helps exfoliate and it doesn&#x27;t work as well if you are pressing the brush hard against your skin.  I hope that helps someone else :)  I recommend buying this and using in addition to your regular skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of my esthetician who said it would make a difference and she was right. I&#x27;m 62 and my skin is in very good condition, but this has taken it up a notch over the 6 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. My skin feels very soft and smooth. It cleans the skin like an electric toothbrush cleans the teeth. My skin feels so clean and my pores are noticably smaller. I just use my normal cleanser with it, but the sample cleansing product they included is also very nice...no chemicals and a very organic fragrance. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this device. Not only does it drastically clean your pours with just one use, over time, it reduces any build up or residue remaining on your face from crappy products.&lt;br /&gt;I do not leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Terrific product! My face has never looked more clear or more smooth in years! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great upgrade from my original Mia which broke down after 4 years (not bad!). Love the new way to charge the machine so convenient. The 3 speeds do make a difference when my cheeks get dry (higher setting) and for the oiler parts of my face (lower setting) since I have combination skin. Overall my skin wouldn&#x27;t be able to function without a clarisonic, just makes my skin so clean and clear.</li>
    <li> I felt my skin tighten and very clean after my first usage. The battery was not very good as it died after 3 months and I had to change the new one. I wish the device could hold more battery. I charged overnight and used it only around 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this item on Amazon, it stopped working after just a few months.  Clarisonic refused to honor it&#x27;s 2-year warranty agreement, because Amazon is apparently not an authorized dealer (even though it said that it was being sold by Clarisonic on Amazon.)  Clarisonic claimed that there were knock offs being sold through Amazon and then told me to contact Amazon to get my money back.  Because it was past the 30-day return period, Amazon technically wasn&#x27;t able to give me a refund.  (HOWEVER, Amazon was kind enough to refund half.)  So, while I think the product worked well while it worked, clearly Clarisonic&#x27;s shoddy manufacturing and schiester business practices demonstrate that it&#x27;s not worth the cost of the machine.  I&#x27;m guessing consumers will be better served by other brands of similar devices.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and love it.  Totally makes your face feel like you have paid big bucks on a facial.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase I have made in a long time.  My skin is so soft and clean after using for only a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She says she loves it and is very happy for it. And everyone knows, &amp;#34;...if momma&#x27;s happy ...life is good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This completely changed my skin and made it super smooth and clear. I have ance prone skin and using this has made a huge difference for me. My combination skin is manageable and vibrant. It&#x27;s pricey but completely worth it. I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> After using the the fair skin rotating bristle brush for a few months&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it didn&#x27;t rid my skin of black heads.&lt;br /&gt;What worse it that it left me with broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks!</li>
    <li> I felt like it was great at opening up my pores and giving my skin better texture, but it made me breakout. I used the sensitive skin brush head on the lowest speed for months and my acne got worst (specifically cystic). When I stopped using it, my acne cleared up considerably.</li>
    <li> I love this product and think my face feels so much cleaner than when I just used a washcloth to remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> After hearing about this device from friends for years, and trying the cheaper versions of it from the drugstore, I bucked up and invested in one of these, the real deal.  And boy has it made a difference.  In the months since I started using it, it has made my skin softer, clearer, and removed many of the hyperpigmentation spots on my forehead from old acne.  While I still get occasional blemishes, the severity and number of them has dropped significantly.  I actually have had numerous compliments on my skin&#x27;s luminosity from strangers, even when without any makeup.  I use a Dermalogica cleanser with it, and moisturize with Josie Maran light Argan Oil.  At night I also tone with the Shiseido skin brightener before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering getting one, I highly recommend it!  It is so worth the investment because let&#x27;s face it, real facials are expensive, and this one is actually quite economical in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- A converted Clarisonic believer</li>
    <li> The only reason i give this product three stars instead of five it&#x27;s because of how long it lasted. I bought it less than a year ago. I don&#x27;t use it regularly probably 2- 3 times a week. Yesterday i was going to use it but it was dead i thought it didn&#x27;t charge or something so i left it to charge. Today i went to used it again and still dead. It&#x27;s the battery. But since you cannot replace the battery now is useless. The product itself is great i love it. But the battery lasted for less than a year that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> It is the authentic Clarisonic! It arrived on time. It comes with one brush for the acne and charger.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> Received the product faster than expected.  Package was in excellent condition.  Have been using the sonic cleaner for about 2 weeks and have begun to notice an improvement in how my skin looks.  I had just spent a lot of money on a laser facial and photo facial to get rid of small cysts/bumps, but it did not work.  With this sonic cleaner, about half of the cysts have gotten smaller and are starting to disappear.  I could not be more pleased - I wish I had tried this product a long time ago.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I buy a Clarisonic device to use when I wash my face due to adult acne.  I have been using it every night for a couple of months.  The Aria used in conjunction with my prescription medication has given my clear skin with smaller pores, fewer blackheads, and less redness.  Before this I tried the in-store generic version (I think it was Revlon or Oil of Olay?) and the Aria by far exceeds that in performance.</li>
    <li> I received this brush as a gift and once I began using it I wondered why I didn&#x27;t get it sooner. It takes just minutes a day for your skin to become softer, cleaner and glowing. I like that it has a drying stand and timmer for your to remind when to switch to different skin area. Make sure to register the brush at Clarrisonic to receive a discount which can be used for additional brush heads. I think the deep cleansing brush is a must but its sold separately with this kit you will only receive sensitive brush head which is great for beginners and for everyday use. Overall great product and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Battery stopped holding a charge just after it was no longer under warranty.  If you call the toll free number for &amp;#34;troubleshooting&amp;#34; their solution is to offer to sell you another one at a slight discount.  Don&#x27;t bother with this product unless you plan to replace it every year.</li>
    <li> Brush batteries inside brush will stop charging after a couple of uses.  There is no way of repairing this brush and Clarisonic  will not replace brush if warranty has expired.  BE cautious of warranty and use it before it expires. The  ni cad batteries used inside this brush do not have a very long life span.  Although the brush is amazing,  purchasing this brush can turn out to be a very expensive mistake . Clarisonic must be laughing all the way to the bank.</li>
    <li> This is a must have! My skin has never looked so clear, it also gets rid of ingrown hairs within days!!! Amazing everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> Frankly, this is a high-priced item and I am not seeing much of a change in my complexion by using it to justify the expense.&lt;br /&gt;I think it has more to do with your facial cleanser than using this fancy &amp;#34;ultrasonic&amp;#34; unit.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended that she buy one for some stubborn acne.  Amazon was the most reputable dealer with the best price so she bought it on this site.  After 2-3 weeks we&#x27;ve noticed a markable improvement in her skin quality.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone else suffering from acne on their skin.  I think it&#x27;s important to note that this product should be used in a regimented fashion as part of a routine and not just periodically to achieve desired results.  Also, don&#x27;t expect an overnight improvement.  Like any other effective skin care treatment, it takes a bit of time to get the skin to appropriately.  She still gets the periodic zit, but it&#x27;s no where near the problem it was before committing to this machine.</li>
    <li> This product was bought as a gift for a female friend of mine, and she loves it.  I saw a difference in her skin immediately.</li>
    <li> I used to exfoliate every week or so with St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub, but have not touched the stuff since getting this for my, cough cough, wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a far better job of smoothing and evening out skin tone than scrub and fingertips and does so in fraction of the time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my gym bag and love it! I have the original at home.  The charger is a great design as well.  I recommend this model because the price and performance balance can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I love my Aria!! I have had for about a month now and it is working flawlessly with no battery issues. Since using the Aria once per day, my skin is as smooth as silk and my pores appear to be smaller. The cleanser provided with the Aria seems to cleanse decently although I use another cleanser as my preferred facial wash. I have not experienced any breakouts or irritation from using the device, very happy to have splurged and treated myself to the Aria.</li>
    <li> very nice design, works as described, but is a bit harsh on my face.  Can only use 1 time per week using the softest cleaning head.</li>
    <li> Still using today.  Love both my clarisonics!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself after seeing it on tv on a morning show, again on the Dr. Oz show and reading about it in a magazine all within a day or two. So I went online and researched the Aria. This is my first Clarisonic purchase.  The Aria is very quiet, quick to charge and holds a charge for a long time (week +).  The timing feature gives a soft beep when it&#x27;s time to move on to another section of your face.  I noticed a difference in my skin tone the first time I used it. My face is much smoother and softer to the touch.  So glad that I purchased it.  If your on the fence, make this your&#x27;s; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing Clarisonic for a while and decided to splurge this Xmas on a present for myself this year. I decided on the Aria rather than the Mia for the additional features and so happy that i did. The 3 different speeds are great for days when you need that extra clean feeling or a gentle clean for those sensitive days....i.e breakouts. The battery life indicator is color coded and lets you know when its time to re-charge again. A big plus over the MIA. This is actually a great kit and on sale! And for the price includes a deep pore cleansing brush. Brought separately this would have been $250 plus.  I&#x27;ve used all three speeds and even at the highest its still super gentle on my skin. I love the way my skin feels after the using the Aria. My lotions definitely \\&quot;sink\\&quot; in more to my skin, which i definitely need in the winter! I&#x27;ve also noticed that i need less make-up......the Aria leaves my skin with a super clean glow. Buy this kit....promise you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> This is not a luxury item, it&#x27;s a necessity.  You will not regret  the money spent to properly clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;My sister and son talked me into it this Xmas, and I&#x27;m a believer.  It&#x27;s great.  Lifts your spirits somehow.&lt;br /&gt;Get one.  You&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> First time using a Clarisonic and I went all out and purchased the Aria. I absolutely love how it makes me skin feel and look! I love washing my face now. :) :)</li>
    <li> The product only worked well for three weeks from the date of delivery. The battery went low and I charged it  and although the white light came on that indicates a full charge, the brush did not work and instead indicated that the battery was still low. After several attempts to charge the battery that did not ever get fully charged, I decided that I will contact the manufacturer for the default kit. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> A quality product. I was not too sure about getting this because I have sensitive skin. Too much friction causes me to breakout. I find the deep pore brush softer and more gentle than the sensitive brush. Go figure. My guess is that the acne brush is even more gentle. If you have large pores they will not magically get smaller with using this device. That being said, clean pores are less noticeable. I have been using it for several weeks now and the clarity of my skin has improved. It also feels smoother and softer. I used it once a day every other day on the low setting in the beginning. I continue to use the same cleansing products that I did before I bought the Clarisonic Aria. Do not feel like you have to buy their cleansing products in order for it to work for you. With a little experimenting I have found what works for me. I should have started using something like this years ago. Not so sure there was anything like this when I was a teen. I am 56 now. Its never too late to start good skin care. Amazon has the best price. Especially if you are a prime member. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, pulled right out of the box, charged for 2 hours, then used. light weight, easy grip handle, easy to clean, gentle on the skin, cleans my face so much better. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for three weeks and notice a huge difference in my pores. I did experience a little of the purging other reviews spoke about. The only negative I&#x27;ve seen so far is that my face has been flakey even though I moisturize daily. I don&#x27;t push down when using the brush so I was a little surprised. It might just be the weather. I&#x27;ve seen doubled the amount I moisturizeing I do and haven&#x27;t had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So the only issue I have with the it is that there isn&#x27;t a low battery warning. It dies unexpectedly while washing your face. If you try to turn it on after it died then the light under the power button flashes red. At first I thought I was just missing the warning but nope. The light is blue all the way up until it dies in the middle of washing your face. I don&#x27;t always remember to charge it so it&#x27;s pretty inconvenient to find out it needs charged while I&#x27;m trying to clean my face.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it  works great. don&#x27;t know what else to say, but it won&#x27;t let me submit until I do.  So it works great</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Cleanes really well. Love the feel and affect the Aria gives after a throughly cleaning. I&#x27;d recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I got his hoping that it would help with my acne and although my face&lt;br /&gt;does feel clean after using it my acne has not improve at all, if anything&lt;br /&gt;it has gotten worse!&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously thinking about returning it!&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice product, very sleek looking but didnt work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 4 later and still no change... I do sadly think this was a waste of&lt;br /&gt;my money, i keep using just for the purpose of washing my face, but not&lt;br /&gt;expecting anything anymore.</li>
    <li> I got my Clarisonic Aria for Christmas and I have used it both morning and night religiously ever since.  I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since I started using my Clarisonic; my skin tone is brighter, my blemishes have disappeared and it allows my skin to absorb moisturizer much better.  I also have a very bad scar on my face from an accident that occurred years ago and it has become less noticeable.  I now only use a tinted moisturizer rather than foundation and powder because of the improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to dry skin and during the first couple of weeks, I noticed my skin was become flakey, but I was persistent with my routine and now that my skin has adjusted, it is not nearly as dry as it was pre-Clarisonic.  I will say, I also use Josie Maran Argan Oil as well as a deep moisturizer as part of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is costly and I waited to receive this as a gift, but it is worth splurging on at any time!  Who knows, you may even save on your makeup in the end because your skin will look beautiful without it.  Go for the splurge!</li>
    <li> I toyed with purchasing a Clarisonic for myself but didn&#x27;t - so glad my daughter splurged and got this for me!  I love the three speeds which have allowed me to experiment and find the speed that is best for my skin.  This product has taken my already decent skin to the next level and it is glowing!  My moisturizers seems to be more effective and my skin is SO soft.  I have been using the Luxe and gentle brushes and both are great.</li>
    <li> Any good exfoliating, acid-based facial wash would do the same for much less. I didn&#x27;t see any difference after one week&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> First of all this is an expensive little device. And that alone is very off putting. Then it promises amazing results. HAH! Well guess what. It lives up to the hype. My 13 year old uses it DAILY without prompting because she sees results. I bought a separate scubbing head and started using it to see what the fuss was about. One of my co-workers-who is a guy- asked what it is I did because he wanted to tell his wife. I work long (12-16 hour days) in a dusty dirty enviroment and men noticed my 47 year old skin looking better.</li>
    <li> I work out a lot, and thus sweat a lot. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was missing on my 1-2 times/day face scrubbing until I got this. It gets into my pores &amp; cleans them out a lot better than I can, and with less force.</li>
    <li> This is my second Clarisonic purchase.  I first one I bought was about 6 years ago and recenly my grandmother tried it and fell in love with it.  I decided to give her my old one (with new brushes of course) and bought this new one for myself. I love how my skin feels after each use and my pores are unbleievably smaller.  It also gives me a natural glow and helps with my dry patches.</li>
    <li> I have always had large pores and am prone to acne and struggle with keeping my skin clear. Since owning the Aria I have not had any breakouts! It was money well spent! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Aria Sonic Skin Cleansing kit  was recommended by my esthetician. She told me that my skin would&lt;br /&gt;improved by using this machine. I used the tube of cleansing cream that came with the machine. It was very good,&lt;br /&gt;but I will probably use the cleanser I already have. I use the machine once a day and my skin is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin feels so health and clean. So easy to pack and take with you everywhere you go. I love that it has adjustable control depending on how sensitive your skin is. Everything with ordering went quick and shipping was good also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Aria brush for about one month now and I love it. I usually use it in the shower and the handy timer lets you know when to move on to a different part of your face. I seriously noticed a difference after one use. It was a subtle change but my skin looked \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and brighter. At first I was using it every day but now I use it every other day. It tickles when you get to your nose, that&#x27;s the one thing I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the size of the Aria, I think it&#x27;s the smallest one available right now. I can&#x27;t imagine using a bigger one. The drying stand gives me a tidy place to put it, too.  It&#x27;s easy to charge and the charge lasts for a long time (with every other day use, keep In mind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*: since submitting this review, I&#x27;m back to using the Aria every day and notice an improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s softer! It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day. Maybe just don&#x27;t use it with a cleanser that has exfoliating beads in it.  It comes with a sensitive skin brush which suits me fine even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  If you want to get a feel for other brushes before buying, you can see them at Macy&#x27;s or other department store that carries this product.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has 3 speeds.  At first I found it difficult to change speeds; I had to push the button really hard.  Now I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it but I leave it at the medium setting anyway.  There&#x27;s also an indicator light that lets you know when the battery is running low.  It goes from orange to red.  Keep an eye out for it so you&#x27;re not left with a drained battery like I was this morning.  One last thing, the USB charge connection is super handy, it makes traveling with it easy.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case though.</li>
    <li> I feel like my 55 year old skin is smoother. I was looking for a bit of  constant gentle exfoliation without having to put irritating chemicals on my skin (like they do in some spas)  Been using it only for about a month, once /day. It&#x27;s not magical but it works well! I&#x27;d recommend this to either young or older.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife after seeing these type face cleansing kits highly recommended. She loves it, says it is better than going to have a facial because she can do it every day. Her skin feels better, cleaner, and looks great. Doesn&#x27;t know how she ever kept her face so clean before. She has very sensitive skin and says it so soft that it feels much better than the very soft wash raggs she normally uses.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I received the product last week and still have not used it. I have been trying to call the toll free number with a question prior to using it, and after calling for three days, I&#x27;ve given up. Each time I called I had to wait on hold between 15 and 30 minutes and no one ever answered the call. If Clarisonic cannot or do not want to handle the volume of calls, they should remove the toll free number from their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that I only called after going through the FAQ and not finding the question I wanted an answer for. I also asked a sales representative at a beauty store and since she did not know the to my question, she too suggested I call the toll free number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that was a waste of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Reid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Aria for exactly one year now. I&#x27;m 25 with chronically oily skin, and have tried just about every possible remedy to deal with the breakouts that come along with that. The first time I used this, I was completely amazed at how clean my skin felt. Before I was exfoliating, using foaming cleansers, astringents, masks, you name it- but my face was never actually clean until the moment I first tried my Clarisonic. Everything was going really well with it, I&#x27;ve tried different brushes and had great success with my skin clearing up like never before in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, in the past couple of months it&#x27;s been causing me a lot of grief over not charging as it should. I&#x27;m dependent on this thing now, and if I don&#x27;t use it two times per day my face with noticeably react. When I charge it allllll night and expect I will be able to use it in the morning and it immediately goes dead as soon as I take it off the charger and press the On button... that&#x27;s frustrating. Weirdly, it&#x27;s inconsistent. I just went on a week long trip and brought my charger assuming I&#x27;d need it, but it lasted 6 days and nights with no issues at all (for reference, I use it on its fastest setting every single use). Sometimes it lasts a week on a single charge, sometimes it only works once or twice or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I feel that a year of clear skin has been worth the $200 I spent on this, but it&#x27;s sad that I&#x27;m already considering replacing it, as living without it simply isn&#x27;t an option!</li>
    <li> I ask all my clients with great mature skin what there secret is , and a lot of them tell me they use a clarisonic. I bought the aria and I noticed the lines around my chest look much better and my skin is better than its ever been. If I had to do this over again I would have bought the Mia 2 instead from a price prospective. I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between speed 2 and 3. I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge difference between brush heads.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this brush, every time i used, it made my skin smooth and it seemed like it was working for my acne. It was very easy to use and was convenient to charge. But after 3 days of using it, battery life was 1 min and 30 seconds when it promised 20mins - 30mins on a full charge. They say to plug it in different outlets to reset the charger, I did three times, full charged on all 3 outlets, and went out again in 1 min 30 - 2mins, and yes the clarisonic charger indicater was solid white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking of exchanging this for a new clarisonic, but if this one had problems in the first 3 days, (and trying to live with the problem for 2 weeks now), then i dont expect this to last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> This is my second clarisonic, the first one lasted years before I accidently damaged it.  This little skin machine is much easier to hold and use.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin baby soft and takes off all my makeup, from what I can tell! Would definately recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading and watching lots of positive reviews.  I however am not a huge fan of the way it feels on the face.  It&#x27;s not very soft and feels more like it&#x27;s scratching my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to make sure you get all the make up off.  I recommend this product to all the ladies that want to keep there skin youthful.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and so much better than the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand.&lt;br /&gt;I liken this to my sonic toothbrush; I am making an investment in my health.</li>
    <li> After much research and deliberation, I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I have bouts of stress induced adult acne, and this keeps my pores open and clean. My skin feels rejuvenated and clean after usage.</li>
    <li> The fact that it has a USB plug in is a real plus.  My original clarisonic bit the dust about 2 months ago.  I went a month without a clarisonic and my skin was so hungry for a good cleaning.  I love the new Aria, it seems to do a better job than the original one that I had for about 5 years, Love Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Felt a difference immediately.  Charging is easy.  Noticed some positive changes in my skin complexion after a week of use!</li>
    <li> I love my clarasonic! My face felt smoother after one use, it looks better now as well. It&#x27;s easy to use, only takes 1-2 minutes and leaves my face glowing! It keeps a charge for a decent time as well.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic thinking it would improve my skin by exfoliating and getting the deep down dirt out. What it did is send me into 4 weeks of constant break outs. I used the sensitive head and was very gentle when pressing on my skin but still I was breaking out. I normally have completely clear skin and get one pimple a month. This product gave me worse breakouts than I have in my entire life. It did not help my skin at all but seemed to aggravate it and make my skin look much worse which is not the outcome I was looking for. I ended up selling it to a girlfriend who has really bad acne and scarring and she said it changed her life. Go figure. My skin was already good and the Clarisonc just irritated it. So I guess the lesson is if you have normal-good skin this is probably not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I am very happy with it&#x27;s results.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but I am seeing a differnce.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used Clarisonic for a few years and really like it.  However it seems to only last a couple of years.  Would still buy again.</li>
    <li> I started using my Aria with the cleansing gel. It is exactly what they said. I was a little scared at first to spend money on something I had not tried first. But I thought if it is not what I expect I will just send it back. Well they can&#x27;t have it back. Huh. I am 63  yrs. Old, and  normally I don&#x27;t use anything on  my face ,  except &amp;#34;Borghese products&amp;#34;, by the way if you have never heard of or tried Borghese skincare YOU are missing out on  remarkable products. I have no wrinkles at all, no blemishes. But back to clarisonic, I needed an extra helper as far as exfoliating goes, that&#x27;s why I bought this Aria, in order to keep your face bright and clean YOU have to exfoliate. So I ordered another brush, it is the one for deep pore cleaning. I am suppose to get it today.  By the way borghese is made in Italy.</li>
    <li> girls love it.....guys maybe not so much?</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Purchased on March 18, 2013 and it now has completely stopped working. I took care of it, charged it properly, left it on the drying stand, etc. and about three months ago it started to act up and since it was bought on Amazon &#x3D; NO WARRANTY. I now cannot use it at all because everytime I press power it turns on but then the power dies after a few seconds even when the light is white, not yellow or red. I&#x27;ve charged it and it just beeps constantly, randomly vibrates, won&#x27;t turn off when I press the power button, and every few seconds when I think it is completely off it randomly beeps/one second vibrates on its own without me touching it. I just called Clarisonic a few minutes ago and turns out they cannot give me a new one because I purchased it on Amazon. According to the sales representative, there are a lot of fakes on Amazon and you should purchase only on the Clarisonic website to ensure a warranty because trust me you will need it. Worked great for about 6 months now I have to purchase a new one from the Clarisonic website. Beware.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. I&#x27;m glad I opted for the Aria over the Mia just to have the three settings options. As an woman in her late 20&#x27;s that&#x27;s always struggled with moderate acne I&#x27;m happy to say that within a month I&#x27;ve been able to clear up my skin and I think this brush was the saving grace! I&#x27;ve never had skin so smooth and it&#x27;s well worth the investment. I&#x27;ve tried 3 other brushes before biting the bullet on the expensive clarisonic brush and I wish I had put my money into this much sooner. Ordering one for my younger sister this Christmas. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy it as much as I do!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing.. if you get it from an authorized dealer. As of right now according to Clarisonic headquarters there are NO authorized dealers selling this set on amazon (I went through the entire list with their customer service department). When mine came in, the battery indicator did not work properly and was a big red flag. I had to return this item - which Amazon was super helpful and amazing about and purchase it from another online retailer that IS an authorized dealer. Just beware that you may not be getting an authentic product, I would double check with Clarisonic first to see if your seller is legit.</li>
    <li> I received the Clarisonic Aria on 03/29/15. It stopped working on 06/26/15. What a short life for such a pricey product. During the three months it worked, it was great. I am stunned, because I have an original Clarisonic (8+ years old) that continues to work well. What a dreadful waste of money.</li>
    <li> Mine was the skin you hated in high school/college: Flawless, &#x27;porcelain,&#x27; perfect, gorgeous. And maintenance? What maintenance? A washcloth, warm water and a little tub of Noxzema every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then 40 happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years now, I&#x27;ve rarely gotten through a week without having to draw attention away from the newest breakout or spackle over last week&#x27;s mess. It started as just T-zone trouble, but now it&#x27;s a craps shoot - chin, cheeks, hairline, even in my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve tried everything! All the classic fixes, newfangled solutions, infomercial miracles, naturopathic powders and blender goo, pills, cleanse diets, all of it.  Last week I was out of town visiting some friends, and my face was in a particularly bad way. I&#x27;d forgotten to pack my usual face wash and hadn&#x27;t been to the store to grab something. I used my friend&#x27;s Clarisonic.  Holy crap.  I&#x27;d had two nasty remnants from last week: They were almost entirely smooth and far less red/angry.  Another 2-3 blemishes were in the early stages, and they seemed to have... changed their mind!  I immediately ordered my own kit.  I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic twice a day for a week now, and I think I may be able to let people see me without makeup for the first time in 10 years or so.  My skin feels clean and smooth - well, more than smooth.  It feels polished.  I love this thing.  It&#x27;s the best investment I&#x27;ve made with regard to my skincare.</li>
    <li> I had the original model for years and it was still going strong but I wanted to update to newer model.  Clarisonic products never fail to deliver.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin periodically thru-out my life, so when I turned 55 I was hoping to find the miracle to turn back the hands of time.  Well this isn&#x27;t it.  :)  But - I really do like the Aria and it has made a difference for my skin.  My large pores are still large - but definitely not as noticeable as before.  I am liking the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my skin and there is just a general better look to my face.  (I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense or not.)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product with a side note of - Nothing will help your skin if you don&#x27;t use it.  Use this - it&#x27;s easy, not too time consuming and I think you will like the results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 23 and I&#x27;m over that, but we share this Clarisonic and both saw wonderful results. I have extremely sensitive skin and it has never been a concern, only beneficial.  I cannot believe the difference in the size of pores, wrinkles smoothed out and texture of my skin. We both are in love with this Clarisonic. Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was shipped when promised and came in perfect shape.  I also used a very good brand name facial cleanser with this.  And it was just fine.  But will get the cleanser from Amazon also.</li>
    <li> I love my Aria sonic skin cleanser.  It&#x27;s so easy to set up and use.  My skin has never felt so clean after using it.  You can use the one-minute setting or change it to two-minutes.  I&#x27;m lazy and just use it 2 one-minute pulses.  It&#x27;s completely waterproofing for shower use and I love the charger/drying stand.  I&#x27;m 40-something with average skin so the normal brush and gentle cleanser work fine on me.  I highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s interested in purchasing one.  I hope everyone gets similar resolutes with their Clarisonics.</li>
    <li> Received timely and the product delivered was as described and works great.  Should you chose to purchase a Clarisonic, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The person who I bought for loved it. It works well and was well packaged. I would love to get one for myself!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now, and the main change i&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin is so much softer! i get stress breakouts and, though i haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since using it, it hasn&#x27;t cleared my skin up completely. i do sometimes get those little white bumps, and this has definitely done the trick in getting rid of those! easy to use and convenient to have. the timer is very helpful and it has such a cool way of charging!</li>
    <li> The item arrived incredibly quickly and actually lives up to the hype (which I&#x27;ve found most products do not).  My skin has never felt cleaner or better.  Beautogen sold the product for a really great price and it arrived extremely quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> It was nice at first but I don&#x27;t really feel the cleansing any longer. I have changed the heads to the deeper cleansing one and I am not noticing any difference. Just in case, I asked at an Ulta how they recommend using this and honestly I don&#x27;t think it cleans very well. The sonic vibrations are better suited if one keeps the device on the same area but where is the friction needed to move the dead skin and clean the face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should rotate and &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; across the face.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after very light use only after 6 months. The seller did not honor an exchange or replacement.</li>
    <li> This was well worth the buy. My skin feel so much softer and a nice glow. It cleans your face better than just your hands with a cleanser.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive.  But you can really tell the difference after using it.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a clean face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year.  I use it 2-3 times per week and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s great for deep cleansing and exfoliating.  I wish the replacement brush heads were not so expensive, that feels a bit scammy to me.</li>
    <li> Got the Clarisonic Aria for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  Can&#x27;t wait for her to let me try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a brush type cleaner for years and find that the Aria does do a better&lt;br /&gt;job getting my face clean.  I do not find any improvement in pore size though.  All in all&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have waited to see what product would do for women who bought it. I finally decided to try it and am obsessed with not only how much cleaner my skin really is (use make up remover, wash with soap and water and THEN use it to see how much make up was STILL on your skin!) but how great the texture and clarity of my skin has become. I realized that it&#x27;s also exfoliating and that I can also use a moisturizing crème to infuse some extra moisture to my skin. I have the travel size that you can recharge with your laptop and look forward to coming back to my room at night and using this before bed. So great!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I do wish the brushes were a little easier to remove. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Amazing product although I only got to use it twice before it stopped charging. For couple hundred dollars you would think they should give you items that last at least a few months. Waste of money</li>
    <li> She uses daily.  Listing showed new.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure but seems like there was no wrapping inside unit.&lt;br /&gt;And the barcode had been trimmed off the box.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little suspicious but I will say so far it&#x27;s been just fine.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using the Clarisonic Skin Cleanser, I could feel the diffencene in my skin tone.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> the price is lower than others shops but the quality is wonderful! High c/p. I would high recommend you come here to buy.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Clarisonic Pro and the only reason I purchased this one was because I dropped mine on the bathroom floor breaking it;  I would recommend any Clarisonic unit; I had my previous one for several years and used it daily; this one is smaller than the pro; easy to use; and takes up less space.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  No drawbacks.  It makes my face feel very clean and does remove little dry areas or flakes and allows deep absorption of moisturizers or serums.</li>
    <li> As I have very sensitive skin I found the Aria Cleansing Kit very gentle and I love the results. It also exfoliates leaving the skin rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend the kit and have also bought one for my adult daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 yr old, fair skinned female, and I use this one to two times per day.  I follow it with Strivectin.  If you are wondering whether to by an expensive face serum/cream or this, by the Clarisonic.  It will do more for your skin than any topical skin product.  Firms skin tone, decreases poor size, reduces breakouts.  I used to use a cream cleanser to cleanse.  I thought my face was clean.  I still use that same cream cleanser to remove eye make up and foundation.  Then I use the Clarisonic.  Make up still comes off on the brush of the Clarisonic.  So I know I was not getting my face clean using cream cleanser, hot water and a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> My face never felt cleaner and more refreshed.  It gets me going in the morning and is like a little spa treatment when I get home in the evening.  The fact that you can charge the Aria on-the-go with either a USB connection, or a small wall plug, made it a no-brainer purchase for me.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a facial with her Clarisonic for a few days before my wedding. I was hooked my skin glowed on my wedding day. Now with my own, my dark acne marks are fading dark circles under eyes fading as well. Great product, getting one for my teen niece as a Christmas gift so she can avoid teen break outs.</li>
    <li> I am constantly amazed at how this device cleans my skin without breaking me out or causing some irritation.  I do have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; after using it and my skin is super clean - both in feeling and to the touch. I feel it was well worth the money, but plan to use another \\&quot;clear\\&quot; liquid cleanser with it once the product that came with it runs out.  I think it will be just as effective.  I advise this for all types of skin because I have combination skin and have had no issues.  I also do not use this every single day - maybe 3 times a week and it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she really likes it. Removes dry skin ,cleans, and tones face area without fail. That is why a lot of experts use this item. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good，i like it ,it very useful and helpful ,it send very quickly ,it is very wonderful product ,and cheaper,easy,comfetable ,</li>
    <li> My family members bought one of the first Clarisonic and it&#x27;s still working today. I had a problem with the Aria in regards to the storage holder. The unit would not charge correctly, until finally I took if off and began charging it on the counter top. Have not had any problems since that time. So the holder is pretty much useless. I was afraid I was going to have to call the company and tell them the unit was defective. But it turns out it was just a matter of the magentic charging block being in the proper area. Overall it does a superior job cleaning- did have issues with some blemishes. My dermatologist told me that it often happens to people with sensitive skin and to reduce use to once a day. Then use your usual method to wash your face the other time. You can cleanse the brushes with an antimicrobial soap so they can extent another 3 months according to my doctor.</li>
    <li> Picture is misleading, if you are wanting the kit pictured, do not order from this seller. You will receive different box than shown, with only sensitive head and small cleaner included.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  After just 1 use my skin was noticeably softer to the touch.  It&#x27;s been about 2-3 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen an overall improvement; *however* I have brokeout but I kind of expected this at first based on other reviews.  I can&#x27;t wait to fully see what this baby can do.</li>
    <li> The product arrived a lot faster than expected and glad it did. I began using it the first night and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I received it a few weeks ago. My face feels a lot cleaner and smoother. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
