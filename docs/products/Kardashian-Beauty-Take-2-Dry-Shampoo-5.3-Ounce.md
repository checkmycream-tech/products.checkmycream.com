### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This was great.</li>
      <li>Smell great</li>
      <li>Works good</li>
      <li>I loved this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>The product on its own works amazingly</li>
      <li>I can describe the smell to be a roses kind of smell.</li>
      <li>However, this one smells great and it is super light.</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo I own.</li>
      <li>Cheap!</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo, and would give it 5 starts, but I agree with everyone else.</li>
      <li>There is more air than there is product.</li>
      <li>I tried soaking the top using a toothpick, I tried everything.</li>
      <li>and I see that there are many people facing this problem.</li>
      <li>I used it three days in a row and my hair looks better than the day before.</li>
      <li>The product is ok but still leaves my hair a bit oily.</li>
      <li>EXCEPT that the spray top stops working</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and fades slightly after dry-down, the results are great, and while you can sometimes see the shampoo if you spray it too closely to your hair, I found it to be mostly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s a huge problem with the nozzle.</li>
      <li>I love the look of the bottle looks great on my black</li>
      <li>and I am well aware of the technique to make sure that the bottle has *</li>
      <li>Nothing special about it</li>
      <li>Still the most amazing dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>If your spray works, you&#x27;ve got a really good dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I bought this dry shampoo after I read several good reviews and, generally, I really liked the product.</li>
      <li>Skip on this product and use Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray  - far superior product!</li>
      <li>I liked it until it stopped coming out of the bottle after the third use.</li>
      <li>Smell is too much like perfume, would prefer clean smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back because of the white residue it leaves, but I love the way it smells!!</li>
      <li>I never got a chance to really use it because the spray cap didn&#x27;t work after the first use!</li>
      <li>I had to return the first one because the nozzle was stuck and wasn&#x27;t letting anything come out.</li>
      <li>fully* stopped spraying before you put it away; you have to hold the bottle to your ear and listen to hear any whistling, and if you do, you have to twist the top and jiggle it around until it&#x27;s silent.</li>
      <li>Buy it only if you&#x27;re OK with the possibility of getting a dysfunctional one.</li>
      <li>That whistling indicates that the bottle is still spewing out some air (because these bottles are super cheap and dry shampoo can easily jam them up) and, if you don&#x27;t stop it off completely, the next time you go to use the product you will not be able to spray anything out because all the air will have leaked out.</li>
      <li>Had a nice scent to it, but didn&#x27;t take out all the grease in my hair like other products do.</li>
      <li>Other than that i absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I have dark hair and work out and love this shampoo to buy me another day before having to wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend saving your money and not buying this shampoo until they fix the bottle.</li>
      <li>I did not have high expectations for this, since it was a &amp;#34;Kardashian&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>They really need to figure this out, until then do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>have bought this two separate times, thinking that my first bottle was faulty, only to have the second bottle run out of air just as quickly.</li>
      <li>Even after following through on this tedious technique, I was only able to get about 3-4 good uses out of this product before my bottle lost all ability to spray; that is to say, I was only able to use about half of the dry shampoo</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised it was Kardashian Beauty.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>I am very used to using aerosol dry shampoo</li>

<li> wow.</li>
<li> I am very used to using aerosol dry shampoo</li>
<li> Was a complete waste of money</li>

<li> This dry shampoo did nothing for my oily hair, i still had shine after using it.</li>
<li> I use to like Batista and Sebastian dry shampoos</li>
<li> I have oily hair, and this dry shampoo did nothing for me.</li>
<li> The spray nozzle just stopped working randomly one day, so I have a full bottle that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s basically like any other dry shampoo.</li>
<li> Not very convenient.</li>
<li> Now the second one is also giving me trouble.</li>
<li> AND MINE WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY</li>
<li> I switched from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply type that had dark powder</li>
<li> I had to hold down for awhile before anything came out.</li>
<li> And it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
<li> I did notice it was stronger than the dry shampoos I have used in the past</li>
<li> agree that the scent is too strong. :(</li>
<li> Also it&#x27;s not a very good dry shampoo.</li>
<li> I bought this at Sallys Beauty and going to return it what a waste not worth the price</li>

    <li> This dry shampoo did nothing for my oily hair, i still had shine after using it. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Works good but after each use the spray nozzle freezes up and you have to soak it in water. Not very convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought this dry shampoo after I read several good reviews and, generally, I really liked the product. The smell is nice and fades slightly after dry-down, the results are great, and while you can sometimes see the shampoo if you spray it too closely to your hair, I found it to be mostly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle and spray nozzle are so terrible that I will no longer buy this product.

    <li> doesn&#x27;t work the way it is advertised and smells awful!</li>
    <li> The product on its own works amazingly but there&#x27;s a huge problem with the nozzle. It got clogged up for me after 2 uses and since then, it&#x27;s just not working. Was a complete waste of money and I see that there are many people facing this problem. If your spray works, you&#x27;ve got a really good dry shampoo. Buy it only if you&#x27;re OK with the possibility of getting a dysfunctional one.</li>
    <li> I liked it until it stopped coming out of the bottle after the third use. Now I have a bottle of product that can&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> Smell is too much like perfume, would prefer clean smell. Spray heavy than I would prefer.</li>
    <li> The product is ok but still leaves my hair a bit oily. I had to return the first one because the nozzle was stuck and wasn&#x27;t letting anything come out. Now the second one is also giving me trouble. I definitely would not recommend anyone get this product</li>
    <li> Only used it once and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore,  the product its still in the bottle and i cant even return it. Smell great but it was defective.</li>
    <li> There is more air than there is product. I had to hold down for awhile before anything came out. It leaves your hair looking like there is dandruff in it. I might as well put baby powder in my hair. It&#x27;s a horrible product and it doesn&#x27;t smell well. I just washed my hair lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically like any other dry shampoo. I switched from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply type that had dark powder so it didn&#x27;t show up in my hair. I&#x27;ll probably go back because of the white residue it leaves, but I love the way it smells!!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Cheap!</li>
    <li> Used it once and it was clogged. I tried soaking the top using a toothpick, I tried everything. A WASTE OF MONEY. Had a nice scent to it, but didn&#x27;t take out all the grease in my hair like other products do.</li>
    <li> I never got a chance to really use it because the spray cap didn&#x27;t work after the first use!</li>
    <li> Love this product! No white residue!</li>
    <li> Smells is not great made my hair worst than when I started left it more oily and dull. I bought this at Sallys Beauty and going to return it what a waste not worth the price</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, and would give it 5 starts, but I agree with everyone else. The spray nozzle just stopped working randomly one day, so I have a full bottle that I can&#x27;t use. They really need to figure this out, until then do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Nothing special about it ive tryed every dry shampoo there is and this isnt anything i would recommend. AND MINE WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY WHEN I GOT IT</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have dark hair and work out and love this shampoo to buy me another day before having to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> The smell reminded me of a pet store, I was distracted by the smell all day! Also it&#x27;s not a very good dry shampoo. I have oily hair, and this dry shampoo did nothing for me. It weighed my hair down, making it look even flatter than usual. Skip on this product and use Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray  - far superior product!</li>
    <li> agree that the scent is too strong. :(</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I did not have high expectations for this, since it was a &amp;#34;Kardashian&amp;#34; product but I gave it a try from a friend&#x27;s referral. wow. This was great. I disagree with others who said the scent was overpowering, maybe they were using A LOT? I did notice it was stronger than the dry shampoos I have used in the past but it was filmy or sticky. And it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. I was pleasantly surprised it was Kardashian Beauty. I would recommend.  Update! I&#x27;ve purchased like 3-4 cans of this stuff. Still the most amazing dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used... EXCEPT that the spray top stops working and I&#x27;m constantly forced to unclog it. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo I own. I use to like Batista and Sebastian dry shampoos but they were too stenchy and lots of residue left over. However, this one smells great and it is super light. I used it three days in a row and my hair looks better than the day before. I can describe the smell to be a roses kind of smell. Everyone compliments the aroma. I love the look of the bottle looks great on my black vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one reason i couldn&#x27;t rate this a 5 star product is that it is a bit pricey for the amount that is in the bottle. Other than that i absolutely love it.</li>
