### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best cleanser for acne break outs.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>So happy that this has worked for her !!</li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>Great product for blemished skin.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>This becomes a relaxing, welcome change.  </li>
      <li>I bought this cause of the good reviews</li>
      <li>but if you use a really good moisturizer there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem</li>
      <li>I have also found that this does a good job of taking off my makeup as well</li>
      <li>pHisoderm has always been a great product and continues to be one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love phisoderm!</li>
      <li>However, it is definitely a nice face wash.</li>
      <li>but it feels nice</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that I have seen a pretty good change in my skin.</li>
      <li>Love this face wash.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>but I i have noticed a change for the better.   </li>
      <li>I love the way this wash feels on my face.</li>
      <li>And man, I am SO glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for my husband&#x27;s tougher skin, but Aveeno Clear Complexion is kinder to the skin and works just as well.</li>
      <li>I found it too strong as it made my skin sting.</li>
      <li>Great general cleaning for all skin</li>
      <li>and I have seen a tremendous difference in her skin!  </li>
      <li>I did my homework and searched for a great facial wash.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for making this product available.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great.  </li>
      <li>It is particularly good when my skin feels sensitive.  </li>
      <li>The first Anti-Gel Facial wash I bought was very good</li>
      <li>This leaves my face feeling clean without over drying or causing breakouts.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a good product, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I have always loved Phisoderm, and this facial wash is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I think this product MAY work well for mild acne..</li>
      <li>I have tried Proactiv, been prescribed oral and topical medications, and done just about every other great, new clear-your-skin-instantly fad on the market, and still couldn&#x27;t balance my skin and get it to that happy place.    </li>
      <li>The product does dry my skin a fair amount</li>
      <li>On a positive note, if you have moderate acne try a really good Zinc supplement (specifically chelated zinc or OptiZinc).</li>
      <li>Amazing is the word for it&#x27;s healing ability and for preventing future blemish outbreaks.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own wash your face with body bar soap 2 or 3 times to get it clean and dry and then wash with pHisoderm.  </li>
      <li>And he is not a big wash his face and/or moisturize kind of guy.  </li>
      <li>I remember using Phisoderm when I was young, and was pleased that it is still around.  </li>
      <li>you are looking for something that is not expensive and you are dealing with a skin problem that is not really bad, then I would recommend this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked for something for acne for the past 3 years and so far this is the best over the counter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s half the price of Phisohex, and conveniently available as OTC, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something the more popular blemish facial washes offer without the price then this is definitely the way to go.</li>
      <li>Very decent price too!</li>
      <li>This product made my skin feel clean, however I noticed after a week or more I had pimples appearing in places where my skin normally never broke out...</li>
      <li>my favorite facial wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it cleared my skin up so much that people always asked if I had on makeup!</li>
      <li>A much better product for oily skin that I can buy in my local stores.</li>
      <li>I have started to use it on my body instead of face to clear up some mild acne there.</li>
      <li>Luckily my sister had a prescription lotion that helped clear it up.</li>
      <li>Most acne fighting washes dry my face and leave me with scaly patches.</li>
      <li>Seems to work pretty decently, I am seeing results within a week.</li>
      <li>really like this face wash.  </li>
      <li>works fast, cleans up blemishs</li>
      <li>It cleans well and is gentle, but thorough.  </li>
      <li>My face was clear in the first week.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it now for about a month and a half and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels clean, fresh, and supple without being dried out.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use it as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; wash to get makeup off until I at least use the product up, because it&#x27;s not causing break outs, just not as effective.</li>
      <li>but I normally use a moisturizer and have no problems with severe drying.       </li>
      <li>This product has done amazingly at controlling his breakouts without excessive drying!</li>
      <li>Keeps face clean but not tight and dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had pimples and acne for a while and nothing ever seems to work...not proactive, or most other store bought facial cleansers.   </li>
      <li>Taking this supplement daily with food, you will see results fast!</li>
      <li>I had never had skin that easily broke out before, like I said, and I&#x27;m just looking for a face wash that will keep the little pimples away.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter because she has VERY sensitive skin, so sensitive that she can not use any OTC acne creams</li>
      <li>so I later purchase more, but received different product with the same name and from the same seller.</li>
      <li>When I wash my face with the body wash, it clears up, marked improvement.</li>
      <li>then but this stuff completely made me break out all around my mouth.</li>
      <li>Being 12 years old, your acne can start to get out of control.</li>
      <li>This product leaves your skin very clean, but is not too hard on skin.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a high end acne cure, but it is what I term: &#x27;middle of the road.</li>
      <li>But then a couple days later my face broke out on the right side with larger red bumps.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t over strip skin or dry out to much.</li>
      <li>but for individuals with cystic or moderate acne I would recommend they purchase something natural based, perhaps from a health foods store or Vitamin Shoppe type.</li>
      <li>I got about 20 little bumps on the right side of my mouth and chin after using this stuff for 4 days.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive dry skin, and alot of products are overly drying.  </li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t wear a whole heck of a lot, just a little eye shadow and mascara).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff sucks. I have skin that generally does not break out, maybe a little pimple on my nose every now and then but this stuff completely made me break out all around my mouth. I got about 20 little bumps on the right side of my mouth and chin after using this stuff for 4 days. I immediately stopped using it. Luckily my sister had a prescription lotion that helped clear it up. But then a couple days later my face broke out on the right side with larger red bumps. Now after almost two weeks it&#x27;s almost all gone because I used my sister&#x27;s ointment, but I was extremely disappointed. I had never had skin that easily broke out before, like I said, and I&#x27;m just looking for a face wash that will keep the little pimples away. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> I have always loved Phisoderm, and this facial wash is no exception.  It works well, and does not leave your face too dry.</li>
    <li> pHisoderm has always been a great product and continues to be one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve used. This is coming from someone who was a Proactiv die hard and have used everything from Murad to Patricia Wexler. If you&#x27;re looking for something the more popular blemish facial washes offer without the price then this is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, 10-Ounce and this did not win out. My face still breaks out if I use this stand-alone. When I wash my face with the body wash, it clears up, marked improvement. I will continue to use it as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; wash to get makeup off until I at least use the product up, because it&#x27;s not causing break outs, just not as effective.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin very clean, but is not too hard on skin.  The only thing I do not like about it is the smell, it is horrible.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a few weeks but it didn&#x27;t seem to help my acne as much as Benzoyl Peroxide products do. However, it is definitely a nice face wash. It is foamy, smells like expensive hotel soap, and washes off clean. Just be very careful not to get any in your mouth because it tastes absolutely horrible! I have started to use it on my body instead of face to clear up some mild acne there. There is actually a body wash version of this product for that purpose. Overall, it is a good product, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now and I can honestly say that I have seen a pretty good change in my skin. I&#x27;ve had pimples and acne for a while and nothing ever seems to work...not proactive, or most other store bought facial cleansers.   pHisoderm has evened out my skin and definitely reduced the severity and amount of pimples i have. It HAS NOT entirely cleared up my skin, and i still get stubborn breakouts from time to time but I i have noticed a change for the better.   The product does dry my skin a fair amount but I normally use a moisturizer and have no problems with severe drying.       Overall, this is defnitely a miracle face wash...unfortunately, but it has helped me and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my skin for as long as I can remember.  Not like I was plagued with big, huge, volcano-like craters on my face, but I would get nailed with a handful of ugly blemishes every month for as long as I can remember.  I have tried Proactiv, been prescribed oral and topical medications, and done just about every other great, new clear-your-skin-instantly fad on the market, and still couldn&#x27;t balance my skin and get it to that happy place.    However, after doing a bit of research and reading the reviews on this here pHisoderm, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  And man, I am SO glad that I did.  I have been using it now for about a month and a half and absolutely love it.  My skin feels clean, fresh, and supple without being dried out.  I still have a blemish every now and again, but when they rear their ugly head, they are far more manageable and go away a lot quicker, so long as I don&#x27;t mess with them.  I have also found that this does a good job of taking off my makeup as well (don&#x27;t wear a whole heck of a lot, just a little eye shadow and mascara).  And my manfriend loves pHisoderm, too.  And he is not a big wash his face and/or moisturize kind of guy.  I would totally recommend this face wash to someone who has combination type skin and is prone to breakouts every now and again and is looking for a product that will balance out their skin without drying it out.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. Seems to work pretty decently, I am seeing results within a week. Blemishes are slowly being removed.</li>
    <li> I did my homework and searched for a great facial wash.  The pHisoderm works well and is non greasy.  I can recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> This works well on my son&#x27;s acne as long as he uses it daily. It isn&#x27;t a high end acne cure, but it is what I term: &#x27;middle of the road.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that is not expensive and you are dealing with a skin problem that is not really bad, then I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great general cleaning for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this face wash.  It cleans well and is gentle, but thorough.  It is particularly good when my skin feels sensitive.  This has become one of the cleansers that is rotated in with scrubs, and other exfoliators.  This becomes a relaxing, welcome change.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, subtle, and ready for a regular daily regimen or an age-battling micro needle session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My single only complaint is that after two bottles, they have both had pump failure and I had to transfer to product to another container.</li>
    <li> A much better product for oily skin that I can buy in my local stores.</li>
    <li> My acne gets worse every day, after using this product. My skin oily, and blemishes, acne, dark spots starts appearing on my face after I used this product. The first Anti-Gel Facial wash I bought was very good so I later purchase more, but received different product with the same name and from the same seller.</li>
    <li> This is a go to product for me. it doesn&#x27;t over strip skin or dry out to much. definitely seems to balance.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Use as part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause of the good reviews but I don&#x27;t like it because it leaves my skin feeling tacky. I see no difference in my acne.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wash a month ago since the prescription \\&quot;Phisohex\\&quot; was discontinued and pHisoderm is the recommended OTC replacement. I like the idea of keeping pH balance, although it&#x27;s not as speedy as Phisohex in healing acne, so I had to use another spot treatment in conjunction with this wash. After 3 weeks, my acne&#x27;s gone and my face has been doing well since then. It&#x27;s half the price of Phisohex, and conveniently available as OTC, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love phisoderm! I&#x27;ve used it before and it cleared my skin up so much that people always asked if I had on makeup! would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Being 12 years old, your acne can start to get out of control. Bought this for my daughter because she has VERY sensitive skin, so sensitive that she can not use any OTC acne creams/gels due to her having a severe reaction with swelling and itching. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been using this and I have seen a tremendous difference in her skin!  So happy that this has worked for her !! :)  Thank you for making this product available.</li>
    <li> I think this product MAY work well for mild acne..but for individuals with cystic or moderate acne I would recommend they purchase something natural based, perhaps from a health foods store or Vitamin Shoppe type. This product made my skin feel clean, however I noticed after a week or more I had pimples appearing in places where my skin normally never broke out... the acne that I already had seemed unphased by the ingredients in this product. On a positive note, if you have moderate acne try a really good Zinc supplement (specifically chelated zinc or OptiZinc). Taking this supplement daily with food, you will see results fast!</li>
    <li> This product uses the same active ingredient as other blemish products, but in a much stronger dosage. I found it too strong as it made my skin sting. It&#x27;s great for my husband&#x27;s tougher skin, but Aveeno Clear Complexion is kinder to the skin and works just as well.</li>
    <li> my favorite facial wash. it does dry the skin out but if you use a really good moisturizer there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long but it feels nice and I feel like my acne is less painful and swollen after using it.</li>
    <li> My 18 yoa Son has just started struggling with acne.  He has sensitive dry skin, and alot of products are overly drying.  I remember using Phisoderm when I was young, and was pleased that it is still around.  This product has done amazingly at controlling his breakouts without excessive drying!</li>
    <li> Delivery as promised,excellent product</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve looked for something for acne for the past 3 years and so far this is the best over the counter. It didn&#x27;t take long to work either. My face was clear in the first week.  Very decent price too!</li>
    <li> I love the way this wash feels on my face. I have acne prone, oily skin. Most acne fighting washes dry my face and leave me with scaly patches. This leaves my face feeling clean without over drying or causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great.  Keeps face clean but not tight and dry.  I know my face has no residual make up after using it.  definitely a terrific facial wash</li>
    <li> Great product for blemished skin.  If it doesn&#x27;t work on it&#x27;s own wash your face with body bar soap 2 or 3 times to get it clean and dry and then wash with pHisoderm.  It totally works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> works fast, cleans up blemishs</li>
    <li> If you have blemishes, this product is a life saver.... Amazing is the word for it&#x27;s healing ability and for preventing future blemish outbreaks.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it. Best cleanser for acne break outs.</li>
</ol>
