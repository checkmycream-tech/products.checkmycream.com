      <li>Well, when the arrived I was surprised to find that they were more like powders than salts, but both my son and I have enjoyed them greatly.  </li>
      <li>I was a tad skittish with the first bath, looked like I was taking a bath in Gatorade</li>
      <li>I enjoy adding these to my bath but wish they had more scent or bubbliness.  </li>
      <li>They smell really good and very relaxing.  </li>
      <li>which makes it kind of fun.</li>
      <li>(it could be quite strong if you dont like the smell)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mostly, they add beautiful color to the water, so I have been using in conjunction with other products.</li>
      <li>it and enjoy it.</li>
      <li>It also made my skin feel really smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I always knew that Japan has really good hot springs that supposedly could do all sorts of cool things such as good for skin, and healing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That was very useful info, and accurate.  </li>
      <li>fun to have this variety pack of scents and colors!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on buying more in the near future and think this is a great quality product.</li>
      <li>The colors of these are so deep, its surprising that they rinse away leaving no tub stains.</li>
      <li>something my son thought was cool).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this as a present to my husband who is Japanese and he is really happy with me for getting him a special present and happy with the bath salts.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these, they are visually inviting as well as great for your skin.</li>
      <li>I enjoy these on special occasions or when I am stressed and find them very comforting.</li>
      <li>Generally, the scents are refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I like this product because it makes you feel like you are in a hot spring.</li>
      <li>I like it, of course not the same experience like the hot spring in Japan but good enough.</li>
      <li>Yes I would recommend this to anyone who wants to soak in a hot tub of water and relax.</li>
      <li>The color is very vibrant.</li>
      <li>I found that the fragrances reminded me too much of laundry detergent.</li>
      <li>They also seem to be very beneficial to the skin.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using this over the weekend to wind down or de-stress from my very hectic work.</li>
      <li>My son wanted some type of bath salts and,after doing some research, I went on ahead and decided to buy the Tabino Yado Hot Springs Clear Bath Salts.  </li>
      <li>So these packets are less wasteful and better value.  </li>
      <li>At first I was worry that it would be hard to clean up after bathroom</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of bath salts, and decided to try this one after reading the largely favorable reviews.  </li>
      <li>But they each came with a different scent which could fill up the whole bathroom.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I really like the bath salts (powders) and would probably keep buying them for future use.</li>
      <li>Then I finally decided on the assortment wanting to see if I can find one that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Despite my rather sensitive skin, these salts do not cause rashes or breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Overall, you want to smell like fresh linen and won&#x27;t be deterred by yellow water, I would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>These are great for relaxing in a hot bath on a very cold (snowy, winter) day.</li>
      <li>Refreshing, although it kind of feels artificial because of the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;Calms you down, you feel stress-free after usage.</li>
      <li>However, I am careful to wait until the tub is full before getting in to ensure that the salts are properly diluted and mixed in my bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer this product because the bath salts come in small individual packets, and one packet is sufficient for a full tub.  </li>
