<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great hair dryer and the as ones used in the salon I go to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful, not too loud, and not as heavy as people seem to say in other reviews.  Very efficient and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Although Ferrari is a car&#x27;s brand it&#x27;s been known for some decades specially because of the design it&#x27;s cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s said to have a professional quality and it DOES. The item works amazingly well and looks very beautiful so as you&#x27;ll when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hook on its base makes it easy to keep the cable together after the use. The unit is very compact and travel is quite easy as well.</li>
    <li> Get you one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for over half a year already and it still impresses my clients and even stylists to know that I, a barber, own such a badass blow dryer. Quality for my clients. Set a standard for yourself, not a price tag. You&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@hailwormatron</li>
    <li> if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment \\&quot;Wow - This dryer is really quiet!\\&quot;  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this dryer an  A+++++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lighter than some reviewers have said, and I&#x27;m comparing it to a similar &amp;#34;professional grade&amp;#34; blow dryer of similar wattage.  I have fairly long and extremely curly hair, so I needed something that would get me through a blow dry without taking most of my morning, creating frizz and making my arms tired.  This one is compact and strong, and is light enough to get the job done.  I also love that I can now tell people I own a Ferrari.  Well, it&#x27;s a blow dryer, but still . . . it&#x27;s a Ferarri.  I think you&#x27;ll be happy with it if you pick one up.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, and no complaints.  My previous expensive one lasted 5+ years so I hope this one has the same life span.</li>
    <li> I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the \\&quot;Ferrari engine\\&quot; printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It&#x27;s powerful but gentle, I don&#x27;t smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it&#x27;s a little heavy, heavier than I&#x27;m used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don&#x27;t care - I love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I&#x27;ve tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I&#x27;ve looked at, this is the strongest \\&quot;travel-size\\&quot; hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn&#x27;t have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a blow dryer this expensive, but my hair dresser recommended the brand and I have a lot of hair. This was worth every penny. It has cut down how long it takes to dry my hair and leaves my hair much, much smoother. My only mistake was not buying sooner.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer lived up to all reviews and expectations! It was completely worth the money to me. I recommend to everyone. It is a game changer for my hair. Cuts my drying time in half, if not more, for my very long hair. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny and I can quickly and easily give myself a salon style blowout with volume every time with this. LOVE IT! (my hair type fine, dry and frizzy regularly and a lot of it. color treated, blonde, mid back length) dry time approx. 5-7 min including smoothing with round bush now</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is too high powered for thin curly hair! The low setting is not low enough and it makes my hair separate and become frizzy.  It come out beautifully if you straighten it but I did not purchase it for hair straightening.  I am trying different amounts of hair product to make each curl more defined but it is difficult to have a good hair day with many of the new dryers today.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I still think my sedu was better but this is the next best thing. Beautiful color and compact. Not as heavy as the compact sedu that&#x27;s tge same size but works well. Id say it was worth the price. Also it&#x27;s non damaging and if your hair is wavy, or you have very loose big curls? You really don&#x27;t need to flat iron</li>
    <li> Love it! Dries my hair quickly. Has lots of settings. The cord doesn&#x27;t is long and doesn&#x27;t tangle. Easy to clean the back screen. And I Love the cold shot button. Yeah and I love that it&#x27;s Red...Pretty:) AWESOME Dryer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer! Not only did this seller offer it for a great price, but when I had an issue they resolved it ASAP and with such kindness and grace, I appreciate people continuing to run their business and actually care about customer service. I would recommend this product and this seller to anyone!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000IG83VE Babyliss Pro BABFRV2 Volare Ferrari Designed Professional Luxury Mid Sized Hair Dryer, Red, 2000 Watts]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is the best but the 2 nozzle did not come in my package... this has me worry that the product may not be new.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer!!! I have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers I have used in the past. I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; can&#x27;t touch this!!!</li>
    <li> After searching through many reviews, I chose this hairdryer.  I didn&#x27;t expect to see a difference...but I did!  Hair dries so much faster and my hair is definitely smoother.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Wife thinks this thing is the best dryer she&#x27;s ever had!  Claims it drys her hair quickly without leaving all the static. I wouldn&#x27;t know since I&#x27;m bald but I&#x27;m glad I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I love it, it dries my hair in half the time and leaves it so smooth. It is definetely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter, who is a professional hair dresser, let me use her Ferrari dryer. Love it! As soon as I got home, I went to Amazon and bought my own! Love it and the color is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Dries hair FAST but my &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; button broke after about a month. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;...more than you can afford pal.&amp;#34; is not a phrase you should apply here. It&#x27;s quieter, blows harder, has ionizer or maybe a deionizer, it&#x27;s red, has an awesome cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention its very quiet? Has more of a whooooooooosh shound than typical shrill hair dryer, &amp;#34;Wheeeeeeee-zzzzzzzzzzzz-eeeeee-zzzzzz-eeee-hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ddrrrrrrrrrrrrr-wheeeeeeeeesh&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Changed my drying time.  Great product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s powerful and it drys by hair super fast.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy and pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.  I love the red color too.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dyer.  Light weight, dries my hair in half the time than other brands I had used, and leaves locks smoother and shinier as well.  It&#x27;s dog-approved quiet, too.  Good purchase and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This thing packs some serious punch.  Takes me less than 5 minutes to dry my whole head (I have baby fine hair).  Sounds and feels like a very high quality product.</li>
    <li> Love  the fact that this dryer is a little lighter in weight than the original one that I also have.  It does not seem to have the same drying power as the original.. I keep this one in my travel bag for that reason..It is easy on the hair and does not seem to frizz out the hair as some brands seem to do all the time..</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. I have two... One ant home and one at the lake place!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I feel I must share with everyone the great purchase I made. This blow dryer is excellent! It exceeded my expectations. It is pricey, but you won&#x27;t regret it after you use it the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hot! I dried my hair using only the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting , and did it in less time also. It leaves your hair straight and shiny, and best of all, it feels light in your hand. When you hold it you know you are holding a good piece right away. I am not a hairstylist but I always buy very good blow dryers and I can tell you that this one is top of the line. Better than the Parlux 385 which has more wattage but heats less and which also costs more. Go for it!!</li>
    <li> 1) I can now say I own the worlds smallest Ferrari!&lt;br /&gt;2) This hair dryer lives up to the hype!!&lt;br /&gt;Not going to lie, I was skeptical at first.  I hadn&#x27;t purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn&#x27;t get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don&#x27;t even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it&#x27;s no louder than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used.  If anything I think it&#x27;s slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this product and am very happy with it.  It is so powerful that even with my very think hair, it is dry within minutes.  By far the best product I own for drying my hair.</li>
    <li> as a guy, i did buy this for my wife and she loves it. so she tells me! haha. i researched online and also went to a few local salons and asked for some suggestions. and it seems to me it all is based on what you can afford and if what you payed for lasts or not! and thats a constant battle for my wife as i start to notice. haha. but i ended finalizing on the BABYLISS V2... its feels pretty small and light, and according to my wife, works very well! so i say THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR WHAT ITS WORTH!&lt;br /&gt; it was a gift for my wife and i am a man that likes quality items. and willing to pay a little more for the quality. and I AM SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast!! and has multiple speeds. The dryer is not that heavy and I love the 4 year warranty!</li>
    <li> A long time Elchim user here- didn&#x27;t think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can&#x27;t really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!</li>
    <li> BEST hair dryer I ever had.  Totally recommend and worth the expense.  Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and leaves it silky soft.  Get it!</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer in mid of May 2014 and it stopped working in mid of October 2014! Would never buy it again!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had one and it dried my hair so quickly I had to get one.  So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I just received the hair dryer and have only used it twice so far.  It absolutely does what it says in that it has a super motor that dries your hair quickly.  I can&#x27;t give the 5th star because of the weight.  It is heavy when you are holding it over your head.  I&#x27;m still deciding if the shorter dry time is worth the weight.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer cut my drying time IN HALF!  There is some serious power coming out of this machine, and I consider it worth every penny for all the time I&#x27;m saving drying my thick, long hair.</li>
