<li> and then you&#x27;d want to go with something a little more slick and wet looking, but man, I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it&#x27;s the only &#x27;thickening agent&#x27; I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dry my hair.  </li>
<li> No exactly the same as the one I bought in stockholm</li>
<li> only tip would be to use a lot less than you think you need.</li>
<li> I apply just a little bit on end of my hair, make them bigger</li>
<li> A word to the wise...if you have a little left on your hands, don&#x27;t wipe it on your towel as it&#x27;ll discolor it, wipe your hands on a tissue</li>
<li> look at the weight carefully before ordering.  </li>
<li> A little goes a really long way.</li>
<li> She likes that you only need a small pea sized amount to give the all day holding power</li>
<li> A little of the pomade goes a long way!</li>
<li> One tube of this product usually lasts me 6 months, and that with daily styling.</li>
<li> Expected my expectations!</li>
<li> the size of the small hand sized one that I had.--so</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me no matter how small of an amount I used.</li>
<li> If you have thick corse hail</li>
<li> If they ever discontinue it, me and my hair will be limp with disappointment.</li>

    <li> I use it for many years. Gives my hair a nice look, provides medium hold which I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  it&#x27;s the only &#x27;thickening agent&#x27; I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dry my hair.  it is a little tricky to use, a little goes a long way, but it is worth getting to know the best way to use it for your own hair. A word to the wise...if you have a little left on your hands, don&#x27;t wipe it on your towel as it&#x27;ll discolor it, wipe your hands on a tissue</li>
    <li> I go to a higher end stylist ($55 for a guys cut) who happens to be co-owner.  It what he uses, recomends to me and sells in his salon.  It woks great and I like the smell.</li>
    <li> It is a great molding paste, it helps to control wayward areas without looking greasy as well as create volume in a style.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this molding paste for styling my short hair in to small pieces and making the style more definitive instead of looking like a blob which is what most short hair looks like.  My hair dresser turned me on to this brand because all the products out there can&#x27;t stand up to humidity.  Even if you just want a bit more definition to your hair in certain spots this is the product for you.  It won&#x27;t stay all day however.  I recommend hair spray on top of the molding paste after you get your hair just the way you want it.</li>
    <li> No exactly the same as the one I bought in stockholm</li>
    <li> My wife uses this cream every morning after her shower.  She likes that you only need a small pea sized amount to give the all day holding power</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it everyday after a recommendation from my Barber. The hold and shine are perfect. No wet mop hair look. And the paste contains keratin.</li>
    <li> Sticky and gooey.  Didn&#x27;t work well for me no matter how small of an amount I used.</li>
    <li> I apply just a little bit on end of my hair, make them bigger and it creates a nice shape - fast and nice!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help give my hair some volume.  It works okay, however I found that it makes my hair very greasy.  I have very fine hair and would not recommend to others with fine hair.</li>
    <li> Product is best hair paste I have used.  Caution- I thought I was ordering a smaller bottle and ordered two... Didnt need two-its three time the size of the small hand sized one that I had.--so look at the weight carefully before ordering.  Shipper was wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product. It holds hair without the greasy look or feel. Throughout the day this product allows for multiple restyling without flaking, which is something that cannot be said for lesser pomades or gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell may turn some people off when they squeeze it into their hands, but once rubbed and applied, the smell dissipates. One tube of this product usually lasts me 6 months, and that with daily styling. A little of the pomade goes a long way! Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Descriptions good. Arrived in time</li>
    <li> Is a bit expensive but very good does not leave the hair greasy and lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From time to time the price drops</li>
    <li> The best one out there, gives a great dry look if you use a little and a thicker look if you use a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold too well in wet/ moist conditions though.</li>
    <li> great product and it arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> This product has great hold and is good for those with fine hair.  You will need a spray shine to overcome the matte finish.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of molding paste for a couple of years now and really like it.  It does a great job of holding my short hair style in place.  I appreciate that it does not have much of a fragrance since I have allergies to many beauty products.

I was glad to find it on Amazon because it is cheaper than getting it from my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite products.  I have naturally wavy, curly hair which is also fine.  This stuff gives me all-day volume without the crunch.  I gets lots of compliments on my hair, and I always credit L&#x27;anza.  If they ever discontinue it, me and my hair will be limp with disappointment.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair product!</li>
    <li> Expected my expectations! Perfect product and perfect delivery time</li>
    <li> This is the best product if you are thinning and want to make you look full.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best style molding paste ever!!! I have very fine/thin hair and my hairdresser used this on my hair, so naturally, I had to order some. No regrets spending the extra money because I can even make my own hair look great with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best hairgel/paste whatever you want to call it. Definitely worth the money. Both my husband and I use it.</li>
    <li> If you have thick corse hail this product will do it for you. Whips your hair into a sleek do.</li>
    <li> I use this on and of for six years. It&#x27;s a fantastic product and I order a lot of it in case it ever gets discontinued. One time I did my hair with it during a music festival and it held it&#x27;s form for two full days, with no gunk or build-up. It&#x27;s like a tube of magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it works best on short to moderate hair lengths and then you&#x27;d want to go with something a little more slick and wet looking, but man, I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only tip would be to use a lot less than you think you need. A little goes a really long way.</li>
    <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t make your hair so damn greasy. Easily washes out and holds my hair for hours. Would highly recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Jesus would use this....I think.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my fine hair</li>
    <li> There is nothin like it, by far the best product to style ur hair. Fast delivery, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
