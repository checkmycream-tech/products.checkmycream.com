      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in a warm place as it will melt.</li>
      <li>excellent value from amazon, this brand tends to be more natural</li>
      <li>so you have to rub it on warm skin and then its easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love cocoa butter..</li>
      <li>Love this one.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>The more I used it, the softer it felt.</li>
      <li>love that.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more of these.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this cocoa butter stick.</li>
      <li>I LOVE QUEEN HELEN Cocoa butter sticks.</li>
      <li>and I love that its 100% cocoa butter (1 ingredient).</li>
      <li>it was okay</li>
      <li>This cocoa butter is okay</li>
      <li>Love this product for many reasons.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it seems like its pretty amazing!</li>
      <li>considering how much weight she was carrying and how much she gained this was extremely impressive.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent and not too grease like most lotions would likely do that at first use.  </li>
      <li>This cocoa butter stick is really easy to use.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re applying it to first with warm water then applying while your skin is moist.</li>
      <li>I love cocoa butter and the stick format in theory should be convenient for quick and easy application.</li>
      <li>The tubing is a little flimsy, but this is a flaw in manufacturing, as it would be best in a roll up tube and sealed.</li>
      <li>Also good as a general skin moisturizer and for preventing and clearing up stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it anywhere hot</li>
      <li>this stuff makes your skin feel amazing and has helped significantly with minimizing the size and texture of my post baby stretch marks,many have disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>i ordered this because it is one of my all time favorite skin products and was much cheaper here then in store.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>It really works to keep your skin smooth!</li>
      <li>Wife bought this to use on her pregnant belly and swears by this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>When I was pregnant I used this every night on my stomach and it resulted in zero stretch marks for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried other sticks and this by far is the best one.</li>
      <li>I miss real pure cocoa butter</li>
      <li>I did not like the cocoa butter at first!</li>
      <li>2) it fades my new facial scars and discolorations very effectively.</li>
      <li>I guess I expected this would be a tighter fit in the sleeve and that the product would be more secure in the packaging.</li>
      <li>This is the only cocoa butter product that I have been able to locate which is 100% free of absolutely any other additives.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great healing tool for skin.</li>
      <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work you can quickly run a hair dryer over it or dab it with hot water on your fingers.</li>
      <li>the stick will fall right out.</li>
      <li>Wish I had this when I was pregnant, seems to really moisturize</li>
      <li>But, I am still using my first one.</li>
      <li>After the first day of use it was a drastic difference.</li>
      <li>he next time, I&#x27;ll get something better.</li>
      <li>I would love to see a similar product with olive oil.</li>
      <li>(assuming, one cleans the targeted areas first.)</li>
      <li>THIS application REALLY HEALS overnight!</li>
      <li>I like to use Avocado butter, moisture lasts for a long time and more creamier.</li>
      <li>All though I never received package ( due to damage, recieved full refund very quickly)</li>
      <li>It also gets rid of redness on my skin and makes it super soft.</li>
      <li>Love it for chapped lips, dry skin, blemishes, under eyes, and stretch marks.</li>
      <li>BUT THIS WORKS ON MY DRY AND FLAKEY SKIN BETTER THAN THE TWO PRESCRIPTION CREAMS</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s got super sensitive skin, so with this being 100% cocoa butter</li>
      <li>This is pure, but what&#x27;s the point?</li>
      <li>You do have to roll the stick in your hands a little bit to warm it up so that you can apply it, and for the hair I use the product that has &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; onto my hands so as not to put too much in and make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The package isn&#x27;t very convinient.</li>
      <li>High recommend to anyone!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried NOW cocoa butter in a jar for almost 10 dollars and this is so much easier to use.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really push it up out of the tube.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product surprised me with its inadequacy. It is hard as a rock and you cannot apply it without pain. I expected a solid stick of cocoa butter-not a useless unappliable scented rock.</li>
    <li> Very good lip moisturizer and has a great chocolate smell. The package isn&#x27;t very convinient.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my car, and even in very cold temperatures, it goes on easily.  The stick will fall out of the container, so I do need to be careful about that.</li>
    <li> The pure cocoa butter sticks are the only ones my friend can use.  Cannot use the creams and other types because they have added ingredients.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter she loves it!</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butter.. the smell is so inviting. Plus it helps with scars..</li>
    <li> Use it at least twice a day until rash vanished then to only once a day prefer night. It&#x27;s excellent and not too grease like most lotions would likely do that at first use.  Love this one.</li>
    <li> I bought the Queen Helen Cocoa Butter stick and I love it. The smell is not strong, it is so easy to use and carry in my bag. My skin is softer and less flakey.I would love to see a similar product with olive oil.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do its just coco butter</li>
    <li> One of the best lip balms.  Soft Chocolate flavor.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Really poor packaging! You can&#x27;t really push it up out of the tube. Also, it&#x27;s very hard, and it&#x27;s difficult to get product to come off the stick onto where ever you&#x27;re trying to apply it; almost like rubbing a dry bar of soap on your skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it in place of lip balm.</li>
    <li> I rate the product a 5 since it is so awesome!  BUT,  I ordered three and one was obviously melted at one time and ran over the edges and hardened on the outside of tube.  Yuk.  The  inside portion is all deformed and lacking.  Can&#x27;t believe this is how they sent it as very obvious from the outside.  Not worth the hassle to send back.</li>
    <li> This is the only cocoa butter product that I have been able to locate which is 100% free of absolutely any other additives.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great healing tool for skin.</li>
    <li> I have learned to rely on Amazon anytime I want advice or input on a product. While searching for some reviews on what this product can do for blemishes/acne scars, I decided to add my own experience with it. When I was pregnant I used this every night on my stomach and it resulted in zero stretch marks for me. Not one single stretch mark or sign of one on my stomach. I rubbed the stick on my stomach once per day, generously. Spread the word!</li>
    <li> Love this product for many reasons. The main three are: 1) it did not clog my pores. 2) it fades my new facial scars and discolorations very effectively. 3) it has simple, smart, and sanitary application to prevent spreading of germs, etc. (assuming, one cleans the targeted areas first.)</li>
    <li> I ordered these from another company at $.23 a stick but my final order was sent to the wrong company somehow and I was over charged $35 but Amazon fixed it and I got my $ back. As for the product. I LOVE QUEEN HELEN Cocoa butter sticks. Great way to lighten scars and soften skin. All natural, no additives just 100% pure coca butter.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I use this on my lips instead of regular lip balm, they have never been softer or as smooth with ANY other product I have tried. It also helps with cracked knuckles and other dried out areas of skin.</li>
    <li> This was a huge disappointment. I can&#x27;t apply it like a lotion. It&#x27;s hard and crumbles. It does smell good. I miss real pure cocoa butter I used to buy in a jar. This is pure, but what&#x27;s the point? I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love this size!  I carry it in my purse.  Sometimes I forget my chapstick and rub this cocoa butter on my lips.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected this would be a tighter fit in the sleeve and that the product would be more secure in the packaging. The stick was shipped to me in a padded yellow envelope and when it arrived, the cap was off and the product was floating around in the envelope. In the past I have used cocoa butter as a lip balm. I&#x27;m a bit skeeved now because the product arrived open as mentioned. Meh.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it melted or what but the coco butter was crumbled up out of the stick!</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter stick is really easy to use. Just be careful to not tip it or the stick will fall right out. Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Its difficult to find 100% cocoa butter anymore so I was happy to find it online. The smell is so nice and I love that its 100% cocoa butter (1 ingredient). The tubing is a little flimsy, but this is a flaw in manufacturing, as it would be best in a roll up tube and sealed.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene has been the best brand, I&#x27;ve found, for permanent skin improvement and a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved the idea of this, but I guess I fantasized the size and shape of this stick to be like a lipbalm stick.  I use this on my lips, mostly, because it works so well, but the packaging needs some serious renovation.  My packaging has cracked, and I think the way to push the butter stick up is just too clumsy.  I found mine fell out of the tubing too often and eventually just gave up with keeping it inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may have just been my experience, but I find that in cold weather, or an air-conditioned house, the stick becomes so solid that it won&#x27;t rub on very easily.  It works best in warm and humid environments or after about 15 seconds of being pressed against a warm body.  Again, it seems like this could be fixed with a more solid packaging design.</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butter and the stick format in theory should be convenient for quick and easy application. Unfortunately, the packaging of this product is not leak proof, and cocoa butter can melt in high temperatures such as a shipping warehouse. Like others, mine arrived partly melted into the box. I was still able to use some of the product and this brand of cocoa butter is good. It leaves my skin moisturized and smells amazing like chocolate. Frow now on I will be buying my cocoa butter in sealed containers instead.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is okay but, it doesn&#x27;t do well for my skin. he next time, I&#x27;ll get something better.</li>
    <li> I am not reviewing the actual effectiveness of the product because I did not have a chance to use it. It arrived to my home in the box and was leaking and completely melted. I would not order this product again online.</li>
    <li> All though I never received package ( due to damage, recieved full refund very quickly) i ordered this because it is one of my all time favorite skin products and was much cheaper here then in store. this stuff makes your skin feel amazing and has helped significantly with minimizing the size and texture of my post baby stretch marks,many have disappeared completely. High recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is going to sound crazy, but I use this in my little girl&#x27;s hair to moisturize it.  She&#x27;s almost 2 and has dry, red hair that is prone to breakage, so it just wouldn&#x27;t grow.  We started using Queen Helene&#x27;s cocoa butter stick twice a day on her face (she has dry skin as well), and once a day in her hair (before bed) and both her dry skin and hair saw a tremendous improvement, and her hair is even getting longer now that it isn&#x27;t breaking off.  You do have to roll the stick in your hands a little bit to warm it up so that you can apply it, and for the hair I use the product that has &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; onto my hands so as not to put too much in and make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love that it doesn&#x27;t come in a twist-up package, as my little girl loves to steal the whole stick and run around with it, thus melting it a bit in her hands.. but it works so well that I hardly care.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is hard as a rock and difficult to use. The product just falls out of the tube. I would not recommend this for use around eyes in this stick form. Too bad, because their other products are very good.</li>
    <li> It can melted all over the other products I purchased</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, but she never used it. Otherwise it seems like its pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> Did not like the fact that I order 10 of these and they still charged me 1 dollar each for shipping. That suck product works well to be expected.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  Cocoa butter is the one thing I would take with me on a desert island as my beauty and health aid.  It&#x27;s great for moisturizing skin, smoothing over a scar to diminish it;  or keeping lips from chapping.  I use it as a moisturizer under makeup and over an oven burn.  Love love this stuff and the price is great.</li>
    <li> best product out there! It really works to keep your skin smooth!</li>
    <li> excellent value from amazon, this brand tends to be more natural</li>
    <li> LISTEN UP, I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THIS WORKS FOR STRETCH MARKS ON WOMEN WHO JUST HAD BABYS, BUT THIS WORKS ON MY DRY AND FLAKEY SKIN BETTER THAN THE TWO PRESCRIPTION CREAMS MY DOCTOR GAVE ME!! BESIDES COSTING LESS THAN 1/2% OF WHAT THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS COST!!&lt;br /&gt;WONDER STUFF, ORDERING MORE----IT&#x27;S MY NEW AND INEXPENSIVE GET YOUNG SKIN AGAIN CREAM, I&#x27;M 63 Y/O AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN LOOK YOUNG AND FEEL BABY SOFT!! BUY IT!!Queen Helene, 100% Cocoa Butter Stick, 1 oz</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for your skin. Make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in a warm place as it will melt.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cocoa butter stick. When I got home I was thinking it would just help a little on my skin but no. After the first day of use it was a drastic difference. The red blochy patches and dry skin was gone. My skin looks even and glowing. The people talking about it being hard to apply being dried out etc try washing your face or area you&#x27;re applying it to first with warm water then applying while your skin is moist. If that doesn&#x27;t work you can quickly run a hair dryer over it or dab it with hot water on your fingers. I will be purchasing more of these. This product makes me so much less insecure about my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this! I got it at the dollar general for only 1.50 and it was a steal! I wouldn&#x27;t buy it here because its so much more expensive for only 1 oz. I&#x27;ve tried NOW cocoa butter in a jar for almost 10 dollars and this is so much easier to use. It&#x27;s pure cocoa butter which is the kind you need for stretch marks not palmers lotion with random additives. The down side to it being pure is its hard so you have to rub it on warm skin and then its easy to use. Love it for chapped lips, dry skin, blemishes, under eyes, and stretch marks. I just bought it today so don&#x27;t know how it works on fading stretch marks and blemishes yet. The kind in a jar you have to microwave it or use a blow dryer to get any out, which makes it a pain to put on all the time. Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it anywhere hot or it will melt everywhere! Wish I had this when I was pregnant, seems to really moisturize I don&#x27;t think i would of gotten stretchmarks!</li>
    <li> it did not seem this was pure 100% cocoa, it was dry.. it was okay but not great.not really happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands of 100% cocoa butter sticks, that were so hard, you could no slide them across your skin without pulling at your skin.  Not so with this brand.  I used it under my eyes twice a day, and it is working so much better than any eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used at keeping this delicate area moisturized and young looking.  It slides on effortlessly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> the most excellent smelling moisturizer---and it is pure.  love that.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I put it on my eye lids</li>
    <li> Moisture doesn&#x27;t really last. I like to use Avocado butter, moisture lasts for a long time and more creamier.</li>
    <li> I did not like the cocoa butter at first! The more I used it, the softer it felt. My first complaint was that it was not filled up to the top. But, I am still using my first one. It goes on very easy and you may have to wipe some off because it leaves a shine. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> GREAT, on ALL SKIN issues/challenges. When you NEED RELIEF from stinging, burning, bleeding, itchy, dry,INFLAMMED skin, ANY AND ALL symptoms. This will give the skin relief. Applied on hands at night, sleep with plastic gloves(like food handling) type they use at SubWay. Remove in morning, during the night, it will absorb. THIS application REALLY HEALS overnight!</li>
    <li> I have tried other sticks and this by far is the best one. I use it twice a day after washing my face. It works great for clearing up blemishes and acne scars. Does not clog pores. Also good as a general skin moisturizer and for preventing and clearing up stretch marks. Great for chapped lips. I keep two tubes in my home at all times. Smells nice. The tube is convienent</li>
    <li> I use on my skin on scars burns or just because it is good for your skin, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Works great as a moisturizer on my face!!! It also gets rid of redness on my skin and makes it super soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> Only 1 ingredient - COCOA BUTTER! No false or deceptive ingredients like other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen, which contain disgusting things like petroleum in them. This makes my lips feel great. It&#x27;s rather large, so I warmed it up and poored it into my old empty lip balm container. However, it melts on your lips like chocolate, (it&#x27;s cocoa butter after all) so I tend to lick it off and have to reapply regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and smells DELICIOUS! I wonder if it&#x27;s food grade Cocoa butter?</li>
    <li> Best product ever! But very over priced, the pharmacy near me has the same exact product and its only 1.50</li>
    <li> Pros: I love how this makes my lips feel AND LOOK! and it is small enough to fit in my purse&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell is a bit too strong and the way to get it o go up is weird, I wish the tube were easier to open</li>
    <li> Helps with the dry, cracked skin on my elbows.</li>
    <li> this stuff is ...better than any cocoa stick, I have ever tried...price is great,and I am a smoker,dark circles, all the time...I put this on... 3x a day,and bingo,no dark circles, anymore...amazing...I have tried others,but ...none work, like this product...it smells great...like chocolate...lol...if you need instant moisturizer and dark circle remover...this is the one !!!...try no others...this is it !!!...thank you queen Helene !!!...</li>
    <li> Wife bought this to use on her pregnant belly and swears by this stuff.  She had twins both weighing 6.9lbs and only got one very small stretch mark, but considering how much weight she was carrying and how much she gained this was extremely impressive.  Would recommend this to anyone trying to avoid stretch marks.  She applied it 2-3 times everyday after her belly was showing until after she gave birth.&lt;br /&gt;She also used this other Cocoa butter in addition to this one found here: [[ASIN:B0028WOURW 100% Pure Natural Cocoa Butter Stick 3 oz.]]</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for anything before and I felt as though this needed to happen. Not only did it come late, but it had completely liquefied and leaked all over the box and the other items I had purchased. I was really looking forward to this product and I am very disappointed that this happened.</li>
    <li> Shipping 5 star. Product 1star. I got my shipping today! This is what I got! The item is damaged!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! This smells like heaven and really moisturises dry skin. I get horribly chapped and cracked hands in the fall and winter months. My son also gets very dry skin and he&#x27;s got super sensitive skin, so with this being 100% cocoa butter it doesn&#x27;t cause his skin to turn red or burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle cure. It absorbs quickly so it&#x27;s not super greasy and the smell just is wonderful. Can&#x27;t say enough good things. Stock up!</li>
    <li> Its a good brand, just don&#x27;t buy during summer.</li>
    <li> use this during pregnancy (with 10,000 IU Vitamin E oil) and you will redyce stretch marks!</li>
