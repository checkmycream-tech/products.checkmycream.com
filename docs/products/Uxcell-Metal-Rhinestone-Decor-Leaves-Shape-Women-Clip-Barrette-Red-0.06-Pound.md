    <li> Pretty hair clip. Works just fine.</li>

    <li> This clip is so gorgeous!  The photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  I love it and hope to get more for gifts.  A++++</li>
    <li> Very nice barrett.  Ships from Asia, so be patient.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and 1 broke already. But they ARE very pretty.</li>
    <li> Far more beautiful in person is this barrette. It is a medium sized barrette. It can not hold a lot of hair if you were purchasing this to the nape of your neck to hold back all your hair (it will not work). It is however far more pretty in person and can be used as a decoration. I took off a star because I am not certain how long it will last. it doesn&#x27;t seem badly constructed though. It does appear to be primarily glued though. If it holds up for a long time, then I will edit my review.</li>

    <li> Beautiful and worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> very well made and very pretty. i cannot give it 5 stars. one of the clear crystals was put in and lays on its side. it has a firm and strong clasp. it will hold a good amount of hair. it is heavy. if you have fine thin hair this is probably not the one for you. it falls out of my hair and its thick and coarse</li>
    <li> This is a really versatile hair clip, just the right size for most hairstyles, and it holds, opens and closes really well. It&#x27;s just as beautiful as the picture shows. Looks quite dressy.</li>
