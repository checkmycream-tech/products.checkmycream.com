### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The price point is perfect to!</li>
      <li>and they work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Great for spray tanning and walking through security at the airport.  </li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>I give these out to my clients at my spary tanning business...and they love them!  </li>
      <li>:) Recommend !</li>
      <li>Clients love these!  </li>
      <li>Bought them out of desperation waiting for our own shipment to come in.  </li>
      <li>These will not come off your clients easily!  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a better price and tried these - for the spray tan booth.  </li>
      <li>so my toes are stuck to the top.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, these are great and stay stuck to your feet, but at the same time come off nicely.  </li>
      <li>I can walk around easily with them like this</li>
      <li>They work just fine.  </li>
      <li>Super sticky, like rat traps!</li>
      <li>I will most likely buy more until I find a better buy!</li>
      <li>While they don&#x27;t look great, I&#x27;ve had the same set of feet for over a year</li>
      <li>However, I found that if you apply a light amount of barrier cream to the bottom of the feet they come off without a problem (make sure to really rub it in to the feet though because they won&#x27;t stick if not).</li>
      <li>I was super excited to get these.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like they have used super glue on them.</li>
      <li>They are not difficult for me to remove, as some others mentioned and they keep the bottom of my feet clean</li>
      <li>Like everyone has said before, they are incredibly sticky (on some people) and hard to get off.</li>
      <li>These sticky feet are really sticky, but relatively cheap and do their job.</li>
      <li>For the price, they are worth it, but if you are running a business, this might not be the most professional product.</li>
      <li>I have no trouble peeling the paper off to use them, and the price is way better than my salon charges.  </li>
      <li>I wear a size 9 shoe and these fit with room to spare (about ½ to ¾ of an inch in the front and back when centered on my foot) and were easy to walk in.  </li>
      <li>Stick to the feet so much that clients cannot get them off!  </li>
      <li>(exactly the purpose I wanted).  </li>
      <li>could have ordered with another company to get the exact color I thought</li>
      <li>I have seen a lot of negative reviews, but they work great for what I need them for.  </li>
      <li>but it keeps the clients feet totally tanner free.</li>
      <li>This is really embarrassing having this happen to my clients when I charge them for a spray tan.</li>
      <li>These are very sticky and then.</li>
      <li>Putting lotion on feet helps but it doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>They are very tacky.  </li>
      <li>as long as it sticks enough to your feet to move around the booth a bit and step out, they&#x27;re effective.</li>
      <li>I love getting a spray tan; in fact I have it down to a science</li>
      <li>After several tans, I&#x27;ll pull the backing further off to expose more of the sticky part and step on them (see picture).  </li>
      <li>Love that they are black, as opposed to white.</li>
      <li>so it looks so natural on me.  </li>
      <li>Thet are not black as shown.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a bit hard to pull off, they are great quality, not cheaply made at all!!  </li>
      <li>It NOT worth spending the $40 for a pack of 50 pairs (100 sticky feet total) when you could spend less money for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she was picking black sticky foam off her feet the whole flight!)</li>
      <li>The sticky feet arrived in a white color and not black as shown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I will say that the sticky feet I received are tan and not black as advertised, but I couldn&#x27;t care less about the color, just thought I would share in case</li>
<li> Not worth it total</li>
<li> half naked trying to collect all the pieces from the bottom of my feet</li>
<li> the black photo and show the white</li>
<li> And the paper backing comes off in strips.. Not a clean solid piece, it strips apart as I&#x27;m trying to have my client put them on their feet.</li>
<li> But pink.</li>
<li> These are the absolute worse.  </li>
<li> Be careful with these, they can stick to the bottom of your customers feet too well and do not want to come off!</li>
<li> I was completely wrong, this really sticks to your feet to the point that it almost doesn’t want to come off.  </li>
<li> but I would suggest leaving at least ½ an inch at the back</li>
<li> I start by peeling them down a quarter of the way</li>
<li> I thought I was getting black as the picture and product description said.</li>
<li> These will stick to your feet but they do NOT have black rubber soles.  </li>
<li> Leaving a sticky mess on the bottom of ur feet</li>
<li> They stick to the feet extremely well!!  </li>
<li> They are thin enough that you could trim them</li>
<li> The collection of sticky feet that I received were thin WHITE cardboard cut-outs with glue on the one side.</li>
<li> Biggest problem though is when you try to peel them off, they break off into little bits and small pieces get stuck to your feet.</li>
<li> and once you do they are TOO sticky and hard to remove from your feet.  </li>
<li> Really hard to get them off in one piece.</li>
<li> It is so hard to get the backing off to even use these</li>
<li> Hard to peel backing off.</li>
<li> Hard to remove.</li>
<li> , when you try to peel the sticky foot off, small pieces rip-off and remain stuck to the bottoms of your feet.</li>
<li> They can be a little difficult to get off after the tanning session</li>
<li> That being said I&#x27;m at my tanning salon a lot and was getting tired of buying their overpriced sticky feet...</li>
<li> was buying, not please with this false advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
<li> Not to mention, they left a sticky film all over my clients feet and was very difficult to remove!  </li>
<li> Not happy with these at all....do not recommend these!!</li>
<li> They are so expensive when purchased at the salon.  </li>
<li> They came in this awful off white color.</li>
<li> Difficult to remove.</li>
<li> These stick to your feet so badly that they peek off in pieces.</li>
<li> Disappointed in these.</li>
<li> I hate when sticky feet pull off in pieces; I&#x27;d rather deal with stained feet that have pieces of sticky feet stuck to my feet as I stand there</li>
<li> Terrible.  </li>
<li> These are terrible!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and will be throwing them in the trash!</li>
<li> These are HORRIBLE!</li>
<li> These did the job during my spray tan but were completely horrible to remove!  </li>
<li> These are the worst!!</li>
<li> Horrible to use in a spa setting.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Be careful with these, they can stick to the bottom of your customers feet too well and do not want to come off!</li>
    <li> These are so helpful to have!</li>
    <li> If you fold the backing back a bit but not pull it all the way off to expose the sticky part and step on them as if the entire backing is removed.. they will work just as well.  I start by peeling them down a quarter of the way so my toes are stuck to the top.  I can walk around easily with them like this and they don&#x27;t flop around or anything.  After several tans, I&#x27;ll pull the backing further off to expose more of the sticky part and step on them (see picture).  After I&#x27;m done spraying, I get out, fold the backing back up to restick to the feet, and put them in a bag to bring next time.  While they don&#x27;t look great, I&#x27;ve had the same set of feet for over a year and they work perfectly.  The point is to have a barrier between your feet and the floor.. as long as it sticks enough to your feet to move around the booth a bit and step out, they&#x27;re effective.</li>
    <li> Clients love these!  They are very tacky.  They can be a little difficult to get off after the tanning session but it keeps the clients feet totally tanner free.</li>
    <li> Thet are not black as shown. But pink.</li>
    <li> Way to sticky, they stuck to my clients feet and one client said she had to use actione to get what wouldn&#x27;t come off!</li>
    <li> These are the worst!! Don&#x27;t buy them. The pieces get beyond stuck on your feet and hurt to pull off. Not worth it total rip off!!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get these.  I love getting a spray tan; in fact I have it down to a science so it looks so natural on me.  That being said I&#x27;m at my tanning salon a lot and was getting tired of buying their overpriced sticky feet...They are so expensive when purchased at the salon.  Anyway, these are great and stay stuck to your feet, but at the same time come off nicely.  You do have to pull at them a bit to get them off but they sort of roll off without tearing into pieces.  (I pull from the back to the front because I think it’s easier to do standing up.)  I hate when sticky feet pull off in pieces; I&#x27;d rather deal with stained feet that have pieces of sticky feet stuck to my feet as I stand there half naked trying to collect all the pieces from the bottom of my feet so I can put shoes on and get on with my day.  I will say that the sticky feet I received are tan and not black as advertised, but I couldn&#x27;t care less about the color, just thought I would share in case some of you do.  I wear a size 9 shoe and these fit with room to spare (about ½ to ¾ of an inch in the front and back when centered on my foot) and were easy to walk in.  They are thin enough that you could trim them but I would suggest leaving at least ½ an inch at the back so you have something to grab and pull to remove them.  I will be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> It is so hard to get the backing off to even use these and once you do they are TOO sticky and hard to remove from your feet.  Only went with these because they were prime but won&#x27;t make that mistake twice</li>
    <li> my tanning salon sells a similar product for a dollar a pair.  I was looking for a better price and tried these - for the spray tan booth.  They work just fine.  They are not difficult for me to remove, as some others mentioned and they keep the bottom of my feet clean (exactly the purpose I wanted).  I have no trouble peeling the paper off to use them, and the price is way better than my salon charges.  Wish mine gives them away like someone else mentions in a different review!  LOL</li>
    <li> Hard to peel backing off. Sticks to feet when trying to remove.</li>
    <li> I spray tan at my Day Spa, and use these so that my clients don&#x27;t get product on their feet. I have seen a lot of negative reviews, but they work great for what I need them for.  :) Recommend !</li>
    <li> These are the absolute worse.  When you take them off your feet it rips into&lt;br /&gt;6 pieces and I had to actually get a pumice stone to get some of it off.  I am&lt;br /&gt;a salon owner and can not use any of them!</li>
    <li> Product sticks too well to the feet. Hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Waaaaaaay too sticky! Really hard to get them off in one piece.</li>
    <li> These will not come off your clients easily!  They have to soak their feet in order to remove the product.  Horrible to use in a spa setting.  You will end up refunding your customers if you use this product.  It&#x27;s like they have used super glue on them.</li>
    <li> Will not come off feet. Literally have to rip to shreds to remove. Leaving a sticky mess on the bottom of ur feet</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product because I didn’t think it would work.  I was completely wrong, this really sticks to your feet to the point that it almost doesn’t want to come off.   Great for spray tanning and walking through security at the airport.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Difficult to remove. Leaves residue on feet</li>
    <li> Super sticky, like rat traps!</li>
    <li> These sticky feet are really sticky, but relatively cheap and do their job. I will buy them again when I run out of the ones I have now.</li>
    <li> Love that they are black, as opposed to white. Biggest problem though is when you try to peel them off, they break off into little bits and small pieces get stuck to your feet. This is really embarrassing having this happen to my clients when I charge them for a spray tan. I will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These are terrible!! They look gross. They came in this awful off white color. I thought I was getting black as the picture and product description said. And the paper backing comes off in strips.. Not a clean solid piece, it strips apart as I&#x27;m trying to have my client put them on their feet. Looks tacky and unprofessional.</li>
    <li> The sticky feet arrived in a white color and not black as shown.&lt;br /&gt;I could have ordered with another company to get the exact color I thought&lt;br /&gt;I was buying, not please with this false advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the black photo and show the white if that&#x27;s what your selling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned over 400 clients. These are very sticky and then. They stick to your clients feet and tear when you try to remove. Putting lotion on feet helps but it doesn&#x27;t help much. Disappointed in these.</li>
    <li> These did the job during my spray tan but were completely horrible to remove!  Not to mention, they left a sticky film all over my clients feet and was very difficult to remove!  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and will be throwing them in the trash!</li>
    <li> The batch I got either stick too well (had a customer that got a tan then left for a trip and she was picking black sticky foam off her feet the whole flight!) or don&#x27;t stick at all (another customer went thru 6 pairs and wouldn&#x27;t stick)! Not happy with these at all....do not recommend these!!</li>
    <li> So sticky when you take them off they break on the feet</li>
    <li> These stick to your feet so badly that they peek off in pieces. My clients leave with pieces of them stuck to their feet. So embarrassing. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I give these out to my clients at my spary tanning business...and they love them!  It makes it way easier to tan them without the tanning solution sticking to their feet.  I like the fact that they are disposable, and some of my clients have even left home with them on!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Stick to the feet so much that clients cannot get them off!  Rip into 20 pieces trying to pry them of clients feet.  Bought them out of desperation waiting for our own shipment to come in.  Wish we would have trusted prior reviews.</li>
    <li> These will stick to your feet but they do NOT have black rubber soles.  The collection of sticky feet that I received were thin WHITE cardboard cut-outs with glue on the one side. It NOT worth spending the $40 for a pack of 50 pairs (100 sticky feet total) when you could spend less money for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, when you try to peel the sticky foot off, small pieces rip-off and remain stuck to the bottoms of your feet.</li>
    <li> They stick to the feet extremely well!!  Sometimes a bit hard to pull off, they are great quality, not cheaply made at all!!  The price point is perfect to!</li>
    <li> Not as sticky as I would like and they are two big. Clients trip over them and rip them off.</li>
    <li> These are HORRIBLE! TOO STICKY! They stick to bottoms of my clients feet and only come off in tiny pieces!  One of my clients&#x27; skin tore off the bottom of her feet with these! AVOID these!!!</li>
    <li> Like everyone has said before, they are incredibly sticky (on some people) and hard to get off. However, I found that if you apply a light amount of barrier cream to the bottom of the feet they come off without a problem (make sure to really rub it in to the feet though because they won&#x27;t stick if not). For the price, they are worth it, but if you are running a business, this might not be the most professional product. I will most likely buy more until I find a better buy!</li>
