      <li>but it&#x27;s completely amazing.</li>

      <li>I love this sparkle polish.  </li>
      <li>I also love how inexpensive it was, I paid about 4.00 each for both the golden one and the silver gem-y one which is an amazing price because in stores the cheapest you will find them is for about 7.50 a-piece.</li>

      <li>It is just lovely, and the best part is that it appears different colors in different lights.  </li>
      <li>Great over dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;Arrive quickly and packaged safely.</li>
      <li>By far one of my favorite top coats.</li>
      <li>It looks great over top of so many colors, it is magical over black and over light blue</li>
      <li>I bought this recently and have to say it is SO versatile and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>this nail polish is not overbearing like full on glitter nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Application is a little tricky, but it goes beautifully over any color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cute over white</li>
      <li>My favorite new polish.</li>
      <li>it looks great over black nail polish.</li>
      <li>My package arrived before the first day on the shipping estimation!</li>
      <li>Both went on evenly and had great coverage as well as dried quickly.</li>
      <li>but it also adds a beautiful subtle effect to light colors as well.</li>
      <li>it gets even better, it came like 5 days early.</li>
      <li>It looks amazing over both light and dark bottom coat.  </li>
      <li>and I love it by itself as well as layered on top of other colors!</li>
      <li>This is so pretty.</li>
      <li>I finally made the decision to get this polish and am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I actually accidentally ordered this nail polish, when trying to order a top coat.</li>
      <li>On greys, it takes on an almost reddish tint to the sparkle, which is also pretty.</li>
      <li>I like these three shimmer shine as a top coat because the shinny flakes are small and easy to remove.</li>
      <li>The flakes are fairly large, but not obnoxiously so.</li>
      <li>I bought three Essie Luxeffects nail polishes, Shine of Times, Pure Pearlfection, and As Gold as it Gets.</li>
      <li>All of them turned out very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending the Essie Nail polish for me.</li>
      <li>😊😉 shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>mine has gooped up quite a bit by now, but I don&#x27;t even care because it rules so much.</li>
      <li>It is just too much for me.</li>
      <li>a real keeper...</li>
      <li>I tried it over a bubblegum pink as well, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as the black and white swatch.</li>
      <li>On top of dark colors it brings out fiery sparkly tones.</li>
      <li>it is also not lumpy like glitter and removes easily.. best over black or a dark colour but most especially black..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a nice formula, not goopy or gummy and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>not only does it look amazing over black</li>
      <li>I was very surprised with this polish.</li>
      <li>When a teenage guy working at the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts compliments you that your nails are \\&quot;pretty awesome\\</li>
      <li>It has small iridescent flakes that somehow gather together to give really interesting designs on the nail.</li>
      <li>, Pure Pearlfesction has a sliver shine, and As Gold as it Gets only has gold shine.</li>
      <li>Shine of the Times is clear and has almost a pink/green iridescence to the glitter flecks.</li>
      <li>Ive boughten three so far just in case</li>
      <li>They are usual high Essie qualities, long lasting, fast drying and easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I wore it over a white polish and it reflected light pink &amp; blue in the sun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful layered over just about any base color, light or dark.</li>
      <li>As Gold as it Gets is clear with different sized gold flecks.</li>
      <li>Vary flashy and will add a nice layer of flaky with one coat.  </li>
      <li>On top of black, it shines red, gold, and green.</li>
      <li>On top of white, it shines almost iridescently but subtly!</li>
      <li>I first swatched this color on black and white.</li>
      <li>i love this top coat it transforms any boring old color into this iridescent</li>

    <li> I bought this recently and have to say it is SO versatile and gorgeous. I wore it over a white polish and it reflected light pink &amp; blue in the sun. I then wore it over a dark brown/black polish and it reflected green/amber. I got compliments on both mani&#x27;s. When a teenage guy working at the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts compliments you that your nails are \\&quot;pretty awesome\\&quot; that means its a winner:) LOL. &amp;lt;3 Essie and will buy more shades in the luxeffects family!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this polish! Great over dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;Arrive quickly and packaged safely. A pleasure to do business with and will be making future purchases from.</li>
    <li> This is a unique color and I love it by itself as well as layered on top of other colors! The service was speedy! My package arrived before the first day on the shipping estimation!</li>
    <li> I bought three Essie Luxeffects nail polishes, Shine of Times, Pure Pearlfection, and As Gold as it Gets. All of them turned out very well. Shine of Times obtains a red and gold shine, Pure Pearlfesction has a sliver shine, and As Gold as it Gets only has gold shine.

They are usual high Essie qualities, long lasting, fast drying and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> One of my very favorite polishes. Looks great over darker shades. When paired with dark blue it looks like a peacock&#x27;s tail. Has a lot of glitter per application.</li>
    <li> This polish is fantastic. It looks great over top of so many colors, it is magical over black and over light blue it turns your nails in to shining Opals! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It looks amazing over both light and dark bottom coat.  I also love how inexpensive it was, I paid about 4.00 each for both the golden one and the silver gem-y one which is an amazing price because in stores the cheapest you will find them is for about 7.50 a-piece.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! It&#x27;s like little flecks of iridescent rainbow, it looks different over different colors or in different lights. It&#x27;s also a nice formula, not goopy or gummy and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
    <li> First of all I hate glitter nail polish. It is just too much for me. I actually accidentally ordered this nail polish, when trying to order a top coat. I am glad I did. this nail polish is not overbearing like full on glitter nail polishes. It has small iridescent flakes that somehow gather together to give really interesting designs on the nail. It looks good over every color of nail polish I have used. It is also great for doing amazing glitter ombre nails.</li>
    <li> Woah. Woah. I was very surprised with this polish. I figured the popularity of it was just overhyped but it&#x27;s completely amazing. I like using it with dark colors but it also adds a beautiful subtle effect to light colors as well. I&#x27;m going to be buying this as gifts this year!</li>
    <li> I love this sparkle polish.  It is just lovely, and the best part is that it appears different colors in different lights.  Sweet!</li>
    <li> Vary flashy and will add a nice layer of flaky with one coat.  Red to green flaky.  May be comparable to some of the other flakies that are on the market like fingerpaints.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty. On top of dark colors it brings out fiery sparkly tones. On top of light colors it looks almost like a sparkiling opal stone.</li>
    <li> This polish is a great top coat!!!  It was so easy to apply unlike The Studio M Covered in Dimonds.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending the Essie Nail polish for me. I received it faster than anticipated. I would definitely use your company again.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish... not only does it look amazing over black it is also not lumpy like glitter and removes easily.. best over black or a dark colour but most especially black.. the colour is amazing... everyone notices and comments..a real keeper... i&#x27;ll be wearing this again and again..</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing! It has flakes that apply smoothly. It works well with all colors. It contains hues of red, pink, yellow, green, white, orange, etc. I can&#x27;t imagine a color that this would not look good with. I have worn this over a bright pink and it is wonderful.Any color will look great, but I recommend pairing it with Super Bossa Nova, Da Bush, Marshmallow, or a crewed interest.&lt;br /&gt;I love this color. It&#x27;s basically like liquid Opals. Can&#x27;t wait to experiment with even more color combinations</li>
    <li> Love this polish! It looks so different on every polish I put it over. I would definitely recommend this polish!!!</li>
    <li> I finally made the decision to get this polish and am so glad I did. I love this type of topper. Makes any base color even prettier! Well pleased with the seller, well wrapped and on time.</li>
    <li> After seeing Essie Luxeffects in a magazine ad I ordered both Shine of the Times and As Gold as it Gets. Both are beautiful on. Shine of the Times is clear and has almost a pink/green iridescence to the glitter flecks. As Gold as it Gets is clear with different sized gold flecks. Both went on evenly and had great coverage as well as dried quickly. Subtle enough to wear every day.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful topcoat. My nails always attract attention when wearing this polish. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorite top coats. It&#x27;s a great color. It makes all bottom coats stand out. Ive boughten three so far just in case it&#x27;s a limited addition</li>
    <li> I first swatched this color on black and white. On top of black, it shines red, gold, and green. On top of white, it shines almost iridescently but subtly! It&#x27;s very cute over white and I would call it a simple wedding manicure. I tried it over a bubblegum pink as well, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as the black and white swatch. If I had more than just one bottle, I&#x27;d try it over almost every color I have just to see what happens!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sparkle polish -- ever. It looks great on nudes, pinks. On greys, it takes on an almost reddish tint to the sparkle, which is also pretty. Wish I could find it in stores, but I&#x27;ll keep ordering this until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> what can I say? this polish is legendary. mine has gooped up quite a bit by now, but I don&#x27;t even care because it rules so much.</li>
    <li> Shine of the Times is the perfect overcoat to go over your favorite nail polish. Application is a little tricky, but it goes beautifully over any color. Who doesn&#x27;t want a holographic flakie?</li>
    <li> Just like every other polish fan girl out there, I had to have this. It&#x27;s amazing. Picture don&#x27;t do it justice. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> I had to order a few of these because it was going to be discontinued. I love it! I get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> i had bought this item because i couldnt find it in the stores. i was hapy to see that they had it. it gets even better, it came like 5 days early. it looks great over black nail polish. i am verry happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> i love this top coat it transforms any boring old color into this iridescent almost acid rain like effect which looks different with every color!bottom line is this is my go to when i want some fun awesome nails and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love it😄😃😀😊😉 shipping was fast. My favorite new polish.</li>
    <li> I saw this polish on a beauty blog and was instantly smitten. It&#x27;s beautiful layered over just about any base color, light or dark. The flakes are fairly large, but not obnoxiously so. It&#x27;s really super layered over a gold micro-glitter polish! And the price is excellent for a product this beautiful.</li>
