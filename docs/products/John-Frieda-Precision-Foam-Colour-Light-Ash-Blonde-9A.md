      <li>I let it sit for 30 minutes just to be safe</li>
      <li>I am well pleased with your product.</li>
      <li>I also think the John Frieda colors have more depth and are prettier.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t drip like most hair dyes do but more importantly!</li>
      <li>Today I ordered some more using Subscribe &amp; Save, and will receive the product monthly.  </li>
      <li>The application was ok -</li>
      <li>Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Perfect blonde I wanted: light but not platinum, summery but not bronze-y.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect blonde, not orange or too light.</li>
      <li>I was impressed at how quickly the color changed and loved the fact that it&#x27;s mess free and doesn&#x27;t need to sit in your hair for around 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>so easy to use.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is easy to use and leaves hair silky, however I found myself to be allergic to the ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t happen with the foam, it soaks in and covers all the hair easily.</li>
      <li>So easy and a pleasure to use.  </li>
      <li>This John Frieda Precision Foam Color9A Light Ash Blonde is the most wonderful, gentle haircoloring I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This did not color my hair quite as light blond as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>I tried this dye because I received a coupon for a free box.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never attemped to use a foam hair color before, and was glad to find John Frieda&#x27;s Precision Foam Color in 6G (Light Golden Brown).  </li>
      <li>However, the color still appears rich rather than faded, and my hair is in fantastic shape.  </li>
      <li>The foam is definitely super easy and</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good hair dye that is not fading easily and is not over drying to the hair.</li>
      <li>The color is rich and vibrant and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>If they really have discontinued this shade, I&#x27;ll have to renew my search for a better color kit</li>
      <li>Either because of medication or changes in highcoloring formulas, every brand that I tried for the five months of trying, my hair kept turning strawberry blonde, with a good deal of brassy gold even tending towards orange.  </li>
      <li>I do like the less-mess foam method over traditional, and Frieda&#x27;s gloves are better than most I&#x27;ve found included in a color kit.</li>
      <li>The color was exactly what I wanted, light ash blond.</li>
      <li>It has all the traits I like in a product ,easy to use, fast and works like it should..</li>
      <li>it was the first time I had ever colored my hair.</li>
      <li>BUT I will choose a shade that looks lighter than what I want, given how this first try turned out.</li>
      <li>Washing out the dye was also much more simple than the liquid dyes.</li>
      <li>I have been using a \\&quot;level 9\\&quot; blonde on my hair for many years, and I know exactly what results to expect.</li>
      <li>They seem to cover better and they last longer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using at home box hair dyes for over five years now and this was my first experience with foam.</li>
      <li>The color is true and no mess.</li>
      <li>Looks super natural.</li>
      <li>The application was easy, especially given the lack of dripping dye.  </li>
      <li>More than three weeks on, it&#x27;s changed a bit to more of a bronze and less of a deep auburn, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t look anything like the color on the box.  </li>
      <li>Also the current color choices are limited but perhaps those will increase as people become more familiar with the foam.</li>
      <li>It was much easier and quicker to use than the liquid dyes and just about anyone could do this.</li>
      <li>I find the foam colors so much easier to use than the &amp;#34;glop&amp;#34; colors.  </li>
      <li>The many that I tried:  Garnier Herbashine, Light Natural Blonde; Garnier \\&quot;New\\&quot; Nutrisse Foam hair color #9; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference Ultra Light Ash Blonde; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference #9.5A Lightest Ash Blonde(smelled horrible and stung my scalp).  </li>
      <li>but, nope, it was significantly darker and redder than I would have thought possible.  </li>
      <li>I now have a head full of very greenish \\&quot;ash\\&quot; blonde hair.</li>
      <li>She said it left her hair silky and full of body.</li>
      <li>It states FULL gray coverage, but it didn&#x27;t even last a week!  </li>
      <li>BUT, none of the shades of Precision Foam Colour I&#x27;ve tried does anything to make my gray/white hairs disappear, so I won&#x27;t recommend it to you if gray coverage is your main goal</li>
      <li>this product sucks, it is ment for just giving the color u got now a better look!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It was old!!.  </li>
      <li>I was afraid it would not be light enough, but it looks great.</li>
      <li>It came out without any hassle, which was a new experience to me.</li>
      <li>Think Blake lively in gossip girl.</li>
      <li>Very easy application, and only a little itchiness on my ears (and I have very sensitive skin!)</li>
      <li>Washing it out is very easy, didn&#x27;t take much rinsing and also didn&#x27;t seem to leave hair as dry as typical dyes do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>9A is a very natural looking Ash Blonde,  with a pretty shimmer.</li>
      <li>I normally use natural ingredient conditioners, no harmful toxins.</li>
      <li>Product was two years old, I didn&#x27;t dare to use it</li>
      <li>It covers all your hair completely.</li>
      <li>Then I finally bought this product, and my hair is finally back to what my hair should be - light ash blonde, with no brassy tones anywhere, instead I have shine to my hair and softness.  </li>
      <li>(old habit) and washed it out.</li>
      <li>This product looks completely natural.</li>
      <li>I thought that surely it looked incredibly dark because it was wet . . .</li>
      <li>I picked this up deciding to try the new foam craze in hair dye that just recently started.</li>
      <li>I am a blonde that wants to stay blonde.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other cons are the price is a bit higher than other foam dyes, I assume you are paying for the \\&quot;John Freida\\&quot;  name.</li>
      <li>It toned down the brassiness from a previous color, which I LOVE.</li>
      <li>Many Golden blonde hair dyes are brassy: too red or too yellow, and sometimes the \\&quot;Ash\\&quot; colors are too dull or dark.</li>
      <li>According to the box, this shade is very similar to my natural color</li>
      <li>It is much easier to use than any other haircoloring; you don&#x27;t have to worry about how neat you are in applying the foam; the color seems to cover wherever it needs to go; you don&#x27;t have any dripping of solution, instead the foam just sits on your head not going anywhere.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but it hardly changed my hair color at all waste of $$</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the foam adding much in terms of ease, and would probably make a roots only application harder.</li>
      <li>For $12 I expected to get a decent change in the color of my hair</li>
      <li>It seems to be higher quality than similar products from other brands, my hair doesn&#x27;t look so dry after using it.</li>
      <li>i have long thick hair, i used the 9a light ash blonde.</li>

<li> It blended away my roots completely, but did not significantly lighten my hair</li>
<li> This takes only about 45 minutes, rather than the hour or two that I spent in the beauty shop.  </li>
<li> Now I&#x27;m saving money - only has cost me less that $200 over the 5 months (and I&#x27;ve had my hair cut only twice; don&#x27;t need to cut as often).</li>
<li> ~ I sure hope I&#x27;m wrong about that!</li>
<li> Took a bit of getting used to because it is different than other home coloring products.</li>
<li> My hair was a dark blonde</li>
<li> The dye is low odor and only takes 20 minutes unless you have hard to color hair.</li>
<li> Most people are shocked that I color my hair, let alone that I do it myself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using at home box hair dyes for over five years now and this was my first experience with foam. My hair was a dark blonde and I wanted to go a few shades lighter so I decided to give this a try.   My roommate bought a box in a brown and I watched as she used this dye. Her hair was a bleach blonde and before she even finished applying the foam dye, her hair was already a dark brown. I was impressed at how quickly the color changed and loved the fact that it&#x27;s mess free and doesn&#x27;t need to sit in your hair for around 45 minutes. So I gave this a try for myself. It was much easier and quicker to use than the liquid dyes and just about anyone could do this. I have thick hair and usually have to buy two boxes to cover everything but not with this stuff! I let it sit for 30 minutes just to be safe (old habit) and washed it out. Washing out the dye was also much more simple than the liquid dyes. It came out without any hassle, which was a new experience to me. But my hair DID NOT turn out the color that is on this box. It is shiny and doesn&#x27;t have spotty color but I didn&#x27;t get the color I wanted. My hair is lighter but not noticeably lighter, which is what I was after. For $12 I expected to get a decent change in the color of my hair and I did not. For half the price I could have boughten two boxes of liquid dye and I would have gotten the color I wanted. I will not buy john frieda foam dye in blonde ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never attemped to use a foam hair color before, and was glad to find John Frieda&#x27;s Precision Foam Color in 6G (Light Golden Brown).  According to the box, this shade is very similar to my natural color (my hair was perhaps one shade darker due to a coloring early this year).  The application was easy, especially given the lack of dripping dye.  I timed it as suggested, and then rinsed out my hair.  I thought that surely it looked incredibly dark because it was wet . . . but, nope, it was significantly darker and redder than I would have thought possible.  More than three weeks on, it&#x27;s changed a bit to more of a bronze and less of a deep auburn, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t look anything like the color on the box.  However, the color still appears rich rather than faded, and my hair is in fantastic shape.  I would not hesitate to use this brand again BUT I will choose a shade that looks lighter than what I want, given how this first try turned out.</li>
    <li> This John Frieda Precision Foam Color9A Light Ash Blonde is the most wonderful, gentle haircoloring I have ever used.  Today I ordered some more using Subscribe &amp; Save, and will receive the product monthly.  For about five years I have been having my hair highlighted in beauty shops, costing me close to $100 with the usual hair cut.  Finally I got sick of spending the time and money and went back to coloring my hair myself which I had done since high school (I now am close to 74 years-old).  Either because of medication or changes in highcoloring formulas, every brand that I tried for the five months of trying, my hair kept turning strawberry blonde, with a good deal of brassy gold even tending towards orange.  The many that I tried:  Garnier Herbashine, Light Natural Blonde; Garnier \\&quot;New\\&quot; Nutrisse Foam hair color #9; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference Ultra Light Ash Blonde; L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference #9.5A Lightest Ash Blonde(smelled horrible and stung my scalp).  Then I finally bought this product, and my hair is finally back to what my hair should be - light ash blonde, with no brassy tones anywhere, instead I have shine to my hair and softness.  It is much easier to use than any other haircoloring; you don&#x27;t have to worry about how neat you are in applying the foam; the color seems to cover wherever it needs to go; you don&#x27;t have any dripping of solution, instead the foam just sits on your head not going anywhere.  Then I just slip into the shower and rinse, then add the conditioner and finish the job.  This takes only about 45 minutes, rather than the hour or two that I spent in the beauty shop.  Now I&#x27;m saving money - only has cost me less that $200 over the 5 months (and I&#x27;ve had my hair cut only twice; don&#x27;t need to cut as often).</li>
    <li> I am a blonde that wants to stay blonde. This product looks completely natural. Most people are shocked that I color my hair, let alone that I do it myself. The instructions are simple and after 40 minutes I feel 10 years younger. It is the perfect blonde, not orange or too light. Amazon allows this product to be bought with a subscription so now it just shows up at my doorstep every two month. Heaven.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and very natural - easy to use.</li>
    <li> I find the foam colors so much easier to use than the &amp;#34;glop&amp;#34; colors.  They seem to cover better and they last longer.  I also think the John Frieda colors have more depth and are prettier.  Nothing beats most salon color, but this is very good if you can&#x27;t get to a salon when you need to get there.</li>
    <li> The more I use this the more I like it. Took a bit of getting used to because it is different than other home coloring products. The foam is nice. The color is true and no mess.</li>
    <li> Everything was in the box, I can&#x27;t find the color 9A in my area.  The box was banged up but everything was in one piece.</li>
    <li> This is &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; shade that produces the result I want, but it appears to have been discontinued... if anyone knows otherwise, please let me know! I do like the less-mess foam method over traditional, and Frieda&#x27;s gloves are better than most I&#x27;ve found included in a color kit. BUT, none of the shades of Precision Foam Colour I&#x27;ve tried does anything to make my gray/white hairs disappear, so I won&#x27;t recommend it to you if gray coverage is your main goal: I just don&#x27;t think it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I began coloring at home because I was tired of leaving a salon $75-$150 poorer &amp; having every single gray I walked in with. If they really have discontinued this shade, I&#x27;ll have to renew my search for a better color kit ~ I sure hope I&#x27;m wrong about that!</li>
    <li> I picked this up deciding to try the new foam craze in hair dye that just recently started. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair most of my life so any innovations is always great. The foam is definitely super easy and even though i have long past the shoulder length hair - i still had plenty of product left over. It doesn&#x27;t drip like most hair dyes do but more importantly! It covers all your hair completely. Usually with the regular hair dye, even with two boxes - the dye would not get to every hair and i would have some spotting underneath. This doesn&#x27;t happen with the foam, it soaks in and covers all the hair easily. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong like typical dyes but not very pleasant either. Washing it out is very easy, didn&#x27;t take much rinsing and also didn&#x27;t seem to leave hair as dry as typical dyes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the negative part of this product, the conditioner! The conditioner is easy to use and leaves hair silky, however I found myself to be allergic to the ingredients in it. They always say test for allergic reaction to the dye, but never the conditioner. I normally use natural ingredient conditioners, no harmful toxins. So whatever was in this conditioner didn&#x27;t sit with me well. Even after rinsing again twice the next day, i could not get the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of the conditioner out, and unfortunately had to deal with allergic reaction of drippy nose and watery eyes for maybe 36 hours after. Needless to say I did not use the 2nd round of the conditioner and probably will be trying other foam dyes the next time I dye my hair. Other than that, it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cons are the price is a bit higher than other foam dyes, I assume you are paying for the \\&quot;John Freida\\&quot;  name. Also the current color choices are limited but perhaps those will increase as people become more familiar with the foam. Overall it is a good hair dye that is not fading easily and is not over drying to the hair.</li>
    <li> so easy to use. colors evenly. I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years it was the first time I had ever colored my hair. It has all the traits I like in a product ,easy to use, fast and works like it should..</li>
    <li> this was my first atempt to use this foam crap! i have long thick hair, i used the 9a light ash blonde. well yes the dye does give u plenty to work with, well the fact is,  it simpley does not lift ur root color... this product sucks, it is ment for just giving the color u got now a better look! not to completly dye ur hair with, and expect it to turn out a diff color. use it if u already have blonde hair, or if u got dark hair use the dark colors ec. in other words im NEVER SPENING MONEY oN THIS CRAP AGAIN!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best price I have seen yet for this item.  The color is rich and vibrant and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect blonde I wanted: light but not platinum, summery but not bronze-y. Think Blake lively in gossip girl. I&#x27;ve been dying my dark brown hair with this color for 2 years and I love it. Looks super natural.</li>
    <li> Product was two years old, I didn&#x27;t dare to use it</li>
    <li> The color was exactly what I wanted, light ash blond. I was afraid it would not be light enough, but it looks great. It seems to be higher quality than similar products from other brands, my hair doesn&#x27;t look so dry after using it.</li>
    <li> I have natural dirty blonde hair that I now try to dye a brighter, prettier color. Many Golden blonde hair dyes are brassy: too red or too yellow, and sometimes the \\&quot;Ash\\&quot; colors are too dull or dark. 9A is a very natural looking Ash Blonde,  with a pretty shimmer. It blended away my roots completely, but did not significantly lighten my hair (I left it on for about 30 minutes). It toned down the brassiness from a previous color, which I LOVE. It didn&#x27;t take me from a medium blonde to a platinum (which is not what I wanted anyway).  I would recommend it to natural blondes looking to blend away roots to to tone down a brassy color. Very easy application, and only a little itchiness on my ears (and I have very sensitive skin!) All in all I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I have had allergies from other hair colors so I tried your product that does not have p-Phenylenediamine included in the ingredients and had no problem with the itchy rash.  I am well pleased with your product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it.  She was going to salon that used it and then decided she wanted to try applying it for herself (at least for root touch ups).  She loved it.  She said it left her hair silky and full of body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but it hardly changed my hair color at all waste of $$</li>
    <li> Came out too brassy for me!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase, the color is as described.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect, looks natural with lights and darks.  So easy and a pleasure to use.  I would definately buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Well, this was an unpleasant and unwelcome suprise. I have been using a \\&quot;level 9\\&quot; blonde on my hair for many years, and I know exactly what results to expect. I tried this dye because I received a coupon for a free box. The application was ok - I don&#x27;t see the foam adding much in terms of ease, and would probably make a roots only application harder. The dye is low odor and only takes 20 minutes unless you have hard to color hair. The negative is that my hair color did not turn out even remotely like the color shown on the box. I now have a head full of very greenish \\&quot;ash\\&quot; blonde hair. I wish I&#x27;d done it on the weekend so that I&#x27;d have time to get another color (from another brand) and subject my poor hair to another dye job. I guess it will have to wait until after work tomorrow. I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I used the dark chocolate brown.  It states FULL gray coverage, but it didn&#x27;t even last a week!  I had gray peeking out in the back of my head AND the crown.  Thought I was going bald and walked around looking like a skunk until I could color again.  I will never spend the money on this product again :(</li>
    <li> It was old!!.  It would not foam like it is supmissed to &amp; did not color my hair.  I was very disappointed.  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> This did not color my hair quite as light blond as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> Love this hair color!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Looks very natural. My hair comes out great every time!</li>
