      <li>Absolutely one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all!!!</li>
      <li>Does have a nice smell though</li>
      <li>It has good absorbency, isn&#x27;t greasy, and blends well with my favorite foundation (Revlon Colorstay) to make a nice tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but the version with SPF15 is better -- this one is very light, almost a lotion, and the SPF version is thicker and creamier.  </li>
      <li>Not terribly</li>
      <li>Try it! :-)</li>
      <li>I love Lumene products, and this is no exception.  </li>

      <li>and I have to say, it has made my skin more smooth and even toned.  </li>

      <li>So far so good .  </li>
      <li>Its too early for me to offer a long term review however, for a day cream, it seems perfect - light, non-greasy, moisturizing and anti-aging.</li>

      <li>Worth buying.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, it&#x27;s in a cute little circular bottle and feels refreshing yet soothing!</li>
      <li>THERE IS NO OTHER BETTER PRODUCT ON THE MARKET</li>
      <li>Small size container but great price on Amazon compared to retail stores.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s something you should check out in person before purchasing because the scent is very, very pungent.</li>
      <li>I had started using Vitamin C cream purchased from my Dermatologist at a higher price.  </li>

      <li>Gentle and nourishing, and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this face cream! This cream has changed the way I view/use face creams.&lt;br /&gt;It has made my ace brighter and a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizing and brightens your skin as well.  Great price for this fabulous product. No matter your skin type, this will work.</li>
    <li> THERE IS NO OTHER BETTER PRODUCT ON THE MARKET REALLY WORKS 100%</li>
    <li> The 1st time I bought it at Walgreens it came in a clear jar and after application my skin had a nice silky glow. This does not leave my skin the same way. Seem&#x27;s like it changed. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin the same way. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Upset actually.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it has brought back my healthy glow to my skin and seems to have smoothed out some lines too. But, the best part is the smell, like oranges Love it</li>
    <li> This light cream does keep skin looking and feeling hydrated....don&#x60;t know what it can do for wrinkles, but I like the way it feels!</li>
    <li> A very pleasant smelling cream that works well.  At my age, I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this leaves my skin very soft. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought a travel size container of this cream at my drugstore recently, to use during a brief hospital stay. I love the consistency, mild fragrance, and have decided to switch to this brand as my main day cream. It has good absorbency, isn&#x27;t greasy, and blends well with my favorite foundation (Revlon Colorstay) to make a nice tinted moisturizer. When my current night cream runs out I may try the Lumene version.</li>
    <li> It even smells like oranges! Smooth and silky. Love the way it makes my skin glow ever morning. It is even lightening some dark spots on my face. Great value. Good size container. This will probably last a few months. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at this cream, it really does smell like oranges.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, it has made my skin more smooth and even toned.  At 62, not sure it has resolved any of my wrinkle issues, but it does feel and smell really nice when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and really seems to have alot of Vitaman C, though I cannot find the exact percent. Feels great when I put it on, as though it is actually doing something.</li>
    <li> I supose there are going to be people who love this lemony baked goods scent, but it&#x27;s not for me. Makes me gag every time I put it on. Perhaps it&#x27;s something you should check out in person before purchasing because the scent is very, very pungent.</li>
    <li> Again, I love Lumene Products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but the version with SPF15 is better -- this one is very light, almost a lotion, and the SPF version is thicker and creamier.  Both are great, especially good value for the price!  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this but after using two days in a row i broke out.Not terribly but i got a few big pimples around my mouth and on my forehead.I was using this for moisturizer after a mini peels but just doesnt work for my sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> Absolutely one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all!!!</li>
    <li> Small size container but great price on Amazon compared to retail stores.  My wife uses it daily and loves the product.</li>
    <li> i am a dark skinned woman who loves my skin tone and i bought this product with the intention of brightening my skin without the harsh bleaching effect of a bleaching cremes and that is exactly what it did. It evened out my dark spots and made my skin radiate, i got compliments on my skin the fist day of using it. i will definitely buy again! thank u</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear any cover up.  This cream really absorbs into my dry skin and heals it.  My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference after using this product for weeks. Does have a nice smell though</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am in my 50s and have always taken care of my skin.  This product quickly absorbs in my skin and does not feel sticky after application or dry an hour later. My Skin stays soft all day until evening. I know I will buy this product again!  I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Love this product! it&#x27;s a fabulous VitaminC cream!</li>
    <li> Gave me a terrible rash.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff almost every day to keep my skin from getting all flaky.  It locks the moisture in and gives me a bit of a glow that I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT CREAM ..LOVE THE SMELL</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.</li>
    <li> leaves a greasy film behind.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s in a cute little circular bottle and feels refreshing yet soothing! It has a lovely citrus aroma and feels light and airy on my skin. It shipped and arrived very quickly and I immediately tried it when I opened it up. Its too early for me to offer a long term review however, for a day cream, it seems perfect - light, non-greasy, moisturizing and anti-aging. Win, win, win...plus it&#x27;s from Finland too so that&#x27;s even better!</li>
    <li> The Lumene products are some of the best available.  Their ingredients are mostly natural and of very high quality.  This cream is aptly named because it is not only very &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; but it also leaves my face feeling wonderfully soft.  It brightens my aging skin and seems to improve it with daily use. Highly recommend it for daily use.</li>
    <li> Saw it advertised in a women&#x27;s magazine... So far so good .  My skin is looking great!  I would recommend it! Love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this face cream-try the small one first to see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Does not seem like the same crème I buy in CVS</li>
    <li> I had started using Vitamin C cream purchased from my Dermatologist at a higher price.  This product has exactly the same ingredients and is much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Just as great as the night time version but with&lt;br /&gt;the protection I need to be outdoors...does not&lt;br /&gt;look pasty white or dry out my skin as other SPF&lt;br /&gt;products tend to do. So glad I found it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the first time using the product, I have had good luck with it. This cream is not only very &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; but it  leaves my face feeling wonderfully soft. It seems to brightens my skin and seems soften with daily use. I highly recommend it for daily use. I haven&#x27;t yet, but I intend to reorder.</li>
    <li> Not at all greasy, blends into the skin well, and makes the face feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum~</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will continue to purchase it...</li>
    <li> I love using this on my face..Leave&#x27;s a glow. Worth buying.</li>
    <li> I have just gone through the end stages of peeling of a jessner peel and used this to help with the healing and overall appearance of my skin and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I have always had sensitive skin and was cautious to try this at first but was pleasantly surprised to find that 1.) I didn&#x27;t break out 2.) How light yet moisturizing it was and 3.) How visibly brighter my skin has been looking during peel and post peel. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product to use every day if you like your skin to be moisturized without a greasy feeling. Try it! :-)</li>
    <li> I love Lumene products, and this is no exception.  Gentle and nourishing, and I do notice a difference in my skin. I have combination skin, and I do get some forehead shine with this creme.  I don&#x27;t care, I just use blotting papers, but I guess someone else might care. It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, but it&#x27;s not bad, and it&#x27;s the same as other vitamin C creams I have tried.  It does not have SPF, that is another version.  That was what bumped it to 4 stars instead of 5 for me.</li>
