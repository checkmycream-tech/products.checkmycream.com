    <li> Amazing. Works like a charm! Love the scent, it&#x27;s very pleasant!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used, and my gal comes over just to use it, but it&#x27;s damn expensive.</li>
    <li> I just received my shampoo and conditioner and used it only once.  I have to say I was very skeptical.  I have tried MANY hair products. This one delivered! My hair is VERY dry and brittle and this product left my hair soft. I like to let my hair air dry and I was impressed that my hair didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; like it sometimes does. I have very long hair so I will have to review again once I have used up my bottles and let you know how long it lasted me. I would definitely recommend.  I gave this product 4 stars only because it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I tried this with a sample first then decided to buy full size..works very well on my hair and i color it every six weeks and this conditioner makes my hair shiny and smooth.. plus love the scent.</li>
    <li> I first used this product at my PM Salon after running out of PM Awapuhi.  This stuff is SO Much better! I have long thick curly hair so I use a lot more than the normal person would but it is well worth it.  I ran out last week and my salon didn&#x27;t have any more in yet so I have been waiting until my next appointment to get some.  I miss it terribly.  My hair has not been the same since I stopped using it, and it&#x27;s only been a few washes.  I can&#x27;t wait to get it back.</li>
    <li> This is ok. I purchased this by accident while trying to get the Flour volumizing shampoo (which is the best ever). Not a fan of the woods smell</li>
    <li> N. 4 is pricey, but well worth it. A little goes a long way.  This shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever tried!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> this is the best product on the market!! My hair was thinning due to medications I have to take, it has thickened my hair,  and I LOVE IT  Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair shine and look healthy.  No build up.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Prompt delivery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Absolutely BEST hair product you&#x27;ll ever use on your hair, might be a little more pricy but worth every drop! Purchase and shipping was great</li>
    <li> I have used the best and most expensive conditioners.  This n4 makes my hair soft manageable and leaves no residue. Very clean and fabulous product . I have highlighted and single processed hair..nothing worked as well as this</li>
    <li> Have tried all high end moisturizing shampoo and conditioners&lt;br /&gt;This one is the Best!!!! Absolutely worth the money, get all three- the shampoo, conditioner and spray. Waiting to receive constructive mask, can&#x27;t wait!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand for shampoo &amp; conditioner. I originally tried the clarifying shampoo through my birchbox subscription and then I purchased the hydrating shampoo &amp; conditioner as a set through Groupon. I fell in love with this brand and my stylist kept telling me how great my hair looked and felt! I bought this through amazon because it seemed to be the best price out there since groupon hasn&#x27;t had it on their site again. I have long thick curly hair and I struggle with dryness because of having this type of hair but this has helped make my hair soft and beautiful :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I have very dry color treated hair.  It did nothing to soften or detangle my hair.  I never made it through the bottle.  Money is better spent on Kerastase products.  Waste of $$.</li>
    <li> The best product for your hair that I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Not only is the smell amazing - the conditioner leaves my hair so shiny &amp; smooth! Love this product! Buy it!</li>
    <li> A little pricey.  Love the scent</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and am always trying conditioners.  This is a bit pricey for me but it certainly delivers! Left my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Hydrating Shampoo and love how my hair feels.  It gives my hair healthy shine and softness.  (I&#x27;d probably touch my hair all day if I could.)  It&#x27;s expensive but lasts a LONG time.. I purchased this in October and still have a little left.</li>
    <li> I love the product; however, the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s cumbersome to have to open and try to pour the product out of the unusually shaped container.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter just loves this shampoo! It is her abso1lute favorite!I have bought it for her at least 3 times. I first heard about it on TV steals and deals.</li>
