### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This hand cream is the best I have used... and I am a product junkie!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this cream!!!  </li>
      <li>I take very good care of my hands, but the years are creeping up, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product.</li>
      <li>It looks great when I use it on my hands.</li>
      <li>This lotion is the best ever it got rid of all my age spots on my hands love</li>
      <li>It feels good when I put the hand lotion on</li>
      <li>I am trying to see the good it does for aging skin.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>AMAZING....</li>
      <li>Feels nice on my skin is not greasy.</li>
      <li>However, as far as improving my hands, I am totally happy and will purchase it again!</li>
      <li>I love this lotion I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my mother and my boss, and of course myself.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite product</li>
      <li>I have used Retinol hand cream and it keeps your hand so nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good hand cream.</li>
      <li>Cream is nice enough, and good perfume to it, but I noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would see results so fast or at all</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely, non-greasy cream that is absorbed quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have it by my nightstand, great for winter time, or dry windy months.</li>
      <li>4-star rating is for the tremendous result when applied to my feet, however it would rate 2 stars based on experience when used on my hands.</li>
      <li>It has a typical retinol smell, which isn&#x27;t great, but it does suggest that there is quite a bit of retinol in the product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, but is mostly absorbed within 10 minutes of application.</li>
      <li>This is the first product that does what it states it will do.  </li>
      <li>A nice surprise for me is that it fades oncoming freckles and dark spots on your hands.</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t notice the promised younger looking, smooth, supple skin.</li>
      <li>I put it on at night because I really don&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>I use every night and my skin is much smoother and it moisturizes really well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks amazon</li>
      <li>This hand cream is so soft and silky, with a delicate and pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, has a strong smell that reminds me of my grandmother and doesn&#x27;t seem to rub in as quickly as I like.</li>
      <li>What I did notice was that the lotion required constant reapplication in order to keep the dry, tight feeling away from my hands and that many other lotions I had on hand were better at keep my hands smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>The scent is typical of basic hand-cream, so not offensive at all, though I would prefer a nice scent were added ( of the lavender or citrus variety, perhaps.)</li>
      <li>It makes my hand feel very soft.</li>
      <li>me smooth hands and my dark</li>
      <li>This is the first product that has actually worked!  </li>
      <li>Not worth the price--could just use cheap jergens, vasoline, or whatever lotion instead.</li>
      <li>My hands are always in water at work and began to look so old, I am 31.</li>
      <li>this hand lotion completely removes age spots on my hands.  </li>
      <li>feet are soft and supple now for the first time in years and it is solely due to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is exactly like every other hand cream with SPF</li>
      <li>I was a bit skeptical at first since I tend to only buy green beauty brands, but this cream is paraben free, and it very sliky and does the trick!</li>
      <li>and I can definitely see a major improvement.  </li>
      <li>It took a couple of applications, no surprise there, but the next day and the days after my feet felt soft and stayed that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of things on these overworked, dry feet of mine, including frequent pedicures and regular application of numerous products, without getting any result like what this lotion does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> As advertised the product is non-greasy and absorbs into the skin without leaving residue which is really nice and difficult to find in other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> This is not moisturizing in the least.  </li>
<li> I have tried a variety of products that are in this price range, in an effort to reduce or eliminate the age spots on my hands (I am in my late 50&#x27;s).  </li>
<li> It is as described and arrived quickly, as usual from Amazon!</li>
<li> I thought I had wasted my money on this expensive product, but not so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> LOVE this cream!!!  It has worked so well on my hands they look like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s again!  I will HAVE to try their other anti-aging products, if they&#x27;re like the hand cream I&#x27;ll be in heaven!!!</li>
    <li> its smoth for hand but I thing it made in USA but I found it made in israel</li>
    <li> As advertised the product is non-greasy and absorbs into the skin without leaving residue which is really nice and difficult to find in other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, after using the lotion for several weeks on my hands I just didn&#x27;t notice the promised younger looking, smooth, supple skin. What I did notice was that the lotion required constant reapplication in order to keep the dry, tight feeling away from my hands and that many other lotions I had on hand were better at keep my hands smooth and hydrated. I thought I had wasted my money on this expensive product, but not so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night I applied the lotion to my forever dry feet. It took a couple of applications, no surprise there, but the next day and the days after my feet felt soft and stayed that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of things on these overworked, dry feet of mine, including frequent pedicures and regular application of numerous products, without getting any result like what this lotion does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are soft and supple now for the first time in years and it is solely due to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-star rating is for the tremendous result when applied to my feet, however it would rate 2 stars based on experience when used on my hands.</li>
    <li> I have using this daily for about one week and can see a difference already. I put it on at night because I really don&#x27;t like the smell of it. It soaks in immediately and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> this hand lotion completely removes age spots on my hands.  This is the first product that does what it states it will do.  I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is so soft and silky, with a delicate and pleasant fragrance. It is as described and arrived quickly, as usual from Amazon! I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my skin is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good hand cream. It doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, but is mostly absorbed within 10 minutes of application. It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy. It has a typical retinol smell, which isn&#x27;t great, but it does suggest that there is quite a bit of retinol in the product. A nice surprise for me is that it fades oncoming freckles and dark spots on your hands. I have very pale skin, so this was a real bonus for me. Good product.</li>
    <li> Cream is nice enough, and good perfume to it, but I noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is the best I have used... and I am a product junkie!  I am in my forties and I was just starting to get an aged appearance to my hands with wrinkles and spots.  I use every night and my skin is much smoother and it moisturizes really well.  It is now a must have for me and I will re order.</li>
    <li> I take very good care of my hands, but the years are creeping up, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles.  This hand cream has subtracted years from the appearance of my hands.  It might seem a little pricey, but very little goes a long way,  It&#x27;s a lovely, non-greasy cream that is absorbed quickly.  It&#x27;s also improved the appearance of my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first since I tend to only buy green beauty brands, but this cream is paraben free, and it very sliky and does the trick! I have it by my nightstand, great for winter time, or dry windy months.</li>
    <li> I am trying to see the good it does for aging skin. Thanks amazon</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best ever it got rid of all my age spots on my hands love it will continue using</li>
    <li> This too was a product on my list of &amp;#34;must-haves&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s thick, has a strong smell that reminds me of my grandmother and doesn&#x27;t seem to rub in as quickly as I like. Not my favorite product but hear it works well.</li>
    <li> My hands are always in water at work and began to look so old, I am 31. I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would see results so fast or at all but within 3days I noticed the difference. AMAZING.... I love this lotion I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my mother and my boss, and of course myself.</li>
    <li> It makes my hand feel very soft. It looks great when I use it on my hands. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price--could just use cheap jergens, vasoline, or whatever lotion instead. Did not notice any difference between this lotion and ordinary lotion even using it several times daily.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of products that are in this price range, in an effort to reduce or eliminate the age spots on my hands (I am in my late 50&#x27;s).  This is the first product that has actually worked!  I have used it for a few months (twice a day, in the morning and evening) and I can definitely see a major improvement.

However, as far as improving my hands, I am totally happy and will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I have used Retinol hand cream and it keeps your hand so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly on my hands for about 3 weeks now, and am definitely seeing a reduction in freckles/age spots (I&#x27;m 47). My hands don&#x27;t seem any softer than usual, but that&#x27;s not really a problem for me. The scent is typical of basic hand-cream, so not offensive at all, though I would prefer a nice scent were added ( of the lavender or citrus variety, perhaps.)</li>
    <li> Not sure how anyone can say this is non-greasy. It&#x27;s a grease slick that doesn&#x27;t absorb, and once the grease evaporates, my hands are just as dry as before.  This is not moisturizing in the least.  It is exactly like every other hand cream with SPF I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The search continues.</li>
    <li> It feels good when I put the hand lotion on but I&#x27;m not sure there are any long term or noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I like this product that I purchased. it&lt;br /&gt;gives me smooth hands and my dark&lt;br /&gt;spots on my hands are starting to&lt;br /&gt;fade.</li>
