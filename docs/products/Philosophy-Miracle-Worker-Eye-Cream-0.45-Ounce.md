      <li>The search for a great paraben free under eye cream continues...</li>
      <li>I really liked the consistency of this cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought it twice since then and will continue to use it until I find it just doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
      <li>I love this product, so to find it at a bargain price, I was thilled.  </li>
      <li>They all seem to take forever to soak  in, or leave a film on top of my skin that beads up and almost seems to peel when I try to apply foundation...</li>
      <li>Hope this helps someone! :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love all Philosophy products, but I found the Miracle Worker eye cream to increase wrinkles and puffiness and had to discontinue using it after 2 months.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty surprising since many do change how my makeup applies &amp; burn my eyes.</li>
      <li>The cream is rich and easily absorbs into the surrounding eye area nicely.  </li>
      <li>This is a very gentle, yet effective eye cream.  </li>
      <li>It has erased any fine lines around the corners of my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, I feel like I need to use a lot of product to get coverage.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I only use it once a day, so maybe I&#x27;d have had better results if I had used it more??</li>
      <li>Nice, but honestly there are richer creams out there...just hard to find in pump-form.</li>
      <li>so when I check out amazon I was thrilled to find it at such an inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>and this is powerful stuff.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited about this one, and to be honest it was the first time that I really forked over the money for a so-called &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for my dark circles.</li>
      <li>but this stuff really does work!</li>
      <li>As with all philosophy products they actually do what they say they will:)</li>
      <li>but I must admit that the first time I tried this product I burned my eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is a good, everyday eye cream.</li>
      <li>Very little is needed also, so the product lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to be allergic to most products, but this one I can use twice daily with no problems.</li>
      <li>Me Retinoid Night Treatment at the same time as this &amp; neither have improved the fine lines on my skin.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product, but a little shiny.</li>
      <li>I was using it too much</li>
      <li>I have never found an eye cream that really works  </li>
      <li>I really regret for this purchase.</li>
      <li>I already bought the whole miracle worker set to give to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not so dark that I can&#x27;t cover them with concealer, but I bought this in the hopes that I&#x27;d be able to wake up one morning and not wear any makeup at all.</li>
      <li>and if I&#x27;m lucky enough to find it I have to mix the product as the lotion has separated from the liquid.</li>
      <li>My skin is fair and sensitive, so I would not recommend this product if your skin is really delicate and tends toward dryness.</li>
      <li>I do think the price is too high, but that is the case with all Philosophy products.</li>
      <li>Love that it comes in pump-form, when you put your fingers into those little pot&#x27;s, it weakens the eye cream a little more each time.</li>
      <li>Great product but the portion size is laughable.</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t find it worth the cost</li>
      <li>This little bottle has really helped get rid of that problem and seems to be helping with the darkness and fine lines.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is miraculous and I cannot live without it.  </li>
      <li>Arrived timely however it was not packaged in a philosophy box and the product is old.</li>
      <li>Old product.</li>
      <li>I already use their cleanser, serum, and moisturizer and it helps my oily, congested, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use in conjunction with the Miracle Worker mouisturizer and it sinks right in and plumps the skin.</li>
      <li>I love Philosophy products and have been using them for the past several years.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it has too much water in the product (which I learned can actually DRY out your skin) and also for sensitive skin like mine, doesn&#x27;t burn after days or weeks of using it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product compared to some others that may be more expensive.</li>
      <li>I loved this for the first few days and really thought I&#x27;d found a miracle, as promised -- until this morning, after maybe two weeks of use, when I woke up with painful, itchy, burning and swollen skin.</li>
      <li>I have about 10 bottles of creams/gels I have already tried to use under my eyes, they are all barely used and under my sink.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly, and I noticed that the skin under my eyes was smoother after using it, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles as far as those under-eye lines go.</li>
      <li>(and lots of others have broken me out)It takes about 3-5 minutes to absorb and it completely vanishes into my skin, immediately I noticed a lightening effect under my eyes and a softening of the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover my dark circles or help with wrinkles as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>I use mineral make-up because of my sensitive skin and have always had problems with the powder looking cakey or dry around my eyes.</li>
      <li>It is not a cure all and does not have the same effect that cosmetic surgery might, but it does help to lift the droopy eye and generally brighten and open your eyes to make them look bigger and younger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 35 &amp; really don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but under my eyes is very dark &amp; when I wear makeup</li>

<li> I was given samples of the Miracle eye cream along with a few others that are even more expensive, and I felt that this one did the trick to adequately moisturize, tighten and decrease the dark circles &amp; puffiness</li>
<li> Dark circles under my eyes have faded completely after one month.  </li>
<li> It makes the fine lines around my eyes look so much worse!  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, but this eye cream made the skin around my eyes so dry, puffy, and flaky.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t see any changes yet, but hopefully will in the long run.</li>
<li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have been looking for something to help with dryness around my eyes and maybe help prevent crows feet as long as I can.</li>
<li> I hate to sound like one of those hawkers who claim they can turn a 50 year old into a 25 year old in 10 minutes</li>
<li> Other than moisturizing my eye area, I don&#x27;t see any advantage to a lesser priced product.  </li>
<li> and my skin is still dry and flaky.  </li>
<li> I had to post a one star rating but it doesn&#x27;t deserve a single star.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to their Eye Hope as I think it helped my dark circles vs this one.</li>
<li> I use a small brush to apply near the inside corners of my eyes.  </li>
<li> But as I did get older, I had increasing &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; eyelid and my eyes just looked plain old tired.</li>
<li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have very few wrinkles and minimal sun damage to begin with but was starting to have an issue below the left eye.</li>
<li> I like the product, it works, but apply carefully.</li>
<li> But be careful not to get any product in your eyes.  </li>
<li> I never experienced this much caking with other eye creams I have used.  </li>
<li> (I thought that would help the crepey thin skin), tan colored, and glides on pretty well, but it does not burn my eyes, or cause my makeup to run or stick unevenly.</li>
<li> I have used this product in the past but this burned the skin around my eyes, wish I could get my money back!</li>
<li> but you really only need a small pump for both eyes</li>
<li> and if you are careful, it will last at least a couple of months.</li>
<li> My skin is not sensitive and I don&#x27;t have any problem with eye cream products usually.  </li>
<li> , dark circles  </li>
<li> My dark circles are hereditary, and all the water and sleep in the world don&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
<li> product does nothing to lighten dark circles or decrease bags.</li>
<li> The cream is thick and a little goes a long way for me.</li>
<li> Used it all in a little over a week</li>
<li> A little dab will do ya.  </li>
<li> Maybe it has helped a little, but I wouldn&#x27;t invest in it again.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not habitually pump heavy.</li>
<li> I could see results after a few days.  </li>
<li> it looks very dry, thin &amp; crepey in the inside corner of my eyes.</li>
<li> I was amazed at how small the bottle is</li>
<li> I usually have every day.</li>
<li> I usually buy this in person and have used it for quite awhile (at least 7-8 purchases).  </li>
<li> Nothing negative to report about this product.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t have anything negative to report about the product itself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a dedicated Philosophy girl but I must admit that the first time I tried this product I burned my eyes.  It turns out it wasn&#x27;t the product&#x27;s fault, it was mine.  I was using it too much and this is powerful stuff.  After being unable to find another product that did was I was seeking, I tried it again.  Baam!  A little dab will do ya.  This eye cream is miraculous and I cannot live without it.  I am only 36 but I am a dedicated Philosophy girl and this eye cream keeps me looking like I&#x27;m in my 20s.  Thank you Philosophy!</li>
    <li> I usually buy this in person and have used it for quite awhile (at least 7-8 purchases).  What I ordered from this company online was NOT the same...it was not the same consistency (almost like water) or the same color.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The eye cream was separated, ? expired? I have used this product in the past but this burned the skin around my eyes, wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> Nothing negative to report about this product. It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly, and I noticed that the skin under my eyes was smoother after using it, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles as far as those under-eye lines go. I do think the price is too high, but that is the case with all Philosophy products.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely however it was not packaged in a philosophy box and the product is old. It is runny and when I try to use it liquid squirts out across the room and if I&#x27;m lucky enough to find it I have to mix the product as the lotion has separated from the liquid. Even then it is watery (won&#x27;t mix) and provides no hydration. Can&#x27;t use it. Terrible purchase. Old product. I had to post a one star rating but it doesn&#x27;t deserve a single star. 😔</li>
    <li> I had been introduced to this product at Sephora while I was shopping for face lotions, eye creams and makeup for my wedding. I was given samples of the Miracle eye cream along with a few others that are even more expensive, and I felt that this one did the trick to adequately moisturize, tighten and decrease the dark circles &amp; puffiness I usually have every day. The cream is thick and a little goes a long way for me. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it has too much water in the product (which I learned can actually DRY out your skin) and also for sensitive skin like mine, doesn&#x27;t burn after days or weeks of using it. I would highly recommend this product compared to some others that may be more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great product but the portion size is laughable. Used it all in a little over a week and I&#x27;m not habitually pump heavy. Personally, I don&#x27;t find it worth the cost but I don&#x27;t have anything negative to report about the product itself. I would suggest splurging for the bigger size.</li>
    <li> I had been receiving this cream from another retailer on the auto-delivery plan. The price on Amazon is excellent.  The cream is rich and easily absorbs into the surrounding eye area nicely.  It has eliminated the crepey skin below my left eye as well as increasing the firmness.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and have very few wrinkles and minimal sun damage to begin with but was starting to have an issue below the left eye. I have very sensitive skin and tend to be allergic to most products, but this one I can use twice daily with no problems. Very little is needed also, so the product lasts a good while.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this has made any difference for me.  Maybe it has helped a little, but I wouldn&#x27;t invest in it again.</li>
    <li> I really liked the consistency of this cream.  Its hydrating and creamy without being oily.  However, it does not wear well with makeup.  I found my concealer underneath my eyes would cake alot.  I never experienced this much caking with other eye creams I have used.  Was hoping for this to work since I do like philosophy&#x27;s skincare, but I will not be reordering this one.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, no fragrance, and absorbs well for me. I use it daily along with Philosophy Eye &amp; Lip Firming Cream(which is a lot heavier)&lt;br /&gt;The combo works for me.</li>
    <li> As with all philosophy products they actually do what they say they will:)</li>
    <li> Great product.  One I use every night.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this one, and to be honest it was the first time that I really forked over the money for a so-called &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for my dark circles. My dark circles are hereditary, and all the water and sleep in the world don&#x27;t make a difference. They&#x27;re not so dark that I can&#x27;t cover them with concealer, but I bought this in the hopes that I&#x27;d be able to wake up one morning and not wear any makeup at all. False.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does nothing to lighten dark circles or decrease bags. It&#x27;s just a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I hated the consistency of this eye cream.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, but a little shiny. Don&#x27;t see any changes yet, but hopefully will in the long run.</li>
    <li> Excellent product . Dark circles under my eyes have faded completely after one month.  I could see results after a few days.  But be careful not to get any product in your eyes.  I use a small brush to apply near the inside corners of my eyes.  Do not use on your eye lids.  Many have experienced irritation if the product gets I touches the membranes inside the eye..including me.  I like the product, it works, but apply carefully.</li>
    <li> I am now 74 and the miracles are over for me  I have never found an eye cream that really works  takes away the lines, dark circles  There just comes a time when  nothing works  If it did  It would be a miracle</li>
    <li> I love all Philosophy products, but I found the Miracle Worker eye cream to increase wrinkles and puffiness and had to discontinue using it after 2 months.  I assume it&#x27;s because of the retinol.  My skin is fair and sensitive, so I would not recommend this product if your skin is really delicate and tends toward dryness.</li>
    <li> I guess i bought  the wrong reasons. I still have the shadows under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Probably i need something different.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this product again.  It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, I feel like I need to use a lot of product to get coverage.  Other than moisturizing my eye area, I don&#x27;t see any advantage to a lesser priced product.  I do like the container.  I do not like to have to put my fingers in face care products.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any life changing...er skin firming, wrinkle erasing or crepey undereye skin changing results. I&#x27;m 35 &amp; really don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but under my eyes is very dark &amp; when I wear makeup it looks very dry, thin &amp; crepey in the inside corner of my eyes. This stuff is very thick &amp; moisturizing (I thought that would help the crepey thin skin), tan colored, and glides on pretty well, but it does not burn my eyes, or cause my makeup to run or stick unevenly. That&#x27;s pretty surprising since many do change how my makeup applies &amp; burn my eyes. I only use it once a day, so maybe I&#x27;d have had better results if I had used it more?? Even still I thought the retinoid product would do something for me. I started using Help Me Retinoid Night Treatment at the same time as this &amp; neither have improved the fine lines on my skin. I&#x27;ll probably go back to their Eye Hope as I think it helped my dark circles vs this one.</li>
    <li> I like Philosophy products, always, but for some reason this burned my eyes.  Very sorry about that because I wanted an eye product.</li>
    <li> Bad product. Spoiled or expired. Product was discolored, runny and yellow looking. Prompt refund.</li>
    <li> Love that it comes in pump-form, when you put your fingers into those little pot&#x27;s, it weakens the eye cream a little more each time. The pump helps maintain the strength of the product. Nice, but honestly there are richer creams out there...just hard to find in pump-form. Arrived quickly. THANX</li>
    <li> I bought this cream about two weeks ago, because I had heard rave reviews about the Miracle Worker line. I already use their cleanser, serum, and moisturizer and it helps my oily, congested, sensitive skin.I am in my 30&#x27;s and have been looking for something to help with dryness around my eyes and maybe help prevent crows feet as long as I can. I have about 10 bottles of creams/gels I have already tried to use under my eyes, they are all barely used and under my sink. They all seem to take forever to soak  in, or leave a film on top of my skin that beads up and almost seems to peel when I try to apply foundation...Not this one. It has an oily/silky feel to it, but doesn&#x27;t break me out around my eyes. (and lots of others have broken me out)It takes about 3-5 minutes to absorb and it completely vanishes into my skin, immediately I noticed a lightening effect under my eyes and a softening of the fine lines around my eyes. I use mineral make-up because of my sensitive skin and have always had problems with the powder looking cakey or dry around my eyes. This little bottle has really helped get rid of that problem and seems to be helping with the darkness and fine lines. I love it. I already bought the whole miracle worker set to give to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. Hope this helps someone! :)[[ASIN:B00021C1NG Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser, 8 Ounce]][[ASIN:B000Z5Y2XQ Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer, All Skin Types, 2 Ounce]][[ASIN:B00C6IDNGC Philosophy Hope in a Jar Night Intensive Retexturizing Moisturizer 12ml/0.4fl oz.

    <li> I have tried it for almost 2 months. After applying this eye cream, I felt stinging on my eyelids. My skin is not sensitive and I don&#x27;t have any problem with eye cream products usually.  Really disappointed for a product with such a price tag. I really regret for this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to believe in systems to &amp;#34;reduce aging&amp;#34; and all the claims made by cosmetic companies that their formula is &amp;#34;clinically proven&amp;#34; to make you look 20 years younger in 2 days....blah, blah, blah. But as I did get older, I had increasing &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; eyelid and my eyes just looked plain old tired. So, finally, in desperation, I asked a friend of mine who has some credibility if she knew of anything that could help. She recommended Miracle Worker Eye cream so I went to Sephora and bought it for $60.00. I was amazed at how small the bottle is but you really only need a small pump for both eyes and if you are careful, it will last at least a couple of months. I hate to sound like one of those hawkers who claim they can turn a 50 year old into a 25 year old in 10 minutes but this stuff really does work! It is not a cure all and does not have the same effect that cosmetic surgery might, but it does help to lift the droopy eye and generally brighten and open your eyes to make them look bigger and younger. I noticed a difference within 2 weeks. When it ran out, I did not buy another one but my eyes soon went back to looking like they did before. I hated spending the $$ at Sephora so when I check out amazon I was thrilled to find it at such an inexpensive price. I&#x27;ve bought it twice since then and will continue to use it until I find it just doesn&#x27;t work any more. I don&#x27;t see that happening soon. I also tried the &amp;#34;When Hope is Not Enough&amp;#34; serum and I give that 5 stars too. Philosophy makes good products that do what they say they will.</li>
    <li> I love this product, so to find it at a bargain price, I was thilled.  Great product at a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle, yet effective eye cream.  I use in conjunction with the Miracle Worker mouisturizer and it sinks right in and plumps the skin. It is not greasy and no unpleasent smell.  It has erased any fine lines around the corners of my eyes.  I use this both for day and night. Philosophy products work well when used together.  I will continue to buy these from Amazon as I do find good deals and shipping is always so propmt.</li>
    <li> I loved this for the first few days and really thought I&#x27;d found a miracle, as promised -- until this morning, after maybe two weeks of use, when I woke up with painful, itchy, burning and swollen skin. Really not attractive or miraculous. I used it only once a day (at night) instead of twice daily as recommended. I think it&#x27;s much too harsh for the eye area.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, but this eye cream made the skin around my eyes so dry, puffy, and flaky.  I continue to use it, because I know sometimes that is what happens when skin is adjusting to a retinol product.  It&#x27;s now been almost a month and my skin is still dry and flaky.  It makes the fine lines around my eyes look so much worse!  Someone please tell me this will go away.  I want to continue using it, as the claims say it will do wonders.  I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena retinol eye creams and the dryness and flaking did not occur with those.  Did anyone else experience this?</li>
    <li> Has a very good non-greasy moisturizing texture. Doesn&#x27;t cover my dark circles or help with wrinkles as much as I would like. The search for a great paraben free under eye cream continues...</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products and have been using them for the past several years. This is a good, everyday eye cream.</li>
