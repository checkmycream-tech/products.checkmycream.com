    <li> I do like these brushes.  I gave them four stars because they bristles are a little on the soft side.  They&#x27;re nice for scrubbing skin, but not quite tough enough to get all dirt underneath the nail after gardening.  Despite that, I do like these they will be gentle enough to use on my feet.</li>
    <li> I like the handles on these--they are designed in such a way that the brush doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand when your hands are all wet and soapy.  If I could change one thing, it would be to make the bristles a bit stiffer.  I have to work pretty hard to get stuff out from under my nails.</li>
    <li> When I opened these, I hated the quality.&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to buy any more nail brush because I use purell every day and I do nail care every week.</li>
    <li> nothing special, i like the soft bristles</li>
    <li> I took a chance on these brushes for garden fingernail cleaning brushes and they don&#x27;t do the the trick.  I was looking for a brush with stiffer bristles. Decent brushes for a light use, but I don&#x27;t have too many uses for that.</li>
    <li> Good Value. Soft enough not to hurt your nails. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Wanted the bristles to be harder.  Not good for getting dirt out from under nails.</li>
    <li> great brush for nails and other things...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
    <li> I wanted some nail brushes for my kichen sink, my laundry room and thought I would stick one in our guest room bath.  Here in Kauai we have our famous &amp;#34;red dirt&amp;#34;, you can&#x27;t come inside our house from out in the yard without it!!  LOL  These are cute, and will get the job done.  Cheap little brushes, just nothing to write home about.  But what do you want for the price.</li>
    <li> Bristles are Too soft for a  nail brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Arrived new in package.</li>
    <li> Great price for three of these.  Not abrasive for even little fingers.  Very pleased and would recommend this nice item.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, soft nail brush, nicely  made, BUT . . . I use for cleaning garden hands, and the brush is just not stiff enough to do this well. Need stiffer bristles to get under nails also. For a generic hand scrub, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Working in the oil and gas industry, it isn&#x27;t always possible to keep my nails clean.  These brushes remove all the nastiness left at the end of the day and the 3 pack allows me to keep one with me at work and two at home when I finally do get some days off.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised fast delivery thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very good nail brush and an incredible deal at $5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are great for scrubbing your hands, and will clean your nails.  However, if you need this for getting real Impacted dirt out, first clean with a file, then use this.  Otherwise, get yourself a stronger bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushes came in the colors shown, and I am very happy with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disapointed . I thought. I&#x27;d receive 3 blue as the photo display&#x27;s. I chose these as there was no statement about color substitution like other ads had clearly stated. I received purple ,yellow &amp; white.</li>
    <li> they work fine  great product</li>
    <li> I USE THESE TO CLEAN MY DOG&#x27;S STUFFED TOYS AND THEY&#x27;RE GREAT.THE BRUSHES ARE FIRM ENOUGH FOR SCRUBBING YET SOFT ENOUGH TO AVOID TEARING THE TOY.PACK OF 3 COMES IN HANDY ALSO.</li>
