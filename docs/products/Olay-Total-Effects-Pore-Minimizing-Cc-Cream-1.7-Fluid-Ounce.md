      <li>It&#x27;s great and has sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>The coverage is nice, the color was perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>This is great.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Well, this product stayed on great and still looks good.</li>
      <li>As someone who has oily skin, moisturizers are not always a good thing.</li>
      <li>My wife thought this was a good product.</li>
      <li>But when I got home from work and looked in the mirror, I noticed that my face looked surprisingly good for the end of a workday.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t have any acne (which is a good thing)</li>
      <li>You know when you buy Olay that you are getting a good product.</li>
      <li>I used fair to medium.    </li>
      <li>Great product, makes my skin look airbrushed and flawless and seems like my skin looks brighter and more even toned ever since I started using it :)</li>
      <li>I have been using a covergirl+olay which is working good for hiding pores and some imperfections.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin but decided to try the Light to Medium color</li>
      <li>, I felt like I was smoothing on a moisturizer, I wasn&#x27;t happy so on top of it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased I tried this.</li>

      <li>think this is a good product and will make a nice addition to my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>It feels good (isn&#x27;t too greasy), and makes her skin feel nice.</li>
      <li>It matches my skin  perfectly - I am quite fair -  when blended in and it certainly evens out my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light, pleasant scent of coconut or something tropical.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I should try this for a week with out using moisturizer first !!!!    </li>
      <li>I am so impressed with the results that I have gotten from this CC Cream that I have already recommended it to one person (my secretary), and I certainly would not hesitate to tell others about it.</li>
      <li>I am so impressed with the results that I have gotten from this CC Cream that I have already recommended it to one person (my secretary), and I certainly would not hesitate to tell others about it.husband for his opinion.  </li>
      <li>CC cream has a nice texture and fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice level of moisturing without being too shiny.</li>
      <li>But, to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any difference between the two products.  </li>
      <li>but I did not notice a remarkable reduction in minimizing fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
      <li>, I am really impressed with this particular one.</li>
      <li>Even when a product looks good in the morning, it rarely looks good at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how nice my face looked!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light feeling and blends well into skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I would use continue to use, not to out of sight in price, very comfortable wear.</li>
      <li>I use it as a very light coverup when I don&#x27;t want to put on makeup.  </li>
      <li>I now have a very smooth finish to my skin</li>
      <li>I love Olay products.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it,</li>
      <li>I have tried many facial/beauty products and I have to say that I was very impressed with the result of this Olay Total Effects cream.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>They’re okay — and in fact, the Olay one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>She told me it went on well but to be sure u wash it off otherwise</li>
      <li>It was ok but didn&#x27;t minimize my pores instead made them more noticeable</li>
      <li>have since experimented with using this product more.  </li>
      <li>have since experimented with using this product more.  </li>
      <li>But I reccomend this if you&#x27;re fair-skinned and looking to have a bit more color on your face</li>
      <li>I love that it has SPF protection.  </li>
      <li>I will be reordering this for sure.</li>
      <li>This product needs more coverage power to hide anything.</li>
      <li>As for pore minimizing, I have grand canyons for pores</li>
      <li>The scent is OK but too perfume like for me although it isn&#x27;t strong and I don&#x27;t smell it any more once it is on.</li>
      <li>pretty good, I don&#x27;t wear any make up besides this cream.</li>
      <li>However, as a facial cream it&#x27;s excellent, and leaves the face feeling smooth and mostly non-greasy afterwards.</li>
      <li>The cream was listed as light/medium, but I would say it tends more towards the light side.  </li>
      <li>Wow- this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Gives lovely light to medium coverage, sun protection, and a bit of optical blurring over pores and lines.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product offers great foundation type of coverage while minimizing pores.  </li>
      <li>Nice cream which gives light coverage and moisture when you don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup on and want quick application.</li>
      <li>It was easy to blend in, and didn&#x27;t make me look like I had a lot of makeup on.</li>
      <li>I like the scent, and it faded away very quickly --</li>
      <li>It is really easy to apply and i like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get streaky, as I&#x27;ve had that problem with foundation before.</li>
      <li>am very pleased with this Olay product and recommend it very highly.</li>
      <li>would say this is really only good as a sunblock and only for girls with nearly perfect skin to begin with.</li>
      <li>I have been a huge fan of the BB cream movement.</li>
      <li>Adding this to my routine made a huge difference in looking polished and even toned.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, does not irritate my skin, and feels light.  </li>
      <li>As I said the color is light,.</li>
      <li>sample was “light to medium.”</li>
      <li>This CC cream blends well and provides light coverage.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy despite having combination skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest, after applying the product in the morning, I really didn&#x27;t think about it during the day.  </li>
      <li>It went on quick and easy.</li>
      <li>when I got this yesterday I was excited to try this</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll stay with my original Olay CC cream.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>It provides SPF protection all day long which is great.  </li>
      <li>Then a quick brush over with lightly tinted powder, if you like, and you’re out the door, looking like you didn’t apply anything at all —</li>
      <li>I already use Olay CC cream and have been very pleased with it, so when I saw that there was another Olay product which was a CC cream, but which additionally provided broad spectrum spf 15 protection, I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so easy to use that I can use it when I take the dog for a walk or if I&#x27;m just running to the corner dry cleaner and instead of hoping I don&#x27;t meet anyone i can feel good about the way I look.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that provides full coverage, you will need to apply this under your day to day foundation as the cream alone will not cover scars or blemishes.  </li>
      <li>But they’re still heavier, shinier, and more opaque than I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, and any time I can find a product that does double duty (moisturize + SPF) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell how well it conceals; whether it could go straight over or if you would need to use a concealer along with it in order to cover up any zits.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>Even though my skin is pretty good, I had to wear something on top of this (Bare Minerals Ready Foundation)</li>
      <li>If scents bother you, this does have a smell, but it is mild and does not remind me of sunscreen at all.  </li>
      <li>- I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference, but otherwise I love this cream and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>This would be good for someone without imperfections that just wants to enhance their natural skin.</li>
      <li>The formula does an adequate job of evening the appearance of skin tone, hydrating skin and enhancing brightness</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and the fragrance is pretty light.</li>
      <li>This is a good tinted moisturizer/light foundation, as long as you don&#x27;t mind that it is scented.</li>
      <li>But this looks very natural while still making my face look a bit more glowy.</li>
      <li>That said, this is a very good cream, even by comparison, and I can see myself using it, at least occassonally.</li>
      <li>This cream provides SPF-15 protection, which isn&#x27;t much if you spend a significant amount of time outdoors.</li>
      <li>I have use before another brand that was pricier, and I noticed a difference right away, but not with the Olay.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a primer under my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Light to medium color is suitable for my NW25 skin.</li>
      <li>The slight redness on my chin and around my nose still looked fairly noticeable.</li>
      <li>It feels light and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>This cream gives my skin very light coverage that is just enough to even out my skin tone and help conceal redness.</li>

<ol>
    <li> My new go to foundation/CC cream.  It goes on smoothly, does not irritate my skin, and feels light.  Love this.  On my second tube.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects Pore Minimizing CC Cream works just as advertised. I saw a noticeable reduction in the pores on my face. I have always had big pores, and wear base to try to cover them up. Because of my big pores, my makeup has never looked smooth on my face. I apply the Olay and after a couple of minutes I apply my base. I now have a very smooth finish to my skin - looks so much better!&lt;br /&gt;My skin also feels very soft. I definitely recommend this CC Cream for everyday use!</li>
    <li> As for a CC  cream, I like it, it&#x27;s thick but spreads so evenly with fingers or brush.  As for pore minimizing, I have grand canyons for pores and I don&#x27;t notice a pore minimizing effect unless I use a matte primer, but that would minimize pores even if I didn&#x27;t use any foundation.  The coverage is nice, the color was perfect for me.  It certainly didn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use continue to use, not to out of sight in price, very comfortable wear.</li>
    <li> This is great.  I don&#x27;t have large pores but I decided to try  this for make up.  I had hope it would be similar to BB cream which I have been using and liking, and it is.  It matches my skin  perfectly - I am quite fair -  when blended in and it certainly evens out my skin tone.  I look better and younger with it on, a little glow even, and as a bonus its sunscreen is helping to prevent future wrinkles from forming.</li>
    <li> This cream gives my skin very light coverage that is just enough to even out my skin tone and help conceal redness. It is light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy despite having combination skin. I like using it for everyday wear because it will give me the added bonus of the SPF and at the same time help minimize the appearance of my pores.</li>
    <li> Feels silky going on, almost oily, but not quite. I use it as a very light coverup when I don&#x27;t want to put on makeup.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works, something about how the light reflects off of it, but does make my skin look smoother, more even.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will make a long term difference.  You can wear it under makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  It does make it feel softer and smoother to the touch.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if not for the initial oily feel. That does go away with a little time.</li>
    <li> I already use Olay CC cream and have been very pleased with it, so when I saw that there was another Olay product which was a CC cream, but which additionally provided broad spectrum spf 15 protection, I decided to try it.  But, to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any difference between the two products.  And, I really don&#x27;t like the advertising that claims to have &amp;#34;instantly reduced the look of pores in 80% of women.&amp;#34;  Too much hype in my opinion so I&#x27;ll stay with my original Olay CC cream.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin but decided to try the Light to Medium color and it is very forgiving in that sense. It&#x27;s also provides extremely sheer coverage, which is probably why I was able to get away with this shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color correcting &#x27;CC&#x27; aspects, I didn&#x27;t see much. The slight redness on my chin and around my nose still looked fairly noticeable. The pore minimizing benefits also appeared completely negligible (I vastly prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Pore Vanisher Cream). I also didn&#x27;t love how heavy it felt on my skin.  Even though my skin is pretty good, I had to wear something on top of this (Bare Minerals Ready Foundation) and it ended up looking very cakey--which never happens with Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is really only good as a sunblock and only for girls with nearly perfect skin to begin with.</li>
    <li> Although I wear makeup daily (yes, even on weekends!), I don&#x27;t tend to wear foundation or any other type of \\&quot;base\\&quot; layer, partly because my skin is oily/sensitive to breakouts, and partly because I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of a lot of product covering my entire face.  On holidays, special occasions, and other times when I want a bit more polished look, I will take the extra step for more coverage--either traditional foundation, a tinted moisturizer, or more recently, a BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried a CC cream before, but reading the description, it sounded pretty similar to the BB creams I&#x27;ve been using of late.  I was especially attracted to the \\&quot;pore minimizing\\&quot; claims, as large pores are a particular issue for me, and I liked that this product was oil-free and included SPF as well.  On the other hand, I was a bit concerned about the \\&quot;Light to Medium\\&quot; shade, as I consider myself to be more towards medium.  However, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay CC Cream arrived during a week that I was sick with a bad cold and not sleeping well.  Although I wouldn&#x27;t normally wear this type of product as part of my workday makeup, I thought my illness-impacted appearance could probably use a little bit of a boost, so I decided to try this product.  Upon first squeezing the product out of the tube, I was worried about how thick the product seemed.  However, once I applied it to my face, it was surprisingly easy to blend and didn&#x27;t feel heavy and all.  I thought that the product smelled very faintly of cucumber, which is a scent I usually dislike, but it was so subtle that it didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, after applying the product in the morning, I really didn&#x27;t think about it during the day.  But when I got home from work and looked in the mirror, I noticed that my face looked surprisingly good for the end of a workday.  At first, I didn&#x27;t remember what was different, but then I did--I used the Olay CC Cream that morning!  I even asked my husband for his opinion.  He said that I looked how I do when I leave the house in the a.m., but that&#x27;s just the point--usually, by the end of the day, I DON&#x27;T look like that anymore, as my skin tends to become shiny and oily, and my makeup wears off as a result.  Instead, after using this CC Cream, my skin looked matte and even, and my makeup looked completely fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since experimented with using this product more.  I have found that it works well for both spot- and full-face coverage.  I am so impressed with the results that I have gotten from this CC Cream that I have already recommended it to one person (my secretary), and I certainly would not hesitate to tell others about it.husband for his opinion.

Instead, after using this CC Cream, my skin looked matte and even, and my makeup looked completely fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since experimented with using this product more.  I have found that it works well for both spot- and full-face coverage.  I am so impressed with the results that I have gotten from this CC Cream that I have already recommended it to one person (my secretary), and I certainly would not hesitate to tell others about it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, this stuff is great.  Most CC creams are too dry with too much color or not enough coverage or they smell bad.  I even tried the Olay type with the swirls of color but it was too oily and not enough color.  I was tired of wasting money so I relied on reviews and bought this type.  It&#x27;s great and has sunscreen.  It really does minimize pores and improve color.</li>
    <li> This product offers great foundation type of coverage while minimizing pores.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 2 weeks now and can see a visible difference on my face.  Even small lines and wrinkles disappear when wearing this cream.  Unfortunately they come back when I was my face.  Would definitely buy this product, but as long as they continue (Olay) to make Regenerist - I&#x27;ll probably not change over.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife to try out. She likes it. It feels good (isn&#x27;t too greasy), and makes her skin feel nice. She didn&#x27;t notice any change in her pores, but maybe she&#x27;ll need to use it for a little longer. This cream provides SPF-15 protection, which isn&#x27;t much if you spend a significant amount of time outdoors.</li>
    <li> You know when you buy Olay that you are getting a good product. CC cream has a nice texture and fragrance. Nice cream which gives light coverage and moisture when you don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup on and want quick application. Use this when I am out and about on the weekends when I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on making up my face. Be advised that coverage is sheer.</li>
    <li> pretty good, I don&#x27;t wear any make up besides this cream. I have large pores in my nose, it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This truly does make pores tighten up and look smaller. I was amazed. The color blends in well with my skin (light to medium) without being heavy. Nice level of moisturing without being too shiny. Goes on creamy. The squeeze bottle is easy to handle and isn&#x27;t wasteful -- and it&#x27;s bigger than Ithought it might be. Very pleased.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Not bad. I like this CC cream because it doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It&#x27;s quite lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is very sheer, but enough to even out complexion. I use it as a primer under my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Light to medium color is suitable for my NW25 skin. The undertones are both pink and yellow, the color of the cream is beige.</li>
    <li> This is a good tinted moisturizer/light foundation, as long as you don&#x27;t mind that it is scented. I like the scent, and it faded away very quickly -- but I know some people don&#x27;t like to use anything with fragrance on their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it really minimizes pores; I don&#x27;t really have very visible pores to begin with. It was easy to blend in, and didn&#x27;t make me look like I had a lot of makeup on. I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> It fills in the pores of my 72 yr old face and gives it a glow without being greasy and shiny. It&#x27;s the only foundation I need.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective its pore minimizing effects are, because first, I don&#x27;t have a problem with pores, and second, I have probably not used it long enough to be able to say for sure. However, as a facial cream it&#x27;s excellent, and leaves the face feeling smooth and mostly non-greasy afterwards. As a regular cream I use Oil of Olay Complete, and just on grounds of cost I do not see a reason to change. That said, this is a very good cream, even by comparison, and I can see myself using it, at least occassonally.</li>
    <li> My wife thought this was a good product. She told me it went on well but to be sure u wash it off otherwise itll leave marks on the pillow.</li>
    <li> Heard about this product yesterday and bought it today. I paid much more at my local drugstore than the listed Amazon price, so next time I purchase this, and I will purchase it again, it will definitely be from Amazon. I am just now reading and hearing about AA, BB and CC products and I have to say, I am really impressed with this particular one. I have fair skin (blonde hair, blue eyes) with pinkish to red undertones and am very greasy, even though I&#x27;m middle-aged. Even when a product looks good in the morning, it rarely looks good at the end of the day. Well, this product stayed on great and still looks good. I purchased the light to medium and used it in place of my regular foundation. I liked the consistency of it, which was relatively thin and the fragrance, which was not overpowering and went away rather quickly. For me this will take the place of my primer and foundation - at least for now. We&#x27;ll see how well this works once the humid Mississippi summer is upon us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41yrs. Old and I usually wear a full coverage foundation,so when I got this yesterday I was excited to try this I just recently started wearing phycisians formula super cc cream and I absolutely love it, to me it has the coverage of a medium foundation with the added benefit of spf 30,so today I tried this for the first time and wow I was really disappointed it gave me no coverage at all, I felt like I was smoothing on a moisturizer, I wasn&#x27;t happy so on top of it I put on my phycisians formula B.B.powder and WOW!!!! I was pleasantly surprised at how nice my face looked!!!!!! I was initially going to return this product first thing in the morning but not anymore this is a keeper, I&#x27;ll use it underneath my base as a primer, actually this product has alot of ingredients that are good for my skin, especially the vitamin B3 being the third ingredient and the added sun protection, so right now I&#x27;m praying that it doesn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin break out, I will update if that happens, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t like foundation this is a great product, but for someone who does it really makes your skin glow as a primer underneath a foundation. I&#x27;m very pleased I tried this.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this brand for years and she just loves it.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products. Regenerist is my go-to moisturizer and one of the few beauty products that does what it claims on the box. This CC Cream - not so much. I was hoping for the pore minimizing effect, not the other 6 claims, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old woman with normal to dry skin.  I usually buy foundation for fair skin, and this worked well for me.  little darker than what I usually wear, but blended fine with my skin tone, no weird demarcations at jaw line.  Prior to using this, my go-to foundation was Neutrogena pore minimizing foundation.  This product is similar in quality to that, or to Clinique or Almay, which I also have used.  I like the squeeze tube.  You don&#x27;t need much, and the product goes on smoothly, not too heavy.  It has a very light, pleasant scent of coconut or something tropical.  It does help minimize pores and small imperfections, without looking too made up.  I felt that my skin looked a little better than usual, and my daughter agreed.  I will likely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This CC cream blends well and provides light coverage. The formula is not oily, sticky, or gritty.  The cream does not feel heavy and does not weigh your skin down.  There is a slight scent so if you prefer something fragrance free, this may not be the right cream for you.  The formula does an adequate job of evening the appearance of skin tone, hydrating skin and enhancing brightness but I did not notice a remarkable reduction in minimizing fine lines or wrinkles. The cream also aids in minimizing the appearance of large pores but did not absolutely minimize the look of my pores.  I saw about 40-50% improvement in the size of my pores.  If you are looking for something that provides full coverage, you will need to apply this under your day to day foundation as the cream alone will not cover scars or blemishes.  Therefore, I use the CC Cream before applying foundation.  Compared with using foundation alone, I feel that my skin looks brighter and firmer.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of the BB cream movement. I have tried dozens of different BB creams and when I first learned of CC creams, I was excited to try them too. After trying a few of them, I realized that the main difference between BB and CC creams are that CC creams have moisturizer. As someone who has oily skin, moisturizers are not always a good thing. I have tried several CC creams since they became popular and this Olay Total Effects is the first one that did not make my skin oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Beauty Blender to apply the Olay Total Effects Pore Minimizing CC cream. It went on quick and easy. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my skin. My only issue with this cream is that the coverage is super light. I almost feel as though I need to apply foundation or a different BB cream over it to truly even out and cover my skin. I will use this Olay CC cream on days when I just want light, natural looking makeup. However, if I was getting dressed up for a night out, I would choose a different product (I like Smashbox BB Cream which is expensive, but gives amazing coverage). The CC cream did last through my low key night out for dinner and drinks with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good product and will make a nice addition to my makeup bag. However, I will use it only occasionally on &amp;#34;light makeup&amp;#34; days. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> All my life, I’ve preferred to go without foundation, and just use small amounts of cover-up and/or face powder when needed. However, as the years pass and I enter the dreaded valley of middle age, it’s harder to get away with going “au naturale.” Fortunately, makeup today is very different from the heavy foundations of even 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve already tried BB creams, meant to be a moisturizer/foundation/“cosmeceutical” combo. They’re okay — and in fact, the Olay one is my favorite. They’re what I wear for evenings out. But they’re still heavier, shinier, and more opaque than I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new CC (“color correcting”) creams. Now we’re talking! For women like me who prefer a “nude” appearance but can no longer quite get away with it, this CC cream is a simple, fuss-free option. I’ve already been using Peter Thomas Roth mattifier, which has no pigment and just serves as a mattifier and light-diffuser. I find the Olay CC has a similar effect, but with a light tint that helps gloss over some imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sample was “light to medium.” I have a difficult-to-match skin tone, but this color is sheer enough that it looked perfect even with a description as vague as “light to medium.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re a somewhat reluctant/impatient user of makeup and prefer a lot less fuss, a lot quicker application, and a lot less of a “made up” look, this is a great easy alternative for you. Takes about 30 seconds to apply. Then a quick brush over with lightly tinted powder, if you like, and you’re out the door, looking like you didn’t apply anything at all — and for me, that’s the ideal look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky about anything I put on my face.  I tend to only wear make-up on &amp;#34;special occasions&amp;#34; because I have sensitive skin and tend to break out after using many products.  I have had absolutely no issues with this cream, and it actually does even out my skin tone.  It&#x27;s not greasy and the fragrance is pretty light. I love that it has SPF protection.  I&#x27;m fair skinned, and any time I can find a product that does double duty (moisturize + SPF) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about pore minimizing - I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference, but otherwise I love this cream and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This is a tinted makeup that is designed to minimize large pores. It is also a moisturizer and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does minimize pores but does not work as well as my usual moisturizers. It also made my face feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am middle-aged, and I think it&#x27;ll work better for younger men and women.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It actually looks like liquid makeup coming out of the tube. I am 58 and have rosacea and I use this instead of foundation. It covers all the redness and evens out my skin tone. My skin is dry, but this goes on like lotion. I just dot it all over my face and blend in. It feels light and looks very natural. I will be reordering this for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I got it! It is really easy to apply and i like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get streaky, as I&#x27;ve had that problem with foundation before. But this looks very natural while still making my face look a bit more glowy. :D&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what your skin tone is, I would recommend this. However, I don&#x27;t have any acne (which is a good thing) but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell how well it conceals; whether it could go straight over or if you would need to use a concealer along with it in order to cover up any zits. But I reccomend this if you&#x27;re fair-skinned and looking to have a bit more color on your face</li>
    <li> Sometimes these CC creams have an unpleasant smell, but I was pleasantly surprised at this cream.  If scents bother you, this does have a smell, but it is mild and does not remind me of sunscreen at all.  The cream was listed as light/medium, but I would say it tends more towards the light side.  I would have to use medium if I planned to use it regularly.  It didn&#x27;t offer much coverage of redness on my cheeks, but it did give a nice overall sheer look (it would not cover up blemishes, spider veins, redness, etc.), and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in pore size (or minimizing).  I prefer my regular CC cream to this one, but possibly if I tried it in the darker shade, medium, it would look better.  (I like the Marcelle brand BB cream and the Philosophy brand).</li>
    <li> Make my face feel tacky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a older woman , although my pores are not really big. We can all use something to make our skin look smoother.    I put on face cream first. As I didn&#x27;t think this pore Minimizer Was rich enough for my skin . I put Olay pore minimized on, and did not notice much difference !    Maybe I should try this for a week with out using moisturizer first !!!!    I used fair to medium.    I&#x27;m fair skin , but this is light in color, and the texture  is thin. After I use it , I put over a light liquid make-up,I then could notice  A little difference in my skin looking smoother .    As I said the color is light,. The color on the the box does not look like what comes out of the tube at all.    I have use before another brand that was pricier, and I noticed a difference right away, but not with the Olay.  That said the pricier one cause my face to break out.   Olay did Not clogged My pores or cause my face to break out, as the pricier one did.    I&#x27;ll continue to use this, if I start to notice a better improvement ,I&#x27;ll be back with a new review.  I do not use heavy make up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, just powder, blush, and mascara.  Adding this to my routine made a huge difference in looking polished and even toned.  It&#x27;s very light feeling and blends well into skin.  It provides SPF protection all day long which is great.  It helps hide the dark veins under my eyes which was unexpected as it isn&#x27;t really marketed for that.  My skin feels smoother after a couple weeks of use. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my skin look airbrushed and flawless and seems like my skin looks brighter and more even toned ever since I started using it :)</li>
    <li> I will use it. A little oily for everday.</li>
    <li> It was ok but didn&#x27;t minimize my pores instead made them more noticeable</li>
    <li> Nice coverage, but definitely not the same as a true foundation.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover pores or discolorations. I saw no benefit in coverage from this.  My pores still look just as big and the discolorations on my face are still visible. The scent is OK but too perfume like for me although it isn&#x27;t strong and I don&#x27;t smell it any more once it is on. It spreads over my face nicely and gives a very slight color. This would be good for someone without imperfections that just wants to enhance their natural skin. I would not buy this for myself. I have been using a covergirl+olay which is working good for hiding pores and some imperfections. This product needs more coverage power to hide anything.</li>
    <li> Wow- this stuff is great. I had no idea what CC  Cream meant but after Googling it I discovered it means &amp;#34;color correcting&amp;#34; and it really does even out my skin tone. I think I look younger and glowing as if a makeup artist worked on my face. This cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and a quick face wash was all it took to remove it. I have some high end makeup from that Texas store but this product makes me look just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so easy to use that I can use it when I take the dog for a walk or if I&#x27;m just running to the corner dry cleaner and instead of hoping I don&#x27;t meet anyone i can feel good about the way I look. I&#x27;ve already told friends about it - try it - you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> Gives lovely light to medium coverage, sun protection, and a bit of optical blurring over pores and lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a trace of a pleasant scent when you first squeeze a pea-sized dab on your finger (enough for your whole face; this tube will last me 4-6 months), but no lasting scent, a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day for me without sneaking into fine lines or becoming shiny or flaky. It works well as a primer under mineral foundation (Bare Minerals Ready 2.0, or Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Stick), giving my skin a really air-brushed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really great BB/CC cream that can keep up with the more pricey ones I&#x27;ve tried from Sephora or Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> I have tried many facial/beauty products and I have to say that I was very impressed with the result of this Olay Total Effects cream. I am cursed with large pores and uneven skin texture and I noticed a difference the first time that I used this. Pores looked smaller, texture more even and dry spots a bit less noticeable. The cream is medium weight and does not feel heavy when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this Olay product and recommend it very highly.</li>
