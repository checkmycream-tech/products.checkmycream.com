### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>best to micro needle before bed</li>
      <li>Great product i can see how my skin is improving just after 2 weeks of using it</li>
      <li>Good product, good price great shipping time.</li>
      <li>But as for the seller, shipping, and product packaging and product itself, I&#x27;ll give good rate.</li>
      <li>My face feels great and is looking better after about 2 months use.</li>
      <li>, from reading u tubes, 0.5 mm is more effective .</li>
      <li>Longer needles increase the risk of infection or scarring and hurt more: “Once you get over one millimeter, you need to be pretty brave,” says Michael Gold, a Nashville, Tenn. Dermatologist who is a consultant to EndyMed</li>
      <li>this is a top notch dermaneedle kit.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll know more in 6-9 mos.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed improvement in my skin texture and a more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>, my face looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>the price is amazing but did not ship quickly</li>
      <li>Everything written about this roller has been accurate</li>
      <li>I just enjoy the two days after I use it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a significant improvement over the 12 month use, but I will say that a day or two after I use this</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and feel that since I spend so much on potions and lotions, now I have a tool that helps me get the most benefit possible from them.</li>
      <li>On freshly cleaned skin, I roll all over, then apply hydrolonic acid -- let  that sink in, then apply a retinol moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I bought this more for the areas around my eyes, but it still too big for that area.</li>
      <li>No miracles but consistent results.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as picture shown.</li>
      <li>I used it for 3 days in a row the  first time, then about every 3 weeks afterward.</li>
      <li>rolling at home, doctors say, it is important to wash the face first with soap and water and use only quality needle devices.</li>
      <li>This is a nice little roller.</li>
      <li>Too much hype.</li>
      <li>Except I don&#x27;t know if its really working yet.</li>
      <li>The things that haven&#x27;t improved -- well, I don&#x27;t really expect them to.</li>
      <li>i really do see an improvementin</li>
      <li>It pricks, but is very tolerable.  </li>
      <li>beware, using this even gently along the pores will result in redness.</li>
      <li>Feels good without being painful, unless that is what you want then you can get decent pain from it without needing to much pressure, lightweight and durable, easy to use.</li>
      <li>it arrived in a nice hard pkastic case for storage and instructions.</li>
      <li>I try to wait over the hour before I apply foundation or anything I don&#x27;t want to be absorbed deeply.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been trying to get his facial hair to grow evenly and get rid of the patchy look when his facial hair comes in and surprisingly we have noticed more facial hair in the bald areas over the past month of using these rollers!</li>
      <li>Sometimes I just give my face a light  rolling if I want my expensive potions and lotions to sink in better.</li>
      <li>What I have noticed is that my sunspots are almost invisible now, the crows feet are less noticeable, lip lines are better, number 11 between the brows is better, and all my facial skin is a little plumper.</li>
      <li>This product actually works very well.</li>
      <li>I like the product, but no big difference in my skin much.</li>
      <li>The needles do not hurt nearly as much as the 1.50mm and it has lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>But what I didn&#x27;t expect is how much improvement I DID get from this little thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I may not be using this correctly. I dont see a difference and I am only leaving red marks that wont go away.</li>
    <li> Never tried it yet, there are other things I need to get before I start to use it.  I will be trying it soon.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated this product does a poor job of piercing the skin. The needles have square points, like the edge of a chisel, instead of being needle like. With pressure it works on my forehead, but on softer areas padded by more fat like cheeks it often fails to pierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may also be a result of the density of the needle placement but it&#x27;s hard to tell when it has both cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it works fine on my forehead, so I can&#x27;t give it a completely bad review.</li>
    <li> I guess at least it improves the  blood circulations . Afte one year ,still have line and wrinkles . I should have order 0.5 mm instade ., from reading u tubes, 0.5 mm is more effective .</li>
    <li> Every time I use it i really do see an improvementin my skin.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s making a difference.  It pricks, but is very tolerable.  I feel my skin tightening as claimed by manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago and realized I never reviewed it. This is a nice little roller. I have another that is 1.50mm too. The needles do not hurt nearly as much as the 1.50mm and it has lasted a long time. I don&#x27;t see a significant improvement over the 12 month use, but I will say that a day or two after I use this, my face looks pretty good. Looks like a summer glow from the beach actually. I bought this more for the areas around my eyes, but it still too big for that area. I like the product, but no big difference in my skin much. I just enjoy the two days after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product actually works very well. I used this tool because I have deep acne on my chin and cheeks. Idk if that makes sense but I had like little white head things that would erupt into hard pimples that were painful so I purchased two of these to solve that problem and it has helped me open them up and that way my benzoyl peroxide gel can kill what&#x27;s in my pores. I also noticed improvement in my skin texture and a more even skin tone. Scars I have had for months are no longer noticeable to me and I obsess over my skin so I think these are a plus! My hubby also uses one. He&#x27;s been trying to get his facial hair to grow evenly and get rid of the patchy look when his facial hair comes in and surprisingly we have noticed more facial hair in the bald areas over the past month of using these rollers!</li>
    <li> Have not figured out how to use yet!!##</li>
    <li> Great product i can see how my skin is improving just after 2 weeks of using it i recomend it</li>
    <li> Good product, good price great shipping time. Ive been using these for years and like the result on my skin. No miracles but consistent results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into what a microneedle does or does not do. I am going to tell you what I see that it does. On freshly cleaned skin, I roll all over, then apply hydrolonic acid -- let  that sink in, then apply a retinol moisturizer. I treat dark spots with crushed up aspirin in a little lemon juice because that makes salicylic acid which is a skin lightener. My face feels great and is looking better after about 2 months use. I used it for 3 days in a row the  first time, then about every 3 weeks afterward. Sometimes I just give my face a light  rolling if I want my expensive potions and lotions to sink in better. From what I&#x27;ve  read around the net, using a microneedle increases absorption of cosmetics by about 80%. The &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; it pokes stay open for about &#x60;1 hour, so that is the window of opportunity to apply any rescue cosmetics. I try to wait over the hour before I apply foundation or anything I don&#x27;t want to be absorbed deeply. What I have noticed is that my sunspots are almost invisible now, the crows feet are less noticeable, lip lines are better, number 11 between the brows is better, and all my facial skin is a little plumper. What hasn&#x27;t changed are the marionette lines from the nose  to mouth and the few broken capillaries I have by the side of my nose and top of my cheek. The things that haven&#x27;t improved -- well, I don&#x27;t really expect them to. But what I didn&#x27;t expect is how much improvement I DID get from this little thing. I am very pleased and feel that since I spend so much on potions and lotions, now I have a tool that helps me get the most benefit possible from them.</li>
    <li> this is a top notch dermaneedle kit. the price is amazing but did not ship quickly but that&#x27;s ok. it arrived in a nice hard pkastic case for storage and instructions. beware, using this even gently along the pores will result in redness. best to micro needle before bed so the skin has time to heal. first time users, don&#x27;t push hard! this is not a toy.</li>
    <li> Too much hype. One of those new products that comes out with promises and you waste your money and damage your skin in the process.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product, though here&#x27;s some information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologists recommend consulting a physician before micro-needling at home and using needles shorter than a quarter-to-a-half millimeter. Longer needles increase the risk of infection or scarring and hurt more: “Once you get over one millimeter, you need to be pretty brave,” says Michael Gold, a Nashville, Tenn. Dermatologist who is a consultant to EndyMed Medical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If rolling at home, doctors say, it is important to wash the face first with soap and water and use only quality needle devices. Dull needles, or somewhat skewed needles, can result in damage to the face, adds Dr. Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal</li>
    <li> It looks exactly as picture shown. I am safisfied with the product itself.  Although I am not seeing dramatic result as all the advertising said.  But as for the seller, shipping, and product packaging and product itself, I&#x27;ll give good rate.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t see that it did ANYTHING at all and was in MY OPINION an absolute waste of my money and time.  I told one friend already to NOT buy one.</li>
    <li> Everything written about this roller has been accurate Except I don&#x27;t know if its really working yet. Its been 3-4 mos now, but I&#x27;ll know more in 6-9 mos.  Ill update my review then.</li>
    <li> Casi un mes en recibir todo... No valio la pena adquirir este producto. Lo enviaron por mensajeria publica lo que dificulto todo.</li>
    <li> Feels good without being painful, unless that is what you want then you can get decent pain from it without needing to much pressure, lightweight and durable, easy to use. I have two sizes of this and I love it.</li>
