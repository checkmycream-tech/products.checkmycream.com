### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very nice....!!!</li>
      <li>Finding this on Amazon has made me HAPPY!!!</li>
      <li>Superior!</li>
      <li>Beautiful scent, not overpowering or nauseating.</li>
      <li>Smells great, would be a great summer scent.</li>
      <li>Fragrant and pleasant, alone or in blends.</li>
      <li>Good price, shipping was on time.</li>
      <li>So pleased with every aspect of this purchase!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Everyone comments about how amazing this product smells.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled that I found it through Tom&#x27;s Incense here.</li>
      <li>Smells so good...if you love coconut you will love this!</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>love this my favorite been wearing for years always get compliments</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and wear it every day.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of summer?</li>
      <li>Fantastic service and product!</li>
      <li>i was really bummed too, because the smell from the bottle is an absolutely amazing, warm, coconut smell, and it just didn&#x27;t transfer to my skin.</li>
      <li>Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
      <li>It is very sweet and strong.</li>
      <li>but it is REALLY strong.  </li>
      <li>Kuumba Made Black Coconut is the best coconut fragrance oil out</li>
      <li>I love how clean and fresh it feels.</li>
      <li>Nice roll on, good spreading ability, and can put anywhere and use as much or as little as you want.  </li>
      <li>I really love the smell of coconut, so I really do like this essence.  </li>
      <li>Best of all all natural botanicals were used in the making of these products no alcohol so the sent lingers and meshes well with other scents from the shampoo or deoderant you may be using.</li>
      <li>If you look through most of the KUUmba Oil scents, most of the comments are all the same, as though someone went &amp; posted the same marvelous things about each product, using the exact same language.  </li>
      <li>Great long lasting and smooth</li>
      <li>I love this scent because its not floral but a dark, exotic fruity, scent.</li>
      <li>though, I just have to put a little dab of this on along with another fragrance and it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>products at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It is a coconut scent with an extra added something that I cannot pinpoint but love .</li>
      <li>whole foods was hrs away!</li>
      <li>I love to just open the cap and smell it.  </li>
      <li>I also love the Vanilla Musk but usually end up putting the Black Coconut on top of that which gives an even more unique scent.</li>
      <li>cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sooooo good, just a little sweet, just enough without smelling of sugar and sweets.</li>
      <li>I get mine at Whole Foods for about 9 dollars.</li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance</li>
      <li>while, at first, Kuumba Black Coconut does seem to meet all of the expectations borne from the reviews, luxury, purity, etc., within about five minutes, the fragrance falls flat, and starts to unleash the talcum powder undertones inherent in cheap, drug store perfumes.</li>
      <li>, I can testify that this fragrance does not reflect that of the natural fruit.</li>

    <li> Everyone comments about how amazing this product smells. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, would be a great summer scent. Smells a lot like Bath and Body Works brand creamy coconut, which I believe has been discontinued, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this company&#x27;s scents for perfume oils but this one was a little heavier than others I&#x27;ve tried like vanilla and sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Kuumba Made Black Coconut is the best coconut fragrance oil out there.&lt;br /&gt;When layered with their Vanilla Musk it smells like one of those&lt;br /&gt;LUXURIOUS sun tan lotions from the 1950s!  I have re-ordered this oil&lt;br /&gt;several times along with their Black Coconut body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;LUXE products at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on positive customer reviews, all of which, I must; unfortunately, refute...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...while, at first, Kuumba Black Coconut does seem to meet all of the expectations borne from the reviews, luxury, purity, etc., within about five minutes, the fragrance falls flat, and starts to unleash the talcum powder undertones inherent in cheap, drug store perfumes. Artificial, and &amp;#34;MUSTY&amp;#34;, not even &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an individual of Caribbean heritage who has been covering herself in unfiltered coconut oil since childhood, I can testify that this fragrance does not reflect that of the natural fruit. Which is unfortunate, as though I love the scent, coconut oil, proper, can become a slippery mess in during the humid South Florida summers.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance but it is REALLY strong.  That&#x27;s o.k. though, I just have to put a little dab of this on along with another fragrance and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Fragrant and pleasant, alone or in blends.</li>
    <li> Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to. Nice roll on, good spreading ability, and can put anywhere and use as much or as little as you want.  Lasts all day, even through hard workout. Beautiful scent, not overpowering or nauseating. Good price, shipping was on time. Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
    <li> love this my favorite been wearing for years always get compliments</li>
    <li> ...smells funky on my skin - not really like coconut at all. maybe this won&#x27;t be the case for everyone. i was really bummed too, because the smell from the bottle is an absolutely amazing, warm, coconut smell, and it just didn&#x27;t transfer to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is very sweet and strong. It is a coconut scent with an extra added something that I cannot pinpoint but love . I get mine at Whole Foods for about 9 dollars.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and wear it every day.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of summer? Then this is the oil for you.  I love how clean and fresh it feels. I roll it on my wrists and behind my ears.  I can smell it all day long.  I use it along with the Black Coconut lotion too!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of coconut, so I really do like this essence.  It comes out dark, but blends well in the skin.  I love to just open the cap and smell it.  It makes me think that I&#x27;m at the beach or that I am a Mounds bar or a macaroon.</li>
    <li> So pleased with every aspect of this purchase! Saving my money to re-buy when I run out! Fantastic service and product! Superior!</li>
    <li> Great long lasting and smooth</li>
    <li> Finding this on Amazon has made me HAPPY!!! Bigger bottle, less money, &amp; easier to get- whole foods was hrs away! Hooray!</li>

Best of all all natural botanicals were used in the making of these products no alcohol so the sent lingers and meshes well with other scents from the shampoo or deoderant you may be using.</li>
    <li> This oil is definitely not perfume oil.  It smells like some furniture polish I have had in the past. There is no scent of fragrance at all, just a waxy odor, maybe like car wax.  This is not how not fragrance oil smells. If you look through most of the KUUmba Oil scents, most of the comments are all the same, as though someone went &amp; posted the same marvelous things about each product, using the exact same language.  I am returning mine &amp; thankfully it was fullfilled by Amazon.com.  Either someone tampered with the product I got or this stuff is really that awful.</li>
