      <li>I put it on my friend today, and she looked instantly awake and noticeably intriguing and gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I am really excited that I came across this Kohl eyeliner by Daliia.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first Daliia kohl eyeliner in Wholefoods and was so excited to find her products were also available on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Daliia liner is amazing, once I understood how to apply it in the inner eye it gave more depth to the way I look with make up&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>goes on easily, wears long and feels like kohl should...comfortable to the eyes and the price is good.</li>
      <li>have looked for a good kohl eyeliner for some time and finally found it.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find a chemical free eyeliner, let alone &amp;#34;kajal!&amp;#34; The black color comes from black mustard seed which is awesome because that means there&#x27;s no titanium dioxide or mica in this particular liner unlike the others.</li>
      <li>love love it the only thing i gave it 4 star because it smudges.</li>
      <li>It protects and soothes, it looks great, and I no longer suffer from chronic bloodshot eyes from attempting to wear conventional eyeliner.</li>
      <li>One of my good friend told me the other day my brown eyes were my best asset to charm anyone, a first while we know each other for years!!</li>
      <li>A must have for healthy, natural makeup!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let price scare you because it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
      <li>difference between Daliia and other natural liners in the market is the ingenious vintage design of the packaging, very cute and practical.&lt;br /&gt;Tres</li>
      <li>The color is such a beautiful black and since I have jet black hair it matched perfectly and looks so natural.</li>
      <li>Although my favorite way to use them is by lining my inner lash lines, on nights out</li>
      <li>I found an all natural chemical and metal free eyeliner, but I do wish it was priced alittle lower.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I will continue to look for eyeliners with few ingredients like this one at a lower price and more colors(that are metal free).</li>
      <li>First of all it&#x27;s all natural and is full of ayurvedic herbs.  </li>
      <li>great, dark color(doesn&#x27;t come out gray like some black eyeliners do) and chemical and metal free.  </li>
      <li>Her eyeliners soothe and clean my sensitive eyes of toxins and impurities (I live and play in NYC amongst exhaust and pollution)  </li>
      <li>I like this so much  </li>
      <li>and then I forgot to twist it into the tube, put the top on and crushed the tip.</li>
      <li>Authenic ancient recipe in modern day style and glamorious case.</li>
      <li>- he does not wear this product, hahaha...</li>
      <li>I use DAliia&#x27;s other products and am just as satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad after searching far and wide</li>
      <li>Product is just too soft and the liner is too large at the tip.  </li>
      <li>That being said,  It&#x27;s different -it&#x27;s best to apply it very slowly to the inner rims of your eyes.</li>
      <li>and they are also completely versatile!</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it does run a little bit, but you can easily just wipe it away.</li>
      <li>I love DALiia&#x27;s Black Kohl eyeliner!!</li>
      <li>anyway it&#x27;s natural ingredients</li>
      <li>have looked for this kajal FOREVER : all natural herbal ingredients, no chemicals, no petroleum products, no parabens...</li>
      <li>every so often becasue natural oils and eye creams and face creams</li>
      <li>I explained her it was thanks to Daliia liner, not only your eyes look smoky and deep but the ayurvedic composition gives them a natural treatment.</li>
      <li>you want a fancy exotic liner (won&#x27;t have the conical shape but you can build it up - Try the Laura Mercier Black gold or black carrot cake liner ....</li>
      <li>Comes with a little mirror on the tube, makes my eyes whiter, look bigger, color is brighter, eyelashes stronger and getting more naturally dark over time.</li>
      <li>It does glide on with much ease but a little too pricey for me.</li>

    <li> I think for the price of this eyeliner it should at some point after application \\&quot;set\\&quot; It tends to smudge easily no matter how long it&#x27;s been on. It does glide on with much ease but a little too pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I am really excited that I came across this Kohl eyeliner by Daliia. I love the smokey eye look and these provide for the perfect application. I have the black which I use everyday.

    <li> I have eye allergies so I have problems with a lot of eye make up, this stuff is all it claims and more!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, dark color(doesn&#x27;t come out gray like some black eyeliners do) and chemical and metal free.  I&#x27;m glad after searching far and wide I found an all natural chemical and metal free eyeliner, but I do wish it was priced alittle lower.

    <li> Daliia liner is amazing, once I understood how to apply it in the inner eye it gave more depth to the way I look with make up&lt;br /&gt;I got so many comments when I start using it. One of my good friend told me the other day my brown eyes were my best asset to charm anyone, a first while we know each other for years!!.. I explained her it was thanks to Daliia liner, not only your eyes look smoky and deep but the ayurvedic composition gives them a natural treatment.Eyes are sensitives, no chemical is the way to go..&lt;br /&gt;The difference between Daliia and other natural liners in the market is the ingenious vintage design of the packaging, very cute and practical.&lt;br /&gt;Tres chic et choc, would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Authenic ancient recipe in modern day style and glamorious case. Comes with a little mirror on the tube, makes my eyes whiter, look bigger, color is brighter, eyelashes stronger and getting more naturally dark over time. Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smudge or drip, just remember to reapply and check in the mirror every so often becasue natural oils and eye creams and face creams will make it smudge eventually. I put it on my friend today, and she looked instantly awake and noticeably intriguing and gorgeous! A must have for healthy, natural makeup! i have only tried black, but look forward to trying all the colors, and gifting it! Thank you.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to learn how to use it by I am thrilled. I am 61 and if I can learn to create a sexy eye with this product anyone can.</li>
    <li> I love DALiia&#x27;s Black Kohl eyeliner!! I used to use eyeliners from the pharmacy that contain toxic ingredients and would cause my eyes irritation, but since I began using this black eyeliner, I have not experienced any redness or irritation.  I can safely apply the liner around the lining of my eyes. It glides on easily as it&#x27;s texture and color are rich. I love its striking, trendy look. I can leave it on for hours without needing to reapply. I use DAliia&#x27;s other products and am just as satisfied.  Discovering DALiia products is one of the best discoveries that I have made this year!!</li>
    <li> It melt from the eyes :(&lt;br /&gt;but anyway it&#x27;s natural ingredients so I will give it 4 Stars</li>
    <li> It was a total waste of money. I used it two days only, it got very dry and hard.</li>
    <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because it does run a little bit, but you can easily just wipe it away. The color is such a beautiful black and since I have jet black hair it matched perfectly and looks so natural. I am sensitive to the least harshest chemicals so I was happy to find a chemical free eyeliner, let alone &amp;#34;kajal!&amp;#34; The black color comes from black mustard seed which is awesome because that means there&#x27;s no titanium dioxide or mica in this particular liner unlike the others. If you are looking for a natural eyeliner, this is your best bet!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop offering this.  Best eyeliner ever for inner lids, top and bottom.lasts all day .  Don&#x27;t let price scare you because it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this so much  .i have a problem with eye liners always give me red eyes .this one dose not give me red eye like others liner do.i sleep without removing it does not bother my eyes .love love love it the only thing i gave it 4 star because it smudges.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Daliia kohl eyeliner in Wholefoods and was so excited to find her products were also available on Amazon!( I bought the brown liner at wholefoods and love it). I am now a dedicated and regular customer, using at least 2 of her products daily. Her eyeliners soothe and clean my sensitive eyes of toxins and impurities (I live and play in NYC amongst exhaust and pollution)  and I have to say since using them, I notice a difference in my lashes as well! They are easy to use, easy application, easy removal, self sharpening and they are also completely versatile! Although my favorite way to use them is by lining my inner lash lines, on nights out I have also used it to create a smokey eye on my upper lids as well!  More than ever, in todays day and age when we have to fear the air we breathe and the food we eat, the water we drink and the products we use, it is so refreshing to know that her products are 100% all natural, safe to use, AND cruelty free!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> have looked for a good kohl eyeliner for some time and finally found it. goes on easily, wears long and feels like kohl should...comfortable to the eyes and the price is good. will buy again and soon to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Product is just too soft and the liner is too large at the tip.  Personally I would not buy iy again.</li>
    <li> I used it for two days and then I forgot to twist it into the tube, put the top on and crushed the tip. No way to sharpen it.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smoothness though.</li>
    <li> I started using Dalia Eye-stick a while ago and absolutely LOVE it! First of all it&#x27;s all natural and is full of ayurvedic herbs.  It applies very smoothly, and I always get complements on it.  Got it as gifts for all my girlfriends, who went ahead and ordered more as the loved it too.  Great product, you should definitely try it!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this &amp; the gold to be more like an ethnic pencil I used years ago from Pakistan.  I found this liner irritating on the eye - plus it broke off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a fancy exotic liner (won&#x27;t have the conical shape but you can build it up - Try the Laura Mercier Black gold or black carrot cake liner .... ;)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re cool with eyeliner that goes on super smooth, but then never ever sets, this is the eyeliner for you! I should probably start reading reviews before paying $28 for eyeliner. :/</li>
