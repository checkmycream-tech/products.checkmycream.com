<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these. My hair curls like crazy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Unbelievable curls in shoulder length or waist length hair.  Curl stays all day with a little spray!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t steam up as much as the old ones. But still better than electric curlers.</li>
    <li> Have had a couple of these over the years. They lasted a long time but I have well water with high iron content. Always start with using distilled water or spring water then get lazy and just use tap water.  Love the curl and the body it gives super fast. Basic I roll in them all and when done unroll them. The time is great and the body lasts on my thick shorter to mid length hair</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t love it more!  Had one years ago but hard water finally ruined it so bought another</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase the ion rollers b/c I know they work well, but I know this type of roller was used on a girl in a movie, and she had really shiny, smooth hair. These take longer to use b/c you have to heat each roller separately, and since you&#x27;re using steam in a humid place, it&#x27;s a little blah, but on the plus side, my hair was shiny.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but they work great!</li>
    <li> concept what I wanted but 2 design flaws.  Each size roller clasp should be different color for easy use.(I am fixing it myself.)  Also the clasp isn&#x27;t always effective as it doesn&#x27;t always fit roller tightly and falls out. (I have another idea for a clasp which works better than theirs...but for the price why should I have to fix their design flaws???????)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Caruso steam hairsetter for 20 years now, and I think I&#x27;m on my 4th one. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair with the foam rollers and steam heat, and it curls my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve used previously. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> these were great and was so easy to use but sadly the curls only lasted for an hour and started to straighten out despite me using styling gels and hairspray on my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t curl mine or my daughter&#x27;s hair AT ALL! Sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Best rollers ever!</li>
    <li> Just too much work, and the curl wouldn&#x27;t stay for me. I have long (mid-back) straight hair which I color but which is predominantly gray. It&#x27;s neither thick nor thin. Though straight, it has a lot of body and develops a natural waviness in high humidity. So it takes a curl very well. I think it would help a lot to know what hair type you are when reviewing to better assist in making a decision as to whether to try this set. I do find regular old plastic hot rollers work fine. But I&#x27;m having trouble finding some in a larger 1.5&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; size with the older style clips that has maybe 6-8 rollers for portability, well made with a top that doesn&#x27;t crack or break off easily.  I read a LOT of reviews complaining about this from people who want the exact same thing! You would think the manufacturers would wake up and come out with such a set. Right now I&#x27;ve bot the Calista Tools set of 12 rollers for spiral curls, works sensationally and has a great pouch for portability. The clips are the only minus. Back to why I tried out the Caruso, often for work I just want less vavavavoom. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with a curling iron til someone figures it out. I also use a flat iron and wear it straight.</li>
    <li> I thought the idea of steam heated rollers would work on my fine hair, but the rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair--------they slid right out no matter how I tried to secure them.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and difficult to hold curl.  These curlers are the very best at holding curl for a longer time.</li>
    <li> Best Hot Rollers I have tried. My flat fine hair comes out movie-star worthy. Easy to use, and quick- about ten minutes!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 1993.  With fine hair, it&#x27;s hard to find something that curls my hair well.  The only reason I ordered again was to replace some of the sponges which had begun to disintegrate from use over time.  I use it for my girls&#x27; hair, too.  It is the only way I curl their hair.  You will not be disappointed with this hairsetter!  You&#x27;ll never use a curling iron again.  (Believe it or not, this takes less time than using a curling iron!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Caruso rollers in the past, used them one time, then promptly returned them after that one use because I didn&#x27;t achieve the style I was going for. Well, I bought and just received them again to give them another shot and let me just say I am so happy I did! These rollers really are as great as most people say they are! I&#x27;ve gotten much better at rolling my hair and can use the rollers much better.   Some things that I have learned:  1. Steaming the \\&quot;shields\\&quot; just adds time to how long it takes your hair to dry, so it&#x27;s not really necessary (though, I thinks that&#x27;s said in the guide lol).  2. End papers help your ends be more smooth (non-frizzy)  3. If your rollers are left with dents after you&#x27;ve used them, simply place them back on the steamer for a few seconds and it&#x27;ll take them out.    I believe these rollers can work for ANYONE&#x27;S hair and suggest for anyone to give them a shot.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It allows you to fix your hair in 15 minutes on a daily basis with no damage to cause breakage. I have tried other types of both steam and ceramic rollers over the years and none curl as well as the Caruso brand.</li>
    <li> The steam rollers produce great curls and heats up very fast.  The two smaller size rollers produces lots of curls.  Medium and large rollers set the best with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the steam curlers. I have thick relaxed hair that is more on the dry side. I wash my hair every 3-4 days and this steam curler set works perfectly on my hair. The curls lasted for 3 days. Of course, they loosened over the days from really tight curls to wavy. I gave it 4 stars as it had more jumbo curlers vs. the more versatile medium curlers.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I love this hairsetter.  I have had this for almost 6 months or longer now.  My hair stays curled through the day.  The only downside it that the foam on many of the rollers started to break up in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> They are okay, but I didn&#x27;t use them for a long time.</li>
    <li> I give 5 star to this rollers, cause they the only one faster, easy, no pain to create curl in minuets!!!!! no more hot iron or Curlers Magic Leverag</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and makes my hair look great.  I use it with the roller covers which are supplied and leave the curlers&lt;br /&gt;in while I do other things, maybe about an hour.  If I have time I remove the roller covers and replace them with jumbo clips so the hair dries on the roller on it&#x27;s own.  Otherwise I get under a cool bonnet dryer for a few minutes before I remove the roller covers.  It is worth the time for me as I have dry-ish hair and blow drying  it completely dry really makes it un-manageable.  This steam hairsetter seems better for my hair.  Right after I wash my hair I blow dry it until it is just barely dry and then use the Caruso curlers as described above.  The curl lasts for days until I repeat the whole process.  My hair is too dry to wash every day and this process keeps it looking good for about a week!  Lucky I found the Caruso.</li>
    <li> I am only writing this review on behalf of the shipping time and condition. I haven&#x27;t used this product yet because it is a Christmas gift for my mom. I have done a ton of research on hot hair rollers and found that this product was the best to go with. I ordered this and it came in the mail within a few days and the box was in great condition. I will be sure to write a review on how well this product works as soon as it is used.</li>
    <li> First I will say I am NOT reviewing this exact model at this time, I am giving my opinion on Caruso steam curlers that I have used. I do not have this model but an older one and I used to use these pretty much everyday in the late 80&#x27;s thru mid 90&#x27;s and I LOVED them. They were pretty easy to use and I had fabulous results. I loved my hair and it felt soft and the curls did last for a couple of days. I usually wash my hair every other day if not everyday, because of the hairspray, so I can&#x27;t say it was days they would last. I didn&#x27;t have a problem using my steamer or the curlers and I got great results. I am thinking about ordering this model because I remember my results and would like to try it again. If or when I do order this I will update my review on the new version. I just hope it is as good as the older one. :)</li>
    <li> bought for daughter for xmas ....she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> I have thick very fine straight hair. These were easy to use and the curl lasted for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love my steam curlers!  I&#x27;m able to pour the water (I buy a gallon of distiller water and keep it under my bathroom sink), plug the container in, and place/remove the curlers in my medium length hair in 10 minutes!  My curls come out smooth, and I just fluff my hair with my fingers. You can even use the curlers without the steam, I.e. wet the sponge of the curler with your finger and roll up a stubborn side bang. Get lots of compliments on my hair, too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re after for a curler, I&#x27;d definitely reccommend this one. I always had trouble using a hair curler or straightner to curl my hair and the curls would never last in my hair. The Caruso steam rollers work so well and it&#x27;s real easy. Of course I had to practice a couple times to get how I wanted it but that&#x27;s like anything. The curls lasted all day! The steamer heats up super fast, 2 minutes max and when placing the rollers on the steamer they take 30 seconds max to heat up. I was so happy with the results. A must buy!</li>
    <li> These rollers are not meant for heavy hair. I read a couple reviews and decided to take my chances. As soon as it came, i tried these on and kept steaming the rollers multiple times in the hop that it would curl my hair. Not only did it not curl, but i ended up wetting my hair because of steam. I&#x27;d rather invest in an expensive curl iron. This product is useless for me.For finer hair, it may work.</li>
    <li> These will be returned.  They are difficult to use and take too long to wait for each curler to heat up.  The clip is difficult to get on and they tend to fall out before removing them.  I don&#x27;t have time for this much frustration in the morning.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look healthy and it feels so soft</li>
    <li> I really wanted this curler set to work for my TBL hair, but it did not.  The curls fell and appeared frizzy.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Curling irons just fried my hair, and the sets they gave me lasted all of 30 minutes, but the Caruso C97953 SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter with 30 Rollers has proved to be the best one for me. I have purchased a new one every 4 or 5 years, and it has been worth it. I use it everyday, and I get the longest lasting curls. I couple it with the new VO5 Curls enhancer, and I am set to go all day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not dried out from curling irons, it is fluffy and soft, and curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these rollers, they just do the best job ever. I look like I have been to the hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to try this hair system. I live overseas, ordered it and it&#x27;s marked 120V AC, not dual voltage.  I dare not plug it in to my 230V household current.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s dual voltage or not but not willing to try.  Just a warning.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair, and my head is full of cowlicks.    I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, electric rollers, everything I can find, nothing worked except to sleep with rollers in my hair overnight.  Then I found the Caruso system and for the first time I found something faster than a curling iron or electric rollers and the curls actually hold.  I&#x27;m white, and passed my set on to an Oriental woman whose hair wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl and she loves it, too.  Now I&#x27;m growing my hair out and once more, I want the only thing that works for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is a great price, I&#x27;ve been checking everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, does a great job and won&#x27;t damage my fine hair. I can roll my daughters&#x27; hair and not feel guilty about damaging their hair.     The 30 rollers are a real plus! This new model is smaller than the previous pink one and doesn&#x27;t require salt. I use distilled water, hoping it will prolong the life of the product.Came with a plastic bag for storage.Also, a booklet for achieving different hairstyles has been very helpful.     The reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5, is that it is a time consuming process. Heating the roller, rolling the hair, then heating the clip before using it can feel tedious. Generally, the results are worth it!</li>
    <li> I have had a couple sets of these, and LOVE THEM.  This set is for a gift.  I am so anxious to give it to her!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.   Love the volume and curls it creates</li>
    <li> I have ultra fine hair also, but with my rollers, I find it helps to add the styling gel or mousse and let it dry, BEFORE rolling.  I leave the rollers in for at least 20 mins, and take alot of care not to pull on the curl as I unroll it.  Then on the unrolled curls, but not combed yet, I use hairspray and make sure it has dried completely.  Then fingercomb.  The first 30 minutes will be a curl that would probably look too curled, but wait and it will settle nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because the description says \\&quot;dual voltage\\&quot;.  However when I received the product it was identical to the single voltage model I already own.  The steamer itself and the instructions both say \\&quot;120\\&quot; Volts only.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. I bought them based on a reccomendation from my director(I moonlight as a stage actor)since I have to curl my hair 5x&#x27;s a week for a 1959 hairstyle. They&#x27;re easy to use. Not only do they work great without damaging my hair, on the days we have two shows I don&#x27;t have to re-curl. The unit starts to steam in a few min. so no more waiting. I&#x27;m at the end of four weeks of performance and my hair looks good(really good!) on stage and off because for the first time I&#x27;m not frying/burning it to death. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;Caruso\\&quot; steam roller girl for life!</li>
    <li> I just received these a week or so ago and have used them several times. So far---I&#x27;m totally taken with this system!      Lately, my hair has gotten so frizzy, thin and damaged by constant lightening/coloring, illness and hormone fluctuations that it felt like straw and has been falling out more than I care to admit. That said, I&#x27;ve been very cautious about how I treat and style my hair.  Of course, due to the health of it, my hair has also been more DIFFICULT to style--a vicious cycle, as some of you know.  I have tried all sorts of curling irons, hot brushes, rollers, etc.  They either didn&#x27;t work or just made my hair more damaged by the day.    Finally, I decided to get these Caruso rollers. The results have been AMAZING!  For the first time in ages, my hair feels soft, pliable, and takes curl MUCH better.  The curls last several days. The steam seems to be actually improving the condition of my hair!  That, alone, is worth the cost of the product.  Also, it feels softer and more manageable even after I wash it.  My hair is shiny and looks professionally styled each day now.  People have suddenly started complimenting me constantly about what gorgeous hair I have!  To have gone from frizzy straw to that in literally a week is nothing short of a miracle!    I will just say that it&#x27;s important to not heat up each roller for more than 5 seconds or so.  I like that they are not even hot to the touch this way.  I was really skeptical about whether they would work, but they do!  Also, I DO steam the shields (aka roller holders), as the instruction manual states.  I haven&#x27;t tried using the rollers without steaming the shields as well because I&#x27;m sticking with what works for now.  I also use distilled water only. Additionally, I empty the water when I&#x27;m done and shake out any extra water left in the unit, so it doesn&#x27;t sit wet when not in use (as I suspect this might contribute to its failure to work down the road--as some people have noted).      All in all, I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has damaged hair and wants to restore its health, shine and body!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have very fine, straight hair and this steam set is the only one that holds the curl all day. If it stops steaming after a few months. Just add a bit a vinegar in with the water and it will clean the device.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, may be good for long hair but does not hold well, not easy to use and leaves hair limp.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a solution to add body to my fine, limp hair that would be less damaging than the flat iron I have been using.  My hair has gotten longer and it has become somewhat unwieldly to pull it all through the flat iron.  These rollers came highly recommended on Amazon and they live up to the hype.  The steam is gentle yet very effective for styling the hair quickly.  The rollers are very comfortable to wear while you are waiting for them to cool down.  It&#x27;s a nice system, more compact than typical roller sets, and they provide a carrying bag with your order and enough rollers for you to achieve any kind of style/curl tightness you need.  You can use regular tap water - no need to bother with distilled.  The only thing I have a tough time with - and this is probably just a lack of aptitude on my part - is getting my ends cleanly curled.  In the past I have used those rollers with the brown velvety surfaces, which seemed to better manage the end curls.  Hopefully my technique will improve over time.</li>
    <li> My old Caruso did a lot better job even though I had to add salt.  Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is day two of the Caruso system and I am happy I ran out to buy it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply yesterday. So, I have to tel you my journey. I am a African-American woman who has always had decent hair until a few years ago when I decided to abandon my \\&quot;old-timey\\&quot; way of doing my hair. Which meant out with the roller setting after washing and in with the blow drying and curling iron/flat iron route. Of course my previous shoulder-length hair is now 5 inches shorter and is looking dry and frizzy and beat up looking. So in efforts to cure that, I went the route of extensions and such. Bad move again. This week I decided enough was enough. Back to the basics of \\&quot;low impact\\&quot; haircare. I don&#x27;t like to sleep on rollers so I decided to purchase this set because of all of the rave reviews. I had used regular hot rollers but was not real happy with the look 2 -3 hours later after the curls had fallen. (And they were hot!!!) Day one of using the Caruso system, my hair was bouncy and beautiful. Day two, I learned a little from day one in how to put them in and today I feel like a movie star. I used the jumbo rollers to create soft curls and waves. I tried the system both ways, in that I heated the roller and the shield on half my head and just the roller on the other half this morning. I can see how the heated shield could make a longer lasting curl, but it took too long for my hair to dry that way. I ended up having to blow dry the rollers dry, not a bad idea, just an extra step I would take when going somewhere special. Also,try experimenting with how long to keep the roller on the unit. That can change your drying time also. My husband tells me I look sexy and beautiful and to be honest, it takes the same amount of time it used to take for me flat iron my hair everyday. I am 36 years old and I know for a lot younger women the idea of hot rollers makes them feel like they are going to end up looking like their grandma, but I can say that with a little practice you can make the hairstyles you see everyday on people without the damage to your hair. Your hair will be bouncy, shiny and healthy!the hairstyles you see everyday on people without the damage to your hair. Your hair will be bouncy, shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> Love this product can&#x27;t live without. The curls stay in all day long even in my Florida humidity. Have used for years.</li>
    <li> I have used these before, and I lost them several years ago, during a move.  I have tried to look for them in stores but could not find them.  I was excited to see them on line.  I got a great price and they were shipped to me quickly.  These are the only curlers that will not damage my hair, and they keep the curl in all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a harsh critic of hot rollers because I have fine, straight hair, but I regularly want curls. I&#x27;ve tried at least three different brands (Conair, Remington, and some off-brand from Sally Beauty Supply) of hot rollers in the past 5 years, and Caruso lives up to its claim that the curls will last for days. Previously, I was so desperate to have round, bouncy curls hold that I even went so far as to have my hair permed to give me just enough kink in my hair that curls would stay after using hot rollers.    If the weather is humid, the curls will only hold for the duration of the day. After sleeping on them, I end up with waves the next day. I can deal with this. The steam on the sponges doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers like the metal on other brands of curlers. If the humidity is low, and I&#x27;ve used enough product, the curls I&#x27;ve created with the Caruso stay and look great.     I&#x27;ve not run into any problems with the steamer as of yet, but I&#x27;ve heard running a vinegar-water solution through it often helps clear up any issues.</li>
    <li> Well, this product doesnt agree with me.  I must be doing something very wrong here since there are some really great reviews.  My curls just dont stay in!  I&#x27;ve had an Avon hot roller system (dont really remember details) and it actually curled my hair much better than this Caruso kit.  I think the moisture from the steam makes my curls flop.  No matter how long I leave the rollers in, (half a day or maybe just 15 minutes), I get no lasting curls.  The sponges also wear out pretty quickly.  I&#x27;ve probably only used them two or three times and the sponges look like they already need replacing.  My hair is very fine... so probably hot curlers would work better.  I mustered up two stars for this review because the kit comes with quite a lot of rollers...</li>
    <li> I love the results of the Caruso Hairsetter. The rollers are a different story. The ends come off as you&#x27;re setting your hair (very inconvenient)! The sponge on the rollers also starts flaking off after a short time.  It seems Caruso could come up with better rollers.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of rollers I have ever purchased.  I have been rolling my hair for years and usually the items constantly break or don&#x27;t hold any curl to my hair. I have been using these for more than 6 months and bought my sister a set for her birthday.  They are wonderful.  My hair is looking healthier and my ends are no longer breaking off.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and the rollers did not hold any curl.</li>
    <li> Hair curlers slip out of hair,</li>
    <li> The product was advertise to be great and it&#x27;s not, I have been trying different ways to make sure it&#x27;s not my hair, and this product still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I had these years ago, but when they died I replaced them with Conair hot rollers. Lately my hair has been so dry and hasn&#x27;t held a curl, so I tried these again. They are great! My curls have lasted and lasted. I love the variety of roller sizes for different looks.     My only complaint is the slant of the top. It&#x27;s difficult to balance the clip on top. I know the last time I had the curlers, I got in a pretty quick rhythm with rolling them and heating the clips. I am sure I will get it to work better with more tries, but so far I have had a lot of falling clips and have burned myself on the steam (nothing serious-- just slightly painful). A flatter top would make it easier and faster.</li>
    <li> i have used Caruso rollers for years.  I needed to replace my old one and I purchased a newer version.  The newer version didn&#x27;t work well and I had to return it to Caruso.  I could not return to store that I purchased them from on Amazon.  Keep that in mind.  Waiting for my replacement from Caruso</li>
    <li> This rollers are super easy even for someone who isn&#x27;t the best roller setter. I highly recommend them. Just don&#x27;t leave the rollers on the steam for more than 20 sec...too much steam will cause frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have long hair.  It measures more than five feet and is very fine and arrow straight.  I have been using Caruso since 1994 with no damage to my hair - not even on the ends.  I have read some of the reviews by people who did not have luck using Caruso and have added some tips which may help those with difficult to curl hair like mine.    When you shampoo your hair, be sure to use a good quality curl enhancing shampoo that is formulated specifically to encourage curl and don&#x27;t use a conditioner that makes your hair incredibly soft. A light conditioner or even better, a good bodifying conditioner are your best choices.    Mist your hair lightly with a really good flexible hair spray before you roll your curls.  I mist the section I am curling while the curler is heating on the unit, and then I use a natural boar bristle brush to air dry and smooth the hair before curling.  Don&#x27;t forget that it is absolutely imperative that your hair be completely dry before you roll it.      If you need your set to last for many hours, make your curls somewhat tighter than you want them to be and heat the clamp that holds the curler as well.  The less hair in each curler, the curlier the results so for a full head of curls which can create an explosion of bouncing curls, use as many curlers as you can possibly fit onto your head.    For spirals which gives consistent curl from top to bottom start at the roots and wrap your hair around the roller until you reach the ends then clamp.  The best thing about spiral curls is that the resulting curl is consistent from top to bottom, something that cannot be achieved when long hair is wrapped on a curler and the curler becomes thicker as you continue to wrap more hair around it - plus the hot roller is in direct contact with the oldest and most fragile portion of your hair.    Before you unroll your curls give it a thorough shot of COLD air from either your bonnet dryer or a blow dryer. I use a regular tabletop fan on the highest setting (which is kept in the bathroom); the extra cool air circulation helps to set the curl.  Then with the fan on the lowest setting, I carefully unroll the curler and immediately re-roll the curl with fingers and clip it to my head to hold in place until I have all the curlers removed.    The look you want determines what to do next. For a head full of spiral curls, use your fingers to gently divide each curl into separate spirals. For a head full of gorgeous messy curls, bend over at your waist and finger comb your hair until you have the look and fullness you want. For old-time Hollywood glamour, gently brush your curls with a boar bristle brush until you achieve that Veronica Lake look.     Once you have your hair styled the way you want it, resist the urge to keep playing with it and give it the final shot of spray. The more you mess with it, the more your curls will loosen.  Also, don&#x27;t use a hard set super hold spray or your hair will move like it&#x27;s all one piece.      Then just be careful of crushing your curls under coats or against car seats, or in my case - sitting on it.    In my opinion Caruso is the safest heated curling solution on the market which gives consistant and quick results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the unlucky people for whom this product didn&#x27;t work. No matter what I did the curls wouldn&#x27;t stay in for more than an hr. I  tried different things and no difference. The only way I can get curls is by leaving the rollers on the steamer for a long time, steam the caps, and then leaving then in my hair for more than four hrs so they can dry, and even after all that, I  have no trace of curls in my hair at the end of the night. Back to using my straightener  to create curls.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Caruso unit that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past 15 years. I have had no problem with operation (my old steamer still works, the rollers just wore out). Unfortunately, my problem is with the roller sizes. They are not as advertised, or even as shown on the box.  The advertisement is for 30 rollers:  6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium (they used to be the large rollers), 6 large and 6 jumbo. Instead of 6 large and 6 jumbo, it came with 12 HUMONGOUS \\&quot;Jumbo/Large\\&quot; rollers, which I have absolutely no use for. There are no &#x27;large&#x27; rollers in the set, only Jumbo size. In the past, it used to come with 6 petite, 6 small, 6 small-plus, 6 large (now called Medium), and 6 jumbo. That was fine. I didn&#x27;t use any Jumbos but there were enough of the other sizes to work.  Now I have to try and order rollers that replace the \\&quot;small-plus\\&quot; to make up for the inordinate amount of jumbo rollers that they included (12!). It sounds like they subcontracted out the rollers and they have no idea about the correct sizes.  I&#x27;d return the whole mess, but a replacement would just be the same. Just be prepared to order extra smaller rollers if you don&#x27;t have long hair and have no use for Jumbos. Is that a marketing ploy to get you to buy more rollers?  This will be the last time I order one of these. (PS. Does anyone want my 18 never-been-used JUMBO rollers?)</li>
    <li> You will love these!!!  It takes minutes to curl my hair!!!  My hair is shinier and silkier after each use.</li>
    <li> You can only steam one at a time and depending on the size of the roll it is supposed to be on there up to 5min. Therefore If you Were To follow the directions it can take you up to 2 hours to put them in one head.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 other hot roller sets and returned them. The curlers didn&#x27;t stay in or they were defective. This is by far the best set. The curls last, it was easy and the rollers stayed in with no problem. You also get a lot more for the money. I have thick coarse hair and these are great.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law saw these in a magazine ad and wanted some for christmas.  She loves them.  She loves the body these give to her hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has NEVER held curls.  These Caruso Rollers are fabulous!!!  I have tried lots of things in the past (putting hair spray all over the curls after styling)...I do not like hair spray so when I used the Caruso rollers the first time I just left my hair product free....I could NOT believe how well and long the curls stayed in my hair.  Thank you so much:)</li>
    <li> I bought the steam rollers to try to get away from frying my hair with \\&quot;iron\\&quot; products.    They do keep my hair soft and healthy looking.  Even though you have to do one curler at a time, it only takes seconds for the curler to heat up.   So that is not a problem.      However the curls do not last more than a couple of hours.   And that is indoors.  Outdoors, if there is wind or any humidity...curls are gone almost instantly.    The new model also shows 6 large and 6 jumbo rollers.    But they are combining those rollers --calling them large/jumbo  So you are going to get 12 very large rollers.    These are all set to be put on Ebay, as I cannot use that many jumbo rollers.    (This will be a good thing for someone with very long hair)    I am going to now invest in an expensive styling mousse, to try to get these curls to hold better.  Wish I had the great experience with this roller system as some of you have had.</li>
    <li> Just love this steam hair setter!!  Have used them for many years, does not dry my hair out nor cause split ends.    Way fast for fixing hair style to start your day.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Curls do not last at all. My hair was flat within an hour even after applying strong hold hair spray. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> I got excited for this product because I have thick hair that is extremely straight.  The different sizes of rollers seemed promising to help me achieve different curl styles while avoiding looking like I just stepped out of a prom from 1989.  Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t even live close to my expectations.  The curlers don&#x27;t even curl my hair unless I use the small size.  The large and jumbo (the majority of rollers in the set) are completely useless in my hair.  The steam never feels that hot and subsequently my hair comes out in a half-curled state making me look like I have curly hair that I&#x27;ve slept on for a few days. not cute.  If you&#x27;re debating between traditional electric rollers and this alternative, my vote hands down would be some traditional electric rollers. These are a let down.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that does not like to hold a curl, try the Caruso Steam hair setter.  You will be amazed how well they work on hard to hold hair.  I have tried regular hot setters they never work. Steam is the only way to go, last all day curls. The large rollers for soft curls and as you go down in curler size the tighter the curl. You will love them.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and well packaged.  Works well and gives my hair a lot of body.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t curled my hair since I was a kid, except for using a round brush. I figured curling irons would damage my hair but when I read about these steam curlers I thought I&#x27;d try. Love the ease of use, and versatality of looks I can create.</li>
    <li> Does not curl and heat up well enough should have sent back</li>
    <li> I have purchased 4 or 5 Caruso hairsetters over the years and loved them! I used them at least 5 days a week and they usually lasted 3 or 4 years.  This one is different....doesn&#x27;t heat up properly and wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair.  Since I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel right about returning it.  I still have the curlers to use with another unit.  I don&#x27;t know if this is an isolated case or if the product quality has changed.</li>
    <li> I successfully used this unit once.  This is the second setting, half of my hair is rolled, and the unit died.  Both uses were with distilled water.  I was practicing for a wedding tomorrow.  All of you who scream that we need smaller government, please let up enough so that we can have more consumer protection put into place.  I&#x27;m tired of working hard for my money and having it stolen by unscrupulous manufacturers who know that there is a problem with their products made in China and don&#x27;t care because they don&#x27;t have to care.  If quality control regulations were in place and it cost manufacturers fine money, we would get our products manufactured in the United States once again.</li>
    <li> Works and travels well</li>
    <li> Awkward to use, feels cheap. Returned.</li>
    <li> Great curlers. Good quality. This steam heat is so much better for your hair. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few friends.</li>
    <li> Works great on thin, straight hair to make it look full and bouncy.  I don&#x27;t use the covers of the rollers--clips instead because the covers put a crease in my hair.  This is my fourth set, but this one has dual voltage, so I use it internationally.  These rollers work much better than any other electric rollers I have ever used.  Keep them clean so they last for a long time.  I really recommend these to folks with limp hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these rollers. Do not listen to anyone who rated it only one or two stars. It is without a doubt the BEST product on the market for curls. My curls stay in for 3 or 4 days with no hairspray. When I use a curling iron and A LOT of hairspray it usually only lasts me a day! 5+++++ stars!!!! GREAT PRODUCT! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Caruso hair setter for years now and I needed a new one so I got this no-salt one.  I love this hair setter to make hair look so much better.  I use is two - three times a week.  With long hair I have to use it the day after washing to set the style. otherwise it&#x27;s fly away.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> I have used these curlers for over 15 years and I love the curls it makes and they tend to last for days.  Great product.  This is the 3rd set I have used in 15 years!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this, instead of using a curling iron. Quicker + less damage. The curls last longer too! Luv it!</li>
    <li> This particular purchase was somewhat of a disappointment. I&#x27;m having to wait much too long between each curler. As it gets older this does happen, but this one is much too slow right now. I&#x27;ll be writing to Caruso for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Amazing I use rollers all the time but these are definitely my favourites</li>
    <li> My hair is very difficult to curl so this item has been a huge help. On the negative side the machine does not have an on off switch, that is done by plugging it in. I have burned my fingers a couple of tumes, but i only have myself to blame for that. I find the best way to use this is to steam roll my hair   first,  then re-enforce with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I had high expectation on this product after having read the reviews. Unfortunately, both my daughter&#x27;s and my straight Asian hair did not hold the curls for even half day. I am very disappointed and will return the product. Amazon is great in honoring the return and taking care of the return shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to a curling iron if you have the time,  better for your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad they still make them. However, I think that the original set I used when you had to add the salt to the water, worked much better. The curl seemed to take better when the salt was added.</li>
    <li> I had an older set and needed to replace them so I bought almost the exact same item. It came with more rollers than my original which was great. Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t send all the sizes they said was in the box.</li>
    <li> I have very fine long hair. I was hoping this product would give me a nice curl that would last all night. It took a ridiculous amount of time to even get all the curlers in my hair because you have to individually heat each one. I also ran out of the same size curler and had to use two random small ones in the front of my hair. It turned into a mess, and when I had fixed it so that I looked somewhat passable, the curls fell out in a couple hours. I had a barely wavy look that had taken me an extremely long amount of time to get. It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> So fast and effective!!! Soft hair results, and it doesn&#x27;t harm your hair. I used only the larger rollers.  Loved it! I am going to use this all the time!!</li>
    <li> These are the worst rollers I&#x27;ve ever used. I followed the directions, looked up tutorials on Youtube, did them on wet AND dry hair and nothing!  Nothing worked.  Furthermore, these are made from sponge and seemed very low-quality.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have very fine hair and if I use hot tools to curl my hair in 30 minutes my hair is poker straight again. I don&#x27;t have that problem with the Caruso Steam Haircutter! The steam locks the curls in place. This is the ONLY way I can maintain a curly style for the evening (it even holds a curl in humid weather). In addition, the steam does not damage hair like a hot tool does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the steam seemed like it would make a very natural soft curl, which it does. The problem is the rollers. Since they are foam, in order to have them hold your hair you have to wrap tightly, undoing any good of using a \\&quot;large\\&quot; roller. I wish there was a steam-based system with hard rollers.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for another steam curling set I had. I am completely satisfied! I wish I had bought this one first.</li>
    <li> Just love these. Curls last forever and steam doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
    <li> Thank you for asking. I love Caruso Molecular.  I had mine since it 1st came out. It finally gave out.  I like this model but I just wished that you would have had the 1st one, the one you add salt to the water.  If you ever sell some please let me know until then I will keep using this one&lt;br /&gt;Dolores Ramos</li>
    <li> Love these steam rollers!!! The curl really does last days and it looks so pretty. The only down side i can think of is that the clips to clip the hair to the roller is a little big for the roller if u have thin hair. It unrolls some after i attach it, but it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference, just a little annoying.</li>
    <li> This probably works well for those with straighter and longer hair than mine, but it was very hard for me.  I have frizzy/wavy shoulder-length hair.  I had a very hard time getting the ends to hold on the rubber sponge, and getting the clip to hold tight to my head. If I used a flat iron on my hair first and then did manage to get the curlers in, my hair looked nice, but that defeats the purpose of trying to get away from my curling iron.</li>
    <li> I already have a set for myself.  This one is for my niece.  Great for thick hair!</li>
    <li> I had a set in the 80&#x27;s and loved the healthy curl they gave my long hair.  My sister asked me about them the other day so I dug them out of the attic.  The base still worked but the sponges on the rollers were dry-rotted.  I was going to buy new rollers here but instead of spending $30 on two sets of jumbo rollers, I popped for $35 and an entire new set, base and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY pleased when my set arrived and contained not 6 jumbos, but 10 jumbo rollers!  They shorted me on the petite, which is fine with me because I don&#x27;t use those.  So instead of receiving 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large, and 6 jumbo rollers, I got: 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium and 10 jumbo!  It works perfectly for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of these curlers.  Hot rollers are HEAVY and HOT (I had to stuff cotton balls between a hot roller and my ear, it was so hot!) and they HURT! These are so light, it&#x27;s not a bother at all to have them in while they dry a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of use out of this new set! Bring on the curls!</li>
    <li> I have perfectly straight hair that could be considered \\&quot;fine\\&quot; in terms of diameter, although I also have a lot of hair (in terms of strands).  I have used hot rollers for years, and they give me a very nice look, but I was concerned about using them every day because of damage.  These rollers are not hot, and therefore, less damaging.  In terms of the curl they produced, it felt much smoother (usually I have some frizzing with the hot rollers) and looked more natural than with hot rollers.  I left the rollers in for only 20 minutes, and it took me about 5 minutes to put them in... the system is very very easy to use, and the whole process was less time intensive than when I use hot rollers.  I used the jumbo sized rollers, and they gave me a big, voluminous curl... I think I could get more of a spiral effect with smaller rollers, but I mostly use rollers for volume rather than for tight curls.  I am so pleased to have found a solution for every day volume that is less damaging and requires minimal product.</li>
    <li> This is the second Caruso Molecular Hairsetter I have owned and this one is better because you don&#x27;t have to add salt to the water. I love the way it makes my hair curl and the ends aren&#x27;t dry and split like with a curling iron. I had to purchase more small and petite rollers, as the ones included weren&#x27;t enough for my hair, but I still would buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers....so easy...and healthy for your hair.  I use them every day and the curl really stays in.  My hair is highlighted and the moisture is good for my hair....better than heat rollers.  I&#x27;ll never go back to heat rollers...love these.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my hair. It was difficult to use.</li>
    <li> My hair is relatively short, fine, and thinning. Tending toward skull-clutching hairdos against my will, I was losing all hope of ever seeing pouf again. I was bummed. But the steam curlers changed my life. The curlers heat quickly, curl quickly, and the curls endure (unless it&#x27;s very humid and windy). This may not be the best product for thick hair, but I highly recommend it for thin.</li>
    <li> I used this 5-6 times and it will no longer steam. Going to see if I can get some response from company (not optomistic) but would not recommend and I would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have NO idea how I&#x27;ve survived so long without my Caruso steam rollers. I read mixed reviews on these and decided to purchase it anyway considering most of the reviews were good. My hair is very long and heavy so when I use a curling iron or a straightener to curl my hair it never really stayed in long. You can go from a beautiful wave to looking like curly sue with these, depending on what style you are going for. They heat up very quickly and even having long hair, I can have my hair rolled and set within 10 minutes and I especially LOVE that aspect. Granted, the set isn&#x27;t compact but considering the lasting curls I get, I can deal with it. I would definitely recommend this product to pretty much anyone. The different size curlers provided mean that you can do so many different things with your hair. Pay no attention to the negative reviews, BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and after using a curling iron for years I felt it was time for a change.  These rollers heat up quickly, are not damaging to the hair and give you a beautiful curl that stays in all day.  I would highly recommend these rollers.  It only take about three minutes to curl my entire head of hair.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot from this hairsetter because my friend raves about it and so do the Amazon reviews!  For me, the product is okay but not stellar.  It&#x27;s hard to wrap my hair around the spongy roller.  Maybe I&#x27;m just used to rolling my hair around harder surfaces, like a curling iron or plastic roller.  Anyway, perhaps someone needs to train me in the way of Caruso!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Caruso hair curlers for years now (decades actually). I have long hair and it is hard sometimes to find products that actually work. I love the way my hair looks with beautiful fluffy waves of curls down my back. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed with Caruso hair steam curlers lately is that the unit does not seem to last as it once did- like I could literally go for years before having to buy a new unit- now it last about a year before going out (maybe 2 if lucky and you hardly use it). I use mine about 4 to 5 time a week, so it gets a lot of use plus I have long hair so it takes me longer- so that is probably the reason why mine don&#x27;t last that long. I recently started purchasing the Revlon version of the steam curlers- which cost less then the Caruso brand- but I noticed right away that the competitor&#x27;s steam generated does not get as hot as the Caruso&#x27;s brand did. All in all, I next unit will be another Caruso unit- I will splurge and spend a little bit more money to get the better product.</li>
    <li> Steam always holds the curl longer. Good investment.</li>
    <li> I had a steam setter several years ago and loved it.(also made by caruso). when the heating element went out after several years i was heartbroken to find one unavailable to me. when I saw this one on amazon my prayers were ansewered. Ladies if you have straight  hair and want fullness , wave, or full blown curls ,  this is the product for you. It works  very fast and does little damage, if used correctly. I would recommend a product called recovery complex by ban de tere, or glss by redkin on your ends AFTER you take out the curlers. also if tou are going for the curly look do not brush, use fingers to seperate or large pick. by the way I am a lisenced cosmotologist.</li>
    <li> this little thing barely takes up any space in my bathroom, it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy to use and it works great.... sometimes i don&#x27;t even have to heat up the rollers... i just put them on get dressed and by the time i&#x27;m done i take them off and i&#x27;m good to go.....:-)... and i have african american hair, so for this roller set to do such a good job on my hair means i&#x27;m never parting away from it...:-).... i really do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great rollers - love them! Shipping was a little slow...but worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They are quick and easy.I have medium long hair and still have extra curlers left when I finish setting my hair.It lasts me through the day but I do need to reset for the evening. I had them years ago and you had to add salt.The tote bag makes packing and moving simple.</li>
    <li> DONOT buy this . I owned 2 of these many years ago. The 1st lasted about 2 yrs., the 2nd last a few months. I had been trying for years to find this in stores to no avail ( now I see why no one wants to carry them ), after finding it here and ordering it,It lasted one week, went up in smoke after ONE WEEK. NEVER again !!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best rollers to use. The steam locks in the curls and gives great body to your hair even in high humidity.  It causes less damage to the hair compaired to regular heat irons or curlers. Your hiar will look and feel as if you had it done in a salon.  Buy this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers!  Keep my hair set all day.  Easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I had one of these back in the 90&#x27;s.  That version required adding salt and it emitted a fierce very hot steam which heated up the rollers quickly and produced glossy perfect curls within minutes that lasted until my next shampoo. I loved it and used it until that fateful evening when I tripped the cord and dumped scalding hot water on my foot -which I do not recommend, by the way. I stopped using it and have no idea what became of the unit after that.&lt;br /&gt; Fast forward to this week, when I decided to get myself another and try again -this one. Big difference. The steam in this unit is nowhere near hot enough. I can hold my hand over the steam and barely feel the heat. I have to leave the roller on the unit  and in my hair much longer than on the previous version and it barely curls. I get some curl but not like I did with the old unit. I have thick hair that falls just below my shoulder ( much shorter than it was in the 90&#x27;s)  and it usually won&#x27;t curl the entire length of the strand, no matter what method I use to roll it and I have to keep them in longer or blast with a hair dryer. Alas, the curls I do get are more like waves no matter how tight I roll them and are dull,dry and ugly instead of glossy and beautiful as with the old unit. Worse, they don&#x27;t last long.  I want the &amp;#34;must add salt&amp;#34; version back! This is a very wimpy hair tool and I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll send it back. I have much better luck with a wet-set using plain old curlers. I am so disappointed! Regular hot rollers and curling irons don&#x27;t give me long lasting curls either, which is why I came back to Caruso. So sad.  By the way, I&#x27;ve read reviews by people who have this model and the Ionic model that say they can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two, so while tempted to try the Ionic, I probably won&#x27;t.  :-(</li>
    <li> Was impressed to see the number of reviews. However feels like it is not that great or better than other electric rollers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every method possible using these...leaving them on a little longer, leaving them on less.  I&#x27;ve left them in for over an hour.  And everytime I take them out I have gorgeous, shiny spiral curls but within about half an hour the curls ALWAYS fall.  I will continue to use this though as I&#x27;m still left with super shiny hair and volume and I don&#x27;t want to go back to damaging heat products.</li>
    <li> I used to have a caruso curler, when it finally broke on me I went to buy another one and could not find it in a retail store anywhere, then I found it with yall. I love my caruso curler and I have not used another curler since. Whoever thought of this was genius.</li>
    <li> The curls that you get with this steamer are very curly and long lasting. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hairsetter. It works so fast, it&#x27;s easy and unlike hot irons, never dries out my hair. Soft, beautiful curls guaranteed! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> this is great, when it works. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it because after awhile, it just stops working. no steam comes out but it is heating up inside and when you place the roller ontop of it, it takes forever just to get a little hot, and then it&#x27;s all wet. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> 1. Color same for all clips making it extremely difficult to find the right size clip.  2. Unit would not steam after 5 uses!  3. Definitely a waste of money for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products on my thick wavy hair and nothing has ever given me curls that will last for more than a few hours...until now.  Curling irons just made my hair frizzy and who has time or energy to put regular rollers in your hair every day/night?  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair was dry and it promised to moisturize it.  I found the steam does help to moisturize, however, the curlers are bulky and the caps to secure the curlers are difficult to snap into place.  I have medium short hair, and the curlers fell out of my hair.  I now use the steamer with velcro curlers and it works much better.  Wish I could have bought just the steamer.</li>
    <li> The biggest problem I find with this product, is the deterioration of the rollers after such a short time, and the cost to  buy new ones.  Also, years ago, it was possible to buy the rollers in the stores (Target, Walmart etc.) that carried the entire set.  That&#x27;s not possible anymore, so you have to pay for shipping whenever you purchase new rollers, which is quite often the way they fall apart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have used these for years on hard to curl hair.I have found they work on most hair type.with a little practice you can set a full head in short order.The other brand of rollers will fit this unit and can be found here cheaper.</li>
    <li> These things rock. My husband got them for me for Christmas, and I wasn&#x27;t sure about them, but they rock. Buy them. I am someone who has no idea how to do hair. Every time I use these curlers, I get compliments for EVERYONE. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Buy them.</li>
    <li> I have very difficult to curl hair.  I used to try to curl it with hot rollers, professional curling irons, etc.  The results were mediocre curls that didn&#x27;t make it through the day.  When my sister told me about the Caruso rollers, I must say I didn&#x27;t believe her.  I decided to try hers out when I was visiting one day.  I LOVED the bouncy soft spiral curls it made and couldn&#x27;t believe it lasted THREE days!!!  I went out and bought my own, I get tonz of compliments and LOVE my Caruso rollers!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 40-something female with mixed hair texture (curly in the back, straight in the front and on the sides).  I also have A LOT of thick, brown hair.  These curlers not only work quickly and well, but also the curl lasts for a long time. I have tried curling irons which work ok but these ... amazing.  Now, if only they would sell enough large rollers in a set for my super abundant hair ...</li>
    <li> I might try the product again, but the first go? What a waste of time! I bought it hoping to relplace my awesome hot roller set that went kaput after years of use and abuse. Read the whole pamphlet, set my hair with the rollers, (which took a while) dried it with the hair dryer just like it was suggested, removed rollers... And...&lt;br /&gt;Nothing. The curls fell out almost instantly! I have a lot of hair, rather long, and mostly fine. Like I said, I might go through all the effort again, but hot rollers are the only sure fire guarantee for a good curl. Invest in those instead!</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE ROLLERS. I would never use any other roller other than a Caruso. Very happy these are still around! They&#x27;re not high heat, won&#x27;t break hair and you can do a tight curl all the way to a wave with these. They don&#x27;t leave hair feeling frizzy. If you are a performer you could count on these to hold (even hair that normally won&#x27;t hold) curl because of the moisture infusion from the steam. Leaves hair silky even after a frizzy blowdry I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love these rollers.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and use heated rollers daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these dual voltage heated rollers to use abroad.  However I have been using these at home in UK in favour of my original heaters because you don&#x27;t need to wait long to heat up and you don&#x27;t need to leave them in long for them to set (15 mins).  The rollers provide lots more curl than my normal ones.</li>
    <li> My hair is very short and thin, this curlsetter makes my hair look full and curly.</li>
    <li> Before buying these I was so skeptical because 1) they&#x27;re a great price, 2) they don&#x27;t damage, and 3) you don&#x27;t need hairspray for the curls to hold. Here&#x27;s what I absolutely love about my Carusos...My hair is very long and to curl it with an iron takes me over an hour. Using the Caruso (and taking my sweet time) it took me 20. Since it creates curls with water vapor there is literally no damage, and if I &#x27;mess&#x27; up a curl, I can redo it in less than a minute. Normal hot rollers burn my ears if I roll them anywhere near them. The Caruso rollers are warm, but you can hardly notice it. Now, the most surprising factor about my Caruso set which I LOVE is that there is no need for hairspray. At first I didn&#x27;t buy this. Even after I tried it without spritzing it with hairspray (and getting beautiful curls that literally lasted a full day), the second time I took my rollers out, I spritzed them. It definitely was not needed. The beauty of it is that this set allows you to hold the curls and have you hair feel perfectly natural while doing so. Adding hairspray was just obnoxious feeling. A few tips I learned from other reviewers which helped me a lot were 1)use distilled water. I read lots of ladies saying their unit stopped working and it was fixed by cleaning it (which you can do with a vinegar mix, I believe.) 2)Like the directions say, I used a blow dryer on cold to &#x27;set&#x27; in the curls. You really don&#x27;t need to let the rollers stay in your hair long at all before setting them. 3)Sectioning your hair really helps with the quick curls. I know this is a routine for most rollers, but, still helpful :) A couple more things I think are great about this set is that you can play around with the different styles and sizes of the curlers. The extra rollers are so inexpensive, I plan on buying some more mediums (my favorite with my length of hair). Also, it&#x27;s very portable. It comes in a bag with all the rollers and the unit (which is the size of a grapefruit). It does come with 30rollers, but I don&#x27;t see myself using all 30 anyways, I&#x27;d probably only have to travel with half that.  I&#x27;m in love with this product as much as the rest of the world. It&#x27;s so great. No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I have been using hot curlers in my hair since I was a teenager!! I was always wary of these because I thought the steam would make my hair frizz. I have been so pleased with them. They are easy to use, heat up quickly and they stay in without a lot of crazy pinning. My hair looks shiny when I take them down and it lasts! I hope this is the last set of hot curlers I ever have to buy! They are great!</li>
    <li> After using these rollers for over fifteen years my hair now has a natural wave.  I have very fine limp hair and this system adds lots of body without frizz.  I don&#x27;t know how they would work in a humid area though, the mountains in California are fairly dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in late 80&#x27;s-early 90s&#x27; and love it...used to use it in the salon since the curls last SO muich longer than an iron,or heated rollers...Mine just died a few months ago ((( yes, it lasted that long with pretty regular to heavy use))).  I just replaced mine with this one and could NOT be happier. This new model doesn&#x27;t require salt to be added to the water. It is so fast to set my hair, it always turns out beautiful, and the curls last all day &amp; night. I always get tons of compliments whenever I use my caruso curler and I am so happy with this purchase! I DO recommend it regularly, and will be purchasing a 2nd soon for a gift. Flat irons,curling irons,blow dryers,etc all dry out hair so badly....this is working only on steam &amp; actually makes my hair so soft &amp; shiny. I can&#x27;t say enough about it..buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I love them.  I have very curly hair and they make it look wavy and healthy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try hot rollers and thought these seemed to be a reasonable first try purchase. I took them to my hairdresser to show me how to put them in properly. We were both a bit skeptical. When we took off the covers and unrolled the curler the curls were amazing! Strong, set, beautiful! This little set packs a punch! My hairdresser was so impressed she wants to get this same set! Works great!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the rave reviews about this product I decided to order a Caruso Set for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it on Thursday!  Some how I got free shipping :)  Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is simple and easy to use!  My hair came out beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;As a woman who is not good at doing my own hair (I acutally don&#x27;t like doing my hair at all) I think I will be skipping my once a month appointment at my beautician and saving a little more money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4a/b natural hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little bit of practice I am sure I will get the hang of it all!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try these curlers as I have tried many others with not good results. The reviews on this product sold me on it, but I was dissapointed. Although the curl does seem to last in my hair (not even overnight or for days as the curlers claim), the quality of the curl really stinks. I used the large and jumbo rollers all over my head and some came out a real tight pretty curl, others came out wavy and some had no curl at all. I tried it a few times on my hair with dissapointing results each time. It does give my hair great volume and body. It made it feel soft and healthy. But if I cant acheive a somewhat standard looking curl throuought my hair, its not worth it. I kind of looked like the crazy lady down the street... I have longish, medium thinkness, straight hair that shouldnt have been a problem for these curlers, but they failed to deliver. Next on my list to try is a conair curl secret... There&#x27;s got to be something out there that will allow my hair to keep its curl all day!</li>
    <li> i love this i use to have one many years ago it is healthy for your hair and quick great curls</li>
    <li> Wonderful buy. Easy to use. Curls look natural. The best featur: it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
    <li> i read all the reviews, this was even recommended by my stylist... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I agree the curl lasts and it definitely gets rid of frizzies, I absolutely **cannot** keep this stupid things in my hair!! I roll up a section, put on the clampy thing and by the time I&#x27;ve reached for the next roller, it had just slid right off. It takes me twice as long to roll my hair because I have to futz with each roller many times. And if it doesn&#x27;t roll right out, it slips and sort of hangs leaving a huge clamp line in the middle of the wave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length, fine hair - lots of hair, but it is very fine. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t work for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> clips to hard to put on</li>
    <li> I feel this is the best! Has all the different size rollers you need to change you styles. Works fast.</li>
    <li> These are  my first impressions of the Caruso C97953 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Plug it in and it&#x27;s ready within a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Rollers are ready to use within 5 seconds of putting them on the steamer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  You won&#x27;t burn you hand or your scalp.  Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;4.  By the time you&#x27;ve steamed and put on one roller, each successive roller heats just as quickly as you are sectioning your hair for the next one.  Truly, it moves along very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short, straight, fine hair and have had a real tough time styling it.  I&#x27;m not a kid, so the messy, shaggy look makes me look tired and older.  Could never find a curling iron the right width and I don&#x27;t have the dexterity to try to wind my hair on a curling iron.  I tried ceramic hot rollers and they were too hot to handle and uncomfortable on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these right out of the box!  Yes, there are 30 rollers and I certainly don&#x27;t need all of them with my short hair, but the medium and large rollers are perfect for my needs. I don&#x27;t like a tight curl.  This gives me soft, smooth lift.  I was concerned that the clamps would leave a mark.... they don&#x27;t!  By the time I wound my last curler, I was ready to remove them.  It took me less than 15 minutes from start to finish.  I figured that I would have a bit of a learning curve, but quite frankly I was delighted with the results I got first time.  In fact, if there were small, loose strands that needed help, I simply rolled it and held it with my fingers without the clamp for a matter of seconds to finish off the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am half way through my day at work and it&#x27;s holding up really well.  I will update the review after a couple of weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I am doing what others suggested, using distilled water.  I want this puppy to last a long time!</li>
    <li> This product gives wonderful curls (size of your choosing!) that are bouncy and soft. Because of the steam, there is no way it could ever dry out your hair/ends like regular curling irons. The curls last well into the next day, or at least in my case, until I wash my hair again! The curler covers hold hold hold and don&#x27;t come out until I take them out. They \\&quot;click\\&quot; into place. I roll my hair and by the time I&#x27;m done w/my makeup, it&#x27;s time to take the rollers out! There is no hurry up and wait. I use to have the one that required salt, but this one, not requiring salt, works just as wonderfully without salt! I am on my second setter. The first lasted me years and years. The rollers foam finally gave out on me I used it so much. But after throwing mine away, I realized I had to have another. I&#x27;m sure this one will last just as long, if not longer w/o the salt to worry with. If anything changes, I&#x27;ll let you know! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I used a previous edition of this product that lasted for 19 years. While I was satisfied with the results, I find that the Caruso C97953 is much improved and easier to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best beauty product I have ever bought for myself.  After I bought the first set, I went ahead and get 3 more sets for my friends and relatives in one month.  I can&#x27;t believe such a simple design can deliver so good result.  The first time I used it, I was amazed.  It actually did curl my hair in a very short time.  A friend of mine introduced this product to me, she is almost 70 years old but I always admire her hair. She definitely knows how to take care of it and make it so stylish. It always looks shining and full.  When I asked her who did her hair, to my surprise, she said she did her own hair and she never had it permed.  After I know her &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this styling set for my own.  I did my homework before ordered by reading lots of positive and negative reviews.  I followed the advice of the helpful positive reviewers.  I had high expectation for this production.  However, when I looked at the mirror after removal of the curlers, I am still amazed by the result, it exceeded my expectation.  I was very pleased.  The second day, I still couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself in the mirror.  I always liked to have waving or curly hair styles.  However, the few times I did got my hair permed, I was disappointed every time.  They tend to over do it, either made my hair frizzy, or made me look like a cartoon cat shocked by electric.  It looked unnatural and dry.  To make that worse, it stayed like that for a loooooong time.  In the morning I couldn&#x27;t stop combing my hair as if by combing it I could make it straight again.  One time, I did spent $300 dollars to straighten it.  Since then I never tried to perm again.  That is why I was overly joyful when I see the result after 15 minutes using this product.  My hair looks moisturized, shining and naturally waved.  With some practice I can now style my hair very quickly.  I can try different styles by using different size of curler and curl to different directions.  I can be very creative, simply use water to straighten and redo if I don&#x27;t like the result.  Yes, never will I need to perm my hair again.  I wish I had this product earlier in my life.  But it was not bad at my age I can look like a girl again.  I bring this set with me wherever I travel.  My curl stays to the second day, become a wave style, the third day if I still don&#x27;t wash, it turns into a very shallow wave,  Still look good if I add one curl at the bank.  I am oriental, have black, short-medium length hair.  At age 50+, I finally realized that I have beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is short, very fine and flat. It would not hold a curl until I was introduced to this steam hairsetter. Now I can roll my hair and have bounce and curl for several days. Love the choice of curler size although I only use the petite, small and medium for the time being. Looks like I have twice the amount of hair now. Have gotten many compliments!</li>
    <li> After reading many electric hair roller reviews, I bought the Caruso set. Love them! Very easy to use. Only takes a minute to heat up the steam, and then just a few seconds to heat up each roller. As you are putting one roller in your hair, you can heat the next; hence no wait time. Love that the rollers do not damage my hair - they do not get very hot and are never too hot to handle. I start removing the rollers almost immediately after I have put them all in my hair - the result is very loose curls, which is just right for me. I usually roll my hair right after I have washed and dried it while it is still very slightly damp - this results in a looser curl. If you want tighter curls, dry your hair completely and leave the rollers in for 10 - 15 minutes. My method takes about 5 minutes total from start to finish which is easier and quicker than using a curling iron (and way less damage to your hair),  In short, look no further - BUY THESE! Oh, one more thing - the rollers are very easy to pack on trips - I put the heating unit and rollers in a gallon freezer bag and pack them in my suitcase. They are very lightweight and don&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
    <li> I was excitied to receive the Caruso Molecular Steam Hairsetter with Rollers in the mail.  My hairdresser recommended it, and the Amazon reviews were positive. I was disappointed, however.  Even though I ordered extra rollers, I still did not have enough for all of my hair.  Because I ran out of the mediums, I substituted with small and large rollers, and the hairstyle, when completed, looked nice. But the curl did not hold.  Within a few hours, I lost the curl.  I thought this product would work because my hair has some natural body and is neither too thick nor too thin.  I have soft water in my house as well, which should be helpful.  I&#x27;ve tried this product a few times now, thinking that perhaps I need more practice, but I still cannot get the curl to stay.  When I spoke to my hairdresser he commented that perhaps my hair is too thick to hold the curls.  So my suggestion to anyone considering purchasing this product is to reconsider it if your hair is slightly thick.  It won&#x27;t hold the curl.</li>
    <li> It is really safe for hair and takes like 30 minutes (for my thick hair) to make nice curls! Too bad I can&#x27;t attache picture)</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and store. It curls fast. The only problem is having to buy extra small curlers because my hair is short. There should be the same amount of small rollers as large.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on here I just had to go out and buy one. I was worried about the negative reviews where someone said people with thick hair should not even bother to buy this because it wouldn&#x27;t curl well, or hold the curl. They don&#x27;t know what they are talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair (mid back) and it&#x27;s very thick. I have bought several curling irons, most with a very high heat setting (around 420), and as soon as I finish one side of my hair and start on the other side, my curled side has gone flat:( (so I returned my curling iron and exchanged it for the steam rollers). Man I am so glad I did! My hair is super curly! I also have long layers in my hair and it looks so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I finally found something that will curl my hair without damaging it. I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, and they also sell the large steam rollers by themselves because the box comes with mixed sizes, so I do plan on going to buy some extra rollers because I like the bigger ones better.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and has a tendency to droop (no matter the weather) during the day, even though I used my curling iron  every morning.  I was not happy about what I called my frumpy maw-maw look.  During my last visit to my hairdresser, she recommended I try the Caruso sponge rollers.  I had no idea what she was talking about, so she graciously gave me a run-through informational tour regarding them and how to use them.  I ordered the Caruso and less than a week later, I went from frumpy maw-maw to oh, that curl and body.  This system gives me curl I&#x27;ve never had, and I can work with it so that I have a smooth do that stays.  There&#x27;s even enough curl to take me through a second day.  One thing I especially love is that my hair is subjected to moisture through these rollers and no longer has to be the victim of the dry, hot heat from my curling iron.  So, for me, Caruso sings beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> These curlers are good. Takes a bit to get used to them but once you get a routine on using them they work well. Really keeps the nice relaxed curls in my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse Asian, stick straight hair - these are the only rollers that will work without harming my hair!</li>
    <li> Love, love it!  Never thought a steam curler would tame frizz!  It&#x27;s like magic!  I have coarse hair which tends to be very frizzy, but these work fabulously!  Wish I had discovered this sooner (like in my teens!)</li>
    <li> It took a little while to figure out how to use this hairsetter - but once I realized how it worked - I loved it!  Super product - thanks again.  I love the Caruso hairsetter!</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical at first, only ever having used typical sets of old fashioned steam rollers... I had an old set that lasted me for years that I regretted departing with for a very long time. My hair is very fine and short to perhaps medium length and sometimes almost runs into long...     I was shopping on Amazon and also on \\&quot;folica.com\\&quot; as per my sisters recommendation.     I found a set of rollers I thought I could be happy with, a regular, traditional type of rollers... and was nearly ready to order them, but wanted to check out the competition! Really glad I did!    At first I thought... what are these? But the positive reviews on both websites was difficult to ignore.    I ordered these based on the positive reviews, but also took note of more recent reviews that these rollers (in their most recent redesign with cheaper materials, apparently) don&#x27;t last very long... Please take note... I checked, these rollers are warranted for a whole year and I will be taking advantage of that if they happen to be short lived!    With that said, I could not be happier with the results of these rollers. I tracked the package via Amazon and saw that my package had arrived around 1:30 pm on Friday afternoon at my local post office. I was so eager to get these rollers I went to pick them up directly, knowing my mail carrier would otherwise deliver them the next day. I did not want to wait!    I tried them out tonight!     WOW!!!    They work! Just for fun I rolled my hair in tight, tight curls this evening... just to see how this would hold up!!! WHOA!!! Tight curs it is!!! Had a blast experimenting! Seeing how the curls are holding up tonight... I am very confident! I didn&#x27;t even use hair spray as I usually do to maintain the curl! But I still can if I choose to do so, and the hairspray, as all other options, still remain.    These rollers are just exactly what I had hoped for! Can HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I had an older model before and like it.  This one is smaller and does not use salt which is a plus.   I like the product.  The only kind that will keep a curl in my straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have no words. These are truly a must have. I like to do a lot of the vintage pin up hair and these give you that look in literally minutes. They are super easy to use, they heat up in just 5 seconds, and they come with a large variety of sizes. The best I&#x27;ve ever used. No complaints what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> I own about eight different sets of hot rollers. This is easily my favorite one. If you style your hair often, these rollers are great because the steam heat does not damage your hair the way dry heat can. Another plus is that the steamer heats up almost immediately. Some of my hot roller sets take almost half an hour to get to the right temperature.     My hair is very thick and straight and needs extra persuasion to hold a style. These rollers work amazingly. The trick is that your hair must be completely dry before you start rolling up your hair. Do not use product before you roll. Let the rollers cool and dry out completely before unrolling. Only after you take your hair out of the rollers and style should you use product to hold the style.    Another plus is that this set is light and quite portable, therefore excellent for travel.     I can plug the steamer in and have my hair all rolled up in about 10 minutes. Add in another 15-20 minutes to let the rollers cool and set your hair, another 10 to style, and you can have a pretty fancy updo in under an hour.     I also appreciate how easy it is to buy additional rollers. That is probably my one complaint about this kit--that there aren&#x27;t quite enough rollers in any size to do your whole head if you have a lot of hair. But it&#x27;s definitely worth it to buy the extra rollers, because this is simply the best hair setter out there.</li>
    <li> I have been a caruso hair setter fan for years and years. I was always told when my hair was set that I had a Marylin Monroe hairdo. I bought my hair setter eventually after years of use finally conked out. I felt though it was an expensive setter, I got my moneys worth. I bought another caruso setter just over a year ago and it burned out and was almost shocked.I did use it with salt and tried it without and the curls did not last. I just had to buy two more setters as they also come with multiple size rollers and I don&#x27;t use the jumbo at all. I am still using salt and am worried these two will also be out of commision in no time. I wish this company would go back to the old style.</li>
    <li> I thought they stopped selling these curlers and then I thought to check on Amazon! I love them because it gives you the look of vintage over-night rollers without the discomfort of sleeping with curlers on. My hair is thick and resists curl, the steam locks gentle waves in place, something I have never been able to accomplish with curling irons.    I recently used them for a special event and I ended with polished gentle waves. When I was in high school I used these rollers all the time for dances and I will continue to use them now that I found them again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these rollers!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick hair and have always had issues curling my hair and having the curls last more than 30 minutes!  I would spend an hour trying to curling my hair, only to have the curls go straight shortly after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The day I got them, I immediately had to try them out.  I rolled a few rollers in my hair and let it set for 15-20 minutes.  When I took the first roller out, I was completely amazed!  My hair had a super-curl-bounce!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re so easy to use &amp; it only takes me about 20 minutes to roll all of my hair up.  While I let them set, I can do my makeup and other things.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These rollers are the best thing I have ever used on my hair for curls.  I was so skeptical about them, but I wish I had bought these sooner!</li>
    <li> I have had my Caruso Hair setters for years! With three children and a busy work schedule, plus extra long, thick hair, it makes my mornings a snap! Get up, set hair, get kids up, dressed and fed, clean house, get dressed and put my make up on, unroll my hair and hit it with a couple shots of hairspray and out the door I go! I work in sales and my hair stands up to the midwest wind all day, and I always get compliments on it! I have to replace the curlers every couple of years, but it is worth it. I only go to the hair dresser for a cut, and I do the styling! If there are a few things that I got to have is my hairsetter, mascara and lipstick, and I am set everyday! My hair feels so soft everytime I use it, and I don&#x27;t have the dry split ends that you would have any other curler. You will fall in love with it after the first time that you use it! Thank you Caruso for such a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> The cover clips trap the moiture in and they never dry, had them in for over an hour and still wet. Finally took them out, blew hair dry and curled with curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, though a lot of it.  These curlers are absolutely the best.  it takes me 10 minutes to curl my hair for the day.  I put them on and leave them in while I do some make up and then remove them.  seriously only 10 minutes.  Best purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Caruso Curlers and I love them. They work very quickly and give you long lasting strong curls. When I remove the rollers I just leave the hair in place for a few minutes before fixing to give the curls time to cool completely and set.</li>
    <li> Have a set of my own. Bought these for a friend with long hair. Works great, less damaging to hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Simple to use with rollers heated one at a time, so the base unit is small.  Each only takes 4-10 seconds of heating.  Put one in your palm, take the heated one, and instantly put the next one on the unit in one move.  Once you roll with the heated one, the next one is ready.  The plastic shield clips are easy to use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downer is the roller variety.  You get 6 of each: jumbo, large, medium, small and petite.  I really just want the first three.  I wish they had sets of jumbo-large-medium and medium-small-petite.  After I tried it once, I ordered more rollers.  You may want to take all of our word for it, and order more at the same time as the unit to take advantage of the free shipping.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, fabulous and mine forever and ever.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd hairsetter in the past 20 years. I won&#x27;t use anything else. My first one was when it first came out and we had to put salt in the machine with the water! I was panicing when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I hung onto my last set for far too long! It was coming apart. Soooooo happy I found it here!!</li>
    <li> When I tried this hairsetter for the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair looked.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like the WAY it works but I hate that you have to heat each roller individually, which takes longer.  I am always in a hurry in the A. M. and I don&#x27;t like the extra steps.  I would prefer one big unit that heats 6-10 rollers at a time.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit the end of May, here it is July 20 and in less than 2 months my unit is no longer working. I have enjoyed the steam rollers and the results that I have received from them but I cannot afford to replace a unit of this supposed quality and reputation every couple of months. My daughter has an older unit and has enjoyed using it for many years and she recommended that I try one also. So, I am greatly disappointed especially as I am on vacation and now can have funky hair the rest of my trip. I cannot wait to see those vacations pics.</li>
    <li> This was ok, but I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it, that one roller at a time was heated.  I thought it was a set that all rollers heated at the same time.  I really don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gives me just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Your hair comes out beautiful and only takes about 20 minutes from start to finish.  By the time you get it all rolled, you can take it down and you&#x27;re ready to go. My first set lasted about 10 years before I replaced it.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;ve been looking for a new curlers set since the last two I&#x27;ve purchased either wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough or were too cheap and wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair. I like that the curlers have a foam base so they form around your hair perfectly. It&#x27;s a bit different to have to heat each curler individually before use, and the learning curve on it seems to be a little bigger than I anticipated. However, it does heat the curlers very hot and quite quickly. In the time it takes me to figure out how I want a curler in my hair, the next one is ready to go, so I it really doesn&#x27;t even affect anything. In the photo you will notice the base piece. It works by filling the inside of the base with water, about half way, and then placing one curler on the top for steam to make the foam curler hot. Then you remove the foam curler, use it as you like to create the curly look you&#x27;re going for. I suggest putting a new one on the steam base prior to putting the hot curler in your hair, so by time you&#x27;re done the new curler is ready to go. The set comes with a nice plastic bag with handles to store all the pieces of the product in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real issue is the clips that they curlers come with. When I use them on my top layer of hair, I notice that my hair will get a flat \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; in it at the base of the curl and I&#x27;m not a fan of how that looks. To fix that I&#x27;ve been using my own clips on my top layer of curls. Thus, now my only issue is just practicing and perfecting my use of them. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people wore the foam curlers to bed, I have no idea how they do that because even though they&#x27;re foam, they have hard plastic circular ends that I feel would be uncomfortable to lay your head down on... then again mom always said pain is beauty.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT ,, WORKS WELL,, LASTING CURLS,,, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH HARD TO CURL HAIR</li>
    <li> I have owned the Caruso roller system for over 25 years. I bought the first set they had with the salt. Yes, I was shocked once by the old ones one time. Not a pleasant feeling. I purchased the saltless system about 10 years ago. It&#x27;s nice not having to add the salt. I have used these on every kind of hair. In fact I just used them on my niece who has the worst hair. She&#x27;s 12 and was so embarrassed by her hair she kept it in a bun on top of her head. Well, I used my rollers to style her hair for my sisters wedding and she begged me for my roller set. Her hair never looked better. Everyone that saw her wanted to know how she \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; her hair. Needless to say I just ordered her a set of her own. I&#x27;ve now bought 5 sets. I&#x27;ll be a user for life.</li>
    <li> Cool little device. But all it did was add moisture to my hair so it didn&#x27;t hold curl because it was moist. (It takes a long time for my hair to dry with any amount of water in it).</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews. It was a huge mistake. It does not keep my hair curled for longer than an hour. I have attempted different ways to keep the curl, and time after time, it doesn&#x27;t get any better. Also it takes forever for the rollers to get your hair curled.</li>
    <li> Great, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to love this product, but every time Ive used it, I&#x27;ve had the same result--mediocre curls. I read other reviews stating that you shouldn&#x27;t use any types of hair oil or anything like that to ensure that the curls will stay. Ive tried cutting out every thing that may make the curls come out (leave in conditioner, hair oil, etc) and they still do not stay well.</li>
    <li> You can achieve so many different looks with these rollers, there is also a booklet that shows which rollers to use to create the look you want.  Does not damange your hair.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I was given the Caruso rollers as a gift about 1 year ago! I thought they would be hard to use or cumbersome so I kept putting it off. I&#x27;m so glad I tried them today! These are better than a traditional roller set on my fine relaxed hair. I have curls that lasted with drizzle and being squished under a scarf for several hours. I would have given these 5 stars but the sponge roller is a hair grabber! Next time I&#x27;ll use end papers.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Hairsetter about a year ago after my sister bought hers. She has Sisterlocks and I have top of the shoulder length natural hair. Her hair was soft and the curls lasted for days, and I got the same results. My hair did not &#x27;poof up&#x27; like I thought it would because of the steam aspect. The best part is how fast it works. I can have curls within 15 minutes from start to finish!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love it!  Normally don&#x27;t have time to really try curly hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t take well to the curling iron.  I followed the instructions and my hair turned out awesome.  Will definitely recommend to any friends or family that are interested in something like this!</li>
    <li> I ordered these rollers because I was looking for something easy and different than the average-old hot rollers. I was terribly disappointed. I sat down and read the instructions and was prepared and ready to fix my hair for a Christmas party. My hair looks mamed and barely even curled (if thats what you want to call what it did actually do). I spent a good hour reading up on the instructions, applying, and letting it set and now my hair is ruined and I have no time to re-do it with something that actually works. DO NOT ORDER THESE. I consider myself to have some decent skill when it comes to curling or styling my hair and this curling system just stinks. What a waste of $40.</li>
    <li> The wife was very happy.</li>
    <li> The absolute best curlers EVER!  I have been using them since the 80&#x27;s when Lisa Hartman (before she was Lisa Hartman Black) advertised them.</li>
    <li> I got this earlier than expected, so I was thrilled.  I&#x27;ve had a Caruso system in the past and love the way it works and the way my stubborn-hard-to-curl-hair looks when I&#x27;ve used it!  I&#x27;m taking a trip to a humid destination, and figured the Caruso would be the best way I would have of looking good for daytime meetings and gala evening events.  But when I opened it, I found that some of the rollers were missing ... specifically, the 6 petite were just not anywhere in the package.  So - I will still keep the unit, but want the rollers shipped to my address as soon as possible.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair(or long if you go by the length in the booklet illustrations) that is naturally wavy and fine, but I have a good amount of fullness. I&#x27;m still trying to work with it to get a good lasting curl but it&#x27;s not exactly intuitive. Plus I got 12 Jumbo without any Large size sponge curlers which impedes some styles. When curling my hair I found it difficult to keep the curlers in place with the shields. They seem to become quite loose and start drooping during the setting time. Even when leaving small and petite curlers in my hair for at least an hour rather than the 10 minutes they say, it still becomes very lose with time. They definitely do not last through sleep. I went to bed after curling it, spritzed it with some hairspray (the only thing I used in my hair after shampooing) and then put it up in a loose bun to sleep. When I woke up it was nothing but waves and several hours later it was straight (remember I have naturally wavy hair) with one little wave in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not ready to give up just yet, so once I try all the techniques in the booklet I&#x27;ll update my comment and rating, but for now I&#x27;m not exactly thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have used a Caruso Steam Hairsetter for more than 10 years.  With the exception of one that I bought in July of 2008 from Amazon it has been a good product lasting for many years.  It gives my hair the volume that I like and works well for my active life style.  I&#x27;m a no fuss kind of person.  I blow dry my hair, put the rollers in, put on my make up, grab some kind of breakfast, take the rollers out, brush through my hair, get dressed and I&#x27;m out the door.  My only complaint is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t stand behind products purchased on their website.  I have to contact the manufacturer to deal with the Caruso set that stopped working in less than five months from date of purchase.</li>
    <li> I am just tried out the caruso steam sponge rollers. I liked them more than i thought. The curls stay longer than when i used a curling iron or velcro rollers. They last me on average about 6 hours or so. It is very quick, even doing them one at a time, I am able to have my hair set and curled after about 15 minutes. I set them first, do my makeup and then take them out. It is enough time to set them and have them last one day. I do find with my type of hair I do have to do it once a day (even if i do not wash it) it does not stay the same type of curled. Also, sometime have to use a straight iron to uncrimp my hair from the holders since my hair is thin, or use the old school clips to keep the hair up. that works also. overall, very impressed! Best i have used yet for my hair. Works better than curling iron and damages hair less. works for me!</li>
    <li> Put in a little gel before putting the rollers in and I got the nice body I was looking for from the jumbo sized rollers.  Easy to use, and clips stay in place.  Each roller only needs a few seconds to steam, so by time you&#x27;ve got one in place the next one is ready.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my hair but it does not curl. I have long, healthy, medium in thickness hair and it just doesn&#x27;t curl. Im so disappointed because the reviews I read got me all pumped up. I think my problem is that my hair is too healthy and will not hold curl. I never use product, dye my hair maybe once a year and use heat on my hair maybe twice a week. Bummed</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting a tighter curl</li>
    <li> This is my fifth caruso. I love it, have not used anything else on my hair since they first came out. Try it you&#x27;ll love it. Does NOT damage hair.</li>
    <li> This product has some potential, but it&#x27;s not good for all types of hair.  The curls lasted awhile, but the ends of my hair were very frizzy - and that wasn&#x27;t good - people were telling me I badly needed a trim.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso for over close to 15 years now.  I have went through a few, but overall each one lasts a long period of time.  I love the product. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but leaves it feeling soft and in good condition.  The curls come wonderful.  I highly recommend this product for all those that want to have curls, but do not want the drying out and burning of a typical iron curler.</li>
    <li> OMGosh !  Am I ever glad I bought this !  So fast, so easy. Best personal care purchase I ever made. Thought having to do each roller one at a time would be a problem, nope !  Its so fast, by the time you comb out the next section of your hair, the next roller is ready to use. No burnt fingers !  just fantastic.  Also if foam roller gets worn, you can just buy replacements. I have shoulder length fairly thick hair &amp; I can roll all my hair on 12 rollers. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> MY BOYFRIEND BOUGHT ME THESE AND I ALREADY BOUGHT ONE.I WANT TO RESELL THIS ONE IS ANYONE INTERESTED? NEVER BEEN USED. THANKS IN ADVANCE!</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these for about 15 years.  I still use the original and it&#x27;s great.  I pull it back out when I change hairstyles and want a curlier look.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It works, it doesn&#x27;t damage hair.  I recently frosted my hair again and I wanted to protect it from harsh curling irons and this is the ticket.  If you get this you&#x27;ll keep it for years.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves these curlers. She had some years ago but they finally wore out.She was glad to find that they are still available to purchase? We looked everywhere to try and find some, but I checked Amazon and there they were ! Thank You  Amazon</li>
    <li> Okay, first I am an African-American and I love my new rollers!! I recently retired my hot curlers and have moved on to bigger and better things. I&#x27;m a licensed Cosmetologist and I recommend this product to my clients who like to curl their hair on a daily basis. My hair is sooooo soft, manageable, shiny, and did I mention bouncy. Goodness I sound like an infomercial I&#x27;m so excited. Get a set and try them for yourself.</li>
    <li> These came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. They offer a quick way to curl and the steam also gives my hair what I consider a spa treatment.Depending on the length of your hair you may need to order an extra set of rollers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;signed a very pleased customer Kerry (sister locked and loving it)</li>
    <li> The overall quality is very good and the system performs well.The steam is very gentle to the hair and forms long lasting curls.The draw backs are the sponge rollers and the clamps. While the rollers may work well for long or curly hair they don&#x27;t work so well for medium or short straight hair. The sponge rollers do not grasp hair and it is almost impossible to coax the hair to wrap around roller. I finally resorted to purchasing velcro rollers, removing the velcro and hot glueing it around the Carusso sponge roller. The other problem is the clamp which holds the roller in place. It leaves a dent in the hair which has to be removed with a curling brush and blow dryer. I would give this product an A+ if the rollers and clamps were better designed but as is I give it a C.</li>
    <li> Works well, but not as well as other reviews would have you think. Is a little longer lasting than curling iron/hairspray combo. My hair is very straight on its own and curl holds but takes about 15-20 minutes to set, even with using hairdryer to speed it up. Would recommend this product. I also have had other brands hot rollers and this does work better than any of those i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The Caruso hairsetters are absoulutley wonderful for holding curls in the &lt;br /&gt;difficult-to-curl hair.  There is only one major problem.  After owning 5 of these products in the past 8 years, I am getting ready to purchase another one. (You would think that I would learn by now, but it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair curly.)  These hairsetters quit working for no apparent reason.  You are guaranteed about 6-10 uses before it craps out on you.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This last one, which was the expensive $55 ionic set was used 4 times before it stopped.  I would like to hear from someone who knows what the problem is with these hairsetters.  First I thought it was the tap water I was using, so I tried using spring water.  Another thought I had with my last hairsetter, was that I turned off the unit after use, but forgot to drain the water from inside the container.  I believe there is another company that makes steam hairsetters.  Does anybody know if the&#x27;re any good?</li>
    <li> I have owned the Caruso Molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product. It is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful, soft, steamed curl, as opposed to harsh, electric hot curlers. I recently purchased the new \\&quot;smaller version\\&quot;, because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have the steam making power the older version did. I am very dissappointed in this \\&quot;newly designed\\&quot; product. I have packed it away, and will use it only as a back up. I hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded, improved, or discontinued the product. Sometimes, it is best to leave well enough alone. I will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on Ebay.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gentle on my hair, could use more rollers in the set though.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one in about 12 years, I won&#x27;t use anything else. I use it daily. It is gentle on my hair &amp; lightweight.  I was in a panic when I couldn&#x27;t locate another Caruso hairsetter in the retail stores or beauty supply stores.  So happy to have my new replacement!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Caruso for my wife after returning a Conair Infinity. The Conair Infinity did not measure up to her expectations. She is happy with the Caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl. I will offer a few observations of my own. I would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer. For instance, women have different lengths of hair. This device provides 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large, 6 jumbo. That might be fine for women with shoulder length hair, but not for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not enough of one size to get the job done. There&#x27;s not enough of two sizes to get the job done. If your hair has just been cut, it&#x27;s to short to use the larger sizes, unless you have long hair to start with. My wife&#x27;s hair is not quite shoulder length, she&#x27;s got a problem. So, I figured, no big deal, just order a dozen of the right size. One dozen additional rollers cost $35. I only paid $29 for the unit with 30 rollers. &lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not what I call customer friendly. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This hairsetter steams very quickly, is easy to use, and the curls really last.  No other hair curlers I have ever used gives the staying power, and you can leave the curlers in varying times depending on how curly you want your hair.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in 1982 at the cost of $87.00 at a Hair Show.  In 1995 I purchased a new steaming unit and additional sponge hair curlers/rollers.  Here it is 2007 and I&#x27;m still using this product.  It is FANTASTIC for the busy woman of today:  Takes 10 minutes to set 25 rollers into my hair; leave in 10 minutes, and my curls are soft and last a couple of days (I have very straight hair, so 2 days is good for me!).</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Caruso&#x27;s.  I purchased this set to get the different sized rollers that were not included in my first purchase.  I have been using this system for a number of years and I think it does a good job of putting body into the hair.  I have shoulder length hair and it always comes out beautifully.  I have to say that unless you put some spray or holding mist on your hair, the curl will eventually fall out.  This may be due to the weight of the hair rather than the fault of the system.  Overall it does give a smooth sleek look to your hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Curls do not last as long as with the one  you had to add salt to. If you take them out to early you have nothing</li>
    <li> I really like these it gives me lots of body to my hair. I would suggest this product for anyone who has limpy straight hair.</li>
    <li> I find the curlers hard to hold in hair with the tops. Because I have long hair I cannot get them to dry fast enough in the mornings even using a blow dryer.  I do not like heating them up one at a time even as fast as it does it.  Also I find it bulky to pack away in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to return  Amy Thompson</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair that hates to maintain a curl.  Other hot rollers have a very temporary effect and I was hoping for a little staying power with these.  My first attempt I followed the directions and by the time I got to a mirror, it was virtually straight again.  I&#x27;ve since had a little bit more luck with leaving the curlers on longer and heating the clips, but the curls have been falling out pretty quickly still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips themselves are just okay, I usually have at least one or two that just don&#x27;t want to stay in, but this could easily be user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are better than average ones, and I feel like they are less likely to damage my hair, but my ceramic curling iron is still the only thing that forces my hair to maintain curls.  I&#x27;m hoping that a little more experience with these will yield better results, but right now, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the second time for my mother who uses them about five days per week. She says that these are the best rollers that she has ever used.</li>
    <li> I used to have the old steam setter with salt.  It worked for years and the curls always held for at least a whole day.  And, all the reviewers who said there are 12 huge rollers are right.  The description of the sizes was wrong.  I didn&#x27;t use any of the huge size. BUT, worst of all, even with the smaller sizes, my curls didn&#x27;t even last ONE HOUR!      After reading the reviews, I picked this one, figuring the folks who liked it were probably right and the ones who complained just didn&#x27;t know how to use the steam setter.  Well, the complainers were right.  It&#x27;s going back in the morning.     I had such high hopes for this to help me look so special for my son&#x27;s wedding in about a week and a half.  At this rate, the curls wouldn&#x27;t have lasted through the pre-wedding pictures and would have been gone before the guests arrived.  Here&#x27;s another incident of something not being made as well now as they used to make it.    Save your money and buy something else!</li>
    <li> works great, easy to use and safe on hair. My hair does not feel damaged or fried. Very happy with this item</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The covers/rollers will slip off the hair if you&#x27;re unable to get the cover all the way to the scalp.  In my case, my ear was in the way and I was using the jumbo/large roller.  I didn&#x27;t want to use a smaller roller because I wanted a bumped look more than an actual curl.  After re-rolling my hair and clipping it again, it still kept slipping off.  Oh well.  The curl that was produced while the roller was on my hair (maybe 1 minute), was sufficient for the look I was going for (I pull that part of my hair behind my ears anyway).  Also getting the clip centered well enough on the roller for it to actually clip right, took a little more effort than I expected.  I may buy some Conair roller clips as other reviewers have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The roller sizes are not what the box says.  I purchased this set from Sally Beauty Supply for $40.  I was supposed to get 6 jumbo, 12 large, 6 medium, and 6 small.  I received 18 jumbo/large (plus the 6 Med and 6 small).  So I was definitely confused trying to figure out which ones were \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; and which ones were \\&quot;large\\&quot;, when I realized that the roller itself reads JUMBO (slash) LARGE...meaning, there is no distinction between the two sizes...so at least in the set I received, Jumbo &#x3D; Large and there were 18 of them.  I&#x27;m glad to have so many because this is the size I need for most of my hair, but just a heads up in case that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The curls themselves are gorgeous.  Your hair will look and feel amazing...smooth and healthy.  I only wanted to play with these rollers to see how my hair might turn out...I only left them in my head for a couple minutes.  Just long enough to roll my whole head.  Then, I removed the rollers in the order I put them in, and my hair just looks awesome.  I don&#x27;t know how long the curls will last yet, but for what I wanted (just a little umph to test it out), I give this two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The price.  At $40, you can easily leave your flat irons behind and perhaps save yourself some money by not visiting the salon as often.  This is an excellent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I love the little booklet that comes with the set to show different ways to roller set your hair depending on your length and hair type.  I am a visual learner primarily, and I LOVED the illustrations.  I really appreciate that there were little arrows pointing to which direction the roller should be rolled to get a certain look.  Very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have AA, relaxed hair, and I have been thinking of getting these rollers since I was a teenager. I can appreciate them so much more now.  I have transitioned from relaxed to natural twice in the past, and I&#x27;ve decided to stay relaxed and work on using rollers and pin curls to give my hair some bounce instead of flat irons.  I think this steam roller set will align perfectly with my hair goals.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the roller/clip/quantity issues.</li>
    <li> I love Caruso Curlers.  They give your hair so much body.  My hair is naturally straight &amp; thin--this product makes my hair so full &amp; bouncy.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and thought they were no longer available. I am so glad I found it as I lost my other one.</li>
    <li> I bought this Caruso months ago, and all I can say is, its worth the price and it doesn&#x27;t get any easier to make beautiful natural looking curls. It used to take me hours to curl my hair and is left looking like it was over curled,but with the Caruso I&#x27;m done within 30 minutes tops. It takes me 10 minutes to roll up my hair and 20 minutes to let it cool down. I watched many youtube reviews before deciding to buy this product. I learned that you have to make sure to use hair end papers since it helps lessen the frizz and i noticed this works faster if the hair is dry ,cause when my hair was a little damp,the curls just wasn&#x27;t as perfect as I hoped it would.But bottom line, Im really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have VERY straight,fine hair and this product just didn&#x27;t work for my type of hair.  It was hard to get the hair in the rollers and when I took them out after about 15 minutes there was a wave however, it didn&#x27;t stay in at all and I couldn&#x27;t get it to look like I was hoping it would look.</li>
    <li> I am African-American and it is a great way to curl my relaxed hair w/o using a curling iron. I cant explain it any other way. I not get more curls but the curls look natural. Im trying to grow my hair back out from color damage...yes I tired the Beyonce thing and I still want to look good it. Great system.</li>
    <li> I love this hairsetter.  It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.  This is the 2nd set I have owned.  The only reason I had to buy a new set, is because the foam on the rollers on my old set was disintegrating (the heating unit was still fine).  It was cheaper to buy an entire set as opposed as to ordering new rollers.  I wish they would make the replacement rollers affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works great for my hair and does not dry it out.  My hair stays curled until I wash it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin fine hair.  Almost every product I have used to curl my hair leaves it straight and limp after about 1/2hr.  This product using the small rollers I had actual curl (not just wave) the next day.  This without even using hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I some ways it reminds me of those old pink rollers of my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Both curl and body doesn&#x27;t last as long as they state for me. I&#x27;ll use it occasionally. Delivery for this product was super fast, would buy from then again. [[ASIN:B0012RBVXU Caruso C97953 Salonpro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter With 30 Rollers]]</li>
    <li> My wife says they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that gives me curls that last.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that will not hold a curl with ordinary rollers.  I discovered the Caruso Hairsetter through a close friend. She said that they really work, do not damage your hair and it takes very little time.She was exactly right.  I now have been using the Caruso system for 7 years.  Excellent product! AA++</li>
    <li> Curls are fantastic and last ALL day! Does not harm your hair. These are the best hair rollers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 4th set total.  I have used these for probably 10 years and LOVE them.  I was a cheerleader in high school and they are so fast and easy and travel well.  I put them in and do my make-up while the curl then by the time my make up is done (like7 minutes)  I take my hair out of the rollers and am on my way! Anyone who is looking give them a try you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Item was received in perfect shape.  It is a wonderful item and a great buy.</li>
    <li> this is my third set of rollers from caruso. bought first one almost 20 yrs. ago when it was first invented. love it doesn&#x27;t damage hair, works fast. curls last a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and quite frizzy, plus I color it every 6 weeks, and blow dry it 4-5 times per week.  It has suffered much damage, but I have to do these things to get my hair to behave...it&#x27;s \\&quot;out of control\\&quot; otherwise.  These curlers work wonders for me.  The steam infuses my hair with moisture which eliminates the frizzies leaving the curls smooth and with a lot of shine...it&#x27;s amazing.  The curls last until I wash them out, but I think that&#x27;s just because my hair holds a curl anyway (I can make curls with my fingers and a blow dryer that last for days...)  Anyway, some people complain the caruso-steam curls don&#x27;t last so if your hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, anyway, these might or might not work for you.  But bottom line, these curlers work great for me because they improve the condition of my hair (whereas hot metal rollers just make it worse) so these are winners in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Allow me to preface this by saying that I usually do not review anything unless I feel VERY strongly about the product, whether it be positive or negative. I have long, very straight hair and I&#x27;ve tried just about every single hairsetter and curling mechanism in existence. With normal heat rollers, I start the day with curls but end up with a ratty hairsprayed mess. Caruso&#x27;s steam hairsetter is arguably the most amazing hair tool that I have EVER used! I was certainly skeptical when I purchased it, but it heats immediately and takes hardly any time at all to use. It is also extremely compact and easy to travel with! The best part- the curls and volume stay ALL DAY!! I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance on Caruso and I will never roll my hair with regular heat rollers again. A quick tip to try that I&#x27;ve found for girls with long hair: put the largest rollers on the top and the smaller rollers underneath- it gives even more volume that way. I highly recommend these to anyone with any length/texture hair.</li>
    <li> This was a special requirement for my wife and luckily AMAZON always come up trumps  when looking for items not readily available in the open market</li>
    <li> I bought this based on positive reviews and personally find it \\&quot;ok.\\&quot;  I can not believe that other ppl claim the curls last for a couple days! unimaginable! I will say if you leave it in for any more than 15 minutes, you will come out with a head ball of curls (and not very stylish!).  No worries, as the curls die out in a couple hours and relaxes to a very soft wave.  I like this alternative to heated rollers bc it seems less damaging to your hair and at least for me, the results are basically the same (curls only hold for 3-4 hrs), so I chose to keep this set over traditional heated rollers.</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a set of steam rollers which I loved.  They were good for my naturally dry hair and worked really well.  I&#x27;m not sure what happened to them, but several moves and years later I wanted some again.  Stores didn&#x27;t seem to carry anything but hot rollers, so I was pleased to find some on Amazon.      They are disappointingly flimsy and hard to use. They come with a lot of rollers, of different sizes, but it doesn&#x27;t make much difference.  I have to wrap my hair around them very tightly to even get them to hold long enough to put on the clip.  Maybe there&#x27;s a technique I don&#x27;t know about, but I&#x27;ve used them several times and haven&#x27;t found it any easier.  If I manage to do it, I still like the way the steam works with my curly, dry hair.  However, I wish they had a better roller system, with some way to catch and hold the hair.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly straight, hard to curl hair that damages easily. This gives me great curls very quickly without damage.  However, because it is steam set, the curls do not hold up in humid weather. This is actually my second one, I had one years ago that went missing, and I just had to have another one.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the covers often leave a mild kink in the hair, but depending on how you wrap it, this can be minimized.</li>
    <li> Alright Here&#x27;s the Real on this product. The bad : if you are seeking a smooth roller wrap finish as with magnetic rollers, that isn&#x27;t what you are going to get with this. It&#x27;s the type of outcome you get with sponge rollers,.which is tight and soft . I have Natural BlacK Hair &gt; these curls made a cute poofy styLe that I like, but I was expecting a smooth silky finish. Next time i m going to run a blow dryer over them before I take them out, and I am going to use products like Oil.When and LottaBody setting lotion..The Good : it works great! This is trully a quality product. The rollers and concept are just as good as it sounds. Just be careful and pay attention to how long you leave the rollers on the steam, Simply set the rollers on the steamer DONT push down on the steam outlet as its not made to be pushed, and watch your water level so you dont burn out your steamer. It&#x27;s good for a kids hair as you shouldn&#x27;t try to get a kids hair flat and straight anyway. I&#x27;m glad I bought this and I think it&#x27;s great for Natural Hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers actually work as promised. I have very fine long hair that tends to look a little dry. These rollers not only give me excellent curls that last, but they soften up my dry hair &amp; make it look soft &amp; shiny. I&#x27;m buying my second set today. My first set lasted a good 20 years (off &amp; on use, not continuous). I hope the new set lasts at least 25% as long. I would definitely recommend them. They do make your hair super curly, so it takes a few times to figure out exactly how long you need to leave the rollers in your hair before you start looking like a poodle, but once you figure it out they are awesome!</li>
    <li> For me is the best!!! I take it every where I go. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t ruin the hair. My hair is very fine, I can spend hours at the hair dresser, and as soon I leave my hair would go flat, with Caruso I do it at home, very fast and my hair looks great for hours and hours. I can&#x27;t understand how this product is not selling every where; it would be a big success. I use it for more them 5 years. Sometimes when I have a big event that I have to go to a salon to do my makeup, I take it with me, and all the hair dresser go crazy, but of course this would take a lot of business away from them. I just love it, and couldn&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
    <li> have had these for years!  When I found out they \\&quot;closed\\&quot; shop, bought all that I could find..&lt;br /&gt;they do not damage hair, and it&#x27;s set in 5 minutes (I have hair 5 inches longer than shoulders)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so mant great reviews about this product so I finally decided to buy it. PS, I&#x27;m definitely going to read the 1 stars before the 5 stars because the 5 stars were definitely inaccurate. I tried using mine once and it crapped out. Would not steam up and even when it did the one and only time it worked, it was not effective at all. HORRIBLE PRODUCT! Don&#x27;t waste your money! If I could reate it, it would be in the negative numbers...</li>
    <li> Figuring out how to use them but I got what I wanted</li>
    <li> Easy to use, I haven&#x27;t burnt myself yet (thanks rotating curler - which I also love, it just likes to hurt me), curls are voluminous and my hair stays curled. Plus you look awesome with curlers in, take me to the &#x27;50s baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not feel as though the damage I&#x27;m doing is even worth trying to avoid for hair that looks so nice after using this product. The damage done is negligable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of variety in size of rollers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying these aren&#x27;t good for some people, they clearly are, but they really didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I was really excited to get these because I have wavy/frizzy hair and am always looking for less damaging ways to style it. These really didn&#x27;t smooth out my hair at all and the curls I did get just fell right out. I read a lot of reviews and experimented with water, length of time on the steam, and length of time in my hair but nothing really worked for a good curl with any hold.</li>
    <li> I really like that the product does not dry out my hair as the hot rollers did. Just started using them - so far so good.</li>
    <li> Difficult really to give these rollers a rating, since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used them.  It is going to take some practice.....kept steaming my fingers when I tried to put the cover on the steamer.  The steamer should be flat, not the top at an angle.  I had trouble with the covers not wanting to go on the rollers, although they&#x27;re the right size.  The literature talks about using clips.  There&#x27;s no place on the roller where you could insert a clip.  What&#x27;s the secret.</li>
    <li> This is my second set - one for home and one for our weekend cabin. The steam rollers are the only device my fine hair respects and I can set it and be ready to go in less time than I can use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and could never get the curls to hold with a regular heat curls.  First time I used these, WOW, couldn&#x27;t believe how nice the curls were and stayed.  Would buy another if I need to.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have thick naturally curly hair 4a and it curls it beautifully. My tip is to leave until dry before removing for more defined curl.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Get some. Your hair will thank you for not exposing it to hot dry heat any longer. Just don&#x27;t leave the roller in the steamer pin too long or it will make your hair too wet. Quick, simple to use, with excellent curlability  and with curls that LAST! I have thick, wavy, hard to curl hair that and always took a lot of heat ( and time) with hot rollers that damaged my hair. I wonder why these aren&#x27;t common knowledge. I YouTubed use just to be sure I was using right. Couldn&#x27;t be easier...and the price is very reasonable. I did buy 6 extra jumbo rollers.</li>
    <li> I had these rollers many years ago and LOVED them. Never had so many complements on my hair. I went back to work &amp; was looking for a QUICK, EASY and, YES! LONG LASTING hairstyler like the one I used to have. I was thrilled to find the Caruso Steam Roller&#x27;s were still out there! I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now and the compliments are back.  They heat up quick, only really need to be left in 10-20 minutes and you&#x27;re done!   The VERY BEST feature: a QUICK, LONG LASTING set. The WORST feature: my previous setter stopped working due to clogging caused by MINERAL BUILD UP from my awful tap water. TIP: ONLY USE DISTILLED OR FILTERED WATER!   I LOVE THEM!!! They come with plenty of rollers in all the necessary sizes and I feel it&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this to replace my babyliss heated rollers, but after few uses i went back to my babyliss.   the good things about this product is that it heats up really fast, and since it uses steam, it does not damage your hair.  however, the result does not last at all. i&#x27;d leave the rollers on for about 15 min.,and my hair would get really curly, but the curls would be gone in about couple of hours. the product informacial stated that the curls would last for days, and could only be released by water. i found that part misleading.</li>
    <li> Best hair setting product I ever had. I&#x27;m 73 so I&#x27;ve been around. The curls stay even after brushing 3 days later. My ceramic curlers always had  uneven heat and some were too hot. Finally some of the curlers melted and stuck to the unit. This product is wonderful.[[ASIN:B0002JKPA4 Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter]]</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these hair setters years ago when they were first advertised on TV.  My hair won&#x27;t hold a curl for more than a few minutes, so I was willing to try anything.  I loved it!  My hair stayed curly until I washed it, and it made my hair really soft - not damaging at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wore out the rollers years ago and threw it out.  I wanted to curl my hair for Halloween, so I looked to see if they still made this system.  Yay!  I bought one and curled my hair.  It stayed curly for about an hour.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about the new systems except that you no longer have to add salt to the water reservoir.  Was it the salt that made the curl last?  No idea...</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time reading both the negative and positive reviews for this product.  I thought that many of the negative reviews were just the result of a few defective units.  Since so many others gushed about how fantastic these things were, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the package arrived in the mail I tried them out.  I was about 4 rollers in when I heard a soft popping sound, then my bathroom began to fill with a heavy smoke smell.  When I went to unplug the cord it was almost too hot to touch... it almost started a fire!  To top it off, it also blew half the fuses in my home.  It is POSSIBLE that the unit I received was also just a defective; however, it was a highly dangerous defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally... I am surprised by the number of 5 star reviews that also mention that the product stopped working after a certain amount of time.  For me, that would cause me to knock a few stars off the overall rating.  On the plus side of everything, the return was very fast and simple.  UPS even picked the product up from porch at no charge.</li>
    <li> Product itself was okay.  However, it was sold to me as &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; - it wasn&#x27;t new.  The rollers and steamers were thrown together in the box and some of the rollers and the steamer itself were not in their original packaging.</li>
    <li> Found the product very difficult to use and using one roller at a time is very inconvenient. Very disappointed with the product</li>
    <li> Brought this for my wife and she said this does not work. The steamer is unreliable - it does not always heat up. The company offered to send another steamer - but I already got stuck with paying return shipping. Fool me once shame on you. They sent the steamer anyway and I think they charged my account a second time. Not sure but I will find out.</li>
    <li> I never do reviews..... Ever.... and I felt that I needed to let you all know that this product is the only thing I have used on my hair for about 10 years.  I don&#x27;t even own a curling iron.  I have pretty straight hair and in the last 10 years I have had everything from really long to above the shoulders length hair and my curlers have been my product of choice for every length I have had.  I love them and have sold many of my friends on this product.  I seriously would cut my hair so short (pixie) if something were to happen that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy this product anymore.  I can do my hair faster than any friend of mine all because it seriously takes a few instant rollers to completely change my hair.  I sleep on my hair wet and wake up looking like a hot mess, but these rollers make each curl perfect....My hair has never been healthier!!  If you are on the fence with buying this, trust me you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these curlers. Use them almost 3 - 4 times a week. My hair structure has improved significantly. Much healthier and not so dry and straw like. The curls last several days. One of the best things I ever bought.</li>
    <li> Ordering was fast and easy.  The description and image of the product was very well written.  I have had other hairsetters but this is the best.  It is small which is good so it does not take up counter space.  It heats very fast.  The machine includes 30 rollers of all sizes.  It will be great to take on trips due to its size and the enclosed carrying case.</li>
    <li> I have tried using these rollers on a number of occasions. I have fine, natural blonde hair. I have yet to get a good curl from these. My hair looks awful when I take out the rollers.  I have never left the rollers in for longer than 30 minutes, as I am short on time in the morning. I think the only  way that these rollers will work for me is to leave them on for a long amount of time, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Used it in Eastern Europe (I&#x27;m from the US) happy to report the dual voltage worked just fine (needed an adapter of course)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this.  I prefer the heat rollers without steam.</li>
    <li> I have heavy, straight hair that will not curl with hot rollers.  The steam works magic!  I get spiral curls that are fully formed beyond just the ends being curled under.  The curls last longer than hot rollers and a curling iron can manage.</li>
    <li> From all the radiating reviews on here I was excited to get these. I was very disappointed. The first set I got came damaged, a huge hole in the shipping box and in the curlers box so I sent that back. Finally got a set not damaged. I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for years and have been through many sets of curlers and types of curlers. This set is cheaply made and junky. The curlers are flimsy, they remind me of the cheap foam curlers you sleep in. The end caps of the curlers kept popping off each time I rolled my hair. The unit does not steam well and I do not have hard water. I kept the curlers in my hair per the instructions. When I checked on them, my hair was damp so I tried the hair dryer and then undid them from my hair. I looked like a wet poodle. It was awful. Save your money! It would be cheaper to use those dollar store foam curlers and steam them with a vaporizer, probably more effective too. I am returning these to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years,  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and gives the right amount curls.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that will give my straight hair curls or waves. Just add water to the steamer unit, plug in, pop a roller on unit. As you are sectioning off the next hair, the roller steams, roll your dry hair, pass the roller cover cap over the steamer and cover the roller. Pop on the next roller, section, roll, pass cap over the steam, cover. Continue until all hair is rolled. By the time I put on a bit of makeup, the curlers are all cooled and ready to unwind. Brush teeth, lightly brush hair or finger comb, mist of spray. Good to go. Hair, makeup, teeth 15 min max. Curls, waves last ALL DAY! If I want tighter curls, I use smaller rollers, or I may use a warm blow dryer on the rolled curlers for a minute, then use cool air to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the curl. What I really appreciate is the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; and volume at the roots of the hair these curlers give. Every other heat set method left my hair flat at the roots with a bit of curl at the ends that slid out within 15 min. I can use my steam rollers every morning without damage to my hair. I can go a couple days without setting if I use a bit of spray to hold. You&#x27;ll be amazed and so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I had a Caruso steam hairsetter for probably over 15 years before the electrical cord developed a break and sparks flew.  I was sad.  Other hot rollers were heavy, fell out, left marks and fried my hair. So I bought this one. It is working, but no matter what level the water is at it sputters water out the top along with steam and at times gets the rollers too wet. I still use it, but I suspect the quality is not the same and don&#x27;t know if it will last. Tips: Besides using purified water I also recommend buying some cheap small aligator clips from the dollar store to hold them on instead of the ones they give you.  Theirs leave a crease.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and heats up very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t take long to roll your complete head and the steam really adds healthful moisture to your hair, which is a good thing since I&#x27;m wearing my hair naturally locked. So, for anyone wearing Sisterlocks, this is a wonderful product to use for beautiful, healthy body and curl.</li>
    <li> I was just getting the hang of it, used it about 20 times. Then I put in in storage for 2 months. Took it out and it stopped working. It heats up but not enough to make the rollers hot.  Cheap product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all (well mostly) positive reviews. I always loved the way my hair looked when it was curled, but if I used a curling iron or hot rollers, my hair would uncurl in a few minutes. This is the only product I can use to curl my hair. There are a few tricks and tips I would tell people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you roll them.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t leave the curler on the steaming unit too long.&lt;br /&gt;3. Steam the sheild before putting it in place&lt;br /&gt;4. After you wait the 10 minutes for the curl to set, take the time and blow dry the curls on the cool heat setting. This sets the curl and can make it last for days longer.&lt;br /&gt;5. If possible, use distilled water.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you have read any other reviews, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard about the unit dying after a few months. Actucally, the machine just needs to be cleaned!!!! Minerals in tap water build up and cause blockages on the inside, all you have to do is mix 1 tablespoon of vinger and full with water to the line. Plug in the steamer and wait 5-10 minutes, you should start to see steam. Let this run til it is not getting anymore water and your steamer with be just like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely the best curling product out there!</li>
    <li> I had the original Caruso steam roller set back in the early 90&#x27;s when it first came out.  This was the one you had to use with salt.  Everyone loved my hair when I used the curlers back then.  I guess the novelty wore off and I stopped using it after the flat iron became the new \\&quot;it\\&quot; product.  Well,  I went out and bought the new version that you use w/out the salt.  I still love it.  My hair is soft and bouncy.  The curls last a few days.  This is great because I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron every day to style my hair.  I plan on using the rollers as often as possible to minimize damage.  P.S.  I&#x27;m African-American with chemically relaxed hair that is pretty long and I wash my hair 3 times a week.  Before I use the rollers, I wash and wrap my hair and dry with a hooded dryer.  Hope this help-Cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Caruso for over 15 years and won&#x27;t use any other type of roller/iron. It isn&#x27;t damaging like dry heat, its super easy to use and sets quickly, even on waist-length hair.    I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I&#x27;m going to use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set based on the other reviews as I researched units ~ on the plus side it keeps a curl exceptionally well and for that reason I am happy to use it ~ on the downside, it is time consuming to set the curlers in place and then they won&#x27;t stay secure where placed.  I think that a set that is secured with pins would be less frustrating.</li>
    <li> My hair is just past my shoulders and these only curl the ends</li>
    <li> They are quick,and easy. The steamer heats so fast, and cools at the same rate. The curls come out beautiful you do have to let them set a while thought, or you will jsut have curly ends. The only thing I wish is there were more rollers in a set, but you can always order more :). Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have long hair - below mid-back.  My hair has a natural wave to it, normally I either put mousse in my hair &amp; scrunch it up or straighten it because when left to dry on it&#x27;s own it&#x27;s very frizzy.  My hair normally holds curls well, but once I&#x27;ve straightened it, it doesn&#x27;t.  The first time I tried these steam rollers, I just blow-dried my hair and got started.  I sectioned my hair, held the roller over the steam, rolled my hair and attached the holder/clip.  Once I had a full head of rollers I got dressed &amp; did my make-up.  When I first took the rollers out, the curl was good - nice loose waves (I just used the largest rolers).  I flipped my head upside down, shook my head &amp; kinda just massaged my scalp to blend the sections together.  When I flipped my head right-side up it was very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried these I decided to try straightening my hair first since that&#x27;s the only way I can get rid of the frizz.  Now as I said before, normally once I straighten my hair it won&#x27;t hold a curl, but I thought it might work with these since they use steam.  Well, it did work :-).  Instead of just blow-drying my hair I also straightened it and then did the same thing as before.  This time when I took out the rollers, each section of hair had a great wave to it, but it was nice &amp; sleek.  After I flipped my head, shook it &amp; massaged my scalp my hair had nice loose waves, nicely blended &amp; no frizz.  And with a little spritz of hair spray, the curls stayed all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things I should mention, first is that using the largest rollers I get great waves, but they aren&#x27;t regular looking curls.  The look is closer to crimping my hair or how it looks when I take out a braid.  Second thing is the set is supposed to come with 30 rollers, 6 of each size: petite, small, medium, large &amp; jumbo.  With my set I have 12 that say jumbo/large.  Not a big deal for me because I like the larger waves and had large &amp; jumbo been 2 different sizes I would have just alternated between the 2 sizes when rolling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using these again and maybe trying the smaller sizes to see how those curls look.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally straight hair and had high hopes for the Caruso system because so many people have said that the curl will stay in your hair for days. The curl leaves my hair within a matter of hours. A curling iron is much more effective for holding a long-term curl. What I do like about this system is that it is much more versatile than a curling iron. It&#x27;s easy to get loose, beachy waves for example. It also sets up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t appear to damage hair the way a curling iron does. This probably would work very well for someone with fine hair.</li>
    <li> My poor little baby fine hair has never found a friend in a roller, curling iron, or other tool...until now. This is goof-proof, makes beautiful, long-lasting curls, and makes my hair very happy (no singed ends, no heat damage)...love!</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this as my very old one died and I missed how great it worked. This new one produces very little steam compared to my old one and the curl did not take. I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I got a dud. I am returning it.  I believe it might work for a person with thin hair that is shorter than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> This is the best system I have found for long lasting beautiful curls. I have been using the&lt;br /&gt;Caruso Hot Rollers for years. They really do&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as advertised. I was suprised to&lt;br /&gt;Find them at Amazon...:))</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair. I am mixed raced and have curly/wavy hair (type 2). I was frying my hair and with these I put them on my dry hair then sit under my hard hat dryer or air dry while I finish getting ready. My hair always looks shiny. Here&#x27;s a good tip: put toilet paper on the ends so you don&#x27;t get crinkly ends.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and the curls this produces are soft and wonderful. I live in a humid are and the curls stay put! Love this!</li>
    <li> I have just spent almost 2 hours reading all the reviews on this product.  Although many people seemed to love it, they also mentioned how often the product just quits working. That alone should sound a warning.  Also people complained about the cheapness of the plastic components.&lt;br /&gt;They did not like the ease of use.  Many found the product noisy.  It seems the cons outweigh the pros.  My thanks to the people&lt;br /&gt;who take the time to warn others.  Shame on Amazon for continuing to give a &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; rating to something that sounds so Iffy. I was all set (no pun intended) to buy this product.  That is why I say, read all the reviews, look for a pattern to give you a true picture.  This is not even that expensive as things go.  We aren&#x27;t buying a car or house here, but it is a personal product that is important to a lot of people.  We need to stop putting up with products that get cheesier and cheesier!!!  H. Argento</li>
    <li> Finally, curlers that stay in my fine hair and hold the curl for ages. A very good product, recommend to anyone with fine hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually considering ordering a second set. NOT because the first one broke, but because I moved away from home after graduation and my grandmother would not mail them to me (ugh!). I miss them so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hair rollers are amazing! I remember the first time that I used them. A group of girlfriends headed to Atlanta for my friend&#x27;s bachelorette celebration. I threw this into my weekend bag on a whim, as I had washed my hair and didn&#x27;t have time to flat iron or do a typical roller set. I have African-American hair that is relaxed and was below shoulder length at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore a ponytail on the drive there, but threw these in before heading out to dinner. I used a mixture of the two largest roller sizes on the majority of my head, but used 2 of the smallest in the front (layers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair came out perfectly! All the girls complimented me and wanted to try it out (Asian hair, Caucasian hair, natural African-American hair). They didn&#x27;t because of time constraints but I&#x27;m sure it would have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls lasted all night and my hair didn&#x27;t have that dry feeling on the ends you sometimes get when you curl with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to buy another, I&#x27;ll let you know how it works on my 2 months post relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive and try out my rollers. After reading all the reviews I wanted to find out on my own how great they really are. They made my layers come out more and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the salon to curl the ends. I am very pleased to have bought this product. Now the only thing that could have given this 5 star is if all the rollers were getting steamed at one time, instead of putting them separately. Overall I am content!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;May I complain that Caruso should supply the \\&quot;Comb Clips\\&quot;, with the small and petite rollers especially since they will probably be used by people with short hair. And these Comb clips should be available to purchase as a separate item, at least. I am very disappointed with the Caruso product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of hair curler sets and this one by far is superior for my type of hair which is very thick but also coarse. The curls last for days so I only curl it once after I wash it. My daughter has thick hair as well but finer but the curls fall out rather quickly. It&#x27;s not empirical evidence, but it&#x27;s my experience. The only improvement I&#x27;d wish for is that we could steam them all at once.</li>
    <li> Like some other reviewers, I really miss the original Caruso units that required salt.  I guess I wasn&#x27;t the only one who was nearly electrocuted on the metal prong several times.  That didn&#x27;t stop me from using it until it croaked though. The original set truly made curls that would last for days.  This new set is somewhat disappointing.  It&#x27;s better than the Revlon steam rollers, but I&#x27;m still not completely satisfied with the product.  My curls only last for a day.  Since I have long hair and only wash my hair every few days, I need more lasting curls.  Some people have complained that the curlers start to deteriorate. I believe that is caused from using the curlers after applying gel or hairspray or other hair products.  These curlers should be used only on freshly washed hair.  The only other complaint I have is that it the size of the curler is embossed in hard to read print and is on the opposite side of the curler than it should be.  Since the curlers will logically be placed with with the marked size down, it is hard to tell which size is which.  I usually group them in sizes, so I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  The jumbo and large sizes look the same from the bottom and so do the small and extra small.  Overall, the curlers work as well as regular hot rollers, but they are much less damaging.  They do take more time to use though, since it is necessary to heat one roller at a time.  I probably would have given them 5 stars if I hadn&#x27;t used the original Carusal rollers.</li>
    <li> Love it...Makes my hair look like I just walked out of a salon. Great curls that last for about 2 days.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my hair.  Wish I would have bout it years ago...</li>
    <li> When I first used these, I thought the curlers were not hot enough to do anything but they really to work.  It&#x27;s nice not to have to burn your fingers to create a quick, curly hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold! I love these things!  I&#x27;ve never used hair rollers before, but I was looking for a new way to style my hair.  I&#x27;ve considered hot rollers for several months, but was always nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them correctly.  I searched on Amazon for several months for the appropraite rollers for my skill level and hair type.  I came across these Caruso rollers and read several of the reviews.  The idea that these are steam rollers was very appealing to me, as I&#x27;ve done enough damage to my hair with constant coloring and highlighting through the years.      I tried these rollers out at night (just to make sure I could use them correctly - and hopefully reverse any big mistakes I would make before going out for the day the next morning)...They were actually very easy to put in (and that&#x27;s something for a first time hair roller girl)!  My hair turned out beautifully and I was super excited about the results!    The next morning, I woke up and my hair looked even better!  I barely had to do anything to my hair for the day, and the body and curls stayed all day.    I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.  I could have spent much more on another set and would have completely given up on the idea of hot rollers.  Wonderful product!  Recommend completely!  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have always used hard electric curlers.  I needed some new ones so I went on-line and saw these curlers with such good ratings.  They arrived fast and I immediately tried them.  It has been 4 days and I still have curls - amazing.</li>
    <li> I used this product three times and didn&#x27;t get good results.  My hair came out frizzy and the curls that were there were not attractive.  That may have been the fault of my technique, however I was unable to practice any further because it stopped working.  When I plugged it in to use it the fourth time it made all the same noises, but no longer spit out any steam at all.  I read and followed the directions exactly and I used ONLY distilled water.  I would have liked to give it a few more tries, but it&#x27;s not priced low enough to be disposable, so even if it had worked great for me the first three times I would not buy another.</li>
    <li> The Caruso Rollers are the only heated ones I can use on my fine mid length hair.  All other electric rollers make my hair too curly.  Also, these rollers maintain curl even on the following day.  Also used them when my hair was long with success.</li>
    <li> I had this set in the late 1980&#x27;s...it required a pinch of salt in the water. This was an easy step. I am disappointed because my curls don&#x27;t last half as long with this setter as with my original one. That set lasted 20 years and did a great job. It still works but felt like a new one would be hotter...Not true. I even have a body wave now and my curls still don&#x27;t last...I am very disappointed..</li>
    <li> The best thing about these rollers is the style stays! They are easy to use without causing any damage to the hair. Only thing is my hair is wavy and I need to straighten them before I can use the rollers. But still these do the job. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Caruso curlers for YEARS!  It is the only curlers I use since they work so well.  I put them in my &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair and leave them in while I take a shower, do my makeup, etc.  At times, I will spray my hair with hair spray and let it dry and then use&lt;br /&gt;the curlers. I always get a good set that stays! I highly recommend Caruso!</li>
    <li> I had a set of Caruso Hot Rollers about 10 years ago and remembered they worked well. I am so glad that they are still available. This set is great and comes with 30 rollers in 6 different sizes. The steam rollers work so much better at curling my hair than any other type. Curls stayed all day/night and my hair was still curly the next day. I feel like the steam is better for your hair as well - doesn&#x27;t dry it out as much. I would definitely recommend this item and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair setter comes with so many curlers which makes it great for long hair, but even better is the several small ones for short hair like mine. It heats up fast and once rolled hot on your head, you leave it cool. Remove and wow! The curls are fantastic! I use a shot of hair spray and the curls last for 2 days. This is important as my hair is stick straight! Clean up is a breeze (wipe out moisture from the heating element) store in supplied bag and you are ready to go!</li>
    <li> These rollers do a nice job of curling your hair, provided it is not long (beyond shoulder length). I like how you can vary the amount of curl by using different sizes and by rolling loosely or tightly. It is easy and quick to use. It would be a lot better, though, if the sizes were different colors so that  you could easily tell which size roller and roller cover to use. That would be such a simple change that would make a big difference to the user. Also, there should be better quality control in terms of the size of the roller covers. Some are a little larger than they should be, so if you use them, those rollers fall right out of your hair. The other change I&#x27;d suggest is to provide more of the mid-sized rollers - there are only 6, so if you use that size, you will definitely be ordering additional rollers.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very fast- only takes seconds for each curler to get ready- would advise using distilled water so don&#x27;t have to worry about calcium build up in the bottom section.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit primarily because I wanted to avoid heat damage. I normally use rollers on my hair 3-4 times a week. This unit is very easy to use and it curls hair nicely, but unfortunately it leaves my hair frizzier than when I use hot rollers. In addition, the curls do not last beyond 3-4 hours on me, even if I use hair spray before/after. It does however not damage my hair, which I like. I now use it on my &#x27;second day hair&#x27; - I use hot rollers to get a nice curl on day 1 then use the Caruso rollers the next day to &#x27;refresh&#x27; them.</li>
    <li> I grew tired of the same straight look. I found this on youtube and like most of the results. I love these rollers! Quick, easy and the steam is good for my relaxed APL hair. My new growth feels softer and my hair looks shiner. I roll from the root and wrap the rest of the hair around the roller to achieve a beach wave look. Caruso even revives limp, need to wash hair. Wish I bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought the steam hair setter over a year ago, I wear weaves and wigs and this is perfect for setting human hair, human hair blend, and synthetic hair the curls last all day and do not go limp. This is a good investment if you wear weaves or wigs and like to go from straight to curly with no fuss.</li>
    <li> I love this product-- but months later I noticed they sent me almost all JUMBO covers instead of the medium and large. This makes it very hard to secure the medium and large rollers cus they just fall out. I didn&#x27;t notice this because I didn&#x27;t realize they were all labelled because they are all red colored. At first I thought i just needed more practice rolling- and then finally i looked closer at the covers. Annoying. I will have to order another set of medium and large rollers to really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I get hot rollers, so I can replicate the style she creates when blowing out my hair.  I&#x27;m not able to get it quite as good as she does, but I love how quick and easy the process is!  I work fairly quickly, setting a new roller down on the steamer after taking one off, so it&#x27;s ready once I&#x27;ve wrapped the last one in my hair.  I&#x27;m able to go through my whole head fairly quickly and then finish other tasks while they cool.  Much, much faster than I expected and my 12yo daughter used them on her own with great success as well!</li>
    <li> I have fine, hard to curl hair. Using other techniques, curls usually last about 2 hours. Using Caruso my curls last 14 hours. This is the best tool I have ever found for my hair. It took at few weeks to get the hang of, but once I figured out how long to steam the different size curlers it worked perfectly. If you oversteam the curler by even a second or two it will make your hair wet and it won&#x27;t curl well. If the curler feels hot, you&#x27;ve steamed for too long. My hair has grown in length since I started using this 9 months ago, and I&#x27;ve found that steaming the cover for a couple seconds works for the longer lengths I have now. I go from poker straight hair to Farrah Fawcett bounce. I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments about my hair as I have since I&#x27;ve started using this hairsetter.</li>
    <li> When using a curling iron, the curls would fall out of my hair by the end of the day; a friend told me about the Caruso roller set so I sent for one right away. I cannot believe how fast the roller heats up!!  My hair has more curl now and the curl stays all day!! It doesn&#x27;t take much longer to use the caruso rollers than it did to use the curling iron.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure about this product. The curl just does not stay. I do use a flat iron, so my hair is smooth, then put the rollers in. It doesn&#x27;t stay as smooth with the rollers, possibly due to the steam, but I know it is better for my hair than dry heat. Maybe I need to try it without using the flat iron first. It sure heats up fast though and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this Caruso hairsetter system, i would recommend it to anyone with thin, polka straight hair like me. SOOOOOOOOOO easy to use. Put one curler on the setter for 5 seconds while your curling one a new curler is heating up on the setter. I do my light makeup routine and whe Im finished Voila Wavy spiral curls and created by moist heat. WONT BURN HAIR!  Buy one and give one as a gift- small and compact.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  My hair is thin and the curls hold all day!!!  Please make sure you dry your hair completely; I sit under a hooded dryer.  This will prevent fizz.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a curl with these. I did as people suggested: shake off the excess water; use end paper; put setting lotion in the water. And I made sure to only fill it to the fill line but the water still splashed out of the steamer. I even let the rollers stay in my hair while I dressed and got ready. I&#x27;ll have to try again but I was kind of disappointed with my experience.</li>
    <li> I remember seeing these advertised when I was a child, and they work nothing like the infomercial. By the time I got them hot enough they would leave my hair wet, so no curl. If I steamed them for less than 10 seconds they didn&#x27;t get hot enough and no curl. I was able to return them, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was swayed to try them by other reviews and was greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and look for other curlers.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT .  I LOVE THE CURLS WITHOUT THE DAMAGE TO YOUR HAIR .BE SURE AND USE DISTILLED WATER;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This could be a great product in theory; not so much in practice. At least for me. I&#x27;m sure others have gotten great results with it, but I think maybe my hair type is too fine (and maybe too long, past mid-back) to allow the rollers to dry properly. As I wanted this because it was supposed to dry within 20 minutes or so and I could wait while I did my makeup, having to sit with the rollers in for an hour and still have damp hair defeated the purpose. All I wound up with were damp, frizzy curls. And this may be user error, but I was annoyed by getting really tight curls at the front of my hair but only loose waves everywhere else, even using the same size rollers all over my head. I&#x27;m returning this, not because I think it&#x27;s a bad product, but because it simply didn&#x27;t work out with my hair,&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, if it works with your hair and you can use them properly, the device steams up very quickly and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my hair .... Disappointing</li>
    <li> works amazing.  I hate styling my hair.  I get so impatient.  This works great every time and very fast.  Love it</li>
    <li> I have always loved this set since I was a kid.  As my set before, this once really hold curls well for a long time.  It&#x27;s small compact and easy for storage.  It steams up very quickly. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a molecular curler for over 30 years.  I love it and have very long hair (down to my waist).  Mine uses salt with the water (small amount) and I notice this Caruso does not.  My foam inserts have totally fallen apart but it is a better deal to purchase a kit than to buy just the rollers.  I did purchase foam and plastic rollers and took the foam out and placed on the rollers for my system.  They are short so I had to do a little piece together, but it worked.  I thought I would order a new one (after 30 years I think it is time LOL), and treat myself.  If you have any doubts about this product, put them to bed.  In all ways it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I just received last week - and have only used them twice so I think it&#x27;s too early for a real review.  But my thoughts so far are that I think this set just takes some getting used to.  When I used on myself (a mix of medium and small rollers), it looked great for about 30 minutes and then the curls slowly started to droop.  Within a couple of hours, you couldn&#x27;t tell I had curled my hair.  But when I used them on my daughter (large rollers), it looks wonderful and stayed in for over a day.  I really think I have to play around with the sizes, how much hair to put on each roller, how long to keep the roller on the steamer, if I should steam the shells, long long to leave the rollers in my hair, etc.  I think I will learn to love these as soon as I figure it out.  Overall, it&#x27;s very easy to use and seems much less damaging than other hot rollers. Storage is a little tricky (it does come with a vinyl bag) - especially compared to the compact hot roller sets I&#x27;ve used for years.  Might purchase a small plastic storage bin to store the steamer and 10-12 rollers and put away the rest for the time being.</li>
    <li> These are beyond fantastic.  They do not damage my hair like electric rollers did.  Really these are so quick to use in the morning.  I have had them now for close to a year and still use them a couple times a week. I don&#x27;t need to use every day because the curl holds much better than electric curlers. I don&#x27;t know if the curl  would hold as well for someone with thick hair, but they work for me, and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just my old grey straight hair that couldn&#x27;t handle these curlers.  For a young bleached blonde, I&#x27;m sure they would work.  They hold more moisture than I expected...making the drying time longer and the dissassembly for cleaning is great unless they dissassemble while you&#x27;re wearing them.  Very portable and compact.  I wish they&#x27;d worked for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long thick hair and these were great! She loves the long lasting curl has figured out how to use them pretty quickly!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  The only thing I would change is to somehow make the clips easier to clamp on the rollers.</li>
    <li> These curlers are a lot of work for very little result.  My fine hair did not take the curl for more tha a few hours.  I did like all the different size curlers included but the result just wasnt worth the work</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair is thin and fine and doesn&#x27;t ever hold curl. With this steam curlers I have lasting curls! It&#x27;s healthier than using heat tools!!</li>
    <li> My hair looked great-for about 30 minutes. Does not hold a curl. (I have fine hair)</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy.  She had an older model that required salt for some reason, this model doesn&#x27;t have that annoyance.  The steamer unit is smaller than the old one, but seems to work just as good.</li>
    <li> Hold the curls for an hour maximum.</li>
    <li> Just as the title of my review says, They are awesome! I have very fine, thin hair that NEVER holds a curl. These rollers are amazing and the curl held for days,&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is 3 of the curlers were broken on the ends. Still work fine though.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I have been using Caruso curlers since the 80s.  Great value and good quality.</li>
    <li> It had been years since I had used the Caruso Steam Hairsetter, but wanted to try it again.  It definitely is the quality product that I remembered and I was not disappointed in my decision.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used to get full, bouncy curls that last all day long.  I leave them in for 10-15 minutes, gently take them out, and spray a little hair spray for all-day hold.  Your hair does not get weighed down by traditional hot curlers - these are very light.  And no more direct heat from a damaging metal iron.  People ask me all the time about my curls.  I tell them to try it for themselves.  There&#x27;s no going back for me!  My long hair is damaged enough from years of color and bleaching in the salon.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> These curlers work amazing! Very easy to use, and tons of curlers in the starter package. I have a TON of very thick, long hair, and I was able to do it all at the same time. The curls turned out SUPER curly in a short amount of time, and stayed a long time without any hair spray. For this first time curler user, this is IT.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old one that was falling a part. I love the way my hair looks after using this product.</li>
    <li> I find these rollers superior for my very straight, thin hair. I love the way they work and do not dry out or burn your hair. That said, I was frustrated because the first time I ordered, I discovered that the factory in China has labeled both the LARGE and the JUMBO rollers as JUMBO LARGE. At first I thought I had received the set with 12 JUMBO LARGE rollers and no LARGE. I returned it and Amazon sent a new set. I finally realized that I did have 6 LARGE ROLLERS, but they are incorrectly marked as JUMBO LARGE. I contacted the manufacturer (Helen of Troy) who was uninterested and said they have &amp;#34;never heard of this complaint before.&amp;#34; Since I really like the product, I kept them and used a permanent marker to mark each of the rollers and shields &amp;#34;X for x-large or Jumbo, L for Large, M for medium, and so on. I wish the manufacturer would COLOR CODE the SIZES. I would gladly pay more for the increased costs, because they would be so much easier to use. Did anyone have a similar experience? Don&#x27;t you just hate it when a manufacturer totally ignores the consumers? Hey, Helen of Troy, are you listening...I said I would even PAY MORE IF YOU COLOR CODED the sizes! I guess there is a reason Helen of Troy was known for her beauty; not brains.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, It takes much longer than expected to get your hair dry from the steam, even when you use a blow drier on the curlers.  It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of the steam rollers.  My first set was actually my mom&#x27;s and she didn&#x27;t let me take them with me when i moved out!  I like these rollers because they don&#x27;t take long to heat up (each one takes just a few seconds and can be done while you&#x27;re getting the next strand of hair ready) and they don&#x27;t have to stay in my hair for more than 5 minutes for me to get a good curl.  I love how soft and smooth my hair feels afterwards from the steam!  The only complaint I have is that the covers for the rollers, sometimes leave a ridge at the base of my hair, but it&#x27;s easy enough to comb smooth with a little bit of water.  These rollers are also great for my daughter because they don&#x27;t get too hot and won&#x27;t burn her, like some rollers or a curling iron might.  Both my daughter and I have straight and smooth hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl incredibly well, but I have found that these rollers work better than any other rollers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It is a clever idea, and I like that I wasn&#x27;t subjecting my hair to extreme heat.  I was disappointed that I had to steam one roller at at time, but in practice, it was not a problem.  It only took 3-4 seconds, and the roller contained just the right amount of moisture.  What did present the problem was that some of the clips didn&#x27;t fit well, and were difficult to lock on.  My hair is chin length, and fairly thin, so the rollers started drooping and falling out within just a few minutes.  I even had to redo a couple of them midway through because they just didn&#x27;t want to stay in.  If they designed a roller that also had some teeth to help hold them in place, I might have been more successful.</li>
    <li> I have used product for years. would still prefer system with salt added but can not seem to locate one</li>
    <li> There are quick and easy to put in your hair, and my curls always last all day long with just a little hair spray (doesn&#x27;t happen with a curling iron, that&#x27;s for sure).  I&#x27;m never too frizzy, and I don&#x27;t use any anti-frizz or heat protecting products.  Sometimes my three year old daughter and I curl our hair together with these and it&#x27;s never too hot against her head.  Though, having three year old hair, her curls don&#x27;t last as long.  If your hair is SUPER thin or you&#x27;re using these for a little girl, try some dry shampoo before you curl-- that might help!</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly however I am Latina with wavy mid long hair and these are more like for short corse hair. I read great reviews but it just wasn&#x27;t for me/my hair type. But the steam rollers do get very hot.</li>
    <li> I like the steam hair curler set. It creates great nice waves and they lost a long time. I also like that it&#x27;s using moist heat which won&#x27;t be as damaging to the hair. (I think.) Just be careful not to burn your hands. I was careless a few times.</li>
    <li> It curls my hair and gives it volume, but the steam also makes my hair a big frizzy which I don&#x27;t like :(</li>
    <li> Did really curl my hair.  Kind of took the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; off, but didn&#x27;t CURL. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have straight Asian hair... Not the super thick kind... But straight nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used curling irons, hot rollers, straightening irons...&lt;br /&gt;But this seems to keep my hair bouncy and wavy all night.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft my hair feels when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;*i don&#x27;t use styling products with it... No hairspray, heat protectors, nothing!!&lt;br /&gt;And I am satisfied with how long it holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!!</li>
    <li> If your hair is fine you will probably have a little bit more luck. Mine didn&#x27;t do much without a lot of extra effort and the curlers staying it for way longer then the recommenced timeframe. I gave these away.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this set&lt;br /&gt; when I got them, the rollers did even get warm after they were steamed.  However I was gently surprised when I took them out.  The key is to blow dry your hair for a few minutes before you unroll them and don&#x27;t comb your hair right away.  I liked the fact that they don&#x27;t entangle my hair and my hair reaches most my back.</li>
    <li> worthless, too long to heat up, can only put one roller on at a time.  not worth the money, don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I used it long ago then, moved on, when I could not find it in the stores. i decided to revisit this product after using another for many years. Now I remember why I love it sooo much. I have OLD,  dry, curly/fritsy hair. These rollers  add moisture and smooth the frizzies while adding body and curl. Easy and quick to use......LOVE</li>
    <li> These curlers work really well!! They hold curl nicely and are easy to use! I didn&#x27;t have to leave mine on for very long at all for them to get hot!</li>
    <li> I had a set of these rollers for many years and used them almost daily.  I passed them on to my daughter and bought myself a new set.  The great thing about these rollers is that they do not damage hair.  The steam quickly curls hair and infuses moisture instead of drying hair out like curling irons or plain hot rollers.  Another thing I love is you can get as much curl as you want.  Since I have naturally wavy hair, I just roll my hair, and when I finish rolling, I remove the rollers.  I don&#x27;t leave them in unless I want a tighter curl.  Either way, a great set of rollers.</li>
    <li> I am having a very busy day - but I had to take time out to write this review.  This is the best beauty care item I have purchased in a LONG, LONG time.  I am growing my hair out long.  It is just barely past shoulder length now.  It&#x27;s baby soft and fine, but not thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I practice medicine which means a couple of things specific to this item:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  I need to look put together and professional every day&lt;br /&gt;(2)  I need something that cuts down on my getting-ready-for-the-day preparation time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain of growing one&#x27;s hair out is that it often reaches stages that require DAILY routines that require a long time to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;Plus those routines usually involve lots of heat ... e.g. curling irons, hot rollers,etc&lt;br /&gt;Bad news because:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I don&#x27;t have lots of time to spare.&lt;br /&gt;(2) All of that heat was actually changing the color of my hair - so I knew it wasn&#x27;t doing the hair shafts any favors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product thinking, &amp;#34;What the heck ... if it&#x27;s as great as it sounds, YAY.  If it&#x27;s not ... well, I&#x27;ll send it back.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely in &amp;#34;YAY&amp;#34; mode ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fast and easy to use.  It&#x27;s easy on the hair -- in fact, good for the hair.  AND the curls REALLY DO LAST.  As in at least 2 days.  Actually, today (and this is the THIRD day after initial curling) my hair still looked nice enough to go to work with nothing more than brushing it again.  When I first got up I thought &amp;#34;no way - I&#x27;m going to have to curl it all again.&amp;#34;  Then I brushed it through, and, VOILA!  Ready to go for another day.  Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips I have learned:&lt;br /&gt;1.  You don&#x27;t want the spongy part of the curler to be wet.  You want it to be HEATED with the steam.  If you wait until it is wet, your curl won&#x27;t set right ... and will fall out because they will be damp themselves.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Plug it in and give it a few minutes (3 or so) to work up a good steam.  If you start curling before the steam is really going, your first curlers won&#x27;t get as &amp;#34;steamed up&amp;#34; as the later ones, and you will end up with inconsistent results.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Separate the hair you are going to roll onto the curler BEFORE you put the curler on the steamer.  Because the curler will cool down quickly if you take it off the steam, then set it down while you are getting the hair ready.  So straight from steamer to hair!&lt;br /&gt;4.  I have found that if I press down on the curler (gentle pressure) as it sits on the steamer, the steam seems to distribute more evenly through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with an order form for additional curlers of whatever size you want.  They take several weeks to arrive when ordered that way - but are cheaper than ordering them on Amazon.  However, you can use the bigger curlers and just wind the hair tightly on them for about the same result as the using the smaller curlers wound at medium tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require much storage space, so it packs great!  I really appreciate the storage bag for the curlers/clamps, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, a last tip.  Get a sharpie pen, and mark &amp;#34;J&amp;#34; for Jumbo, &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; for Large, &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; for Medium, &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; for Small, and &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; for Petite on both ends of the respective-sized curlers.  That makes it easier to grab the right one quickly as you are &#x27;rolling along&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT !  TEN STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!eam is really going, your first curlers won&#x27;t get as &amp;#34;steamed up&amp;#34; as the later ones, and you will end up with inconsistent results.&lt;br /&gt;3.

    <li> Ladies this is a must have, especially if you are someone who likes to change up your look ever so often. I had one of these when it now came out (if I recall correctly 20  yrs ago) and you had to use salt in the water.  It is so nice when a product does what is claims it can do. When done as instructed, curls really do last for days.  Presently I have a pixi cut that I am growing out.  I used the petite and small curlers and I brushed my hair as normal for three days and my hair still had a lot of volume for the three days. I was really surprised by the negative comments.  I do think it is very easy to use and worth buying&lt;br /&gt; I would strongly recommend you use distilled water and still clean unit by putting say a teaspoon of white vinegar and let the steam run through for say 5 mins, then  of course clean well before reusing.  How often you use vinegar will depend on how often you use curlers.  This will prevent that mineral build up.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Caruso rollers.  I had the first set for at least 5 years.  After I bought this set, I read the instructions that said you should clean the steamer in case of water deposits.  So I recommend doing that.  This set is fast, and very portable for travel.  I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m african american, it may make you a little nappy. It makes the hair kinda damp.  You know what that means.  You get a tight curl.</li>
    <li> I had a set of these curlers many years ago until the rollers kind of began to rot and I tossed it. I remembered that I used to have to put a pinch of salt in the steamer which you no longer have to do. The problem is, my hair still isn&#x27;t holding the curl. My hair comes out of the rollers super curly but alas, like other methods, my long and fine hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl after using these any longer than other methods.</li>
    <li> My wife has fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for long using hot tools. These steam rollers produce long lasting, beautiful curls with no damage. With six rollers in each size, there are more than enough to create any look she wants. The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the SECOND time she used the machine, the regular steam setting no longer worked. She was going to compare the results of the ion setting to the regular steam setting, and tried the ion first. When she went to try regular steam, the unit wouldn&#x27;t activate unless it was in the ion setting. She has been using the ion function ever since, but it makes an annoying clicking sound. We&#x27;ll see how many uses she gets out of it before the whole thing stops working. If it&#x27;s less than 6 months, I will be revising my rating.</li>
    <li> I really did a lot of research on rollers and these were so highly rated that I finally bit the bullet and bought a set. I have thin fine medium to long length hair. The only plus to these is they don&#x27;t damage your hair. They do curl my hair and stay in with no products for about 6 hrs but I don&#x27;t like the way it curls. To make my hair stay on the roller I have to wrap it tighter which means the different size rollers become pointless. And I&#x27;m looking for volume not all over curl(which is what it gave me). Also if left on the steamer to long it will cause my hair to go frizzy. And I have 4 little kids and trying to make sure I time all the rollers while dealing with kids in the morning is distracting. My last complaint is the roller clips if you can call them that. I fight about half of them to stay in and they cause a line where they are put in at. So all in all I&#x27;m not a fan. I hate that I bought these and will never use them again and stuck with them, but lesson learned...</li>
    <li> I was using rollers that warm up, and those dried out my hair.  Now using the Caruso setter, and this is much better for my hair.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have &#x27;difficult&#x27; shoulder length hair.  Humidity is my enemy.  I suggest using the largest rollers unless you want really curly hair.  This products makes my hair soft.  Like some of the reviews, the curl does not last very long but long enough for me. Don&#x27;t expect your hair to look perfect the next day.  I find letting my hair dry naturally and then setting.  Curl last longer.  Recommend this product for quickness and ease of use.  Take your time doing it and you will be pleased!</li>
    <li> Though these rollers work I don&#x27;t seem to get as much curl as I do with a curling iron. I might have to try it a few more times to really get it to work well with my long, thick hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best in the market.  It gives strong curls and waves without damaging your hair.  Also, it easy,sage and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, and the Caruso give me uniform curls without harming my hair.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this system since it first came out.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid hot roller user for over 15 years.  My favorite set died and is no longer made so I have been on a relentless pursuit for something comparable.  Due to health issues the past couple of years, my hair has become more thin and prone to damage and breakage.  This is the first set of steam rollers I have tried in an effort to do less damage to my hair from direct heat styling.  I have mixed opinions on this product.  The clips are terrible.  Depending upon which direction you are placing the roller in your hair, the clips may not hold at all.  I threw all of the included clips in the box and use other butterfly-style clips instead that hold the rollers perfectly in place at the scalp.  The rollers themselves are comfortable and easy to use.  The unit heats up and begins steaming within a few seconds and it takes just a couple of seconds to steam each roller - the time it takes for you to section your hair to roll.  So using this heat-as-you-go system does not take any longer than a traditional hot roller system where the rollers are all heated at once.  In fact, this goes faster since you do not have to wait 10-15 minutes for an entire set of rollers to heat.  The steam from the rollers does not do any damage to the hair and the rollers do not pull or break my hair as other &amp;#34;hot rollers&amp;#34; can do.  You still must blow dry your hair before using the steam rollers, so your hair still suffers from that.  It takes a bit of practice to determine the perfect amount of steam (how many seconds to steam your rollers) for your hair type.  Otherwise your hair will not curl and end up limp and lifeless instead from too much steam.  I have tried to &amp;#34;quick-set&amp;#34; the rollers with the cold setting on my blow dryer hoping for a better curl as indicated in the instruction manual, but this just made my curls frizzy.  I typically leave the rollers in my hair for about 10 minutes, unroll, let set for a few minutes, then brush through curls with my fingers.I have found that for my fine, thin hair I cannot steam my hair two days in a row without washing in between or the curl will not set again.  I end up with lifeless hair.  I love that the steam unit is very compact and takes up very little room.  I hate that the &amp;#34;carrying case&amp;#34; is a cheap clear plastic tote.  I wish there were some other way to organize the rollers to keep them all together and handy as you are getting ready.  It is nice that you get a total of 30 rollers in a variety of sizes and are able to order additional rollers in whatever sizes you want.  Unfortunately, ALL the different size rollers are the same color.  This makes it difficult to determine which are which when you are trying to get ready in a hurry especially since, as I stated before, there is no real method to keep these organized.  The same goes for the clips.  If you actually liked the clips and wanted to use them, you&#x27;d better keep them on the correct size rollers all the time or it is a nightmare trying to get everything all matched up again on 30 different rollers when you are in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work but my hair (long, thick and straight) doesn&#x27;t keep the shape more than an hour (even with extra hold hairspray). It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair looked nice... for about half an hour.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso Steam Rollers.  It keeps my hair soft and curly.  I would recommend this product to people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these. Her hair is very thick and hard to curl. These work GREAT</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. I have the finest, limpest, most uncooperative hair ever. It seriously does not like to curl, ever. My test drive with these, I got a full 6 hours of curls on a summer&#x27;s day with zero product whatsoever in my hair. With a good setting lotion and a little hair spray to finish, I get excellent curls for whatever my needs! Do I want an afro? Or just luscious waves? Or how about doing following a 50&#x27;s pattern for the perfect bombshell curls? The longer the hair stays in the roller, the better your curls! These are definitely not the most comfortable, but they are amazing at curling. I throw on a bandana or two to keep the rollers in place and will go about my business (I&#x27;m fairly certain that my neighbors think I&#x27;m crazy). In the evening, my hair will be stunning! If you sleep on your front, you may be able to swing sleeping in them... but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, which is a huge DUH and error on my part... in humid weather and when it&#x27;s rainy, even these beauties can do nothing to help my hair.</li>
    <li> When I first pull the rollers out my curls look great! But it doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve tried using is with hairspray both before and after using the rollers, but no lucky. :(</li>
    <li> These were a gift and my wife has been enjoying how well the rollers works for her.  Makes her thin hair come alive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I was desperate for a hair-safe way to get long-lasting curls and everyone said these curls last for days. Unfortunately, this is still just the same-old curler set and curls will fall out in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight, medium-width hair and followed the directions exactly. The steamer only takes a minute to produce steam, which is pretty quick. I put the curler on for the directed amount of time (4-7 seconds) and they were not hot to the touch or wet, but I wanted to follow the directions exactly. I put each curler in my hair exactly as the instructions said. I was testing the product so I did half my head without steaming the covers and the other half with the covers steamed (Just under 5 seconds, as instructed). I waited longer than 15 minutes (probably 20-25) and removed the curlers. I was really hoping for something great, but there was no curl at all! It was barely wavy and within two minutes it looked like I had intentionally straightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed, I tried for round 2. This time, I used the petite curlers (before I had used a mixture of medium and small) and put them in steam for around 9 seconds (maybe my hair is thicker than I thought?). I steamed all the covers, although I saw no discernable difference before. I let them sit for roughly 25 minutes before removing the curlers. This time, I had a proper curl! (Yay!) Unfortunately, just 3 hours later my hair was wavy at best. (Darn!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I tried again, messing around with several techniques. I finally got a curl again, but it lasted maybe 3 hours max before it was all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product is pretty much a standard curler set... which is fine. It&#x27;s just not the miracle I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Steam starts up quick. Includes tons of curlers at different sizes. Curlers are not hot to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Curls fall out quickly. Does not work as instructions indicate. Very difficult to use and hard to achieve a proper curl.</li>
    <li> I has these when I was a kid. I lent them out and never got them back. My hair is thinned out from bleach and hair extensions and I have fine hair in top of it. My hair is healing. Im done with the bleach and extensions but it&#x27;s a slow go getting it healthy again in top of it just not being a great head of hair to begin with.  I put mouse in my hair when it is still wet tease my roots just a tiny bit when it&#x27;s dry for some volume because I have none and I let the rollers do the rest of the work. My hair comes out shiny and bouncy just like in a shampoo commercial! My stylist doesn&#x27;t even do as good a job with pin curls or the barrel iron. I love these. I won&#x27;t be lending them out this time around.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers  They hold the curl much better than others and don&#x27;t damage the hair.  I buy these as gifts.</li>
    <li> I owned a salon for many years and am very impressed with this set. I only wish I knew about them sooner. They give great curl without damage.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying these curlers....the clips are the worst. They don&#x27;t grab the hair NOR to do they stay in. So sad I wasted my money...the clips are really bad.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. I am not impressed with these rollers since it takes way too much time (and lots of practice) to get it right. Part of my curls were way too tight, I had to use the blow dryer and a brush to &amp;#34;uncurl&amp;#34; them. Not enough large rollers for my med. long hair, the small ones are useless unless you have real short hair. Also the clamps to hold the rollers leave a mark on the curl which again requires a round brush and a blow dryer to even it out. Another item that will rot away in a drawer since I - regretfully - disposed of the box prior to testing them.</li>
    <li> I HATE ELETRIC ROLLERS THEY BURN AND FRY YOUR HAIR. I HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR AND I NO SOONER PUT IT UP THEN I TAKE IT DOWN. I LOVE IT ! IT IS SO QUICK I CAN DO IT EVERY MORNING! GREAT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this set. It is perfect I. Size an doesn&#x27;t require any further roller purchase. This was the one for her.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING FOR 20 YEARS WOULD NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE. USE WITH PAUL MITCHELL SHAMPOO 1 AND LEAVE IN CONDITION AND CURLS WILL LAST ALL DAY WITH KENRA 25 HAIRSPRAY</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and takes up very little counter space. Easy to travel with. Half the price of ones on the local store!</li>
    <li> Loved this the first two times then after that the rollers fall right off (heat causes things to expand) so rollers are no longer tight...very annoying loves this at first smh</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They heal broken hair and makes glorious curls.&lt;br /&gt;- Anonymous please do not quote my name thanks</li>
    <li> Caruso, you blew it when you tried to improve on the old version of the steamer.  This one is horrible.  The canister is too small.  The plastic roller cover does not fit over the steamer spout nearly as well as it did on the old steamer and therefore does not heat up the cover prior to securing over the rolled hair.  I would not recommend this product and deem it to be a waste of my money</li>
    <li> I have bleach damaged hair and using this makes me feel good about curling my hair. It is easy and fun to use. And the curls are sooooo sexy. Especially using the large and x-large curlers, the resulting waves are unbelievable. You will feel like a goddess with silky, smooth, healthy looking manes!</li>
    <li> This is a great set for fine hair. I used to rely on &amp;#34;crunch curling&amp;#34; wet hair with a blow dryer, but these give a softer, healthier-looking finish to my hair.  The curls are long lasting, too, if you allow the rollers to cool before removing them, and then gently blow dry the curls on a cool setting after removing the rollers to thoroughly set.  If your hair has any body at all, these curlers should work very well.  Just use them as directed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an A-line cut - short in back and long in front. I use the medium size on the longest hair (which is chin length) and the large rollers on the medium length hair - parting into about 1/2&amp;#34; sections or less. I use the small rollers for the shortest hair but I part those curls into larger pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a fun, touseled look, gently &amp;#34;comb through&amp;#34; the cooled curls with your fingers, then bend over and blow dry hair on low (cool setting) very briefly to separate strands and erase &amp;#34;curler&amp;#34; lines.  Spritz with hairspray before standing up and tossing head back. If needed, coat your palms with a light pomade and gently touch any frizzy ends. Don&#x27;t overcoat hair with product. Then with fingertips, move curls where you want them using a light, upward motion. Reposition strands to your liking an then Spritz finished look with hairspray, drying with blow dryer between spritzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wavy hairdo lasts all day and the compliments do too!</li>
    <li> These did not work on my very thick, full hair.  I was also very dissappointed that they could not be returned with a postage paid label.</li>
    <li> I hesitantly bought these after reading reviews about rollers everywhere. Because they were rated so highly and were greatly recommended I bought them. I thought it would take me longer to put the rollers on than regular rollers that all heat at once in a single carrier...I was so wrong!!! It&#x27;s super fast, leaves my hair soft (as opposed to mildly toasted like a Conair roller set that I had). I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have used the caruso hair setter for years. I panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelf at wallmart when my old one quit. Finally realized duh look on line and my prayers were answered. I have extremely thick wavy hair and this works amazing and with having steam you have no hair damage.My hair curls so easy that by the time I get the last curler in I can actually start taking out the first one. Now my daughter in law who has never been able to curl her hair because it is super fine and straight now fights me for my hair setter because it works for her to. So for anyone out there looking for a hairsetter for all types hair  I personally can gaurantee this is the one you want. Believe me stop looking and purchase now. I hoped to G they never stop making this hairsetter. I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, not pin-straight, but close. I&#x27;m caucasian &amp; 38. When using hot curling iron, it takes me about 8 minutes to create some waves that last a couple hours. These Caruso curlers might also take me about 8 min to put all in (I&#x27;m new with it too) then I can finish getting kids ready, etc &amp; come back. The cold shot with dryer makes a difference, and the curls (even with Jumbo) are amazingly bouncy &amp; shiny. It absolutely relaxes to a nice body look which I spray, and its better than curling iron gives. That holds for several hours, but by end of day its all but a memory. Forget the \\&quot;days\\&quot; claim. Even when I put gel in first that didn&#x27;t happen. Now after using them about 5 times, the clips seem to slip off easier, causing great frustration. It does require distilled water, which the csr told me - the website &amp; box do not. Mine came WITHOUT instructions or styling guide, which 2 weeks later I&#x27;m still waiting for its arrival from the company. Disappointed with these issues, but I do like the change from hot iron, and the curls are beautiful, so I still gave 3 stars. My hair dresser thought they had a good reputation.</li>
    <li> These curlers are a good deal for the price. I have friends with short and medium length hair and they work great for them. However, I have very long hair and the curls don&#x27;t seem to set as well as a good curling iron. However, the payoff is better hair quality, as steam heat is far less damaging. All in all, Caruso curlers are a good addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I have extra fine hair so my hair loses curl fast. Naturally I was very skeptical of this product, but I bought it anyway.  I am so glad I did because it works great, the curls stays all day and it is really easy to use.  I can finally have curls in my hair, YAY!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank You!!  Got this veryyyy fast and just love the Caruso rollers!</li>
    <li> I. Love. These. I&#x27;m still learning how to use them, they are different than your average hot roller. I have pin straight, stubborn hair which goes a few inches past my shoulder blades. These made it curl, and it was still a little bit curled the next morning, which is unheard of for me. Hot rollers only last an hour before it just makes my hair look like it has volume. I have fairly thick hair too, so this tells you the wonders it works.</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products and I always come back to Caruso. I have long, curly hair and these give me a beautiful \\&quot;beach\\&quot; look.  These curls hold longer than with any other product.  I like the steam heat as my hair feels more healthy.  It does not feel stiff or damaged like when I use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> My perm was getting dull and I didn&#x27;t want to perm my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gave me the refresh I needed.  It&#x27;s quick and simple and so now I am looking good . . . . . again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 15 yr old  curler set. Glad I didn&#x27;t through it away before I  got to try  it out.  Doesn&#x27;t hold the curl. Uneven  curling . Terrible results. I bought this because of the positive reviews .  That was a lesson learned!!!</li>
    <li> I love this steam curler set and haven&#x27;t had any issues. I do wish it had more of the larger size rollers, but I&#x27;ll just need to buy extra. Also, my hair is pretty fine so sometimes they won&#x27;t stay. If the covers had some sort of grip on them, that would be helpful for those of us with fine, straight hair. I love the volume it gives my hair, but the curls don&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for these rollers after reading all of the positive reviews. I read the instructions thoroughly, watched several tutorials online. hen I tried a different technique every day for almost a week.  These DO NOT work on my fine hair (there is lots of it and it has some natural wave - doesn&#x27;t help).  Only if I take tiny sections and use the smallest rollers do I get a bit of curl or wave, which is completely gone by the next morning. I will switch back to traditional hot rollers, as they have worked much better in the past.</li>
    <li> This is great, I got the curls I want!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these.  I like to take them out of my hair and style.  These have to dry first and I don&#x27;t have time for that.</li>
    <li> HAIR SLIPS OUT OF SHIELDS .  MORE TROUBLE THAN USING A CURLING IRON.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that curls my thick and straight hair well.  I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as my last one that is pink, but I needed new rollers and the price was similar to just buy a whole new set.  I like to use my old molecular steamer with the new rollers, but if I didn&#x27;t have that option, this would still work pretty great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of different curlers and curling irons, and rods, and this set works very well.  Lightweight and it really sets your curls if you leave them in as directed.</li>
    <li> I love Caruso curlers have been using them for  over 10 years. I do not have damaged hair because it is all I use to curl my hair. I have fine straight hair. These curlers never let me down.</li>
    <li> The hair rollers work really well, 4 sizes of rollers are included.  Instructions are well written and easy to follow. The steam unit is great and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I guess I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use them correctly yet.  I let the roller steam for 10 seconds before rolling my hair. But after 15 minutes or so of wearing them, when I take them out, my hair is damp.  Also, the rollers slip out of the clip.  Hmmm.  I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it takes extra time.  You have to leave the curlers in longer than hot rollers; until the steam dries on your hair.  It curls pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t last all day on my hair, which is thick and coarse.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this set by my hairdresser as an alternative to damaging curling irons.  I have used it at least a dozen times and I am extremely happy with its ease of use and the results.</li>
    <li> I have tried to curl my shoulder length hair seveal times and it curls a little bit but just won&#x27;t stay in. Also it leaves ridges in my hair from the covers on the rollers. The only way I found that works is to twist it and roll it up to my scalp, then the ridges aren&#x27;t so noticable. It still won&#x27;t stay in very long though. I guess it&#x27;s my hair and /or my skill at using them.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and easy to use. The curl lasts, a long time, but not necessarily true to the original style the next day (but still wavy and full). Love that it is steam - I literally use no hair products with this and my hair maintains volume, sheen and a beautiful wave. I have very long hair and do find the curl is bouncier and lasts longer if I wrap my head after putting the rollers in and let them set for 20 or so minutes. I have not tried using a hairdryer to achieve the 30sec curl... These are great because they have no converter issue traveling overseas... BUT they are bulky and although Caruso provides you with a bag to carry it all in, it&#x27;s not like having a convenient carry case to stow in your luggage.</li>
    <li> The curlers would not stay put in my hair, not for fine hair . Also the clips were not easy to use</li>
    <li> my hair has no body and thin. theses rollers stay in until I take them out and the curl lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The wife is happy with these, stay cool and work well.  The rollers assortment was just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as she is happy, I am (even though they don&#x27;t work for me !)</li>
    <li> So far so good...just got them and haven&#x27;t used them to much yet.  My hairdresser uses them so I thought I would give them a try.</li>
    <li> Makes perfect curls.  It doesn&#x27;t damage the hair as heat irons do.  Good price. Delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well these work. I have a TON of different curling tools at home, but none work as well and as easily as these. As others have said, make sure your hair is D-R-Y! And then try to leave them in for at least 45 minutes - more if you can. Yes, the clips will leave a slight crease in your hair, but as the curls straightens out a bit (trust me you want it to as you will look like a poodle as soon as you take them out), the crease dissapates. I wholeheartedly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I would have given the product 5 stars because it works great.  I&#x27;m not happy with the fact that I didn&#x27;t get what the packages states is inside. I received 12 Jumbo and I didn&#x27;t get any large rollers.  I also received 1 medium, 1 small and 1 petite cover (no roller).</li>
    <li> I usually use the Sedu clipless curling iron and love it but wanted to see if this would be faster. My hair curls easily and it&#x27;s fine. Well, this took FOREVER!! I swear I was at it for over an hour at least both times.. I followed complete instructions twice and both times it took forever. GOD BLESS my Sedu. Anyway, guess what kind of curls I got with the Caruso? No curls! just nothing. Some of the hair had a very slight, strangely shaped curl. I did NOT over saturate curlers or under saturate. Left them in until dry etc. I do NOT understand all the raving reviews. They must be getting paid or something. Who has three hours to get ready in the morning? Not me.</li>
    <li> I had one of these several years ago and I loved it.  The only problem was that the steam unit was to large.  They fixed the problem and included a carrying pouch so this perfect for use at home or on the road.  Cuts my morning routine down and is very simple to use.  I put the rollers in and by the time I finish applying makeup my hair is fabulous.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR NATURALS! It heats up incredibly fast and curls within 15 minutes. No more hours of roller setting. I tested this on a wig and my natural hair and was impressed beyond measure. No more curling iron! No more heat damage. The best part is how soft your hair feels with no product on it.</li>
    <li> Very happy hearing from a friend that Amazon carried this product.  I used these rollers for years.  I replaced my original one and had it for years and then when it came to replacing it a second time I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Glad I found it and I&#x27;m as happy as I was with the original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two of these and love them.  I only use bottled water  The second one just died on me and I wonder if they have a Planned Obsolescence built in...  Still, well worth the price to keep getting another!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ve used up two of these in past years.  I am glad someone is still making them.</li>
    <li> The Caruso Molecular Hairsetters are just fantastic.  They are simple to use and very healthy for your hair.   The steam provides much needed moisture, esp[ecially in winter and if you process your hair.  The whole process is also very quick.  I can get my hair set and ready in less than 15 minutes.  I bought this as a replacement for my 15 year old hair setter.  The improvements on the original design are very good.</li>
    <li> Honest review here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair came out SILKY SOFT after I curled it with these curlers. In comparison, I have some electronic hot rollers and my hair comes out a bit charred. ;) I didn&#x27;t even realize my hair was getting fried so much until I had the comparison to Caruso and had SOFT SILKY hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is already pretty soft naturally. So for my hair to be crispy with electric rollers/curling iron and then to compare them to Caruso SOFT hair??? CARUSO showed me that it&#x27;s possible to HAVE silky soft hair!!!! Let me say that again-- CARUSO SHOWED ME that it&#x27;s possible to have silky soft curly hair. I mean really?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take awhile getting used to putting one foam curler at a time on the steam machine. And then the transition of the curler to hair, curler cap to the steam, then hold the foam curler as the cap gets heated, then put cap on curler--- yeah. That takes awhile to get used to but for silky soft seriously amazing hair? And the avoidance of split ends?? I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is so fine, it damages SUPER quickly from blow drying, curling irons, and hot rollers. I am looking forward to amazing looking hair without the split ends. Before I wouldn&#x27;t be able to grow my hair out quickly because of my need to cut the ends off all the time due to styling everyday and therefore MAJOR split ends. Caruso has helped me see that I could actually grow my hair out (shoulder length to mid back is my goal) while still styling it every day because I won&#x27;t be damaging INCHES of hair as it grows. HEALTHY HAIR, HERE I COME!!!!!!!! *EXCITED!!* &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the curls you get from Caruso stay in better and longer than electric hot rollers or a curling iron. This is comparatively WITHOUT any hair product to help the styling tools. Caruso, gives a sweet cute little curl. I feel so delicate and pretty afterward with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To note, when you take your hair out of Caruso curlers, you will have a line where the curling cap laid on your hair. I combed my hands through hair but it was still there. So I just used my blow dryer to shake my hair out and the lines disappeared! wonderful. I also chose to style my bangs with a blow dryer bc i didn&#x27;t like how Caruso curls looked on them. But that&#x27;s not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair holds curl REALLY well so I can&#x27;t speak for those with flat fine hair with difficulty to curl your hair. But I can speak about fine hair that gets easily charred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caruso will leave your hair SILKY, SHINY, SERIOUSLY SOFT and leaving you feeling beautiful! Sweet curls? I felt like a beauty today. ;)my hands through hair but it was still there. So I just used my blow dryer to shake my hair out and the lines disappeared! wonderful.

    <li> My wife had this when we were dating and it quit, I went online and found the same exact model but diferent color and ordered it for her.  It works just as good and she is happy, sadly, this will likely out last us!  It&#x27;s a really good product, my wife uses it almost every morning using tap water, which is probably not so good for it but like I said it lasted 25 years!</li>
    <li> Had been needing to replace my old hot rollers when I found these online.  I&#x27;ve only had them a week, but they work great.  Steam unit heats up quickly and the rollers are easy to use.  You do have to allow time for the curls to \\&quot;set\\&quot; as the steam dampens your hair.  Take it down too soon, your hair will be damp and the curls will fall out.  I also go ahead and take out the rollers I want to use, remove clips and have them set up on the counter for me to use.  Handy bag for storage is included. I remove the roller, put the clip back on it, and toss it in the bag. When I&#x27;ve removed all rollers, just place the bag in the cabinet for storage. Curls do last longer than regular hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair at all...I have very long blonde hair! The ends were frizzy and the curl went out of my hair with in minutes!</li>
    <li> These rollers work as described and are probably much better for hair than other types and curling irons, but it takes too long for hair to dry unless you have time to stand there with a blow dryer for 15 or so minutes.  After leaving them in for 30 minutes my hair was still damp.  I tried to cut back further on the time left on the steamer, but that didn&#x27;t really help much.  They are just way too time consuming for me.</li>
    <li> If Caruso ever stops making this product I will be in trouble and seriously sad.  I have baby fine, super straight hair that I have ruined in the past by coloring, blow drying, hot roller, and hot ironing to death all in failed attempts to make it appear as if it had a little oomph.  I&#x27;ve braided it wet, I&#x27;ve have had long uncomfortable nights sleeping on a head full of rollers, I&#x27;ve wasted countless dollars on volume shampoos and still was not happy with the results that would end up a stringy mess within hours.  Until, that is, I discovered the Caruso Steam Hairsetter. This roller is easy to use, very affordable, and versatile.  I use the biggest rollers because I&#x27;m looking for more wave/volume than curls but can wrap up my hair in a spiral for nice wave or roll them up loosely for volume.  I use them on dry hair that I&#x27;ve washed the night before, and spritz each curl with a bit of hair spray after rolling up and before putting the cap over the roller.  Then I put on my makeup and take them out for tons of volume that will last the entire day.  I&#x27;m not going to claim that my curls \\&quot;last for day\\&quot; because my hair is too oily and it&#x27;s just not true but I&#x27;m thrilled they last one day and all without contributing to the damage I&#x27;ve already done to my hair.  All you need is an outlet, water, a comb and hair spray (if your hair is as fine as mine), a little practice (if you&#x27;re new to rolling up rollers) and your hair will look like lovely. I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> This is the third &amp;#34;molecular&amp;#34; steam foam roller hairsetter I&#x27;ve owned in 30 years. You cannot beat the curls and the moist steam doesn&#x27;t fry your hair the way regular heated hairstyling tools do. My hair is shoulder-length and I am Caucasian. My curls do not more than a day, the result some people get, but is probably because I sleep on the curls because my hair is shorter. The curls you do get that day though: WOW! I almost always get compliments on my hair when I use this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair curling system as an alternative to using a curling iron hoping that it would be quicker and that the results would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heated up very quickly which is good, but the rollers were too hot to handle and wouldn&#x27;t have the curling power once they were cool enough to touch. I also found it difficult to leave these set in because the hard plastic cases that are meant to hold the rollers in place were bulky and i had trouble adding layers.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Not as good as the older model I used to have.  Maybe because the older model used salt and this one doesn&#x27;t?  It works, just not as well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s better on clean hair.  does not dry hair; moistens an softens it.  works fast, so i keep an hour at most on my long, curly, fine hair.  may need to use an additional product to preserve the style, especially in humid areas.</li>
    <li> I have had my Caruso steam curler set for over 20 years! It has lasted forever and my hair still curls beautifully!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I used it once and now it&#x27;s broken. Tried cleaning it and nada. Used filtered water.&lt;br /&gt;Steam doesn&#x27;t come out anymore. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am an african-american female and was skeptical about purchasing this product because I have natural (no perm) shoulder length hair.  However I absolutely LOVE this product.  I washed, blow dryed, flat ironed (for a soft press) and then steam set my hair with the Caruso rollers and my hair turned out moisturized, shiny and soft.  I used a little oil on my hair prior to setting.  Also, I rolled the ends with roller wrap.  Again, beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Love it; it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put good smelling oil or something in the water sometimes. But be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and have not had success with curling irons or hot rollers. After reading the reviews on this product I figured it was worth a try!   Right now I only use the jumbo rollers and leave them on the base 15 seconds before rolling my hair. My hair curls and has body throughout the day! I use them just about everyday!! :)</li>
    <li> My first Caruso Steam Hair Setter was a gift 20 years ago, so I have long been a fan.  The new set includes many more large rollers which was a real bonus for me.  It heats quickly (without salt which the old one required)and while it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the old Caruso (ouch), it gives a great set and still takes away any frizzies!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use on human hair wigs and the curls last at least 2days. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love Caruso curlers, have used them for at least 20 years.  However, this particular model does not put out as much steam as the previous one.  Therefore, the curls do not last as long.  I will keep it anyway because it does &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;.  In the future, I will still order Caruso curlers, but I will change model numbers.  My order arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> i have fine uncooperative hair and the curls only last a few hours, but they look good</li>
    <li> My wife has pretty thin hair and hasn&#x27;t had much luck with curlers.  Obviously all work, but the curl never holds for very long.  A friend told her to try this and worked like a champ.  She loved it!  A little time consuming putting in and taking out, but she said it&#x27;s worth the end result.  She liked them so much, I got some for her.  She uses them weekly and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> I gave two stars instead of one because clearly the rollers work for someone (see reviews). Not for me. I have very fine hair. I have tried everything I can think of to get these to work...read instructions many times, read and watch tutorials, practiced. First problem is getting my hair to curl with these rollers. it&#x27;s difficult to know how long to stream the rollers. Steaming time depends on several factors including the amount of steam coming out of the machine, coarseness of the hair, and the diameter of the roller. Sometimes I steam too long and my hair comes out wet even after 45 minutes of waiting and blowing dry. Sometimes my hair literally comes out with zero curl. Moreover, even when I do get curls, they last only a few minutes then go straight. I give up. What a waste of much time and money.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years. So glad Amazon had it. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this does the job pretty well.  I leave the rollers in about 30min. though to get a better curl.</li>
    <li> Purchased fall 2013.  Great curl that holds through the day, everyday.  BEST natural looking curl I&#x27;ve ever received from curlers.  Received compliments daily.  Unit just stopped working this past weekend.  Ordering a new set today.  Crossing my fingers this one holds up longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairsetter for my wedding. I did my hair and makeup so I wanted to use hair rollers instead of curling iron so that I can do my makeup while my hair is setting it&#x27;s curl. This product is good and comes in a variety of sizes. It&#x27;I also like that it&#x27;s dual voltage so you can bring it with you anywhere. This produce really good bouncy curls that holds.</li>
    <li> My hair remains healthy and soft when using these curlers. I like it!</li>
    <li> Junk. The cord is worth more than the curlers.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and wanted to start getting away from a flat iron because of long term damage to my hair.  My is fine, but not real thin, but not thick either!  My hair has some wave to it.  I used these for the first time this morning and I thought it turned out great.  My curls have lasted all day.  Some of the fullness of my hair is gone from this morning, but that is to be expected since I didn&#x27;t spray it or do anything to it to make it stay.  It still looks pretty.  The biggest adjustment for me is to remember when I am putting one curler in my hair, to go ahead and set another curler on so it can be steaming!  It&#x27;s a little time consuming, you have to work into a routine if you do it everyday.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. Burn your fingers, very little curl and does not hold.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quick way to curl my hair.  This is not it.  If I were to heat each roller as prescribed in the pamphlet for my hair, it would take me over an hour to just place the rollers.  Another reviewer suggested placing the next curler on the steam machine as soon as you had one wrapped in your hair and before placing the clip; then place the clip, section your hair for the next roller and repeat.  This works alright but still takes a considerable amount of time.  Then after all the rollers are placed in your hair you have to wait for at least 30 minutes before removing them, followed by using a blow dryer on the cold setting to finish drying your hair and setting the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the rollers gave my hair a lot of bounce and body, but the process took way too long.</li>
    <li> Everyone who answered my questions about this product were right.  It is easy to use and it gives great body.  It is so nice not to get burned while using a curling iron.  I have short hair and thought I would only use the smaller curlers but I use the large ones and the great big ones because of the foam, they conform to the hair.  It gives my hair body without curls since I don&#x27;t want curls.  I find that by the time I put the last roller in, I can start removing the first ones.  All in all, it takes less than 20 minutes to do your entire hair,  once you know what rollers you use and you establish a routine.  Love this product and thanks to everyone who recommended it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These work well.  I use distilled water when I&#x27;m home and I read that using vinegar through  the system occasionally will help with any build up.  We have hard water, so I&#x27;m taking that into consideration in using this product.  Also, I really like not having to put salt packets in my overnight case like the older system I had. Good for fine, brittle hair in dry climates!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and LOVE THEM!  They&#x27;re quick, easy and good for your hair.  Wish you could buy the steamer without all the rollers as they seem to wear out faster...</li>
    <li> My hair stayed curly, maybe too curly even with the jumbo curls, all day &amp; night-still there when I woke up &amp; stayed after being in the rain all the next day! If I had any complaint, it would be that it worked too well............if thats a complaint. I will have to work with how I roll them to get the look I want.</li>
    <li> MY MOM LOVED HER ROLLERS!</li>
    <li> You have to either leave these in over night or have one of those blow dryer machines to stick your head in for an hour.  Otherwise the curls will fall out before you can leave the house.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> They heat up very fast and really like it so far.  The last one I had I didn&#x27;t use distilled water.  I am this time so maybe it will last longer.</li>
    <li> ok... my hair resists curl so this works minimally for me..</li>
    <li> I prefer the old fashion steam rollers.  These you have to heat up one at a time so it takes longer.  One more hand would make it easier.&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever use it.... back to the curling iron :(</li>
    <li> Get product for curling your hair, would totally recommend! Fast, easy and for all hair types and most lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> Really holds the curls longer than any other type of curlers.  It&#x27;s quick and easy too.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair, so you&#x27;d think it would curl easy....nope - initially I get really curly hair and then it mostly falls out within an hour unless I spray it with glue-spray so that my hair is hard ha ha. Plus, curling irons damage my hair and I have tried so many curling sets but they either burn my scalp or they slide out of my hair.  These rollers are awesome, you really only need to put them on the steamer for a few seconds, and it takes almost 10 seconds to part and brush sections of your hair, so while you are getting a section of your hair ready, you can steam the roller.  I got mine done in 10-15 minutes!  I did leave mine on for 10 seconds which meant that my hair needed longer to dry as the steam makes it slightly damp for long-lasting curls.  I also lightly sprayed my dry hair with Got2b Glued Blasting Freeze Spray, 12 Ounce ($7 at my local grocery store - or they sell it here on amazon) before putting the curler in and that helped hold it really well.  My hair stayed bouncy and curled for 2 days so I&#x27;d say it works!  The mentioned hairspray is the best I have found - it is not like other maximum hold hair sprays that keep your hair sticky and hard and painful when you brush!  This stuff is dry in your hair and you only need a light mist.  You can also spray it on thick and your hair will still look light and fluffy, it doesn&#x27;t make it heavy or darker/wet looking.  I only mention it because it worked really well with the curls and it dries fast so you can hold your hair where you want it and it will stay there.  I have also used these curlers without hair spray and they work great - I just like extra volume so I spray it :)  Also, there are WAY too many rollers than what you actually need, and I have a pretty large noggin, but I couldn&#x27;t fit them all on - this works well especially if you wanted to use a ton of the smaller rollers as there would be enough for your whole head.</li>
    <li> It took a while to learn how to use this, but now I really do like it and I assume its better than a curling iron for the condition of your hair.  The instructions say to wait 10-15 minutes to remove rollers but I have waited much longer &amp; still my hair remains damp.  Now, as I remove each roller, I direct the hair dryer (low setting) on it for no more than 10 seconds per curl.  So...it takes a little extra effort but once you get the hang of it, it goes pretty fast.  (The curls DO NOT last for days as per package claim).</li>
    <li> Worked well once they cooled and came out but it takes FOREVER to get them all heated up and in my hair... and I have thin hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased my first set in 1993 and just recently had to replace it.  I have long, very straight hair and have NEVER used a product that creates such long lasting curls.  I love the new model - no adding salt!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I just wih wish they included more small rollers and more short hair clips</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, thin hair, or both then this is probably the best hairsetter for you.  The curls are long lasting and my hair has never seemed dry after use unlike some of the other standard hot rollers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other customers who had problems with the units not working properly were probably not cleaing it properly.  Every so often, you have to fill the unit with equal parts water and vinegar and run it to break down mineral deposits.  It also needs salt to steam properly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one I had that wore out. Gets hair too wet and not as tight of a curl. Don&#x27;t use much. Use my regular hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Hard to roll the ends of my hair in these curlers and they slip easily....doesn&#x27;t hold curl all day.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I used these rollers years ago and we loved them but she had an accident with them and we were hesitant about using them again.  The lid to the water basin just sits on top of the basin and while she was rolling up her hair the basin with the hot boiling water fell onto her leg causing a severe burn.  There should be some way to secure the lid to the basin so that that does not happen to someone else.  I would have given these rollers a give star if the lid was secure to the bottom.</li>
    <li> perfect addition to my set</li>
    <li> What a bummer. I thought these steam rollers would be the end of my flat ironing days (at least for daily styling). Not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am AFRICAN AMERICAN with fine, natural hair. These rollers saturated my hair with moisture causing it to curl up. When I reduced the steaming time then they really didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say the entire unit (with all those doggone rollers) is sitting buried in a basket somewhere in my house. Save your money - and don&#x27;t buy these if you have hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Happy Hair from Caruso! Good for my hair and the set stays for a week! My hair looks twice as thick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural, and I was hoping that I would be about to use these to somewhat straighten my hair without the use of heat. The first time I used it, nothing happened. So I tried on stretched hair, that I did with a flat iron on low heat. Didn&#x27;t put on curl in my hair...no wait, I lie. It did for this small section of hair that I accidently permanently straighten. So now, I&#x27;m just going to use it to condition my hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair! I wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair more than once a year because my hair gets damaged so easily. These steam curlers are amazing!! They absolutely positively will not damage your hair! I&#x27;m still getting the technique down as sometimes my curls come out a bit funky looking. I definitely don&#x27;t get curls that last for days... but it lasts just as long, if not a bit longer than if I used a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love this, so easy to use.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great product. worked perfectly on my hair and for once my curls stayed in all day in red hot heat as well! Brilliant, would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like this for my naturally curls hair. The steam make my hair frizzy. I will give it to someone with straight hair. It might work for them.</li>
    <li> This hairsetter system takes a little bit of practice, but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of securing the foam rollers in their clips correctly, it is so easy to use and so kind to your hair, no more frizzy ends from curling irons as the system just uses hot steam. My hair has never looked so healthy and the unit heats up in less than a minute and is ready to go.   I&#x27;ll never be without this product now.   Also,  Amazon&#x27;s price is the best by far and I researched it carefully before ordering mine.</li>
    <li> I was overall pleased with this product.  There were a good number of rollers in different sizes.  The rollers heated up quickly, but to get longer lasting curls I need to leave them in for 20-30 minutes. The curls will usually last several days.</li>
    <li> The rollers heat up as fast as you can get your next chunk of hair ready, but I found that I really need to leave them in for 30-45 minutes to really keep the curl.  My hair is very thick, so I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t be true for finer hair. Once they are set, the curls stay with no hair spray (I also have a perm) and my husband loves my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this item when it came out over 10 years ago when you had to use the salt in the water. After 10 years of constant use it gave up a nd so I purchased another one because not only did last a long time it gave me great curls. Well, I purchased the same model and this one says you don&#x27;t use the salt which I thought was great, but after only 6 month it stopped working. I called Caurso and they sent me another one for free well this one wasn&#x27;t much better with only about 6 month and not using it every day it also stopped working. I don&#x27;t know if the other models are better than this one, but this model is not like it used to be. I am now looking into purchasing hot rollers as I have given up on the Caurso&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  The clips are not easy to attach and the curlers keep falling out.  I get a tighter curl with my old stand-by curling iron.</li>
    <li> The Caruso system really does work. We used it backstage for our performances, and it was super fast and held well. The only downfall I would say it has: it gives that \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; where the edge of the cover meets the hair. But you can blow-dry that out.</li>
    <li> These are great for fine to medium hair.  Other rollers leave my hair limp after a couple hours, but the steam rollers give my hair lots of volume which lasts for a couple of days.  The best part is that these curl without all the heat.  No more burnt ears or neck!  Easy to use and set up.  The steamer itself requires so much less space than my old hot rollers which took up half my vanity.  Great for travel too - just take the steamer and a few of the rollers.      Tip - I had a dash of perfume to the water for the steamer which makes my house and my hair smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Just bought this 2 weeks ago, the unit works great and consistent with other reviews here. However, it is NOT dual voltage with international plug. The power clearly indicates 120v 60Hz with the polarized US power plug. So beware if you are planning to travel oversea with this unit. Either I have the wrong model (or different version) or  they no longer making dual voltage unit.</li>
    <li> Awesome, the only thing that keeps curls in my hair.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this purchase. It is probably one of the most impressive products I bought recently. I have been using this product everyday since I bought it, around 2 months ago; it still works fine. The pros of this product is that it can curl your hair as the curling iron can. However, it does not cause the damage to your hair as the culing iron always does. For the cons, the curlness of your hair is not last long as it would be when using the curling iron. At the end of the day, my hair starts to lose some extent of curlness. Also, it probably takes longer time to curl your hair with this product compared to the curling iron since you have to wait for at least a few minute to warm up the hair roller.&lt;br /&gt;By trading off between the pros and the cons of this product, I still really like this product. It does not leave the damage on my hair after using it. That is the most impressive feature.</li>
    <li> rollers stay in place with fine hair</li>
    <li> RETURNED. I&#x27;ve been on a crusade to find hot rollers that work for me, and tried these. Very disappointing. Clips on different sizes of rollers look almost the same size, and they are not color coded. It is difficult &amp; time consuming to figure out which clip fits each roller. The &#x27;one at a time&#x27; design is very inconvenient and time-consuming.</li>
    <li> For me, curling irons are unwieldy for all over hair setting and electric curling rods are too heavy causing them to unwind or fall out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Caruso Steam Hairsetter, the first one being lost in a move.  I like the effect I get with this quick hair setting aid.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative would be that sometimes the curlers slide out of my hair.</li>
    <li> love these had some years ago</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before on my very fine, thin, straight, flat hair.  The steamed foam rollers work very well although I have to leave them on for a very long time and make sure my hair is perfectly dry.  Blowing a hair dryer on it helps.  My hair is also very porus and doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or scalp on the rollers. Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the snap on clips do not hold the rollers in place at all.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because my hair is so thin.  Once a roller gets a little loose and hangs a little (which is the moment you move your head or blink), your hair will show the ridge of the clip.  Very frustrating.  I ended up going to Sally Beauty supply and getting these clips that look like little claws (only $6 for 10) and now I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it over again, I probably would have selected a steamer that came with the claw-clips instead of a snap on clip.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking that it would save me time in the morning to curl my hair. It didn&#x27;t. Not only that, it didn&#x27;t come with the Large sizes, it just went directly from medium to Large. Also, I tried to be as consistent in how I was rolling them in my hair but they never look quite right. It depends on how long it&#x27;s been on, how tight you have it on, and the amount of hair you happen to grab to roll on one curler. I&#x27;m still hopeful that I will get the hang of it and I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times already with not so good results. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve got mostly all large sizes or if it&#x27;s user error. In either case, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to my friends. It seems to be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly, more quickly than they had said it would come.  The product arrived in perfect condition, and works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!  I&#x27;ve been using these since they first came out like 20 years ago.  I have super thick, straight, coarse hair and it curls like crazy with these!  If I curl my hair with a curling iron, it takes forever and won&#x27;t last an hour.  These curls last all day!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of steam rollers and I really like them. I purchased the 30 roller set with 5 different size rollers. I like having the different size rollers so I can create different looks. The quality of this product is very good. It heats up very quickly and it&#x27;s relatively small. A few things about this product that I dislike is that there isn&#x27;t an on/off switch so you have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off. I also don&#x27;t like that the top is angled with a little place holder/dent/thingy to put the curler snap/cap/whatever-you-call-it on top of. I find that the cap/snap/thingy frequently falls off. It&#x27;d be more convenient if it were just flat so it would just stay put especially since I usually have at least one hand busy doing my hair. When using this product, you need to make sure you always start with water up to the max line. One time I still had water in it from the day before so I just plugged it in but then it stopped working mid way since I didn&#x27;t re-fill it. Because it was so hot, I wasn&#x27;t able to pop off the top to add more water. I had to bust out my curling iron to finish off the rest of my hair. I plan on taking this steam roller with me on vacation but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to be difficult to travel with. I&#x27;m paranoid my curlers are going to crack in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the few cons that I mentioned, I would recommend purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I still enjoy using these rollers. Very few of the rollers have cracked but still work. Two cons i have realized: 1) the petite and small rollers look extremely similar so you need to make sure you match the correct cap and roller together otherwise they wont fit ( and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why a few of my rollers have cracked), 2) because the curlers have a case that snaps on instead of a clip, I sometimes get a crease in the curl which I&#x27;m not a fan of. I&#x27;m kind of wishing this would break so I could have an excuse to buy a new set of steam rollers that have clips instead.lips instead.</li>
    <li> The rollers are hard to get them to stay in my hair.  I prefer my old steam rollers which had a metal clip to hold them in place.  They may get easier to use after I practice a while but I&#x27;m finding myself using my curling iron again to get curls.</li>
    <li> Curls last all day. The only product that has worked for me.I had one as a teenager and I&#x27;m now in my 30&#x27;s and realize I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of time and money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Dual Voltage so works in most countries. (Using it in Australia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick to start steaming and sets the hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now recommend this curler to everyone who needs one.</li>
    <li> For someone who has very straight, fine, thin hair this system is a blessing. I get body and curl that last for 2 days! It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it does what it says it will do!!</li>
    <li> I can do my hair in under ten minutes from dry with this and it looks great.  For the curl to stay you have to let them dry all the way. Also I use conair roller clips instead of the covers. Much easier an no bumps in my hair.</li>
    <li> seems to work well. good set quick to heat up. My only negative is that there could have been more medium sized rollers in the pack.</li>
    <li> I remember using my stepmother&#x27;s old version of this with the salt about 20 years ago. I feel like this one isn&#x27;t as solidly built and that the curls don&#x27;t hold quite as well, but it&#x27;s still a fantastic product. My hair comes out great, especially using the medium and smaller rollers. The large and jumbo tend to fall by the end of the day,  but it could be I need more practice and/or a different product to apply first. I really like it a lot and have used it 3-5 times per week since I got it about a month ago without any issues. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to be fling something wrong because the curlers keep getting slack and falling off within 5 mins.  And I am not a newbie to rollers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls don&#x27;t last all day either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any advice would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good for dry and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> If you have stick straight Asian hair that will not hold curls this is okay for volume but not for curls.  I really wanted this to work because I have always wanted curly hair even if it meant only for a day, but with my hair the curl with this product only lasts me for about 30 minutes with curl, yes, 30 minutes only with curl.  But, since it left me with volume I give it three stars if you are blessed with thick beautiful hair this will probably work for you :)</li>
    <li> Gorgeous curls!!!!! These curls are effortless and bouncy. I&#x27;m in love!!! I feel like a diva after I finish.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, limp hair, and I wanted to find something that would allow me to set my hair with minimum damage to my hair. I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t deliver:-(. No matter how soon I try to take the roller off the steamer, it always is too damp. I end up having to blow dry the rollers in my hair over and over and over again, but still, when I take the rollers off, my hair still is damp-AND IT FLOPS RIGHT DOWN INTO ITS limp, fine, straight nothingness. The caps that keep the rollers on my head are solid plastic, which prevents the hair from drying adequately. I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
    <li> Using this, it takes only a few minutes to have my hair done. I love it! It&#x27;s an excellent find!</li>
    <li> My hair is just too thin for this product. I&#x27;m sure if you have a thicker head of hair it would work very well.</li>
    <li> Yes it did.it curls nice and fast</li>
    <li> Candyj(queens,ny)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a black woman with natural hair I thought this would be a great product to use when I wanted a roller set my hair. It did not give my hair a straight texture and with the steam my hair reverted Back to my natural texture.long story short I basically wasted my time using this product. I guess if you have a relaxer and use the product it would work but if your natural it really won&#x27;t work. I do think this product is for naturally straight hair but not for black thick natural hair.</li>
    <li> The curls would not hold.</li>
    <li> This is the second Caruso steam hairsetter I have owned.  It heats up fast and does not dry out me hair.  It only takes a few minutes for the curl to set and the curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to just using &#x27;hot rollers&#x27; that heat and I&#x27;m able to quickly set all my hair.  This roller set does take longer since I have to individually steam heat each roller.  Also when I remove the rollers, my hair is slightly &#x27;damp&#x27; from the steam and the curl does not stay as well as was the case with the regular hot rollers.  Having said that, if I were more patient, the rollers do what they advertise they do: curl hair! Also, a great number of rollers come with the set so it is possible to get just the look you want - if you&#x27;re a bit more patient than I am. Also, the steam is not as harsh on my hair as the old hot rollers. If you&#x27;re clever, you would be happier than I am.</li>
    <li> Beautiful curls on African American, relaxed hair after ~20 minutes.  I was so surprised at the outcome.  I plan to use these over and over again!</li>
    <li> Have wasted a lot of money all through my life on rollers...plastic, steel, foam, crunching. Was naturally hesitant to try... these are the best ones so far. For the first time in my life, money well spent on rollers. Superior quality, a lot of good size rollers. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I like very much this setter so I oredered one more...but later one steams very weak. I don&#x27;t know what to do...</li>
    <li> Easy, gentle, and awesome results! Took very little time! Definitely worth the money.Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> I have not had long hair in quite a few years, but recently decided to grow it out once again.  I have a lot of hair, but unfortunately it&#x27;s fine as opposed to thin.  Sometimes when I wear it down, it&#x27;s like a limp mop.  I was evaluating my styling options, and hot rollers came to mind.  In the past, I used the old school plastic ones.  You know the ones... they singe your fingertips when you roll them, and burn your earlobes.  After you have inflicted the pain upon your scalp, the metal clips assist the heavy, plastic roller in barely dangling away from your scalp, leaving half of your hair straight, and half of it curly.  Ok, ok... maybe that&#x27;s just for fine-haired gals like me.  I digress.  The main drawback of traditional heat rollers was the havoc wreaked upon your tresses.  I bleach and highlight my hair regularly, so I don&#x27;t need any help in transforming my hair into straw, thank you very much.  That&#x27;s when I decided to try the steam curlers.  I read product reviews, and Caruso seemed to be a winner.  There was another set, but it had the &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; logo on the roller unit, so I had to pass.  I ordered this set, and it shipped fast.  Upon the advice of other consumers, I went ahead and ordered an extra set of jumbo rollers.  I&#x27;m glad I did since they arrived on the same day as the Caruso set.  I would highly recommend doing this, especially if your hair is long.  Mine is past my shoulders, and mid-way down my back.  I used the distilled water as recommended, and plugged this baby in.  It was very quiet, and I saw the glorious steam right away.  It took a bit to learn the rolling technique, but I mastered it.  As others say, I would recommend rolling the hair up and then steaming the cover before putting it over the roller on your head.  I&#x27;m really glad that I used the jumbo rollers.  My fine hair took the curl a little too well.  If I had used the small or medium rollers, I might have ended up looking like Annie!  I was amazed that the curls took so well, and I didn&#x27;t have to use a drop of hairspray.  I normally have to wear a helmet of Aussie to even hold my curls.  These curls lasted about 2 days, until I washed my hair.  Phenomenal.  My boyfriend even commented on how bouncy and full of body my hair looked.  *blush*  I would definitely recommend this to my friends, and maybe even my enemies....</li>
    <li> I used to curl my hair with curlers where you plugged in the unit to heat the curlers, then I started getting perms and using a curling iron, then I stopped the perms and started using curling rods.  I have very fine, very limp hair, so even getting my hair to wrap around a curler and stay there was a challenge, and usually the curlers or rods would work themselves loose while I waited the necessary time for the curls to set.  And let&#x27;s not forget the scorched fingers!  The worse part was, unless I had a perm, the curls that would look so good when I was done would be gone within 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this set last week and it is wonderful!  My hair wraps around the curlers without a problem, the curlers stay tight and in place, I have absolutely no scorched fingers - and the curls last all day, even when it&#x27;s raining; I&#x27;ve been able to skip curling my hair twice already because the curl lasted overnight.  And the steam seems to leave my hair in better condition.  Wow!  I wish I would have found these years ago.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE it!!!  I have had many hair setters and Caruso is the ONLY hair setter that not only is FAST and EASY to use but my CURLS LAST like never before.  Even in this HOT HUMID weather, my curls last.  I love it, and the man in my life loves the curls.  Thank you Caruso!!!</li>
    <li> This is great and saves so much time in the mornings. It is very compact also. I absolutely love this hairsetter.</li>
    <li> In my experience, it has been the best hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used and has made hair dryers and curling irons defunct for me. I wouldn&#x27;t say the curls last for days, but it does keep your hair from looking oily the day after and leaves behind great volume. I&#x27;m finicky about heat on my hair, and this does absolutely no damage whatsoever. If anything, it makes it a little more hydrated and shiny. You also get a lot of rollers, which is nice because with regular hot rollers, you only get maybe 12.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little fiddly, so here&#x27;s my recipe for success using these if you have long hair or fine hair:&lt;br /&gt;0. Before you use the rollers, spray your hair with hairspray. The steam will mix with the spray and make the curls last longer but not be sticky or too &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34; looking.&lt;br /&gt;1. Switch the setting all the way on to Ionic Steam, not just the Regular Steam option which did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put the roller on until it&#x27;s hot but not too hot to touch.&lt;br /&gt;3. Before you use the roller, *put the roller shield (the red plastic thing) on top of the steam vent* and let it get warm while you wrap your hair in the roller.&lt;br /&gt;4. *Wipe the inside of the roller shield so it&#x27;s not wet but is still very warm* and snap it on your roller. (If you use it when it&#x27;s wet, your hair looks terrible.)</li>
    <li> The set was nice enough but I had to return it because it did not work at all .  I put water in and plugged it up but nothing happened</li>
    <li> The rollers are not the same quality as the ones I had purchased before.  The caps do not stay on and the rollers fall out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to get the ones like what I had before?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Caruso Hairsetter for over 20 years and it never failed to give me long lasting waves or curls.  I bought this second Caruso specifically for travel.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely hard to curl, but with this I was able to curl my hair in under 10 minutes AND the curl stays in!</li>
    <li> This is an old school way to do hair and my God does it work!!!! I love it and would most definitely recommend it to every woman looking for a way to look beautiful and it also conditions your locks!</li>
    <li> I have used Caruso steam rollers for many years.....LOVE them!!!&lt;br /&gt; My old one still works...but this one is faster, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use salt.&lt;br /&gt;Steam rollers are the best...they don&#x27;t damage your hair..the rollers heat up as fast as you can put the the roller on machine...you control how much curl, or just body you want in your hair each time...etc...etc...just try it  (Caruso is the best)&lt;br /&gt;Everything arrived in perfect condition, &amp; very fast.....THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! My curls come out awesome and no frizz. Highly recommended product....</li>
    <li> Much more than expected and a great price with super delivery</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers with such high hopes, and was so dissapointed. I did everything to make them work. I read review after review. Watched Youtube videos. The curls fell out of my hair within hours. I have very thick, long hair (almost to my waist). I tried leaving the rollers on the unit for 10 seconds, then tried 8 seconds, then only 5 seconds. I tried steaming the shield, not steaming the shield. With hair product, without hair product. I would leave the rollers in for 30 minutes and made sure to blow dry on cool setting. Nothing worked. Also the shields stretched out after about five uses and would not hold the roller in place. I had to use a metal hair clip, and the shield, to keep the roller in. If you have very thick hair I would stay away from this styling tool.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected! I just need to get use to putting in the rollers. I haven&#x27;t worn them since I had to wear the foam ones all night. Excited to get familiar with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I just love it, love it, love it, it is so easy to use. At first I couldn&#x27;t believe all the YouTube videos on how simple it was to use and how great the results were. I finally gave in and bought one. I just can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve changed into another person with my amazing curly hair in a short time.</li>
    <li> Ok first I would like to say that I went on YouTube to see this product in action. I was the ionic version of this one, not this actual product. Everyone&#x27;s hair came out so nice. I wanted Victoria Secret bouncing curls...no curling iron trick did it.  I emailed Sarah Victor ( on YouTube) and asked her if she would still recommend the Caruso system..she said. Yes.  I decided to go with the smaller one. Because of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair..  I tried this on my dry. Not so straighten hair...20 minutes. Later. Bouncing curls!!!  I cold shot blowed dried the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok my friend has slippery fine hair..  I tried this on her. And her hair was slightly Damp when I took out the rollers, the curls didn&#x27;t  come out as bouncy.  It was more like waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another girl has thick Smooth Hair. And. She got the Bounce too!  Only, I ran out of the medium and small rollers, those are the trick to the curls. In my experience.  The big curlers smooth the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter, thinking it would be effective, but safe for her long, thick hair.  Even though I have been doing the rolling (since I thought it would work better if the rollers were placed properly, steamed appropriately, not much hair in each, etc.), the curls are pretty disappointing.  Nothing like the photographs of girls with long flowing hair with gentle curls.  These usually fall out pretty quickly, and don&#x27;t ever brush them or they are completely gone.  Would not recommend for thick hair - maybe okay for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, wish it steamed up as well as the original model did, but still works just as good.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing curling system!  Once you get the hang of how to properly set up the system for ease of application...its a pretty fast process and produces soft curls that will last for days in a quick 20 mins!  I roll my hair, then do my makeup, then take it out and set with hairspray.  I have very long hair with layers.  My hair looks super healthy.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. They do not work on my hair. They made it full and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I have purchased a few.  They don&#x27;t last more than a year or so, so I keep purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and thick and never keeps a curl from a curling iron/hot rollers, even though I have curly/wavy hair.  These curlers are great!  They&#x27;re super easy to use and the curls actually stay.  I was a little worried about having to steam the rollers one at a time but honestly it&#x27;s not a problem at all.  I separate all the rollers and clips before I start rolling my hair then once a roller is done steaming I swap it out for the next one, roll my hair strand while the next one is heating up, then repeat!  I would recommend this product to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! It curls my long hair very quickly. By the time I&#x27;m done rolling the last strand of my hair, I&#x27;m ready to take off all of the curlers. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t ruin (fry) my hair like how the curling iron has. The only negative I have is that my curls do not last as long.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new Caruso Steam Hairsetter.  My old Caruso still worked, but was twenty years old and getting tired.  My new Caruso is fast, and does a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> Great, takes 10 min to make the curl, they look great. I love it, it looks very natural. Anyone can do</li>
    <li> The weight of these rollers will not pull themselves out of your hair, because they are so light... LOVE them!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, straight, wussy hair and chose to listen to the favorable reviews for this little unit, thinking that if it didn&#x27;t work, oh well. I got it about a week ago and still can&#x27;t believe how pretty and fluffy my hair looks. I have gotten numerous compliments so I know I&#x27;m not fooling myself. The key to success for me is to shampoo my hair with a body-boosting shampoo (I use Garnier), towel dry it til it&#x27;s almost dry, apply my mousse and finish thoroughly drying my hair. I use the petite and small curlers and I don&#x27;t steam the shields because I don&#x27;t seem to need to, maybe because my hair is only chin-length and layered. The amazing thing is that my curls last all day. When I used hot rollers or a curling iron, my curls were just a distant memory after an hour or two. My hair has never looked so good. Seriously, buy this if you have baby-fine hair or even if you&#x27;re blessed with great, thick hair. I really think it would work on all hair types.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever, I won&#x27;t recommend for anyone to waste their money purchasing it. I was so excited to get it in the mail, when it finally arrived it didn&#x27;t even work.I was so disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have a slight wave to my hair so after I wash and dry my hair I pop a few of the large rollers into my hair, quickly pull them out, use a few squirts of Bed Head Hard Head hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go all day (unless it rains or is foggy of course -- then the waves begin).  Easier (and cheaper) to use than a flat iron and isn&#x27;t bad for your hair.  I&#x27;ve no split ends!!</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso molecular steam hairsetter.  The rollers are ready to go in a second and they are so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used Caruso for years and I Love it but my one complaint is that it has too many large rollers and not enough small ones and the rollers alone are expensive.  I recently lost my rollers and what is in the kit does not give enough for short hair.</li>
    <li> she loved the gift, just what she wanted</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this product when I first heard about it but I took the leap and decided to buy this product. I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for the perfect hot roller set because I wanted to find a way to curl my hair quickly and easily without using a lot of heat like form an iron. I am so impressed with these hot rollers. The curls come out so perfect and beautiful and last all day! I&#x27;ve tried several hot roller sets, and these rollers are the best l&#x27;ve tried. They do not get too hot at all, they do not feel heavy sitting on my head and they do not burn my scalp like traditional hot rollers. Also the curls take a lot faster than traditional hot rollers. I only have to leave these in my hair for maybe 10 minutes and the curls come out beautiful. I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love how this product performs on my hair, but I am disappointed that there were no large size rollers. I was counting on 5 sizes of rollers, but only received 4.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years. The steaming unit quit so I had to have another one. I have plenty of rollers and didn&#x27;t really need another set of rollers, but they come with the unit.</li>
    <li> Works great so far!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, very curly hair that I ususally blow straight. I wanted these to get a looser curl. This did not work at all. My hair just eneded up frizzy.</li>
    <li> I purchased these rollers because I thought, since the heating unit was small, they would not take up a lot of space on my vanity - wrong!  The rollers themselves are bulky and take up space.  The clips are difficult to maneuver and leave dents in your hair.  Moreover, these rollers are very inefficient since you must heat each roller individually and then heat each clip individually.  It is also difficult to identify the size of the roller since the clips are made to fit two sizes of the rollers and are labeled for example Medium/Large.  I have fine, thick shoulder length hair that is slightly curly/wavy and the rollers made my hair too puffy - it looked like a 50&#x27;s &#x27;do.  DO NOT BUY THESE STUPID ROLLERS.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve had one before and was happy to find another. The best hairsetter there is!</li>
    <li> So disappointed with Amazon 2 day ontrac service! I ordered this product and was so excited to be getting it on the specified day as it was a birthday gift. Instead I received a message saying driver couldn&#x27;t deliver because he didn&#x27;t have access to the gated community - interesting since I don&#x27;t live in a secured building. After speaking to an ontrac representative, she promised to call me within 45 minutes to let me know if driver would come back and deliver my package. No call and no package. I called contract again and was cut off due to bad phone reception. Received call from original rep from contract assuring me that driver would return to deliver my package that same night. I received a text message from Amazon this morning at 7am saying that driver delivered package. So I rushed to the door to find NOTHING! NO PACKAGE, NO &#x27;SORRY WE MISSED YOU&#x27; note -Nothing! I called contract and rep once again was told she would contact driver and &#x27;get back to me&#x27; doesn&#x27;t matter now since it was to be given as a birthday gift and birthday has passed. Note to self; STICK WITH ebay next time!</li>
    <li> This is the Greatest Hairsetter ever! It is extremely fast And my hair has never looked so beautiful.  It ialso easy to take with you and if you are like me and always in a hurry, it is perfect because it heats up almost instantly and by the time I have all the rollers in, I wait 5 minutes and take the rollers out, shake my hair and run a brush through it., and off I go...I love this hairsetter...</li>
    <li> This is a great product. !! I am African-American and it really works on my hair, and now I don&#x27;t have to use  curling irons thank you !!! I ordered one for myself and loved it so much brought one for a friend.</li>
    <li> The clips left a bend in my hair that looked awful and was still apparent the next day.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd caruso curler.  They last for years and still using it for my hair styling.</li>
    <li> Due to the sponge core of the roller, those with layering hair will find it difficult to roll hair neatly.</li>
    <li> Sending back.  Didn&#x27;t realize it only holds 1 curler at a time. Very difficult to use - you put on 1 curler on the heater, when it&#x27;s ready you put in your hair but first you need to put the other half of the culer piece on the heater to heat up. each curler has two parts. So as you&#x27;re holding the curler in your hair with one hand, you&#x27;re supposed to be able to take the other piece, put it on the heating device and then put together with the other curler.  Not so easy.  Fair job at curler.  My old curling iron does a better job. Will be returning this as soon as I can fit it all back in the little box.</li>
    <li> After using for just a month and a half, it started taking quite a bit longer that 7 mins. to heat up a roller and sometimes a roller wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all.  It&#x27;s 3 months now and I am definitely going to call about it.  If they make me send it back, they will have to send me another one first because my hair is so straight I can&#x27;t live without steam rollers.</li>
    <li> Got my purchased sooner than expected &amp; I loved it! I can style my hair quickly &amp; it looks really nice afterwards.</li>
    <li> it really didn&#x27;t hold the curls for me</li>
    <li> I loved my first one so much I bought a spare to have when I travel home from work.  All depends on how long you steam the curlers, but my thick hair does great!  I roll, then put my makeup on and 30 minutes later I&#x27;m ready to roll....</li>
    <li> These work great. Went to two weddings in the rain and the curls stayed. Absolutely love these curlers. A must have.</li>
    <li> If you have average or coarse hair I would say this is a great roller set to have around. Sadly, for those of us with fine hair this is just another method that is alright. Not bad and not wonderful. Just alright…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these rollers. My hair is lower waist length, fine and does not hold curls well. I stopped using heat to keep it from getting damaged while I grow it out a few more inches. I’ve had this roller set for around 6 months and have only used it 4 times… The process it very time consuming. When I do use them, the curls hold for most of the day before they start to fall flat (better than the results from curling irons and without the damage &#x3D; 3 stars for a rating). One of the issues I have is frizz. You have to let your hair completely dry and cool down before unrolling. If you misjudge the time (or run out of time) you end up with a frizzy mess… The other issue I have is that the clamp/clips don’t hold the rollers in place for fine slippery hair. The rollers end up falling and wobbling around if I don’t get just the right amount of hair in a  section, roll at the perfect angle, and position the roller right before clipping. Sometimes I have to redo the roller once or twice to get it right. That makes the whole process very tedious. It takes a lot longer than it should. My friend that recommended these to me has long average hair and she can roll it up in about 10 seconds without any problems and it will stay. Then 30-40 min’s later she takes them out and has hair like a Pantene commercial. I’m sure I would get better at this method and it wouldn’t take me as long if I used the set more often, but having a better clip system would make the process 8x easier and less frustrating.</li>
    <li> Curls hold better even in this rainy weather in the south. I ordered it at the right time! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have own a Caruso hot roller set since the mid 1990s.  The older models used table salt to produce the steam.  The new models do not use salt, you just plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go.  I noticed my old model does exactly as it states, curl stays in until I wash it out.  But the new model I purchased that is not true.  It lasts longer than regular hot rollers but not as long as my old model.</li>
    <li> Sorry,  it is  a  very  cumbersome  product. &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it. &lt;br /&gt;Gave it  away to my  hairdresser. &lt;br /&gt;Description and Users-Guide   should  state  that it is  to  STRAIGHTEN  kinky  hair  with  steam. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted  a  CURLER,   not a  starightener.</li>
    <li> This is about the fourth Caruso I have owned in the last 15 years.  I have had a few problems with them but never any as extreme as this one.  The quality is a bit hit and miss on this model.  I have read poor reviews about it at other sites but I decided to ignore them based on my previous experience with the product.  That was a bad decision.  My Caruso stopped working after 1 month of VERY LIMITED use.  It just died.  I have no idea what happened but I&#x27;m not very happy about it.  So far two of the ones I&#x27;ve owned stopped working after about a year, two lasted several years, and this one lasted only 1 month.  That&#x27;s not good.</li>
    <li> I was suspicious when I found this product for $30 at a beauty supply place. That seemed kind of low for 30 heated rollers. I got even more suspicious when I found out that they were \\&quot;just\\&quot; sponge rollers and had to be \\&quot;heated\\&quot; one at a time.    I gave it a try anyway, since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with conventional dry hot rollers. This unit shoots hot steam through each roller, which takes only a few seconds apiece, so you heat them as you go. You can also steam-heat the clips (they call them \\&quot;shields\\&quot;) so the hair on the roller gets heated from both sides. Then you can just let them cool off on their own, or help them along with a hair dryer.    I still had my doubts about this product since the rollers, when steamed, didn&#x27;t seem very hot (compared to regular dry hot rollers). But the sponge rollers grabbed my hair well and the \\&quot;shields\\&quot; kept them from unwinding or falling out, which was already a big plus over other hot rollers.    To my surprise, the curls really did take. In fact, they were curlier than I had intended. It may take some practice to get the results I need, but it looks very promising.    Some of the rollers looked squashed when I took them out, because I had wound the hair around them so tightly (habit). I was afraid I had ruined them. I put them back on the steaming unit, and they returned to normal within seconds!    The curls were still there when I woke up this morning. That was a real shock. I have ultra-straight, ultra-fine hair. I have trouble getting even the best hot rollers to stay in, if I can get my hair to roll around them in the first place. The resulting \\&quot;curls\\&quot; are but a distant memory by the end of the day. But not these curls. I slept on them, and didn&#x27;t even spray them, and they were still there the next day. I was sad that I had to wash them out (I wasn&#x27;t very careful putting them in last night since I was just testing them, so I didn&#x27;t have any sort of presentable hairstyle).    This unit should travel well, since the steaming unit is small, a little bigger than a memo cube. It comes with five different sizes of rollers, and there&#x27;s a mail-order form where you can get more rollers in any size if you need them - they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> Ok, 20 words are required.  How shall we sing the praises of, they were plastic, they were in a box, and when you add water and plug it in it makes steam.  Boy, it is like some one &amp;#34;Designed&amp;#34; them that way.  Cheesy enough for you yet?  have I hit the 20 Word MINIMUM YET?</li>
    <li> I first tried Caruso rollers when it was required to put salt in the unit, and I remember the curls lasting much longer with that set. I have long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, but I had high hopes that Caruso rollers would still give me curls that lasted until I washed my hair again. No such luck. The curls start out absolutely gorgeous, but by lunchtime, my hair has fallen and only the ends remained curled. I&#x27;ve tried using gel, mousse, and spray....no improvement. I&#x27;ve tried using the hairdryer and then using the cool blast......no improvement. I don&#x27;t find that it is inconvenient to heat the rollers individually, and have no problems with the rollers staying in my hair. Wish these worked for my fine hair, but since nothing really gives me volume and lasting curls, I&#x27;m not really too disappointed or surprised.</li>
    <li> I first got one of these back when I was in HS. It&#x27;s the only thing that really curls my hair aside from sleeping all night with things in my head that hurt and ruin my night&#x27;s sleep and rip out my hair. It&#x27;s so easy I would use these every morning. Now that I am older, I use them when I want my hair to look good. Best just to put some shape/body into my hair.     The downside: these things get clogged after a year or two of use and I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix that. They one day just stop producing steam. I just decided to buy my third set, but I&#x27;m still really glad that I did. Sure it may cost you $40 or so every time you buy it, but when used over a couple years, that&#x27;s not even as much as you would spend on hair products in couple months, let alone haircuts, treatments, etc.     For the job it does, it&#x27;s well worth it to keep buying this product after it wears out.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of these curlers over 10 years ago and I&#x27;ve used them continuously.  Recently I decided to get a new set.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  They work quickly and create a very long term curl.  I have very straight hair and it looks good and curly all day until bedtime.    They are also very easy to use.  Just put a little water in the reservoir and plug it in.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received these rollers after reading great reviews. Unfortunately, these rollers didn&#x27;t work at ALL for me. I have long, fine shafted hair. It did nothing for me. In fact, because of the steam, my hair looked worse after using them than before. At least before attempting, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy. So, I would recommend you look elsewhere if you have fine shafted hair.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Caruso Steam Hairsetter about 15or 16 years ago.  The foam on the curlers was in bad shape.  I was excited to find the updated one on Amazon.con.  Obviously, I like it.  The new stam system is much better than the one on my original set.  There is no hot water to deal with when cleaning the system after use.</li>
    <li> My old \\&quot;purple\\&quot; system died after 15 years of use.  I was excited to try out the \\&quot;new, no salt\\&quot; system.  I ordered it in January, and the system has already quit working.  I&#x27;m having to find alternative ways to curl my hair and am not happy.  I&#x27;m also not willing to fork out another $35 on something that may/may not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give the caruso five stars...if my unit didn&#x27;t die every six months!  I&#x27;ve tried cleaning the unit as someone had suggested, but it&#x27;s definitely dead.  When I plugged the unit in for the last time, I heard a \\&quot;popping\\&quot; sound and it would no longer steam.  I used it almost every day.    This is my fourth unit and I am looking into other brands.  I have zero luck with regular electric rollers - my hair is super fine and long, and nothing else works!  I am completely sold on steam rollers, but need something that will last!    At the very least I have four units worth of rollers to use with my next purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair was so fried that I ended up taking off 12 inches to get rid of the damage and bad layers that resulted. My shorter hair needed something to style it, and a former hair stylist suggested steam rollers. I love these. They aren&#x27;t perfect compared to hot rollers, and they aren&#x27;t as fast as a curling iron, but my hair feels so soft afterwards and the curl is nice. Hint: The hair is slightly moist from the steam after taking the curlers out. After they&#x27;re out, I spray hairspray lightly then wait a few minutes for my hair to dry (usually putting on makeup). Once it&#x27;s dry, I finger-comb it, and the curls last the whole day (and the next if I don&#x27;t wash it). If I comb it out immediately after taking the rollers out, the curl is lost.</li>
    <li> I have had this product over a month now, and.  it is great when on the run and just in general. I am into healthy hair, direct heat constantly applied to your hair daily can damage it. This product eliminates that. It works differently on everyones&#x27;s hair, but it works better on mine when I have previously flat ironed it. If you leave the roller on the steamer longer than 5 seconds you probably won&#x27;t get the desired result because it will make your hair damp and then it will have to dry. You can do all sorts of curls with this set and it literally only takes seconds to warm up. Leave them on the steamer for only 3-7 seconds at a time. The longer the rollers are in your hair, the tighter the curl. I&#x27;ve read many reviews and looke at videos on how to use these. They are great, but you have to know your hair and find how this works best for you. Trial and error is what made it a success for me.</li>
    <li> I am a long time hot curler, but lately, my hair was just falling flat. Also, I have to wash my hair every day for it to be stylable. But these curlers have changed my life! 1. It comes with so many curlers! I don&#x27;t have to worry about parceling out my thick tresses for a limited number of curlers. 2. Its so quick! I used to have to let my hot rollers heat up for 20+ mins. 3. They work great with &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair. I can regularly 2 days of wear out of one wash by using these each morning. They take a few times to get used to, but I just watched some Youtube videos and caught on pretty quick. I definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> I like it because it heats up quickly and uses steam, but my daughter&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t curl! If your hair won&#x27;t hold curl, even this probably won&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy way to curl your hair without fuss.  Lots of rollers for variety of curls.  Rollers are bulky, but nice bag to hold them for storage.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NOT RECOMMENT THIS PRODUCT AT ALL, the rollers do not stay in your hair, you cannot move and they fall out, and i hate the steam it wets my hair, again, i made a big mistake i wish that i took the ordinary rollers the ones that heat up with no steam and have clips it&#x27;s tighter and more secure and will not roll out of your hair, aai, I made a bad choice, I&#x27;M SO UNHAPPY, and you pay more for shipment, costs,</li>
    <li> I love how soft my hair feels after a set. I get 3 days out of my sets. By the 4th day, I need to wear it as an up do with a scarf or clips, but that works for me. My hair type is a 3A, if that helps.</li>
    <li> I was given 12 jumbo, 12 medium, 6 petite curlers instead of 6 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium, 6 small, 6 petite.  They do work great though!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!  Only thing that really holds curl in my hair!!  I would highly recommend them to anyone needing to curl their hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had an earlier version  hairsetter that I loved. This setter is great! It works quickly. My hair feels so healthy and is very shiny.  Cool video on YouTube too on how to use it but it is simple. Recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Have used it only one time so far,  but It performed as promised.  Great curl,  and made my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.  IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT, HOWEVER, THEY AT ONE TIME MADE BETTER ROLLERS.  THE FOAM WAS STIFFER AND LASTED A LOT LONGER. THE ONES I JUST RECEIVED ARE TOO SOFT AND WILL FALL APART IN NO TIME.  WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE JUMBO OR LARGE SIZE WILL END UP BEING MEDIUM TO SMALL IN SIZE BECAUSE THEY DON&#x27;T HOLD UP TO THEIR TRUE SIZE WITH USE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 types of hot rollers this past month (Conair, Remington, BaByliss) before trying Caruso. Each version had positive qualities but they either left visible creases in my hair or didn&#x27;t hold curls for the day. I was starting to think I would just stick to my curling wand and be done with trying to make rollers work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Caruso rollers had been recommended to me, I initially wasn&#x27;t into the idea of heating the rollers with steam and having to do it one at a time. But since I didn&#x27;t like the previous hot rollers I tried, these were my last attempt before giving up. Heating up the Caruso rollers one at a time isn&#x27;t an issue, as it takes 10 seconds on the steamer and then the roller is ready to be put in your hair. The trick to these seems to be making sure the curlers are left in long enough for the hair to completely dry, because the steam has dampened it slightly. After taking the rollers out and finger combing out the hair, it does give very full, voluminous waves and I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test for me will be if these curls can last all day, as previous rollers did not. I&#x27;ll update this review at that time.</li>
    <li> These rollers and this system is a wonderful alternative to hot rollers or curling iron. I love the results I get with the steam.&lt;br /&gt;However, it wasn&#x27;t until a few weeks after using them that I noticed I didn&#x27;t have the same number of rollers as I did the clips.&lt;br /&gt;My own fault for not getting it corrected.&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to check this out when the product arrives.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these years ago and loved it.  It is THE best way to put curl in your hair.  The steam from the rollers actually adds moisture as it curls, leaving your hair luxuriously soft, manageable and full of curls and/or waves that have staying power. It&#x27;s a hair styling system that is GOOD for your hair - NO damage.  My hair is very long - several inches past my shoulders and it comes out fabulous.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy and try - you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> When I need to have my curls last I use my Caruso.  My old set lasted about 7 years so I&#x27;m looking forward to a lot of years with this one.as well</li>
    <li> This item works well on all types of hair and does exactly what it is advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;You should try it</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She uses it every day and she looks as beautiful as the day I met her. The curls look awesome and last a long time</li>
    <li> The rollers that I received were a return from somebody else. The bags were open and there are pieces missing. I thought I was getting a new set. Therefore I would like to return them at no cost to me. Thank you. Please advise</li>
    <li> Love it, love it!  I have thin hair and was not able to use hot rollers or curling irons.  They made my hair dry because of the heat.  These steam rollers curl my hair AND give it volume.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the result.  You may think it takes too long to steam one roller at a time, but, in fact, it moves quite quickly.  Hot rollers take a while to heat up, while this steams in less than a minute.  The negative thing I would say about it is it would be nice if the different size rollers had a coloring system so I could tell which clips went with which rollers.  But I am putting them in different bags so I can tell at a glance.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble getting their hair to curl and needs the volume.</li>
    <li> Good product, but no better than comparably priced hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Carrying bag&lt;br /&gt;More rollers than a typical hot roller set - which is good for people with long hair&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Covers/shields snap securely over rollers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair will not stay curled for \\&quot;days\\&quot; as product claims...maybe it does for some people, but my hair starts losing its curl within the first hour, and is completely gone before the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;Putting the shield to steam is cumbersome when you only have 1 free hand to take off the steamed roller and put the shield in its place - all in one smooth motion. If you don&#x27;t position the shield exactly right on the ledges, it falls off, disrupting your rhythm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to elaborate: I have thick straight hair and I live in a humid climate (south Texas), so I know that it is very difficult to keep any type of curl in my hair. I have I given up on curling irons, and so I must use some type of roller that I can keep on my head for at least 15 min in order to achieve a curl that will last longer than 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this product, I was using a hot roller set that was felt flocked with a heated inner core and heated clips. It was the best set I had found - as I definitly needed something with heated clips to work on the amount of hair I was putting on each roller. But I was still disappointed in not being able to keep my hair curled all day. So based on the reviews I read, I bought this set, hoping it would perform better - but I&#x27;ve been left with mixed feelings. I like that it comes with more curlers than the average 20 you get with a hot roller set. Considering how much hair I have, it is difficult to section it just right in order to get all of it on 20 rollers. With this set, I always have left over rollers. I also like that it comes with a carrying bag. I can actually see myself taking this set on vacation, whereas my hot roller case is big and bulky. I also like the bag because I usually leave the house with the rollers still in my hair, so it gives me a place to put them when I take them out at my destination.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like that I have to steam the shields. If I do not steam them, i basically will not have any curl at all. But when you are using 1 hand to hold the section of hair you are going to roll, that only leaves you with one free hand to swap out the shield for the roller. Often times, I will miss one of the ledges that the shield is supposed to sit on, and it messes up my rhythm. I either have to put the roller down in order to put the shield back in place, all the while the roller is losing heat - or roll up my hair, then put the shield in place and wait, which makes the process take longer. All in all, I think that is my biggest complaint. It probably takes me an extra 5 min to use this set as opposed to a traditional hot roller set, which sometimes discourages me from using it since I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this hairsetter. It is well made and heats up quickly but is not what I&#x27;m looking for in a hairsetter. I have longer length, very fine hair and the clips will not hold the roller in place. I purchased medium sized claw clips at the local discount store and they worked much better at holding the rollers in place. However, the foam rollers compress when the hair is rolled onto the rollers resulting in a much tighter curl than I want (I am using the largest rollers). I wanted a steam setter because the style holds better with steam but this hairsetter just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised but takes me too much time and effort than I&#x27;m willing to put in for a hairdo.  :) I&#x27;m definitely on the low maintenance side of things though.  Gave me soft beautiful touchable curls and worked on my straight, thick (heavy), asian black hair.  My curls lasted better than other curling irons I&#x27;ve used and I loved that I didn&#x27;t have to put any product in my hair or damage it with heat.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised, i need more practice to know if i really like them.</li>
    <li> I have a perm and very fine hair. This product works great for me. Simple. Effective. Easy product to use.</li>
    <li> Only used them once but I think I will like them.</li>
    <li> For me personally it was awkward to use. Steaming one roller at a time is annoying.  The product is made well but I did not understand how it had to be used</li>
    <li> I have thin baby hair and the steam system works wonders for my hair.  Rollers don&#x27;t just hang and pull on the roots, instead it is held on by a clamp which i truly appreciate.  Hair comes out shiny and full of body.  I love my Caruso Steam Hairsetter...I don&#x27;t really use the small rollers, but I will need to order 6-12 more of the Jumbo sized rollers.</li>
    <li> These are  my first heatrollers so i&#x27;m not sure what to expect.  The rollers fall out of my hair. My hair is not thin and is short to medium length.  If they would stay put I might get a good set.  I don&#x27;t like having to put one roller at a time on the steamer - inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Got this as replacement for Remington hot rollers and have been using it for about 10 days. With hot rollers my very fine hair would be curled, fluffed and I could be out the door in 15-20 minutes. With the steam rollers, using them on completely dry hair and steaming them for only 3-4 seconds, hair is damp when rollers come out, even after half and hour. I unroll and leave hair &#x27;finger curled&#x27; to dry, but it is still a lightly frizzy look in the end. Curls lasts well, but I much prefer the speed and smoother results of the Remington, even though it is very bulky.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hairsetter, easy to use, and my hair will hold it&#x27;s curl all day long. Also my hair seem to shine more after I use these curlers.</li>
    <li> I got this because of a review I saw on YouTube, and let&#x27;s say these rollers lived up to it! I have chemically treated blond thick hair and my hair is so soft and feminine looking after I style it. I leave them in for 10 minutes and every time I am amazed at how good my hair looks! The curls hold for the whole day and I am very happy with the purchase. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am SO happy I purchased these for my wife. She says there is a learning curve when switching from traditional hot curlers. But after a few online videos, she was up and running. Her tips are that they are best with COMPLETLY dry hair, and to keep them in until they are fully cooled off (more so that the hair has cooled), it will hold curl better this way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have access to quality water, this product will last longer over using hard tap water. Some tap water has tons of calcium that will collect on the heating element inside and eventually make it not work as well, or at all. If needed, you can run vinegar through it (or soak for hours) a few times to break down the minerals.</li>
    <li> So this morning I tried out my new Caruso steam rollers. I pinned the top of my hair, as it is shorter and did the long section first. I used to jumbo rollers and large rollers on the bottom and the medium rollers on the top layer. I have fine hair but it is pretty thick. I left each roller on the steam for about 6 seconds. I left the rollers in while I went to make a sandwich (about 15 minutes because I was cooking bacon too), then I went back and took them out. My hair came out a bit wavy- that&#x27;s all. It looks nice but I expected that it would have a lot more curl to it. I will try again, this time, leaving the roller on the steam a bit longer and update soon.</li>
    <li> Nice and hot rollers- I&#x27;ve had it for a few years and its still going strong. Nice bug curls or small.</li>
    <li> These curlers give curl and body to my fine limp hair.  I can do my hair in less than ten minutes.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang on how to place the curlers for the effect I want but I love these. My hair looks bouncy, wavy and healthy. Much better than heat styling. Especially on my bleached hair. Hello good hair days!</li>
    <li> I got these for my mom for mothers day as a replacement to her original ones she&#x27;s had for way to many years. She uses them every day and loves them!</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting my hair to curl with anything but a hot metal iron. I was really hopeful for these because so many people seemed to be very pleased with them.  I got them for myself for Christmas.  But whatever magic they hold for others just didn&#x27;t pan out with my hair. The curl looked promising for about 30 minutes... then started to go limp: just the same as regular hot rollers.  Just to make sure I was giving these a fair shake, I tried again.  Same results.  Ended up curling my hair with my metal curling iron after the two failed attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Try them... so many people are excited about them, maybe they really will work for your hair. Amazon has an easy to use return system.  I just returned mine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews. I am very, very good with styling my hair. Maybe if you have a very LONG TIME to let these dry, they will work. I even went on the website to see if I was doing something wrong. You might as well set your hair with water and let dry for 2 hours or blow the curlers with your hair dryer to speed up the drying process.</li>
    <li> It works but it leaves your hair wet and some time frizzy. I would not buy it again but it does work</li>
    <li> have used this in the past, have to make sure you get the covers hot if you want to have lasting curls, old unit worked better with dash of salt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since back in high school.  Ended up going tye straight hair way for many years but I&#x27;m back and these are the best! I have very straight hair and these rollers curl my hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!</li>
    <li> Creates soft curls which last not more than an hour.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective hot roller set. Extremely easy to use compared to other hot rollers and holds a curl like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian-American with lots and lots of thick, coarse hair. It&#x27;s slightly wavy, so my hair has a little texture and can hold a curl for slightly longer than other Asian hair. Nonetheless, it still requires lots of heat and potential damage to curl my hair. I&#x27;ve always wanted to use hot rollers to style my hair, but I was put off by the tutorials on Youtube by non-Asian women because they have SO MUCH LESS hair than me. I have to use 2-3x as many rollers as they do and I can&#x27;t trust that they have a similarly resistant hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Caruso steam setting works like a charm. It doesn&#x27;t set with heat so much as steam. Just be sure not to over steam the roller. Also, the cups that hold the curl? Dude, they hold the roller REALLY WELL. I ALWAYS have trouble with the rollers falling out and putting too much hair in any individual roller and having the hair not curl properly. With this set? Wow. No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My curls look fab every time, I&#x27;m African American so I had to use a moisturizer on my hair if not when I took the rollers out my hair would look a little ratty.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and the Caruso is perfect to make my hair fuller and also to retain the curl all day.  I&#x27;m 70, so I&#x27;ve had years of trying to find the best type of product.  But I do wish thy would give you a choice of curler sizes, as there are many in the kit I will never use.</li>
    <li> Have only used them twice, once for practice, not really taking care of how I did it, and today, I&#x27;m pregnant and on bed rest so I have a LOT of time on my hands, lol.  My hair is somewhat coarse and has a natural curl, or maybe wave is the right word.  This rollers set really, REALLY quick, and they are a breeze to get them on,if you don&#x27;t use any hair spray (I don&#x27;t) you can brush out the curls in a couple of days and your hair stays shiny and smooth, you can also use it on dirty hair, which I think it helps with my friz.  I also got them super fast on the mail.  So far the only problem I have with them is that is very hard for me to get the clip on, I bet I only need to practice more.</li>
    <li> I got these and tried using them with mousse and it was a little pouffier than I wanted, so I used them using nothing on my hair, freshly washed and conditioned. It was great.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great.  I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and satisfied w/ the outcome.  I will use them on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using these for years and I thought she was very old fashioned until I bought my own.  I love that they do not fry your hair like most curling irons and straighteners.  The curl lasts all day and is much gentler on my hair.  I will probably buy another set of the curlers because I run out of the medium size.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These did absolutely nothing for my hair, no curl, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;With all the great reviews, I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective hairsetter or what happened, but mine when right back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to the old fashioned electric rollers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Caruso for many years as my hair always split using electric rollers. I&#x27;ve had short hair and long hair and it works beautifully for all lengths. My one disappointment is that the  one I have just purchased had 12 of the Jumbo rollers and none of the size medium which I use most.. The jumbo size is big and only suitable for very long hair..</li>
    <li> These curlers ara a joke!  The original curlers (10 years ago) were great.  These ones have cheap foam and all six of the petite rollers had no covers to go over them so they are completely useless.  I am VERY disapointed.</li>
    <li> The roller set is REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD. Makes my hair curly or full of volume. So quick and easy to use BUTTTT the only flaw i found which is becoming a problem is the roller caps ( the plastic to hold the roller on hair) somehow is loosening up or the rollar foam is shrinking because many rollers dont fit or held tight but fall.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is simply, hands down, the very best and healthiest way to curl your hair. I have heard numerous people say that they liked the salt version better, so , here is a way to achieve that same look. After hair is clean and completely dry, spritz with a beach (salt spray) to each section and let dry (just a few seconds) then wrap that section. BOOM! I love Davines&#x27; but any quality beach spray will work. For all you healthy hair nuts (myself included) try the Wen cleansing conditioner before using this great product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you are gonna steam the shield, be sure to zap curls with blow dryer due to the fact that the steam in the shield can make hair wet and you won&#x27;t get results. I learned this the hard way. ugh. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this today. It&#x27;s cheaper on here than I have found anywhere else. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to sell it locally as I don&#x27;t like it.  My hair won&#x27;t hold the curl no matter how I do it.  3 to 5 seconds, longer, blow dry it too, sit under the dryer...nope not for me.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to the good old fashioned curling iron.  At least then my curls will stay in.  :)</li>
    <li> I have purchased about 10 of these during the past 20 or so years, some for myself, some for gifts. They are wonderful! They curl or smooth the hair, depending on the size of the roller that is used. They also add great bounce and shine. My daughters and I love them!</li>
    <li> I have VERY hard to curl hair. I can curl it with regular hot rollers or a curling iron and within an hour the curls have all just about fallen out...even AFTER I spray it! With the Caruso system that uses STEAM, my hair is STILL curly the next day. It isn&#x27;t frizzy, I don&#x27;t have to use any product on it before I roll it so it is SOFT too! I absolutely LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by a relative who has been using hers for years. I&#x27;ve used about 6 times, and am getting better results now than at first. Just takes a bit of practice. I use it as a backup to my usual curling iron routine. Quick and fairly easy.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok....if you have long hair.  If your hair is not long...don&#x27;t buy...won&#x27;t hold short on the rollers.</li>
    <li> Love it. No damage to hair. Actually makes hair softer &amp; healthier looking &amp; feeling.  Nice soft bouncy curls. Love this. Had one vack in the late 90&#x27;s. Just be sure to remove base from water &amp; let dry out after each use to keep it in tip top.</li>
    <li> Clips were very hard to get on and off the rollers, curls did not stay in and it took to long to heat the rollers and clips&lt;br /&gt;one at a time.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers- this is a replacement- I have hard water so I think that is why my older ones quit working- I am using distilled water with this set as recommended  by the manuf.  I love these because they are quick to use- the curl last and even after sleeping .  I also like that they do not leave any marks where you clip them.  Fast to use- you have the next one heating up while you are curling . I have medium length hair and I use between 4-8 per set depending on how much curl I want- leave them in longer for a tighter set, leave them in just a bit for just more body- a lot options.  They are the best and they do not damage hair because you are only using steam.</li>
    <li> my hair is much too thin and fine for these to work. to be fair, I didn&#x27;t try but a couple times to make them work.</li>
    <li> Not really sure about this yet. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I was in high school when these first came out in the 90&#x27;s, the salt ionizer version.  LOVED THEM THEN.  This version doesn&#x27;t use the salt and is a bit more portable (smaller) and the variation of rollers has greatly improved. Also, it steams faster!  However, the overall concept and ease of use is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore these rollers, short or long hair, course or fine...they will give you plenty of lasting volume withOUT any heat damage.  Best of all, they can stand the test of many year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great hair investment, I must say!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my original Caruso Hairsetter I purchased in the early 90&#x27;s. The system itself STILL works, but the rollers were shot to crap. For the price of replacement rollers, it was CHEAPER to replace the whole thing! I gave my old system to my daughter and warned her on the cost of the rollers for it, Hey, you never know, she might want to at some point use it. The only thing I was not happy about was they gave me mostly LARGE rollers. My hair is very short and I have to set the rollers in &amp;#34;batches&amp;#34;. You know, roll area, let them set, take it down, do another section, etc...bit of a pain. I would also have liked some of those special plastic clips that go under the cover to keep hair in place on the roller. My old system had them, the new one didn&#x27;t. What I liked the best about it, NO SALT! Old system used salt in the water, the new one doesn&#x27;t. The rollers and system is great! I also have ceramic rollers and avoid them as they burn and I am SURE they dry my hair out, the curl doesn&#x27;t hold up as well either. The steam is just so good for the hair and seems to make the curls &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;. I recomend this system to anyone looking for a good reliable hairsetter system!</li>
    <li> When I was a younger woman, I had a caruso steam curler set and I used it until it died, It lasted for many years and gave me beautiful curls. I tried to replace it with curling irons, hot curlers,and nothing worked. When I found this online, I was so happy. And using it at home, my curls are back...and they stay here a long time. What a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My hair will not hold a curl for anything! Whether a hairdresser does the curls or myself! HOWEVER, the steam curls last me all night and when I wake up the next morning they are still there! Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and wanted to try it out right away.  I have fine, thin hair and had already had styled my hair that morning with mousse and hair spray, so I brushed out my hair. I only left the curlers in for about 3 minutes so I was pleasantly surprised to see my hair curled and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test came this morning when I had no product in my hair (I washed it out the night before). I rolled my dry hair and left the rollers in while I did my makeup.  When I removed the curlers I had great curls and my hair was soft and bouncy. I also needed less hairspray on my hair which allows more movement. I still need to work out how long to leave them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few suggestions when you use this for the first time.  Un-clip all of the rollers you plan on using ahead of time ( I put the rollers in rows according to size and did the same with the clips. It saves me time and frustration from grabbing the wrong size or clip).  Roll your hair on a day when you aren&#x27;t planning on going anywhere (like work or school).  This will allow you the time to re-do your hair if the curl is too loose or too tight.  You will also need the time to experiment with different roller sizes and the length of time to leave them in. Before thinking about buying more rollers, experiment with all of the sizes.  You might find a combination that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing. The 2 jumbo rollers and 4 large roller both say \\&quot;large jumbo\\&quot;.  Look at the size of the sponge and you will see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the one reviewer who said the rollers didn&#x27;t stay on.  Mine were fine.  It is possible they were using the wrong size for the ammount of hair, or barely rolled the hair onto the curler and the clip had nothing to hold.  Again, take the time to experiment.</li>
    <li> I have long long straight hair which is medium texture and this works great. Make sure to leave rollers in long enough to make sure they are completely dry before taking out. The smaller rollers aren&#x27;t good for super long hair but use them in my young daughters and works well in her hair.</li>
    <li> My hair goes flat in damp weather.  My daughter&#x27;s hair does not.  These steam curlers did not work for my hair, but my daughter gets a fabulous result with them.  Love that they use no damaging heat, and that they are so quick to heat and use.</li>
    <li> On my 4th unit &amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it.  20 years of using this product &amp; still going strong!  ♥ my Caruso!</li>
    <li> I had been shopping for an ionic setter - something well above $100 - but read the reviews and am so glad I chose the Caruso!.  I have medium length fine hair, my hair tends to love limpness; This system is easy to do; and I followed the advice to be sure the steam is set and dried before removing  the curlers. If I&#x27;m short on time, I go ahead and take out the curlers, but blow dry a wee bit to make sure all dampness is gone before running a brush through.  Love these!</li>
    <li> I purchased the original Caruso Molecular unit sometime before 2000. It has worked wonderfully without a problem all this time. The curls stay even through humid weather. I was pleased to discover that the product is still being manufactured, it speaks volumes about it&#x27;s performance. I am buying the new unit to keep at home and to replace the rollers because after over 12 years they are starting to tear a bit. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have colored gray hair - it&#x27;s thin and fine and has no body.  I&#x27;m trying to grow it to a same length - chin length bob and I&#x27;m about 1 inch short of this.  So - just giving you an idea of my hair type/style.  I think I really like these rollers.  I&#x27;ve only been using them a week and you do have to get the hang of them.  Such as figuring out how to roll your hair around the roller to keep it from kinking and showing the marks of the caps.  Also - you have to get the sizes just right to get the desired effect.  So I&#x27;m working on that.  It is a little hard getting the caps on the rollers.  Haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of that yet.  But they are very quick to use and heat up in just a few seconds.  So this is a very fast process.  I gave up trying to use a blow drier with a around brush.  My hair got to the length that would not hold any body or style.  So I tried these.  A worthwhile purchase I believe.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using these rollers for years. This is the third set I have bought. I have found that my hair holds the curls 100% better with these. As a bonus, there is nothing metal to burn your head (ie the metal clips that come with the other type and get hot).</li>
    <li> I love these. I have been growing out my hair from a very short style for about a year now. It is currently cut in a short, angled wedge that comes to my chin. I was getting so bored with wearing it it straight everyday and wanted to do something different. It took a little practice rolling and learning how to make sure all the ends are tucked in and not crimped because may hair is still fairly short. The rollers create soft curls without the crimp marks sometimes caused by curling irons.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely SO HAPPY with this system. I read about them on Amazon, but bought them from Sally&#x27;s because I was so sure they wouldn&#x27;t work (for my very straight, curl-resistant, thick, fine, flat hair) and I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of mailing them back. Surprise! My hair was super curly &amp; the curl lasted three days with just sn EZ re-curl of the hair in front of my ears from laying on it on the third day. Plus, my fingers don&#x27;t get burned like they did with my old curlers. I am SOO happy with these curlers so far (I&#x27;ve had them for about a month), and I&#x27;ll soon be buying another set for our lake cabin. My old sets (I had to buy two because just one didn&#x27;t have enough curlers) are on their way to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES these!  WE got them for her for Christmas and she uses them daily, and it helps to manage the hair</li>
    <li> This is probably my 13th or 14th set of Caruso Steam Rollers and I just love them-I can go out all day long and come home, set my hair for 5 r 10 min and i am ready to go again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using heated rollers, and I thought I&#x27;d try this steam set. I was excited after reading the reviews from other people, but after trying it once, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. This takes longer to use than my Conair Xtreme set, and the resulting curls aren&#x27;t nearly as bouncy and don&#x27;t last as long. I&#x27;ll try it again later, but I&#x27;m fairly disappointed with the results so far.</li>
    <li> When using my first set I lived in NY and my hair was always long. The caruso curls were wonderful without hair breakage /intence heat or sitting under an old fashioned dryer. In remembering how much I loved them I bought another set. I live in Florida now and the reason I&#x27;m not getting the same results I&#x27;m sure is that the humidity down here is off the wall. On low humidity days or just plain normal weather you can&#x27;t beat the curl. I like the ability to create the type or kind of cure I&#x27;m in the mood for.On humid days I leave the curler on steam for a shorter time and use large hair clips instead of the carouso jacket.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with  natural hair (kinda kinky coily not soft loose curls by any means). I wear my hair straight, blown out and flat ironed. I attempted to use these rollers (after reading reviews stating it would not revert my hair, so yes I did read the reviews first) and the results were not good for me. These rollers gave me a few curls but all they really did was put too much moisture in my hair and leave me with a fluffy mess. I gave these three stars because they were packaged well, in perfect working order, and would probably work very well on someone else&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heated very quickly, you do have to get a rhythm going to get the shields on the rollers properly. The steam is not hot to the touch on the roller itself but you can feel the heat. The machine heats really quickly so you are ready to go almost as soon as you plug the machine in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated earlier this is probably a great product for another woman but it reverted my hair and I had to send it back. I think I should go for a traditional hot roller system.</li>
    <li> The wave lasted a couple days but the curls fell within a few hours, I&#x27;m going to keep trying smaller rollers. i have a lot of thin hair that is long (upper mid back length hair), it&#x27;s layered....the jumbo rollers are almost worthless. I get a decent curl out of the large, medium gets too tight of a curl just out of the roller but it falls eventually. Im going to experiment more because I am looking for a less damaging ways to get long lasting curls.</li>
    <li> I am very perplexed as to how certain items can achieve tons of 5 star reviews and also tons of 1 stars. I guess, in this case, it really does all depend on the individuals hair. (and having a working unit lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this Caruso system has not worked at all. Not one bit. I&#x27;m Caucasian with shoulder length, very fine, very delicate and thin (a result of chronic illness) hair. Now, usually, my hair takes a curl from irons or other curling tools in seconds, like lightening! I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with curls falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve been on a &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t wanna use heat anymore!!&amp;#34; escapade (imagine Seinfeld and his cowboy boot or pirate sagas). I&#x27;ve been pin curling, sock curling, etc etc. I found this contraption and after reading all the reviews about bodyful curls that last and last and extra moisture and having longer hair as a result yaddi yadda, I knew I just HAD to have this! So I exclaimed to my supportive husband &amp;#34;I&#x27;m gonna order this hair thingy right here!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I waited and waited for a week until it arrived and I was SO excited! I am hugely self conscious of my super thin hair, as I&#x27;m only 30 and used to be somewhat attractive. I feel like a balding rat most of the time nowadays. Anyway, I opened my Amazon package and immediately got to work. First attempt &#x3D; failure. Second attempt &#x3D; Failure. Third, Fourth, Fifth attempts &#x3D; failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty good at rolling my hair, so I don&#x27;t not believe that&#x27;s an issue. I don&#x27;t use product on my hair beforehand, so it&#x27;s not that. I only use the Caruso on completely dry, clean hair. Like countless others, I have experimented with shorter steam times, longer steam times, in between steam times, and the same with curler-on-head times. When I unroll these puppies, my hair looks like crap! Seriously, like crap. It looks thinner than when I use velcro rollers (which rip my hair, wahhhh), and it gets all lank and sad looking, like a dying flower that some guy you don&#x27;t like gave you. Then the ends begin to turn in weird directions and nothing looks fluid and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my hair may look a teensy weensy bit shinier at the end, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the awkward shapes and scraggly appearance it takes on after using these curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sad day for all of us.don&#x27;t like gave you. Then the ends begin to turn in weird directions and nothing looks fluid and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my hair may look a teensy weensy bit shinier at the end, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the awkward shapes and scraggly appearance it takes on after using these curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sad day for all of us.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well. I like the ability to curl my hair and have it stay that way for a few days without the added expense of a perm. Definitely work the money and the time.</li>
    <li> After reading so many possitive reviews I bought these curlers and was greatly anticipating using them. Unfortunately, after several uses I am not very impressed. I have naturally curly hair that has always held curl very well when I set it. Although I do like that the Caruso curlers use steam and therefore won&#x27;t damage your hair, they create a soft curl that doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, unlike using a curling iron. The most dissatisfying thing though, is the clamps provided to hold the curlers in your hair do not work! I have medium length hair and it can take 30 minutes to set my hair. Your supposed to leave the curlers in until they are dry, say 30 or so minutes. So, I like to use that time to get dressed and do my makeup. Instead, I spend that time picking up the curlers off the floor that have fallen out, reheating and rerolling them!  Ugh, So frustrating!  I usually end up going back to my curling iron and these curlers just sit there. Bummer, wish they had worked better!</li>
    <li> have used this a few times now and really like it.  Fast and easy to heat up, rollers work well and there are several different sizes.</li>
    <li> I am a Makeup Artist and I have used other hot roller products and loved it but this one is unique and love the curls it produces without th e need to burn hair! A bit time consuming though so if youre a busy on the go person maybe not best choice for u! But I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried the set several times, in several different ways, using different sizes of the rollers.  The set started out way too curly with all sizes. Within several hours, my hair was limp.  I have thick hair and this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I&#x27;m not too impressed with the return process either. I had to wait for my return to be authorized, then had to go to the post office to pay for the return shipping.  I guess I&#x27;m more accustomed to easy returns from other companies that let me print a prepaid shipping label and set it on my front porch for the mailperson to pick up.</li>
    <li> First off, these do a wonderful job of curling hair without damaging heat. However, be aware if you have fine hair,  the covers that come with the curlers allow them to slip out easily. To remedy this, I bought claw type clips at Sally&#x27;s. I know there are other steam hairsetters on the market that DO come with clips. Wish I had found one of them first.</li>
    <li> These are not exactly what I was looking for, but hopefully they will get the job done.  One problem I do have with them, is that the curler covers used to hold them on your head, end up putting &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; in your hair because of their edges.  Also, the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in the hair for very long.</li>
    <li> I threw these away. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Sent it back , my hair is too fine</li>
    <li> I purchased these curlers for a wedding. Despite my best intentions, I didn&#x27;t have the time to test them out before I had to get ready. Fortunately, they were easy to use, and worked wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t easy to completely empty the water from the unit, after use. The bottom basin is easily dumped, but I could still hear water in the other part, when shaken. I had a flight to catch, so I just stole a hotel towel and wrapped it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies, Vegas. I&#x27;ll bring you another towel next time.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my hot rollers were damaging my hair.  I was skeptical because the rollers don&#x27;t seem to get very hot, I didn&#x27;t think it would curl my hair very much.  Boy was I surprised!  I had beautiful curls that lasted ALL DAY!  I&#x27;ve never had curls last more than an hour before.  There is definitely a learning curve, as with any new tool, but I caught on pretty quick.  It doesn&#x27;t take me any more time than my hot rollers did.  You don&#x27;t have to leave the curlers on the steamer for very long at all.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use. Quick way to get lasting curls. My curls will last for several days.The different sizes of curlers is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly amazed at this hairsetter. It is simple, elegant, and works like a champ to take my very straight waist-length hair into any sort of curl I want. The only rollers I haven&#x27;t used so far are the jumbo ones, as this would be pointless to me. The roller sizes are fairly standard, and I like it that I can order more of any size I want, either directly from Caruso (order form comes with setter), or from Amazon. I have owned a Clairol heat setter and a Conair one, and Caruso has them both beat. I like the ease of putting one roller on the steamer, then when it&#x27;s ready to use, put another on; by the time I have the clip on the first, the next is ready to use. This is more functional than opening a box to get a curler, and allowing the heat out while doing so. The rollers are easy on my hair, being foam, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m cooking my baby-fine hair while using them. Heads up, though, really do get your hair totally dry before using this little marvel, otherwise the curl won&#x27;t stay, you&#x27;re adding water to water. Oh, and unless your city water is pristine, I recommend using distilled for longevity of both the steamer and curlers (and who wants yuck cooked into their hair?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set I bought came with a nice plastic bag to keep everything together, the steamer itself is easy maintenance, just air dry or wipe it out with something. I am very pleased so far. If anything goes wrong, I will update, but so far, so good! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it would be.  You have to hat each curler individually.  I don&#x27;t like that</li>
    <li> This system does not work for fine hair under 4 inches. The curlers and clips are very heavy and just fell out of my hair. I ended up using velcro curlers and placed round foam curlers inside them to absorb the steam. This  works well and leaves no clip marks. I do feel that the steam is a healthier alternative to dry heat and the curl seams to last if I dry my hair with warm and then cool air using a hair dryer.  I think the manufacturer should describe the product as only for medium to long hair only.</li>
    <li> the Caruso steam rollers are good, I especially like how it makes your hair shine.  I also like it for the less time it takes to curl your hair as oppose to traditional rollers.</li>
    <li> I have thick, course, curly hair. I usually straighten my hair with a CHI and then I curl my hair for definition with my Hot Tools 2&amp;#34; curling iron. I wanted to try hot curlers and saw that the Caruso Steam Rollers received really good reviews. I am not impressed! I used these last night after washing, drying, and straightening my. Although the curl was really cute, after I fingered through the curls, they immediately spurned to frizz!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were really easy to put in my hair though and they were super light on my head. I think that these just weren&#x27;t meant for my hair. Weird because all of the reviews appears to move towards being perfect for my hair:-(</li>
    <li> When the sponge on the rollers of my last Caruso set disintegrated after 20+ years, I bought what looked like the closest approximation at my local Wal-Mart.  They were pathetic, and so was my hairdo. I was traumatized, until I decided to see if they were still available anywhere. We all know there is no place like Amazon for that scenario, right? I was so thrilled, I ordered two sets this time. It&#x27;s cheaper than the equivalent number of replacement rollers. Nothing like steam + sponge rollers for the best set, that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loves these curlers. I had a set and completely wore them out, so it was time for a new one. I have long, thick hair and these will hold curl for up to two days in low humidity.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily the products fault.  Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.  I have another steam set that&#x27;s bigger and not as travel friendly but boy the results are unbeatable.  I just can&#x27;t travel with it, so I tried this one just to look super glam when I travel.  What a disappointment. I&#x27;ve used it twice.  It curls, just that the curls are not smooth at all all crinkly and irregular.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> best hair curlers ever.</li>
    <li> The wife really wanted this and has used it almost every day</li>
    <li> They were as expected.  They do not warm up as hot as my sets in the past have is my only  complaint.</li>
    <li> I really like the Caruso steam curlers. It takes a little time to find exactly how long to keep them on till you get the curl you want. My first set lasted me about 6 or 7 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Caruso Steam Hair-setter for years and have never been disappointed - so much better than other hot rollers or curler irons.</li>
    <li> Works super with all types of hair! Recommend to everyone! Light weight and very easy to use! Directions easy to follow! Super!</li>
    <li> Maybe other Asian reviewers had better luck, but after following the directions carefully, I only got soft beachy waves that fell out in 20 minutes. :( I wanted to find a hair curling solution for my wedding that didn&#x27;t involve high heat, but the only thing that worked for me was a flat iron and Lottabody setting lotion. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Love them they heat up nicely and are less damaging than a curling iron. I would recomend this product</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It lives up to it&#x27;s name.  I have longer lasting curls and do not have to worry about my curls dropping during summer heat!</li>
    <li> I had this roller set when I was a teenager, about 20 years ago. I lost it in a move and couldn&#x27;t believe I found it again. It still works like it did back then and my class mates love the way my hair looks. Thank God for Amazon, they have everything!</li>
    <li> I will say I read all the reviews and held off buying these, in fact, i think i came across this item in some magazine and google them. Finally, I decided it was time.  They just arrived and let me tell you... BUY THIS FOR YOUR HAIR!!! I have very long, thin, straight hair which I dont wash every day because it wont do anything if its clean clean.  I feel like I am tired of using a curling iron because the curls never last the day let alone an hour. This has created  THE EXACT TYPE OF WAVE IN MY HAIR I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED BUT COULD NEVER CREATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used six jumbo rollers in my hair and the VOLUME I HAVE IS UNREAL.  My hair looks professionally done without looking overdone.  I left in long enough to set curl but remain soft and just wavy all over!!  I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE IN MY HAIR AGAIN!!!!! Now I only hope they will last over night like the other reviewers claim they will.  This is the only review I have ever written on Amazon because I hope I change even just one ladies life with this little product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been an hour or so and the curls have fallen a bit.  I just need to experiment whether I should use Large instead of Jumbo and the time I should keep them in.</li>
    <li> I get great curls that last all day!  I normally put the rollers in and by the time I finish my makeup, the curls are set.  No finishing products needed and no heat damage.  I also get great volume even when my hair is weighed down by product.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even waist your time, is not worth it, i have very lim p hair, roller will fall off and they were not friendly user, need to heat one at a time?????</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, very straight hair. I had hoped after reading some of the other reviews that this hairsetter would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered was this product is difficult to use and time consuming. I thought I could set my hair then do my make up while the rollers cooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are easy enough, but the caps are a real bear to clip on the roller so that they actually hold. The clips do no fit on easily and the roller keep falling out.&lt;br /&gt;If I want to use this I must plan extra time---a LOT of extra time. The up side would be I&#x27;d be using steam to set my hair rather than a hot, dry curling iron and I liked that idea.&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought it and unwrapped it to use, I have it, so I&#x27;ll try again. But, not excited about it.</li>
    <li> Healthy looking and long lasting curls without damaging your hair.  The system also heats up fast and I especially like all the various size rollers.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I really couldn&#x27;t figure out how to work these. Made my hair frizzy instead of curly and I often had a wrinkle from the hair setter cap.</li>
    <li> I guess what i am really looking for, is like the old steam rollers.  Where they all heated up at once</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom who is an older lady. She has trouble washing and curling her very straight and thinning hair with traditional rollers. I was looking for the old Clairol electric rollers but couldn&#x27;t find it. I saw these steam types of rollers and this particular item had a better selection of roller sizes.&lt;br /&gt;We just received the rollers and turned it on to make sure we got steam.  The steam part worked fine and I put a couple of rollers in her hair and they curled the hair. All that is fine ... but you have to steam each roller separately which takes a bit longer than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 3 stars now because I am just not sure if this is going to meet all the needs of my mom. I will possibly change my rating as she uses them ... or not because they are a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> Returned it as it did not work as advertised..</li>
    <li> I have straight, thin hair that never holds a curl. These are the first things that have actually gave my hair waves that looked good and lasted all day. I love how easy they are to use, although I have burned myself on the steam, so watch out! I first saw this on [...] and she has tutorials on how to use it as well. So I suggest checking that out if you&#x27;re interested in purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I used these rollers a few years ago and loved them.  I received the newest model, and I love it also.</li>
    <li> Simple mechanism, works well, compact design... and apparantly a healthier option than hot rollers. I&#x27;m not great at styling my hair and have no previous experience using curlers, but this is simple enough to use- even for me and works as described.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Wife loves these and uses them every work day&lt;br /&gt;She always looks great</li>
    <li> I had an old Caruso I guess the original. It created way more steam thereby giving you way more curl. This new 1 doesn&#x27;t have in my opinion a big enough opening so that more steam can come out plus it just doesn&#x27;t get near as hot as the old one Just as important is the fact that I did not get all the rollers I was supposed to. You were supposed to get 6 each of 5 different sizes. I got 12 jumbo rollers, and only 4 medium and 4 small. I needed the smaller ones and never before used the jumbo and never will. I thought about complaining to Amazon but I have heard from tons of people that is the 1 way Amazon falls short. Everyone says they just won&#x27;t do much of anything about an inferior product so I didn&#x27;t even try. It&#x27;s funny to me that Amazon would send me a review on this product since I got it almost 2 months ago, what took so long? Anyway it is shoved away in the back of the closet where most likely it will stay.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly straight hair that does not curl with anything. This product not only curled my hair, but it was quick, easy and the curls actually held for hours after! I highly recommend these curlers!</li>
    <li> This product will hold curls for a long time.  I had both short and long hair.  I usually give an extra shot of the hair dryer once set and let the rollser cool completely.  The sponges do wear out but refills are available</li>
    <li> Love this product because it adds moisture to my hair and doesn&#x27;t damage it.  The device is small so storage is not a problem.  Wish the color wasn&#x27;t read though; it would be nice to have pink, purple, yellow or another attractive color.</li>
    <li> Good Price with fast shipping.  Can not comment too much since I bought it for my wife.  All I know is that my wife hair is very thick so she complain about leaving the rollers twice as long but her hair does curl.</li>
    <li> Best curling product I have ever tried. Quick and amazingly simple, even for someone who has struggled with rollers in the past. Beautiful curls and waves depending on how you roll. I bought the travel size for my shoulder length hair -- I am now going to buy more large or jumbo rollers because I want to see how that will look.</li>
    <li> I love steam rollers. My package is short one medium roller,the cap is there but no roller to match it.  These curls last all day and into the next. One of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in my hair journey. I have mid back length hair and wanted to wear my hair curler without the damage. This gives me that chance.</li>
    <li> I did like these curlers they curl well and the curls holds pretty well but the overall quality is not so great. The steamer stopped working and i havent used it maybe four times and its passed the 30 days to return and the curlers feel very cheap also...for the price i expected better</li>
    <li> having a harder time that I thought getting just the right amount of steam to curl my hair.  actually have had to dry hair with hair dryer while curlers are still in hair.</li>
    <li> Who ever said the curls are long-lasting either lied or doesn&#x27;t have fine hair.</li>
    <li> So disappointed!  All these great reviews so I really hoped would work for me.  Curls, yes -- lasting curls, nope.  Returned the item :(</li>
    <li> I find this appliance utterly useless.  First, it isn&#x27;t hot enough.  Second, you can&#x27;t help it out by blowdrying, as the curl is covered by the plastic cover.  Finally, it takes too long doing it one by one.  It is particularly useless if you have long hair, as I do.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but one roller came apart in my hand on the first use</li>
    <li> This steam system works great to curl hair! I&#x27;ve only used the system once so far. I had to use all of the curlers provided... and the end product:  my hair was rolled into tight curls (I don&#x27;t like this at all). I prefer large, looser curls so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m 12. The other downside, it took almost 3 hours to curl my hair. Even worse, it was very difficult getting the curlers out of my hair. It would somehow get tangled and I&#x27;d end up ripping some of my hair out of the curlers.  Ouch! I don&#x27;t think I will be using this system again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still hard for me to gauge how the curl will turn out. Sometimes they are perfect, and other times they are too tight. I think it&#x27;s probably in my technique!</li>
    <li> These curlers work surprisingly well.  I will admit, I&#x27;m still more likely to grab my curling iron in a pinch as these are not all that convenient to use but if your only interest is whether or not they work then .... oh boy do they work!</li>
    <li> I am not going to discuss the quality of curl because you have hundreds of reviews for that. Instead, I will share my experience with longevity. My steam unit still works after 24 years of use. I have to replace the rollers because the foam finally rotted (like any foam product would). Thud is a good quality product worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Curls last for days.better than any other curlers or curling iron. Does not damage hair.</li>
    <li> Great Rollers and so fast shipping!</li>
    <li> takes too long to dry</li>
    <li> The package says it comes with 6 each size rollers and yes I received 6 jumbo 6 large rollers but there are only 5 small rollers and its 5 small caps (1 small roller didnt come), and one more caps for medium and petite size roller.(6 foams and 7 caps lol)&lt;br /&gt;* I thought one medium roller was also missing but I found it. Still dont know why there are extra caps in my package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works greatly on my slightly thick and tend to be straight long asian hair :) only takes about 10 to 15 mins to set (until the roller cools down) and the curls are shiny until I brush them out. I prefer to brush them out as it gives more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also warm up the cap for about 3 to 4 sec as many people recommend :) Be careful the steam is really really hot!&lt;br /&gt;also for the exact curls I sometimes roll again or use a heat hair curler wand. With a little bit of practice you&#x27;ll get perfect curls :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I connected a small 110v-to-220v plug-adaptor to its plug(110v) since in my country 220v plug is used and there&#x27;s no problem! dual voltage is true. (purchased the adaptor through online)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars if I received full 6 rollers and caps each...</li>
    <li> These curlers are amazing. I&#x27;ve never been one to be really great with my hair...and my hair doesn&#x27;t like to curl, except for it&#x27;s own unpredictable wave. So! When I decided to take a chance on these curlers, I was skeptical but due to other reviews, I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;At first, it took several tries to get the hang on them. I was worried it would be time consuming but once you get a rhythm down, it&#x27;s streamline. Now I love them!! My hair actually likes these curlers and holds the curl well. I can&#x27;t say that my hair holds the curl for days and days like some other people&#x27;s but that&#x27;s fine with me. As long as they last throughout the day, I&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere that you shouldn&#x27;t keep the curler on the steamer too long....to not let it get wet before putting it in your hair. I have found that to be true. And it might just be my hair, but if it&#x27;s freshly washed and blow dried first, the curls actually do last for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;These curlers might not be for everyone, but I&#x27;d recommend giving them a shot. They have changed my hair life!</li>
    <li> I received these rollers as a birthday present from my husband. These are great! The longer you leave them in the better, but my hair was even curly after 8 minutes. I don&#x27;t agree with other reviewers who say you don&#x27;t have to use hairspray, but then again I always use hairspray to create a look that will last all day. I also love that these curlers cannot seriously burn you, unlike curling irons etc. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and If I go to bed with wet hair I know that all I have to do in the morning is roll it with these and by the time I put on makeup my hair is back under control, soft and wavy. I use the larger rollers to create looser waves. But if you want more curl go for the smaller size rollers.</li>
    <li> I really like this unit.  The rollers have great clamps that make them stay on.  It is compact for travel also.</li>
    <li> this is a great product,  i bought this as a replacement to one i had for 10yrs would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this for myself &amp; took a day to learn how to use. This is better for my hair &amp; holds curl much longer than traditional hot rollers.</li>
    <li> I like Caruso steam hairsetter so much. Goodbye to neck burns from curling irons. I can multitask while waiting my hair to be curled such as applying my make up. It is also very handy. Steams quick as well.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers, I just wish they were a little cheaper.  I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have long super straight fine hair. My hair is always the kind of hair that would never hold a curl. These curlers are sooooooooooooooooooo amazing and make my hair gorgeous! I use the medium and small to create beach like waves and I get a lot of compliments on my hair and people asking me how I did it. I hold the roller at the top of my hair and wrap my hair round and round fast to create wave not \\&quot;curl.\\&quot; I use Matrix Biolage Thermal-Active Setting Spray before rolling my hair and that is it...otherwise my hair gets too weighed down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and I have long thick straight hair.  It can usually take a curl if I use a hot iron but I decided to try this out since I thought it would be healthier for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box, I was super excited.  I put in the water, plugged it in and started curling.  I let it sit for 30 minutes hoping that it would stay in longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair fell down flat in about an hour.  I sprayed it with hair spray, I tried all the different methods I could think of to help it stay in place over several days but it still didn&#x27;t work. No matter how curly it got, my thick hair just fell down completely straight again after an hour.  I even tried to heat it and take it out and pin it to keep the curl while I was curling the rest of my hair and it was still a no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wanted so badly for it to work for me, it just didn&#x27;t.  I would probably stick to a hot iron over this.</li>
    <li> This Steam Hairsetter is great for my hair!  Instead of damaging heat like electric hairsetters, this is gentle steam.  Yet it curls beautifully and the set stays.  I&#x27;d recommend this set to anyone.  It also has plenty of rollers of various sizes for variety.  This is the only hairsetter I will get from now on.</li>
    <li> Best hair tool I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s dual voltage so I&#x27;m using it with an adaptor in Asia, which is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Caruso for 20 years and am so glad I could find one.  Curls last for days. Best with distilled water, but not necessary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and does what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> These are made for people with nice long hair.  I have medium length and they rollers just fall out.  Hard to clip on in the back too.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Good for fine hair as rollers are really light</li>
