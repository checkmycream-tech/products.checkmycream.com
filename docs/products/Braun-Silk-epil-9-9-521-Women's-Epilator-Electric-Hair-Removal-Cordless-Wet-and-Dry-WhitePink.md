      <li>It was amazing!</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hairs, I think you just have to use it once every 2-3 weeks, that is just amazing !</li>
      <li>The reason I&#x27;m so impressed with the Braun one is because I can tolerate the pain better.</li>
      <li>: I love Braun products and this is the best Epilator you can find.</li>
      <li>but for now I am loving this product!</li>
      <li>but what product that ripping out body hair is going to feel pleasant?</li>
      <li>and I also really loved the look of it (</li>
      <li>It is sturdy, the weight feels good in my hand.</li>
      <li>Its good and save lots of money</li>
      <li>Anything that speeds up the process is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been nothing but good.</li>
      <li>One of the best features on this epilator is the light.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I should probably give this a five star review because it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I have silky smooth skin with no bumps or irritation after using this device!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this epilator, received from Braun through a BzzAgent campaign (thank you) and I would recommend to others.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to have gotten the opportunity to try this great product through BzzAgent</li>
      <li>This one is just great, I had no problems fitting everything back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very glad to have been chosen by Braun to try this product</li>
      <li>I would prefer a corded one just because the batteries tend to not hold a great charge after a while, and it can take me more time to epilate than the battery can handle.</li>
      <li>Great product, love it</li>
      <li>Right out of the box I was very happy with the product&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>I did not specify a brand/model, so, although I received a very nice epilator, some models work better than others.  </li>
      <li>A very good, cost effective investment as against waxing and keeping skin hair free for longer time.</li>
      <li>And hope 2 weeks more!</li>
      <li>and it does get better as you continue to use it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I am so satisfied with it !</li>

      <li>I loved being able to see what I was doing.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and weighty in my hand, but it&#x27;s not too cumbersome.</li>
      <li>It is also heavier, but still feels quite nice in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sugared, waxed and shaved; each with its own benefits and difficulties.  </li>
      <li>I already use a Clarisonic for my face, so i really liked having something to use on the rest of my body.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received one of these for free from BzzAgent and Braun, and I was not disappointed! I was so excited to receive this item! I have wanted an Epilator, but was always hesitant because of the price tag. This was a little painful at first, but gets more comfortable with continued usage. I think about it like plucking ones eyebrows... the first few times is always the hardest, but it gets better and is so worth it to have smooth, hairless skin and not have to shave and worry about cutting yourself! I am recommending this product to all of my friends and family, and this is now a staple in my beauty routine! Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it ladies, and don&#x27;t let is intimidate you. You will thank yourself in the end!</li>
    <li> This is not the first ever epilator I owned, I do own a Braun epilator, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s been nothing but good. Well I&#x27;ve been a tiny bit apprehensive of getting any other since I am so used to this one and it does it&#x27;s job. Mind you that on average it takes me about an hour to epilate one leg with my old one.&lt;br /&gt;First of I didn&#x27;t expect it to come charged, it was and that was very comfortable - not having to wait a whole hour before I use it. This new guy feels a tad bit heavier compared to my old one, which is expected, due to the rechargeable batteries, but that doesn&#x27;t make it uncomfortable to use, if anything it&#x27;s on the contrary because there is no cord getting in the way while I&#x27;m using it. It IS true what they write about it&#x27;s wide head, it takes off a lot more hairs a lot faster, making the whole process faster as a whole so that&#x27;s another plus. What I noticed was, compared to my old braun epilator, this one takes out longer hairs without breaking them - while my old one needed certain conditions to be used, like I had to be fresh out of the shower so the skin pores were open and the hairs had to be no longer than 2-5 mm - this time I tried it on a dry skin with a tad bit longer hair and he cleaned it off like you wouldn&#x27;t believe without breaking the hairs!&lt;br /&gt;Now for someone who hasn&#x27;t used an epilator before, the initial first sensation may be a bit hard to stand - they even warn you of it in the instruction (which I read before using and it&#x27;s really good, informational even, for me it didn&#x27;t hold anything new though, the epilator is so easy to use you can figure it out on your own without the instruction anyway) - but what I didn&#x27;t expect was to get used to it so fast. It definitely is more painless than my older model.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a small handy satchel that you can put different epilator heads or brush or cord in, which quickly became my favorite there, very handy.&lt;br /&gt;My only minor remark would be that it&#x27;s turn on/offbutton (handle) is a little uncomfortable to use, when it&#x27;s your regular button it&#x27;s easier to just switch it on or off with your thumb (up and down motion), this one, because it is round, requires both fingers (well at least for me) and leaves me more careful so as to not break it or anything - but I wouldn&#x27;t take away a star for something as minor as that.&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t feel any pain after the epilation, no discomfort, just a very slight buzzing feeling on the skin - no redness either.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet yet, but what I loved most of all was you can wash the head - I couldn&#x27;t do that on my old epilator, you couldn&#x27;t bring it anywhere near water - this one I can which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;It IS fair to say that it&#x27;s a little loud but nothing you can&#x27;t get used to so no problems there, well at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging box is also very handy, it fits everything that&#x27;s inside just fine - that&#x27;s another part I love about Braun, you know how a packaging is uncomfortable, once you take everything out of it you can never put it back so it fits? This one is just great, I had no problems fitting everything back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very effective machine and it works great, I am VERY, VERY pleased with it, thank you so very much to Braun and bzzagent for letting me try it for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks sturdy and well put, I have a feeling and do hope that it&#x27;s going to last just as long if not longer than my old epilator (which still works just fine by the way but I think I won&#x27;t be using it much with this new guy at hands).</li>
    <li> To start… I’m a big fan of epilation over waxing or shaving. I am comparing the new Braun Silk Epil 9 to my old Braun Silk Epil. Thanks to Braun and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to honestly review the Silk Epil 9 for FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cordless. It charges in less than an hour. I have yet to exhaust the battery in one hair removal stint, but the box indicates that it will last for 40 minutes. I get worried that cordless appliances aren’t as powerful as plug-in, but have not experienced any lack of performance in this cordless unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wet / Dry usage. You can take this epilator into the shower. I love that my leg hairs aren’t scattered all over the bathroom floor after epilation and can just wash down the drain. I worried that the tweezers would not be able to grip the wet hair as well, but saw no difference between using wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wider epilation head. This model is 1/4” wider than my old Silk Epil and is about the width of a standard razor. Anything that speeds up the process is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Epilation heads. There are two caps that come with this model. A “High frequency massage cap” and a “Skin contact cap”. I am a seasoned epilator user - so I use the skin contact cap as it is quicker and gets it over with. Unfortunately the cost of speed is a bit more pain. But as the user manual states, “The discomfort experienced in the beginning will decrease considerably with repeated use as the skin adapts to the process.” I found the “High frequency massage cap” to be pretty useless. I would have to go over the same area over and over just to pick up a couple of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Smartlight. I was excited to have a light on this unit because my shower is pretty dark. Unfortunately it cast more shadows with the light on in a dark space and made it harder to see missed hairs. When I used the light during epilation in a brighter room I found it pretty handy in locating any missed spots.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent and Braun for introducing me to this great product! I was skeptical at first, but with summer months quickly approaching, I was excited to get started! The packaging is nice, and the razor is sizeable, making it easy to grip wet or dry. My favorite feature is the light that helps get hairs with the upmost precision. I have used this both wet and dry, and I find it easiest to use wet. The manual states the warm water helps get a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> it is a very good epilator, but too expensive</li>
    <li> I encourage those of you who feel uneasy about trying this epilator to give it a go! With the first few uses it may take some getting used to. It&#x27;s a completely different sensation than waxing or shaving in that there are no nicks or unnecessary pulls on your sensitive skin, but there can be a bit of slight pain like tweezing. I used this product both wet and dry and I recommend using this when wet and warm and applying a moisturizer such as coconut oil after. The ease of the pink pivoting head was awesome I loved how it glided over my legs! The smoothness is unparalleled to waxing or shaving and I cannot wait to see how long it lasts! I received this product free from Braun to try!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Braun and Bzzagent ! At first the sound of this product is a little intimidating. Dont be fooled because its a really good product for efficient hair removal with smooth results. At first it hurts a little bit bit no more than a bee sting or immunization at the doctors office, and after you get over that this tool works wonders. It is equipted with a large head to cover a greater area resulting in less strokes! I would absolutely reccomend this product!!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off and say I LOVE this product. Secondly, I got to try the Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator  for free, thanks to Braun through BzzAgent. Prior to receiving this product, I had never used an epilator or gone through the epilation process but now that I have I never want to go back to basic razors or anything else! I was scared, I had read that its painful but don&#x27;t be scared, it has a similar plucking sensation alike to getting eyebrows done. Waxing to me, is more painful and definitely a bigger mess. Epilation is the way to go. One of the best features on this epilator is the light. I think it is amazing that Braun thought of this concept because it helps so much. You actually get to see where you are going and actually see the epilation process. The final results blew me away. My legs were soft, smooth and hair free for a good while, and who doesn&#x27;t love that. This product works, its on the pricey end but it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Thanks to buzzfeed I tried this product absolutely free. I fully recommend this product to every woman! If you wax your legs stop now and buy this product! The silk-épil gets all your hair out fast with no chemicals unlike waxing. It left my skin smooth with no problems like skin swelling and redness that comes from waxing. My skin stayed smoother longer with no irritations. This product tweezes all you hair with one stroke. I loved it! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I tried this epilator thanks to BzzAgent and Braun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a great fan of epilators (that the primary method I used since years) because even if it is not dolor free, the result is very good and the regrow is less visible and important. This Braun epilator is perfect. It is a cordless version that you just have to plug for 1 hour to use it then around 40 minutes. You can use it dry or wet under the shower (that is so practical!) !&lt;br /&gt;The design is super cool and feminine with 2 different speed. The head is very large (more than the older Silk Epil) and that is very nice ! You can epilate more quickly than ever ! Silk Epil 9 is very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hairs on my legs and I use it frequently because I love to have perfect legs every time (I am sort of really obsessed with epilation when sunny days are here) ! But if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hairs, I think you just have to use it once every 2-3 weeks, that is just amazing !&lt;br /&gt;Also, this epilator is not too noisy, I mean even less noisy than the Silk Epil 7 that I used before and that is a very good point also !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really find the perfect epilator ! I am so satisfied with it ! Thanks to BzzAgent and Braun !!!</li>
    <li> I got this product from bzzagent. I loved using the product when my legs was wet but when they was dry it hurt me so bad. This was amazing to get and I broke out the first time using it. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t go away but it did and I will use it more and check in as I use it my aunt used it and it didn&#x27;t hurt her even a little and I felt like a big baby. It’s easy to clean the hair off and product which I have seen some people work for hours get the hairs out. I like the fact that it has a light because I can see my hairs that I missed and need to go over again. I tried to charge it the day it got here and it started to smell so I guess it was charged so I took it off as soon as I could. I use soy milk lotion after I finish using the product and the lotion helps it clear up. The first time I used that I had red bumps all over my legs which hurt for an hour or so. I had to go though the same place two to five time when I was using it which wasn&#x27;t something I liked and the more I did it the more spots came up in the area after I finished. The sound I watched a video of the one from years ago and this sounds better but the sound it what scared me. The product removes about I’ll say around 30 hairs at a time. The product if I can using tweezers multiple tweezers. This product is supposed to help you not have to shave for 2 weeks. As you know I’m going to put the two weeks to the test. I feel like the product is great when I used it when my legs are wet. I didn&#x27;t put the product in the water.</li>
    <li> Thank you Braun and Bzzagent for letting me try this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;There are SO many different aspects to love about this epilator!  The wider head covers more area in less time, you stay smoother longer, it has fabulous battery life, and it&#x27;s pretty. It is a bit loud, but don&#x27;t let it stop you from using this product.  Honestly one of the best epilators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I received this epilator free from BzzAgent. This is not my first epilator, I have a similar one from a different brand that I have a love/hate relationship with.  I&#x27;m a huge baby when it comes to pain so I barely ever use my other one. The reason I&#x27;m so impressed with the Braun one is because I can tolerate the pain better. I don&#x27;t have to run it over my legs a million times before the hair is pulled out either, which is important. The light certainly helps as well, you can see all the fine hairs you may have missed with the first pass. I&#x27;ve noticed with both of my epilators they tend to work better on dry skin instead of wet, but that&#x27;s just me. The chordless feature is a definite plus as well, I would hate to have to sit near an outlet and do this, I definitely want to be somewhere comfy haha! I will say the actual product is esthetically pleasing and fits in my hand nicely. Pink and sparkly is right up my alley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the pain factor is still there but what product that ripping out body hair is going to feel pleasant? I prefer this one over my other and I feel I&#x27;m more likely to use it since the pain is bareable, for a baby like me that&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
    <li> I was initially both terrified and excited when I found out I would be testing the Silk-épil 9 absolutely free from BzzAgent. As soon as I received it, I charged it up while I read the instructions. After an hour, I turned it on and pressed it to my leg. I learned all new curse words. Owie was not sufficient. The &amp;#34;small shocking sensations I may experience&amp;#34; felt more like 6 or 7 mean kids in school popping me as hard as they could with rubber bands in one area all at once. And I have fine blonde hair on my legs! However, I know that women all over the world use these devices every day and somehow manage to deal. I am also the woman who recklessly burned her first age spot off the back of her hand. Beauty knows no pain, right? So, I researched. First, take pain relief 40 minutes before use, soften the pores with warm water (as in a soak in the tub) and a good topical pain relief helps for first time users. As to the product. It is sturdy, the weight feels good in my hand. The device is not overly loud. I would compare the noise to that of an electric razor. (My initial screaming WAS loud!) I like the pretty sparklies on the face of it. I used it in the bathtub slightly under the water - which a great feature of the Silk-épil 9 and from what I understand, the only epilator that can be used with water. I learned rather quickly that this product is not meant to be used as one would a razor, dragging it up and down my legs - but instead, small rotating sections. The hair removal goes much quicker that way. It really is amazing the way the Braun Silk-epil 9 removes every little hair! The texture of my skin afterwards is almost strange to feel because it is SO very smooth. I haven&#x27;t tried an epilator since my mother got one in the 80s. Therefore, I can&#x27;t testify as to whether or not my time was faster due to the wider head. It certainly took longer than a shave. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my bikini line or the armpits. I have a feeling after I havemore experience with it, I may give it a try. I DID use it on my face around my lips and on my chin. No more little goat hairs that feel like wire sticking out of my face but are IMPOSSIBLE to find with a single pair of tweezers. It didn&#x27;t even hurt there! I haven&#x27;t needed to remove more hair yet. I understand that it gets easier the more you epilate because the hair starts to come in finer. I&#x27;m rather excited to find out. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m enjoying the feel of smooth sheets and silky pj bottoms slithering over my legs.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Braun silk epil 9 as a free offer to review for buzz agent! I was super excited that it arrived a day before i was to leave on a cruise.  I wasted no time in trying it out! I have thick course black hairs on my legs and face, I have tried everything. This thing is very painful at first but gets easier the more you do it. I went 5 days on my cruise without having to shave!!! I am amazed!</li>
    <li> This product has been sent to me to test by Braun, in the campaign of Bzzagent. That was really good chance to have this product, because i forgot my old one in my home country. Even if you search on the website, you will see the previous model of this brand epilator is the top. Already having this impression, got the epilator opened the box gently. The epilator was awesome. It is shiny, nice pink color, and really handy. The charge cable is also really light. So, you can get it wherever you want. It has a light feature, really usefull to see the skin. First, i tested it on my arm for five second, the level of the pain is in my expectation. Not less, not much. Then, first use it for underarm. In just 5 minutes, all hair gone, which is very nice. The pink head was good, in my first impression. It is adaptable to different angles. Then, used it for legs. Suddenly, i saw some scratches on my leg, you will see in the picture. I tried a bit more, and it was definitely visible. I changed the pink head with the spare one. So, it worked nicely at that time. The pink head should improve. Also i tried it under the water, it worked better than dry case to me. Especially, cold water treated nicely, has really less pain in that case. It is now two weeks time, still no hair! And hope 2 weeks more! If so, i will definetly be happy, that is all correct as in the manual. I recommend this item who needs easy, quick, precise epilation.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Braun! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared! Lol&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud and it&#x27;s uncomfortable at first.  After the 1st time, it gets better :)&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it&#x27;s so easy to use &amp; I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving everyday. I like that you can use wet or dry. Has made my legs super soft! It even comes with an attachment for more sensitive areas. Overall this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I used an epilator once (it was my sisters) and it hurt really really bad! She told me to keep trying and I would get used to it, I did not believe her and am still on the fence. If you have never epilated before BEWARE it HURTS! BAD! Or maybe its just that I&#x27;m a wus when it comes to pain (ask my family I&#x27;m a big baby) That said the Silk-epil 9 was a much better experience then my previous brief encounter, it still hurts and I&#x27;m honestly on the fence as to if I will continue using it long term, but the special head on it that gives a \\&quot;message\\&quot; before and after the tweezers really seems to ease some of the discomfort. It also seems to get quiet a bit of hair on one pass so there is a lot less redoing spots! Additionally the head is large so it takes less time and works more effectively. The machine has two settings I stopped using the lower setting since it did not seem to ease the pain so much and picked up less hair (more repeating spots I figured I&#x27;d rather one or two pass&#x27;s and slightly more pain) I tried using it in the shower and the pain was even less, but my shower is small so maneuvering was harder! The light on the machine is a FANTASTIC feature it really helped me see what I was doing even in my dark shower with the water pouring down my leg! Over all I think its a great product compared to others on the market so if you have epilated before you are going to love it. If you have never done so know its going to hurt but this is probably your best bet because a) you can use it in your shower and b) it has that massage head to help ease the pain and c) its big so it all gets done faster! Thanks to Braun and Bzzagent I got to try this for FREE :)</li>
    <li> I received this epilator free from BzzAgent to try and review. This was my first time using an epilator. Right out of the box I was very happy with the product&#x27;s appearance. The pink and white Braun Silk-épil  is very girly and attractive, and fits well in the hand. It came with a charging cord, two different head attachments, a cleaning brush, and a little drawstring bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was already charged when I received it, so I turned it on and was surprised how bright the little light was, and how generally noisy it was. It&#x27;s almost as loud as a paper shredder and sounds similar. The hair on my legs was a tad too long to comfortably epilate, but I gave it a little test. I started at the front of my ankle and moved up my shin towards my knee. There was virtually no pain, until I got closer to the knee, and even then it wasn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I shaved and after letting my leg hair grow out for a few days, I sat down and decided to do my full legs. I did everything from my toes and ankles up to my thighs. On a scale of 1-10, the worst pain I felt I would rate as a four. It really wasn&#x27;t too bad, and as they say, the first time is the worst time. It&#x27;s supposed to get much easier over time with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to try my armpits, which was a whole different story. The pain was pretty much unbearable. I had to stop and psych myself up to finish. I went online and read some tips from other people who have previously used epilators. They recommended using numbing creams or sprays, and also taking some ibuprofen a while before. So I took some ibuprofen, sprayed some Dermoplast , which contains Benzocaine, on my armpits and waited a little while. It made a huge difference, although it was still a bit painful, but it allowed me to finish the job. I did notice that the left pit went much easier, the right pit was more painful and left me with a few bleeding pores, nothing too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a week, since thenI&#x27;ve been mostly hair free on my legs and my armpits, with the exception of a few stray hairs that I missed. I did get one ingrown hair in my armpit that I suspect broke off under the hairline instead of being pulled out. I also tried epilating my bikini line and it wasn&#x27;t for me. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try that again, although I probably will eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll continue using the Braun Silk-épil, because as someone who gets their brows frequently threaded, I remember that it was more painful in the beginning and it got easier over time. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have the same experience with this epilator. One more note, there is a bit of cleanup afterwards. You need to clean out the device with the brush and give it a little rinse, and also there will be little hairs everywhere to wipe up. But that&#x27;s with any hair removal method, and compared to shaving every couple of days, I&#x27;ll take the epilator any day. I&#x27;m so pleased to have gotten the opportunity to try this great product through BzzAgent and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the product for free thanks to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Second time in my life when I really used the epilator.First was some years ago, also Braun but different model .This one I bought.I expected much,used &amp;#34;icy&amp;#34; glove, but after first couple minutes I put it back in a box with thought-maybe later-and never took it out again. This time I decided to knuckle down to this work.I sad to myself you are not a young girl, you can be patient and suffer it. I hardly travailed and little by little started to touch the legs.It was..OK.Little more,little higher..It was fine!Painful-yes, but not that catastrophically, as I was prepared to fill. So,I finished my legs,second was even faster, because I even was able to relax.For about 20 min legs were done. Definitely I like it!!!! When I open the box,first I so how nice it is,then I press the button-it was charged-you can use it right away without a cord.Little light helps you to see small hear better.It has a battery for the brush.Very easily you can change attachments.And you can use it even while you take shower. It so much better than shaving.Use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie: it hurts. It hurts a LOT. But--only the first pass hurts. Every one after that is not as bad. I did it on long leg hairs and on trimmed leg hair and it hurt equally bad on both, so I am not bothering to trim it before epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because shaving gave me horrible rashes, no matter how i did it or what products I used to minimize damage. I&#x27;m happy to say that I have silky smooth skin with no bumps or irritation after using this device! Not even on the bikini line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick out the pain of the first use and you will be rewarded with hairless skin!</li>
    <li> Love it! it can be used wet or dry and the wider epilation head really make the difference. All short hairs are gone its like magic. Make sure to wet your legs and scrub them before epilation so you will get all their hairs and there will be no ingrown hairs. I hope you will enjoy it! Thanks to Braun I was able to test it for free and just fall in love with it.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time using an epilator, but it has been a while.  I like the design of the epilator and that I can use it in the shower. When first trying to use it, I was having difficulty with the pink massage head on. I felt like it was not doing anything but scratching my skin and hardly any hair was being pulled out. Once a removed this piece, I saw a huge difference.  This epilator hurt more than the one I tried in the past but the results were also way better.  PS.. I received this epilator from Bzzz Agent to try out.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that at first use, this little machine terrified me. I had never used an epilator before and honestly kind of misunderstood what it was from the beginning when BzzAgent offered to send me one. The removal of the hair feels similar to the popping of a rubber band onto your skin and is honestly, not very pleasant. However, beauty is pain, and that is what I told myself the whole time! At the end (I was doing my underarms) they were so much more smooth, and once the redness dissipated, you could no longer she the underarm shadow that stubble usually leaves behind! I do think I will continue to use this product and I also really loved the look of it (the pink trim and the little sparkles were very nice). Product received free for testing purposes from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> amazing product...my legs, arms and bikini line stay so smooth!!!</li>
    <li> i love my braun silk-epil 9 i love the idea of being able to use the braun silk-epil 9 wet or dry i have to say after using my free bruan silk-epil 9 it left my legs soft and smooth i didnt have to shave as often either thanks to braun for allowing me this free silk-epil 9 to try out awesome product.</li>
    <li> I received my epi lator via Bzz agent.  I have used emoji epil lator in the past and it was pretty painful.  I found the Braun epi 9 to be less painful, I really like the fact that it has 2 speeds and a light to help guide you .  I only gave it 4 stars because the only downfall is you had to go over the areas numerous times to remove the hair.  I used this on my arms and legs, it was especially sensitive behind my knees.  I have yet to use it wet while showering.  My arms are still hair free and I used this 3 days ago.  I would much rather use an epi lator than have to shave daily.</li>
    <li> I received this from Braun via bzzagent for free and was excited and nervous in receiving the Braun Silk epil 9 as I have used an epilator in the past but never really got comfortable using one due to the discomfort. Well, the Braun Silk epil 9 may have made me a convert! First, I tried it on my arm to see how it felt, not too bad! Now with some confidence, I began with my legs while showering and although I had to go over some spots more than once, the results the next couple of days were a great improvement from shaving and the wider head did help to speed up the process.  While not necessary, I would recommend a good moisturizer following usage to help with some of the redness that will occur. My legs feel much smoother and so far, I have not had too much of an issue with ingrowns like I normally do with shaving. I normally have to shave my legs every 3 or 4 days and hopefully I can reduce this chore to only twice a month. The device was fairly easy to clean and comfortable to use.  I plan to continue to use it on my legs again and then plan on trying on my underarms and possibly my bikini line as summer approaches.</li>
    <li> Why oh why did I not start epilating years ago?  Don&#x27;t be discouraged by people saying it is painful.  It&#x27;s nothing you cant handle and it does get better as you continue to use it!  The first minute I used it I was like &amp;#34;woah, that&#x27;s a bit much&amp;#34; but it was really because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. As I continued to use it, it became less of an issue and by the time I got to the second leg I was going so fast I had to remind myself to slow down so I don&#x27;t miss to many hairs.  Going over an area twice caused me no issues and I was amazed at how long my legs stayed smooth.  Just as the product said, when my hair eventually grew back it was much less and finer, making round 2 even easier.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my bikini area or armpits next but I will soon and update this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get the hype, couldn&#x27;t pull the most easily able hair.. I used cheaper epilators with more success than this and this cost much more. Bummer</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Silk Epil 9 for about a month now.  I was given the epilator to try by the Braun Company.  The more I use it the more I like it.  I was hesitant at first because I thought it might be painful.  It really is not bad.  It can be used wet or dry.  I have found that I like it better  using it dry and on short hair.  I use it in the mornings and before I go to bed at night. That gives the hair time to grow and not get too long.  This keeps my legs smooth as silk!  It is packaged and designed well.  There are two speeds for you to choose from.  I use both speeds depending on the area that I am epilating.  I only use it on my legs.  I hope this review has been helpful to you!</li>
    <li> Thank you #BzzAgent #Braun #igotitfree for sending me the Braun Silk Epil 9 free to try out and review. Using this epilator has been a positive experience. The epilator has a very feminine appearance with the white and pink colors. It fit nicely in my hand. It has a little bit of weight to it but its not heavy or uncomfortable to hold. I like that this epilator is versatile and can be used wet or dry and is cordless. Its very convenient to use this way. The battery lasts much longer then 40 minutes. It hasnt died on me yet and Ive used it several time already wout charging it yet. As for hair removal it does a great job removing hair. There is some pain involved but certainly nothing unbearable. I was very impressed with how smooth my legs were after my initial use. My hair did start to grow back within about a week so I epilated again. It appears it will take a few epilations before the hair growth is slowed to the point of only needing to epilate every few weeks. I tried to use it on my underarms but the pain in that area is more intense as thats a much more sensitive spot. Ill continue trying and Im sure it will lessen. Over all I really like the epilator and will continue to use it. Compared to shaving it is much more effective and the results last longer. Ty again BzzAgent and Ty Braun Silk Epil 9.</li>
    <li> Silk-epil 9 is an amazing epilator that I got to try for free thanks to Braun. Yes, of course it does hurt a little, but I swear its only a pinch! But ohhh is it worth it! I believe due to the wider head, it took me next to no time to finish my legs and they feel ahhmazinggg!!! The Silk-epil 9 worked great both in the shower and out. I preferred out, only because it hurt more in the shower and I have a low threshold for pain, but I love the fact that I have the option. The light on the Silk-epil 9 is a tremendous help! I loved being able to see what I was doing. In ambient light its generally hard for me to see the hair on my legs as it blends in with my skin, but this product took care of that problem. Its now 3 days after and my legs still feel as smooth as it did the day I used the Silk-epil 9, normally the day after I shave with a disposal razor I could already feel stubble. I will definitely be using this for a long time to come, and now I am in search of the different attachments, can&#x27;t wait to try those!  UPDATE: I didn&#x27;t start to feel stubble until the end of week 2. This epilator is truly amazing. I will be using it once a month for my legs, but due to the sensitivity of my underarm area, I think I will stick to the conventional razors for my underarms.</li>
    <li> worked alright on underarms in terms of removing all the hair, but didn&#x27;t slow re-growth at all. didn&#x27;t work well on legs and left stubble behind, but did slow re-growth of what was removed. but, the pain is definitely not worth it for the legs. price not really worth it for the underarms, either, but it&#x27;s a time saver compared to plucking.</li>
    <li> I was nervous at first to try this product but it has been incredible. I recieved it free from Braun and BZZAgent. i had never tried an epilator before and was not sure how much it would hurt. I was very happy to find that with the white head attachment I was able to get really close on my face and underarms. It pinches slightly at first but with the massage action that quickly goes away. The 40% larger head really does a nice job doing the task  quickly and getting rid of excess body hair efficiently.  I love the pink head for epilating my legs as it moves with the contours of your body. I have been more than happy with its performance and think it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> It hurts but it works.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator, thanks to BzzAgent for letting me join the campaign and test out this Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9. I have read few reviews about braun epilators to be painful, but surprisingly this one doesn&#x27;t hurt.. or maybe because I have been using an epilator for quite some time now.. so for me, this might not be that good for first timers who wants to try epilators as a method of hair removal..but all in all I really love how this epilator glides smoothly even on the contoured areas. Moreover, one of the best thing about this product is you can use it wet/dry, so whether you wanna do it while in the shower which I much prefer or do it when you can.. The built in light in the epilator makes it easier for you to see the little hair that is being left behind which is an awesome idea. Overall, I am satisfied with the performance of this product and will recommend it to my friends and family. It leaves my legs feeling smooth and hairless for weeks.</li>
    <li> Ok I got this product free to try and when I opened it I was freaked out cause it literally plucks out the hair. I had to work up the nerve to try it lol. A little painful at first but then after getting over my being scared it was simple and works amazingly. I have thick leg hair so I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna work well moat products don&#x27;t but it lasted a couple of weeks before I had to touch up my legs. I love this product and will never shave again!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.  She just started &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t need to worry about her cutting or slicing her skin with a regular shaver.</li>
    <li> I love it it remove the hair super fast but still pain like hill</li>
    <li> I had armpit stubble even immediately after shaving. My armpits show no sign of hair. One of my best beauty purchases ever. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong it hurts, but overtime you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Very effective, and for an epilator it&#x27;s actually not that painful. Sure it still is but to me it&#x27;s less painful than waxing and much much easier to do. Before I always had trouble with underarm because it&#x27;s really sensitive and hard to get a completely smooth skin. This epilator is the only one among other methods that get the results I really want.</li>
    <li> I have been given this product to use and review for FREE from BRAUN and BzzAgent.  I just tested it on the underarm area and was extremely impressed.  The wider head made the process very fast and very smooth.  The discomfort level was no worse than waxing however even better was the fact that it didn&#x27;t pull my skin so there was NO skin irritation and I was left with a very smooth under arm area.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it on other areas - I recommend this to anyone wanting a fast smooth hair removal process.</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that I have received the Braun silk-epilator wet/dry to try free....thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it wet and dry.  Wet it worked ok.  I think that because the hair on my legs was a bit long it lay flat and was hard to grab.  I had tried an older version when it came out years ago.  Th older version was painful.  The new version is so much better.  There is a bit of a prick, very mild.  I find for myself dry works better.  No irritation, smooth skin.  sometimes instead of pulling the entire hair out it shaves it from the top, but that is minimal.  Overall a great product!</li>
    <li> Silk epil 9  it is the best  On leg hair . my legs have been smooth for a week .other than a slight pinch it is one of the best hair removals  you can ever use.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to rate and review this product! I&#x27;m very impressed! This is my very first epilator purchase ever. Received this as a buzz agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve used the epilator for the first time, I would tell other newbies the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this particular epilator to be very comfortable in spite of the many reviews of other ones on the market and the whole process in general. I would say that I followed the first timers suggestions from the product instructions and found them to be a very helpful guide (at night take a hot shower/bath to open pores + exfoliate areas that you will use the device on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the guard at first, but took it off due making too many passes. Covered more area when the guard cover was removed and didn&#x27;t feel a need to put it on again because the pulling of the machine was not exactly &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; per se... I&#x27;d describe the sensation as more of an &amp;#34;annoyance&amp;#34; rather than pain and this is after using the device first under my arms and bikini area ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel of epilating with this device on a pain scale of 1-5 with 5 being excruciatingly painful, I&#x27;d give my total experience with this product a good 5 as I feel wonderful using this..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried epilators in the past - even going so far as to pay well over $200 for one that was supposed to be the best of the best. I was lucky enough to be sent this epilator from Braun to test out, and I&#x27;m so grateful for it! The Braun Silk-épil 9 was MUCH better than the previous epilators that I&#x27;ve owned. What I think is best about this epilator is the fact that it can be used both wet and dry. The epilator has an attached light that literally lights up each individual hair and makes it so easy to see where you&#x27;re epilating. Thankfully the epilator also has 2 settings, one slower setting for more sensitive areas and for fine hair, and a second faster setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of epilation can be painful, and your tolerance to the pain will truly depend on your own body. Just like tweezing and waxing, the initial pain that you may experience will lessen with repeated usage. I was able to easily epilate my legs without pain. I then tried my underarms, and that was a bit more painful. I committed and was able to get through it, and I&#x27;m 100% glad that I did. There is not one hair under there! And I&#x27;m relieved to know that it&#x27;ll last a few weeks until I&#x27;ll need to touch it up again. While it was painful, the results have me convinced that I&#x27;ll continue epilating both my legs and my underarms. After I epilated my underarms, I was a bit brave and attempted to epilate my bikini area. It was just too painful for me to take on fully - for now I&#x27;ll continue saving that area for shaving only (no matter how annoying shaving can be). If you regularly wax down there, epilating the area should be much more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this epilator was better than others I&#x27;ve used and I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I was selected to try the Braun silk epil 9 free from bzzagent. The day it arrived I opened and charged it.  Once it was charged I got to work.  I used it to shave my bikini area. Of course there was minor pain but it worked quick  and the light that is on it made it easy to spot little hairs that otherwise would be hard to see.  I love it and I am soo glad this beauty tool came in my life.  No more wasting money on razors. Also since it pulls from the root the hair takes like longer to grow back.</li>
    <li> I epilate regularly. I haven&#x27;t shaved in almost a decade. The epilator I used to use before I bought this was the Braun SE3170 Silk-épil 3, which used to take my 1.5 hours to epilate my legs and arms (TBF, it is very old). This took me 30 minutes. It is so efficient and fast, I can&#x27;t get over it. The only downside is that it only functions while cordless. So if you run out of power, you have to put it to charge and can&#x27;t use it in the meantime. This may be a problem for someone who is not used to epilating, and may not go as fast over the hair as I do (since I don&#x27;t feel as much pain anymore).   The light is super bright and AWESOME. Really really helps to see any stray hair. The pink head attachment also helps with the efficiency of the epilator, but does hurt more. It also scratches your skin.  Totally worth it though.</li>
    <li> I had one similar to this model before and loved it. Then it gave up the ghost, and I put an epilator on my Christmas list.  I did not specify a brand/model, so, although I received a very nice epilator, some models work better than others.  I finally broke down and replaced the nearly new epilator, with another Braun Silk-Epil. This is like the one I was so satisfied with for so long, only this model has the added feature of being wet and dry.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower, so can&#x27;t comment on that feature.  For first time users, epilation is not pain free, no matter which epilator you use.  I used to have my legs waxed and found that to be quite a trauma, so I find epilation to be easier.  I have been doing it for some years now, so I don&#x27;t think much about it.  I just take out the Braun, run it over my legs to keep them smooth; takes only a few minutes, then put it away in the bag that came with it.</li>
    <li> I received it earlier than I expected. The epilator was great, plus I was surprised it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would for the first time. I admit it hurts just for the first time. The cons of this item is that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs especially the short onesie ven if I go over the place more than a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I am so happy, I recommend ir widely</li>
    <li> Was a bit worried about this purchase. Most of the reviews stated that much pain was involved. My experience has been quite the opposite. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t even call it pain. More a very slight discomfort. Love this epilator!!</li>
    <li> Love this epilator! It&#x27;s waterproof and cordless so you can epilate anywhere. Of course like tweezing and waxing it&#x27;s going to hurt but the more you do it the less it hurts. Completely beats shaving.</li>
    <li> Best unit I have had so far</li>
    <li> This thing really hurts, I prefer to just use wax</li>
    <li> when turning it on epilator produces a very loud noise and it was scary but the epilator works amazingly. the skin epilated is soft 5 days later the discomfort is tolerable. I tried it dry and in the shower trying to get used it. the light it has was amazing since my shower is kind of dark. I can only complain at the fact that on multiple occasions I had to go over some spots 2 or 3 times. which is kind of a big deal if you are using a product like this for the first time. as i mentioned the product is intimidating because ofthe loud noise but i would still use it even though some spots i have to double back on. you do ge used to he iscomfort it feels like tweezing ona larger scale (lol). i love this product. worth the discomfort specially since braun was kind enoug to send it to me free :)</li>
    <li> I was perfectly happy with my razor...until BzzAgent came along and told me Braun would send me one of these to try for only my review in return.  I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and here I am.  At this point, I&#x27;ve only been able to use it once.  I did both legs last night during a shower.  I am not going to lie and tell you it&#x27;s not painful.  Because it is.  But it will certainly be worth not having to shave on a daily basis.  I&#x27;ll admit, I did not follow the directions exactly at first.  They said to slowly pull the epilator up the leg.  I couldn&#x27;t handle that for the first run.  Even with the included &amp;#34;high frequency massage cap&amp;#34; that the instructions say &amp;#34;ensures best skin comfort during epilation&amp;#34;.  There was just way to much yanking going on all at once.  After the first pass, I did slow it down so the machine was able to do it&#x27;s job correctly.  Even with having to do multiple runs over the same spot, a full charge on the battery lasted the full amount of time it took me to do both legs.  The machine worked well under the running water.  The wider, rotating head worked great over my knees.  And the light helped me see any hairs that I missed.  I will say, so far, I am extremely happy with the results.  I will definitely be using this for my hair removal purposes from now on!  I really can&#x27;t wait to see how my legs are after a few months of consistent use.  And maybe one day I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try using it on my underarms and bikini area....</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product! I have very sensitive skin in my bikini area. When I shave with a razor, I&#x27;ll wake up the next day with horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs. After using the Silk-Epil, I noticed that I had no bumps or ingrown hairs the next day. It was amazing! The only irritation I experienced was right after I used it and it subsided within an hour. This product isn&#x27;t for someone with a low pain tolerance. It hurts but it is absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> I got this from Bzzagent. I was using epilator since past one year. And when it comes to epilator, no second thoughts.. I swear by Braun, nothing else close to it. I was using earlier Braun Silk Epil 5 and now got an opportunity to upgrade to Braun Silk Epil 9. Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;So coming to its features, true to its claims - 40% wider epilation. Saves lot of time.  Cordless feature makes it easy to use anywhere. And the LED light provided with the newer one is quite bright.  Epilation is always going to be painful but you eventually get used it like the way you were for waxing. It is a habit so now it only pinches. And I prefer epilation over waxing. And this new epilator scores it all. Wonderful to use on hands n legs.I have pretty coarse and thick underarm hair, so I prefer waxing and can&#x27;t take the pain of epilation for underarms.  Or sometimes I used to use the Shaver attachment that comes along with the Silk eplil 5, which I found missing in Silk epil 9. But voila, I just thought of checking if the shaver attachment fits to Braun Silk epil 9, and it DID! Problem solved. Braun, you rock. That&#x27;s how a design should be. I found the dry epilation useful than wet one. Off course wet one during shower is less painful. But wet hair tend to stick to your skin making epilation less effective. Again it depends upon the length of your hair. But overall I am satisfied to upgrade to Epil 9, saves my time, easy n convenient to use, travel friendly, can be used with multiple attachments and fits my bill perfectly in all ways. A very good, cost effective investment as against waxing and keeping skin hair free for longer time.</li>
    <li> Got his for my girl&#x27;s birthday. She says it is a great alternative to waxing, though she says it misses some areas. She has to let them grow a little longer to get them. Still a great product.</li>
    <li> The Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 9-521 was better than expected! i received this product for free to share my thoughts, this review is based on my experience using this Epilator, i am not paid nor anything to favor the brand. Being sincere this was my first time using an epilator and i am so glad i did it, it is a whole new thing, before this i always shaved my legs but as you should know shaving is an everyday task. I am a first time mother, i also work and the house chores, i can hardly find time or myself this epilator is beyond great, IT SAVES YOU SO MUCH TIME!  it did hurt a little bit at the beggining but as you go along you get used to it, i discovered that the saying &amp;#34;NO PAIN NO GAIN&amp;#34; it is true, but is well worth it, it leaves your skin a little red after using it but the redness goes away after a few minutes and the softness it leaves is so great, no more shaving for me! Flawless legs lasts about a week for me, after this you get some hairs here and there i see them growing less and less hair everytime i use the epilator, probably it just last longer but whichever is the case it is great! the little twizzers on the epilator work great and it does cover a bigger area so you finish really fast, it does get those little hairs and the led light it has is so much help, this light does make a difference! i used it on my legs and underarms... and i had no ingrown hairs so far.&lt;br /&gt;i can advice you this o my experience: -Use the higher level it goes faster and is less painful. -it does not hurt so much, at the beginning feels like it stings a little but you get use to it barely notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line You want to save time? as most of us Women, we are mothers, workers, and so much more with a ton of things to do, this will save you time and have one thing less to worry about. Remember... &amp;#34;no pain no gain&amp;#34; and with this epilator you have so much to gain... it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love the Braun silk epil wet and dry cordless epilator. It keeps my legs looking smooth for weeks. I like the light on the it helps when looking for any hair you might have missed. I also enjoy that you can use it in the shower which hurts significantly less than using it dry. The only problem I had with the epilator is a weird stubble i had after using the epilator. Oh and a little while after using the epilator make sure to exfoliate to prevent in grown hairs. Overall i enjoyed this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product complimentary from bzzagent.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Braun, I was able to to test and review the Silk-Épil 9 Epilator. This was the first time ever hearing of an Epilator, so I was unsure what to expect. I have since grown to like it, and now am comfortable enough using it to where it has become the main way I remove my leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From first looks, the silk-épil 9 is a gorgeous tool. It is an attractive sparkly pearly white with magenta accents. It feels nice and weighty in my hand, but it&#x27;s not too cumbersome. For such an expensive little tool, it&#x27;s good to know it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap! The handle has an LED light, so you can actually SEE the hair you&#x27;re trying to get rid of. My shower is particularly dark, so being able to not miss giant patches of hair means a lot to me. To turn on the silk-épil 9, you have to use both hands to twist a little cumbersome dial (wish it was a button or slide adjuster instead), which has the off position, a lower speed and a higher speed setting. I would definitely recommend starting with the lower setting, and throughout the process, I found myself adjusting the dial back and forth between the two speeds. Once you get used to the speeds, however, high speed doesn&#x27;t feel much more painful or different than low speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless silk-épil 9 is neat because you can either epilate dry, clean skin- or you can take it right into the shower. It comes with a charger that charges it super quick. For the price of the thing, you&#x27;d think it would come with a charging stand, but it sadly doesn&#x27;t (hopefully by the next model?). It also comes with 2 interchangeable heads. The white head is a big, thick guard meant for sensitive areas such as your armpits. I barely use this head at all, and I certainly do not use the Epilator on my armpits! I tried, and I am wayyyyy to sensitive for that! The other head that comes with it is a magenta contouring head, that helps glide the Epilator along the curves of your body and gets in those tough spots- like around your knees and behind your thighs. I use this mildly pivot able attachment most often. The two different guard attachments snap right on and off with ease. You also get a little nifty looking brush, which is great for cleaning the hairs out of the machine- especially after using it dry. It&#x27;s little, so don&#x27;t lose it! Lastly, Braun gives you a chintzy little bag to put it all in. So overall, regarding appearance and other physical features- the Silk-Épil 9 feels like a quality piece, has a sturdy charger, comes with some handy attachments, and some cheap little extras like the brush and bag. I think just based on the charger and the Epilator alone (forget the extras), this is totally worth the money and is ideal for first time users and experts alike.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for a LONG time (I would say half my life). I am fair skinned, but have dark hair, which means I need to take care of business quite often. Most recently, I have owned a [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator Model: 5395]], as well as a [[ASIN:B0077PLOHE Braun Series 5-5185 Silk Epil Epilator 1 Count]]. Both still work, which speaks to the durability and quality of Braun products. I use my epilators at least once a week. I was so excited to receive this latest version to test out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and feel: I think the sparkly handle is adorable. The Silk-épil 9 is larger than the Silk-épil 5 (photos for comparison - travel toothpaste for scale). It is also heavier, but still feels quite nice in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is cordless, and can be used wet or dry. When cleaning my previous epilators, hair would sometimes get stuck in between the tweezer areas because of oil and other products. Using a brush wouldn’t get them totally clean, so I really like being able to rinse this out. I didn’t use it in the shower (because draught) and I like being able to sit down and see what I’m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little confused when searching on Amazon - there seems to be 2 similar epilators that are both wet/dry. From what I can tell, the pink one (Silk-epil 9) is rechargeable and comes with a body exfoliator head (NOTE: the exfoliator CANNOT be used on your face), while the [[ASIN:B00TI5ZMZQ Braun Silk-Epil Bonus Edition Wet and Dry Cordless Epilator with 7 Extras Facial Cleansing Brush]] (purple one) requires batteries and has a separate facial cleansing brush. I already use a Clarisonic for my face, so i really liked having something to use on the rest of my body. Made me feel squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the Braun Silk-épil 5, the light is a great feature. Regarding charging time, the manual says it only needs an hour to run on 40 minutes. I just plugged the Silk-épil 9 and came back to it later, so Ican’t say for sure if the charging time is an hour. The light blinks when it is charging, and stays on once fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the Silk-épil 9 can be used to remove facial hair. While I wouldn’t use it to pluck my eyebrows, cleaning up errant hairs on my upper lip was not such a bad experience while using the attached cover (I normally get it threaded).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch took a little getting used to. There are two buttons on the left and right sides of the circular switch, which I have never encountered in other products. I was able to turn the unit on and off using one hand, but it was a little awkward at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn’t like was that although they do include a pouch, it is similar to the Braun 5270 - just a thin fabric pouch. Keep in mind, I bought the 5270 5 years ago. The Silk-épil 5, on the other hand (from 2 years ago), came with a nice pink pouch that was silky and sturdy. You would think Braun would only upgrade their pouches, not revert back to old ones. Anyway, this was a super minor item that did not retract from the efficacy of the Silk-épil 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain level, since I’ve been using epilators for so long, I’m pretty used to the sensation. I do appreciate that it has a 40% larger head, which means getting the job done in less time. For anyone wanting to start epilating, I would probably recommend starting with your lower legs, after exfoliating and a warm shower. Just like the attached manual says, try to keep your skin taut. Also, don’t epilate before or during your period - you are more sensitive to pain at this time. Also, keep at it! The more you do it, the less often hair grows, and you get accustomed to the sensation. I wouldn’t say it is completely pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife - Its good and save lots of money</li>
    <li> I just finished using the Braun Silk-Epil 9 epilator. The extra wide head makes quick work of shaving your legs. Left my legs feeling very smooth and dare I say silky? The smart light is really helpful in finding any hair I might have otherwise missed. If you have never used one be prepared for some slight stinging sensation at the beginning. Also make sure you don&#x27;t have long growth. This epilator has a powerful motor and it only took an hour to charge and holds a charge for 40 minutes! Of course you don&#x27;t need that much time!  Comes in a pouch with a skin cap for underarms and bikini line. I am very glad to have been chosen by Braun to try this product and I am pleased with the product, (I have used another epilator in the past and this is definitely a much better product).</li>
    <li> I received one free from Braun in the mail as part of a promotion. I liked it a lot. I like that it didn&#x27;t give me razor burn or ingrown hairs. I have really sensitive legs, especially on my thighs so this was a great product for me. It does take a while to do, but I haven&#x27;t had to shave my legs yet and its been four days, with no stubble. I would give it a 4 out of a 5 because this would be more useful for me on vacation and I didn&#x27;t want to bring razors.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have ever been excited by hair removal! For about 1.5 years I have been using an Epillady but over time it has gotten worse, having to go over each area over and over and never achieving actual smoothness. This Braun Elipator is like the mac daddy Cadillac compared to the edilady. It worked much faster, covering more surface at a time and it actually left my legs smooth! I am so very happy with this! This was less painful than the other one as well, it pretty much felt like a stinging sensation instead of painful. I am so happy I bought this, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> For me, I wasn&#x27;t happy. I received this as a promotion for buzz agent.  It didn&#x27;t give me the smooth and close shave I was hoping for and expecting. I got a closer shave with my razor.</li>
    <li> Super super super perfect really I love it</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and far less painful than my old one!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased/used, so I don&#x27;t have a comparison to make with another type/brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came charged, which was very nice.  The first use was insanely painful.  Akin to waxing.  I had to take pain breaks.  But the following uses are less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DOES NOT capture every hair.  I still had to use tweezers to remove hair here and there.  Does not prevent ingrown hairs.  (Other reviews have said they don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs from this.)  And it needs to be cleaned between legs.  Hair gets caught in and under the head.  But it comes with a little brush, and it&#x27;s very easy to sweep away the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually happy with it.  It is much easier/less messy than waxing.  And seems like hair does take longer to come back even compared to waxing.  Fast-charging.  And it&#x27;s pinky and sparkly, which if you&#x27;re a girly-girl, that&#x27;s fun.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this - I really did. But it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs on my leg, even after going over the whole leg several times. Now, I have very thin, fine, sparse hair on my legs, which could be the issue. I do like it for my underarms, even though it is pretty painful. I mean, these things are not designed to feel good.</li>
    <li> Love it, I never used wax after using this.</li>
    <li> First I want to say thank you BzzAgent for letting me test Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9! So here is my review: I love Braun products and this is the best Epilator you can find. The last time I used epilator was about 5 years ago and WOW I mean WOW this new model is amazing and less painful. Loved the WET feature because I find the water somehow makes it less painful. But still I would not recommend this product for people with very sensitive skin. The first time I tried it took me forever to finish my leg because it was painful and I went extra slow. I have a very sensitive skin and after I was done my legs looked scary red with lots of bumps, it took 3 days for them to go away and as I saw some tiny little hair that were left became very irritated and red. So for me next time there will be no legs day or armpits because I feel that its not worth the pain. But I do recommend this product for bikini area! I always epilate my bikini area and it is used to it. This Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 was very easy to use and it is very efficient! Also I find that the batterie life is very good and it charges pretty fast too. Will definitely continue to use for bikini area. Maybe little by little when my skin get used to it I will be able to use it on my legs! Also don&#x27;t forget to use ALOT of moisturizing creams to avoid ingrown hair and don&#x27;t forget to read manual when you get the product. Almost forgot to mention the little but VERY bright light that helps you see all the hair that needs to be gone, it is a BIG plus in this product!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I should probably give this a five star review because it&#x27;s good for what it is. All emulators are painful to use, and I knew this walking in. This epilators is much quieter than previous models. I didn&#x27;t notice whether the extra width really speeds things up, but there are definitely more tweezers and they have less of a flat shape, making it seem like there are more connections points to grip hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I love: its muxh quieter, the light is whiter and brighter, the shape is more ergonomic, the battery warning light is so helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing I don&#x27;t like: it hurts! A bit like tattooing yourself. Bearable but not pleasant.  There could be an even slower speed for the dainty areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that leave me neutral: length of time before regrowth (is it pulling or breaking hair?), using it wet (you cant see and it doesnt seem to work as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: there&#x27;s way more good than bad, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle product. Excellent choice if you&#x27;re set on epilating, but maybe not enough to convince me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest opinion, but I&#x27;m obligated to say I received a free product to try for review.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I would have liked more accessories.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me, I had  a supper  old Braun silk epil i can&#x27;t even tell the model so old it was, all this years  been working good, couple months ago the massage cap broke and then  the wire start giving me problems  making annoying  to use. As I needed a new epilator i check  on Internet the best optios, my sister bought a Philips couple years ago and  i remember that thing was awesome but i wanted  to make  sure  i was buying the best since  i know  I ll keep it  for years most probably. My sister told me her Philips  ripped of part  of  her skin  on her arm pit  so  she  only  uses  it  for  the legs,  that make  me seriously discard  that  option  and  think about  Braun as  i was doing in the beginning, i was doubting between the 7 or  the 9 since  the  9 is new  i couldnt find a  lot  of reviews but  i thought  and  my friend  told  me every new model  is better so  i decided  to get this one even  when  only have  the massage cap and the sensitive cap (which  is faster and more painful cos  goes closer to your skin) First  i was  super happy to get  it  the next  day since  i have  prime account, and something  I love about  this  epilator is  that  its  cordless,  so  i charged it and  when  i tried  it  omg!  i wasn&#x27;t feeling nothing!!  i thought it was  shaving me instead  of  depilating  me !!  i tried  on  the  arm and  i saw  it  was pulling  out  the hair,  this machine  is super  fast and  the massage cap  is  very very  useful compare to other machines and it  pug out  the smallest  hairs.  It  can  definitely be  use on  arm pits,  legs bikini arms  etc....  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT  I RECOMMEND IT  100%!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it</li>
    <li> After reading many, MANY reviews, I decided to order this a couple days ago.  I had very high hopes for this device, after trying waxing, hair removal creams, and shaving.  I have very pale skin, and my hair color is dark, so shaving would always leave tiny dark spots on my legs.  I had even watched video reviews on this product, to gauge how painful it might be.  The people&#x27;s reactions were quite hilarious.  Anyway, I finally tried out this product--just now actually.  It seems to work a little better than shaving.  It does actually pluck out A LOT of hairs, but it also just cuts it down like a razor would.  It also works better on very, very short hair.  Using this on your legs feels like a prickling sensation, but it&#x27;s nothing you won&#x27;t be able to tolerate.  Don&#x27;t bother using it on your underarms (I have just tried it) it only pulls on your skin and cuts most of the hairs down instead of plucking them out (and the pain is not worth the persistent efforts); you&#x27;d have a better time tweezing them out one by one.  I was actually hesitating on whether I should return this product or just keep it; it does work better than a razor (on the legs at least), but not as well as if you were going to tweeze out the hairs yourself (which no one would really want to spend  time doing).</li>
    <li> easy to handle, I love my epilator already. It hurts the first times but it&#x27;s getting better very quick and don&#x27;t Need to shave the legs every couple days is it definitely worth.</li>
    <li> Although this is probably the most expensive epilator I&#x27;ve ever bought, I have to say it&#x27;s probably by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. This is my 3rd or 4th one so I have some experience with epilators. I&#x27;m not sure if this one is superior to the epil 7, which was the epilator I used a few years ago before trying a different brand (that I didn&#x27;t care for). These epilators are the best for a few reasons. Number one is just that the head moves around so you can actually get at curves on your skin, making epilating areas other than your legs WAY easier, and it makes closer contact with your skin that way. I suspect it also pulls the hair out more by the root that way, leading you to not have to epilate as often. The other great thing about these is the light, which is really helpful for checking your progress in areas that are unavoidably hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: flexible head lets you epilate more closely and in challenging areas, light helps you see hairs, less painful than the average epilator&lt;br /&gt;Cons: cordless, ugh! I would prefer a corded one just because the batteries tend to not hold a great charge after a while, and it can take me more time to epilate than the battery can handle. This seems to be all of the braun epilators now though, so the compromise is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I highly recommend this epilator if you can afford it, but braun epil 7 was also pretty great. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this model.</li>
    <li> I personally love mine. I received it free from bzzagent.com.  The day I got it I used it right away.  It was slightly painful at first but you quickly get use to the unusual sensation.  The first time I used it took awhile because I had so much hair on my legs (sorry, TMI) but 6 week later and I only use it once a week for touching up areas that have started to regrow.  I haven&#x27;t used a \\&quot;traditional razor\\&quot; on my legs in over a month.  I love the fact that I can use it anywhere because I have a 3 year old that never sits still.  It has definitely made wearing shorts and dresses less of a pain because I don&#x27;t have to spend half an hour in the bathroom shaving.  I will absolutely continue to use this product for many years to come.  I have a friend that I had try it after much persuasion and she comes over all the time to use mine until she gets her own.  I&#x27;m trying to convince my sister to give it a try next.  If I didn&#x27;t already own one I would definitely be purchasing one ASAP.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a promotion from the brand. It definitely takes some time getting used to the plucking. Your hair cant be long, but also not too short. Very scary when you first use it, but after using it at least once a week, you get use to it and its very easy to use. My hair grows in much slower now that the hair cuticles are damaged. I recommend this if you are use to epilators and are sick of any kind of leg,arm, back hair.</li>
    <li> ill never go back to shaving again</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I try this sooner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this on my legs and at first of course it was a tad bit painful but why wouldn&#x27;t it be your pulling out your hairs. After the first leg it didn&#x27;t really hurt at all, you get used to the feeling and it doesn&#x27;t end up hurting as much. I got tiny red bumps on my legs, i moisturized when I was done and by morning the bumps were gone. I have to shave often so if this item cut down on that then i was all for a little pain.&lt;br /&gt;The next week I had very few hairs growing back and my legs were still smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try under my arms, this area is much more sensitive but it beats shaving EVERY DAY!! I have been able to epilate about once a week under my arms and barely any hair growth which is soooo nice!! My underarms were a tad irritated but if I use this at night then put a moisturizing oil on they feel fine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried this on my upper lip and it works great no red bumps or irritation which was nice. I want to get a smaller one for my eyebrows and lip area but for now I am loving this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different ways to deal with hairy legs that, over time, I have given up and only remove the hair on my legs in summer or when there&#x27;s a special event that requires a dress in winter. I have sugared, waxed and shaved; each with its own benefits and difficulties.  I originally tried an epilator in the 1990s and that was simply Torture: painful and painstaking to make sure I got all the hair.  I figured there had to be improvements in epilators in the last 20 years and I was very surprised!  The Braun Silk-epil 9 arrived already charged and ready to go. The instructions are straight forward and easy to follow.  The more comfortable head is in place when it arrived.  The instruction to use the slower speed was followed; though I did not trim my year long growth on my legs, the Silk epil 9 did a fantastic job...Moving slowy, the wider head covers more area, so less turns up the leg.  I was finished in about 10 minutes for both legs. Even though my hair was longer, it removed it completely with surprisingly little discomfort.  There was a bit more pain on the inner thigh, but that was expected. There was also an itchy feeling immediately afterwards, but following the directions to use lotion afterwards, that resolved quickly.  The machine is easy to take apart and clean with the brush provided.  I did not try under water yet, but will likely do so another time.  Recharging  did not take but 15- 20 minutes. I am very pleased with this epilator, received from Braun through a BzzAgent campaign (thank you) and I would recommend to others.  I know a couple of friends are considering gettting it as they get tired of shaving, don&#x27;t like the mess of waxing and had not thought about trying an epilator until I told them about the Braun Silk-epil 9. I highly recommend it for efficient hair removal with less pain and longer regrowth time. I&#x27;ve included a photo of how long my hair was to start. ;)</li>
    <li> Works as described! Very happy with the product!</li>
