<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It holds eye-rashes perfectly until the time I want remove.</li>
      <li>One happy customer here that I found it on Amazon, thank you!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find the perfect mascara but not anymore C:</li>
      <li>Just perfect.  </li>
      <li>I have never found a better mascara and believe me I tried a lot of them!!!</li>
      <li>Good product vs price, and excellent shipment time</li>
      <li>Great color, didnt clump or run.</li>
      <li>That one was amazing!</li>
      <li>She told me she loved and uses MaxFactor.</li>
      <li>I LOVED it</li>
      <li>good seller and the product deffinately stays on</li>
      <li>Amazing product .</li>
      <li>And what I loved most was</li>
      <li>Put one very light coat on but it started to ring  my eyes before I even got out of the house.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m trying to buy at Amazon.com here :)</li>
      <li>After it drys It&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my eyelashes look,</li>
      <li>I love Max Factor, but this isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara of theirs.</li>
      <li>max factor mascara was my favorite</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>Not my favorite, but works fine.</li>
      <li>stuff has an incredible lasting power.</li>
      <li>Brush is huge, mascara clumpy</li>
      <li>I asked my friend who is a cosmotoglist if she could direct me to a good brand that was still affordable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it in waterproof since onions</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does give a nice look to the lashes if you apply the right amount, so I do like it for that, but I probably would not use this particular mascara as a staple.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny...</li>
      <li>However, to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>As with most new mascaras, there can be too much mascara on the brush.</li>
      <li>When I first moved to the UK I was using Maybelline mascara.</li>
      <li>It definitely requires make-up remover and even that can take some effort to remove most of the mascara.</li>
      <li>and you have the hot string</li>
      <li>I have tried many others and they just straighten my eye lashes back once applied.</li>
      <li>but as soon as I opened it, it was very webie, i could not even wear it because it would just be clumpy, it was just like when you use a hot glue gun</li>
      <li>I have rare fights with clumping and its normally my fault.</li>
      <li>I would not change this mascara for anything...it really gives the eyelashes</li>
      <li>, If I have a formal event I often combine the two (False Lash first, then I take it up a notch with Masterpiece to get even more length)</li>
      <li>Been using this amazing mascara for years, which normally in the UK can easily be bought in the stores but unfortunately have to now buy it online at a more expensive price as it is shipped from Europe and cannot find it in the States.</li>
      <li>Long, thick, and amazing.</li>
      <li>I am British but now live in the USA.</li>
      <li>As soon as I tried False Lash, I fell in love.</li>

<li> As soon as I tried False Lash, I fell in love.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t get a long</li>
<li> it destroys makeup above and down the eye smears everywhere like ink totally waist of money</li>
<li> The only other mascara I use is Max Factor&#x27;s MasterpieceMAX</li>
<li> After a trying many different ones I was frustrated.</li>
<li> But thats the only down side.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known it would come loose; not even in a package!</li>
<li> That being said, It is harder to get off.</li>
<li> well i gave it four stars because it is a little dry and goes on clumpy if your not careful and is a little hard to start over</li>
<li> Now, I have been using it for awhile, but I still feel as if the brush is coming away with too much mascara, which makes it difficult to obtain defined lashes, unless you want defined bunches.</li>
<li> THE mascara WAS gooey AND stringed OUT when YOU went TO put it on :(...AND would SMEAR really EASILY.</li>
<li> I got caught in heavy rain the other night without an umbrella, it stayed!</li>
<li> I was frustrated, so I tried to go back to my old mascara...</li>
<li> When I ran out I had to change since the masacara I was using was not available in the UK.</li>
<li> but it is heavy on the lashes and needs to be combed through a few times before it is evenly distributed on my lashes</li>
<li> but when i got this, I&#x27;m not sure if it was defective</li>
<li> Getting this stuff in my eyes is incredibly irritating if I don&#x27;t manage to catch all the bits that snuck into my eyes or tears ducts before I put my contacts in.&lt;br</li>
<li> I no longer have to fuss with false lashes for those events.</li>
<li> that false lash effect...</li>
<li> (but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t).</li>
<li> and I hate having mascara run when I&#x27;m cutting them.</li>
<li> I wish that Max Factor was still around :(  </li>
<li> I was 100% disappointed with this product</li>
<li> I hated it.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> So sad they don&#x27;t make it anymore!!!</li>
<li> This is a terrible product.  </li>
<li> , it was terrible</li>

    <li> I was 100% disappointed with this product it did not come close to what it is advertised at. Was also concerned about recieving it not in package..</li>
    <li> Great color, didnt clump or run.</li>
    <li> When I first moved to the UK I was using Maybelline mascara. When I ran out I had to change since the masacara I was using was not available in the UK. After a trying many different ones I was frustrated. I asked my friend who is a cosmotoglist if she could direct me to a good brand that was still affordable. She told me she loved and uses MaxFactor. As soon as I tried False Lash, I fell in love. And what I loved most was I knew (or so I thought) I could get it in America too when I was home on visits. I was ecstatic. I have since moved back to the US and found that MaxFactor is no longer sold in stores here. I was frustrated, so I tried to go back to my old mascara...I hated it. So, I came to Amazon to buy it online. I&#x27;m excited to try it in waterproof since onions and I don&#x27;t get a long and I hate having mascara run when I&#x27;m cutting them. I love the way this makes my eyelashes look, Long, thick, and amazing. It lasts all day. I have rare fights with clumping and its normally my fault. The only other mascara I use is Max Factor&#x27;s MasterpieceMAX, If I have a formal event I often combine the two (False Lash first, then I take it up a notch with Masterpiece to get even more length) I no longer have to fuss with false lashes for those events. Lasts all night, and I have lashes giraffes would be jealous of.  Update since trying the waterproof: I can cut onions without my mascara running or cry in films like the sap that I am without it getting everywhere. I got caught in heavy rain the other night without an umbrella, it stayed! Didn&#x27;t even need to reapply. That being said, It is harder to get off. But thats the only down side.</li>
    <li> Gets clumpy. Would not want to use it again.</li>
    <li> good seller and the product deffinately stays on well i gave it four stars because it is a little dry and goes on clumpy if your not careful and is a little hard to start over but i like because it stays on</li>
    <li> THE mascara WAS gooey AND stringed OUT when YOU went TO put it on :(...AND would SMEAR really EASILY. it DID HOWEVER arrive PROMPTLY</li>
    <li> Just perfect.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Not my favorite, but works fine.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known it would come loose; not even in a package!</li>
    <li> I would not change this mascara for anything...it really gives the eyelashes that false lash effect...I love it...Its worth every penny...I&#x27;ve struggled to find the perfect mascara but not anymore C:</li>
    <li> I am British but now live in the USA. Been using this amazing mascara for years, which normally in the UK can easily be bought in the stores but unfortunately have to now buy it online at a more expensive price as it is shipped from Europe and cannot find it in the States. However, to me it&#x27;s worth it. I curl my eyelashes and this mascara is the only one that holds the curl. I have tried many others and they just straighten my eye lashes back once applied. One happy customer here that I found it on Amazon, thank you!</li>
    <li> it destroys makeup above and down the eye smears everywhere like ink totally waist of money</li>
    <li> I love Max Factor, but this isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara of theirs. As with most new mascaras, there can be too much mascara on the brush. Now, I have been using it for awhile, but I still feel as if the brush is coming away with too much mascara, which makes it difficult to obtain defined lashes, unless you want defined bunches. I&#x27;ve been making a point to get rid of excess before applying it, which works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has an incredible lasting power. I have washed my face with soap and water and it still stays on. It definitely requires make-up remover and even that can take some effort to remove most of the mascara. The only problem I have with the staying power is that sometimes in the morning and/or after I wash my face, I have a residue of mascara &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; around my eyes that I need to wipe off. Overall, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but I wear contacts. Getting this stuff in my eyes is incredibly irritating if I don&#x27;t manage to catch all the bits that snuck into my eyes or tears ducts before I put my contacts in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a nice look to the lashes if you apply the right amount, so I do like it for that, but I probably would not use this particular mascara as a staple.</li>
    <li> Amazing product . My lashes looks really bigger</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it here, but bought it at offline store. I LOVED it so much!&lt;br /&gt;It holds eye-rashes perfectly until the time I want remove. So I&#x27;m trying to buy at Amazon.com here :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  Would never recommend it to anyone.  Put one very light coat on but it started to ring  my eyes before I even got out of the house.  Was clumpy. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product vs price, and excellent shipment time</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara for the length but I found the consistency too sticky/gloopy. I would not buy it again. There is, however, a max factor mascara that my friend had and I thought this was the same one (but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t). That one was amazing!</li>
    <li> Brush is huge, mascara clumpy</li>
    <li> max factor mascara was my favorite but when i got this, I&#x27;m not sure if it was defective but as soon as I opened it, it was very webie, i could not even wear it because it would just be clumpy, it was just like when you use a hot glue gun and you have the hot string, it was terrible it was just a waiste of money</li>
    <li> When you apply this mascara, it smears everywhere. After it drys It&#x27;s OK I guess,  but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I wish that Max Factor was still around :(  I have never found a better mascara and believe me I tried a lot of them!!! Nothing compares to this mascara!!! So sad they don&#x27;t make it anymore!!!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara but it is heavy on the lashes and needs to be combed through a few times before it is evenly distributed on my lashes</li>
