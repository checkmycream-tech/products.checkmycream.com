      <li>A little goes a long way with this body wash, so you definitely do not have to use a lot to get a good lather.</li>
      <li>soft &amp; feminine.</li>
      <li>This is nice since the body wash is on the expensive side, so atleast its going to last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> so it leaves very little fragrance on the skin - almost none.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product, you wont be disappointed.</li>
<li> IT&#x27;s a little expensive to wear every day</li>
<li> We all deserve to treat outselves from time to time and not feel guilty.  </li>

    <li> Thymes has the most true to life scents and their body wash is luxurious. You need only a small amount to cover your entire body. This particular scent is sensual- it does not smell like a typcial rose scen as its other fragrance hues come through making for an exotic feminine smell that isn&#x27;t too floral, too girlie, or too mature. I enjoy the lotion and body wash best- with that combo you rarely need the perfume as it has a lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I love the Thymes company. They produce wonderfully fragrant, high quality soaps and room sprays for the home. This Kimono Rose body wash is in an attractive bottle. The soap has a great delicate scent. Not overpowering, but pleasant to use. It is not inexpensive, but for a high-end liquid soap, you won&#x27;t find one any better.</li>
    <li> the scent is wonderful. soft &amp; feminine. nice for every day, &amp; adds subtle sexiness to evenings.</li>

    <li> concerning that the bottle had been altered - however the product seems to be what I was looking for and I really like the product.</li>
    <li> When my favorite drug store stopped carrying this exceptional Thyme&#x27;s product, I found if on Amazon. This is a product that lightly scents the body on days when you might not want to wear any perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> Again, a wonderful scent and so nice to use.  The scent is milder on my skin and last all day, without drying it out.  And my bathroom smells &amp;#34;ooo-lalala&amp;#34; for several hours afterwards</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents in body wash and lotion.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrant wash.</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to a lovely Rose fragrance.......still using it up but find very little fragrance!
