<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> hate that I have to say I have to use this but I do and it is very good product</li>
    <li> We like the this product, and we&#x27;re not smokers.  Polident&lt;br /&gt;Smokers cleans tea and coffee stains better than any&lt;br /&gt;other denture cleaner we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product does an amazing job. I use it overnight. Cleans perfectly and smells great I have been using this product for years but I can&#x27;t find it at local retIlers</li>
    <li> Overpriced for the results. I purchased for my mother&#x27;s coffee stained dentures. Have used for nearly two years now and so far the stains are still there.</li>
    <li> Great for my family who wears dentures and smokes. For months my sister tried to find a denture cleanser that would clean her dentures because she loves to smoke. No she can enjoy smoking knowing that Polident has made a cleanser she can be proud to use.</li>
    <li> Polident Smokers is great for anyone with dentures.  It cleans great, smells wonderful.  It makes your dentures lool like new.</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner I&#x27;ve found. Really helps decrease the negative impact smoking can have on the dentures. Also effective in removing coffee stains. This is the only cleaner I use.</li>
    <li> This denture cleanser works . . .removes all types of stains,  blue berries, etc. It cleans rapidly enough and it&#x27;s not abrasive.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else I can say that I didn&#x27;t say in the subject line...does what it is supposed to do, although I add a little bleach per my dentist&#x27;s suggestion</li>
    <li> Quite frankly, I had forgotten the the &#x27;for smokers&#x27; aspect of this while quickly putting an order of items in some weeks back. I am a smoker, however--and don&#x27;t notice any difference in this versus the regular Polident tablets.  That&#x27;s probably because I use a brush on my dentures every morning, after thoroughly rinsing off cleanser residue anyway--just because I don&#x27;t like any slimy feeling on my dentures at the start of my day.  I do like it...and the 84-count means fewer mail orders.</li>
    <li> love itcoming in bymail get more for less money.</li>
    <li> If you do this gets rid of the stain all of them coffee too.I would recommend to everyone smoke or not|</li>
    <li> good product, but I really do not notice any difference in the regular vs smokers versions as far as cleaning.? I will buy again</li>

    <li> Great Product, Great Value, Fast shipping. Thank YOU  A++</li>
    <li> Was what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;jan</li>
    <li> Over several years and trial and error with several Denture Cleaners I&#x27;ve found that Polident Smokers Cleanser really does the best and fastest job of cleaning.  I don&#x27;t just use it for cleaning my dentures however,  I also use it to clean the coffee stains which are unavoidable in a glass coffee maker caraffe.  I fill the pot with hot water (run a caraffe of water through the coffee maker to heat), then I drop in a couple of Polident tablets and within a short time I have a sparking clean glass caraffe.</li>

    <li> I use this for my retainers and it works like a charm. There are just certain things that a toothbrush can&#x27;t clean so this will do the job!</li>
    <li> This works.  No yellow stains for me ..... : - )  Been using this since it came on the market,  used another for a bit .... came back I came!</li>
    <li> I have use Polident products for many years and I shall continue until the teeth are no longer need, I suppose that would mean that I no longer will be in need of and solid food!</li>
    <li> Good cleaner for dentures.  Have used it for years.</li>
