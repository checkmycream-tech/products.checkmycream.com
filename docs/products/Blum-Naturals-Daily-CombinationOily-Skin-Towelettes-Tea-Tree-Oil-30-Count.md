      <li>It smells delightful and takes off all of my makeup; the natural way.</li>

      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Worth a try and a good value for the price</li>
      <li>I have many friends that have started using them as well.  </li>
      <li>I already have a face wash that I love</li>
      <li>knew the first time I tried one that this was going to be a good thing.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty nice refreshing wipes.</li>
      <li>The wipes work great if you use natural makeup</li>
      <li>I was more excited to have a makeup remover wipe to use.</li>
      <li>Smells good and is decently priced.</li>
      <li>They make it so quick and easy to clean your face!</li>
      <li>The thick towelletts are great and the scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It kind of just smudged around my eyeliner rather than really REMOVING it.</li>
      <li>oh my gosh they&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
      <li>I just bought these for a good price and was super excited to try them out since they&#x27;re all natural and aren&#x27;t tested on animals!</li>
      <li>These clean well and are astringent.</li>
      <li>These make my skin feel somewhat clean.</li>
      <li>Natural is better!</li>
      <li>So what to do in between showers and eye cleansing with special cleaning solutions ... that can be a challenge.  </li>
      <li>These wipes clean my combination skin well, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can.</li>
      <li>I fight blepharitis all the time and also have bouts of rosacea (face and neck turn bright red).  </li>
      <li>Not cleaner than a citrus-based face wipe but good enough.</li>
      <li>I really like these Blum Naturals a lot better than even the Yes to Grapefruit or the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a clean, fresh tea tree oil smell.</li>
      <li>These are super convenient.  </li>
      <li>My face is the type that gets super shiny and oily an hour or two after washing it.</li>
      <li>These are the wife&#x27;s favorite face wipes after trying many different brands and types.</li>
      <li>There was not a noticeable amount of Tea Tree Oil in them to do an adequate job.</li>
      <li>Being pregnant, I can&#x27;t use products containing salicylic acid, which these wipes DO CONTAIN.  </li>
      <li>These are great  -- and can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower.</li>
      <li>but these facial wipes are very refreshing</li>
      <li>They do not contain many of the harmful ingredients found in other face wipes, but are just as effective.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are a natural option for cleansing, and I use them post workout!</li>
      <li>It has a very light natural tea tree oil smell.  </li>
      <li>These wipes are more for if you don&#x27;t want to completely strip all the oil off your skin, which could be good for some as your skin tends to produce more oil than usual when that happens.</li>
      <li>Easy and healthy and good for you, even when you&#x27;re tired.</li>
      <li>I purchased these makeup wipes thinking they were all natural (they recieved a great rating on the Skin Deep Database).  </li>
      <li>What I like the most about the wipes is that the cloth is soft and contains an ingredient to prevent breakouts.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
      <li>If you use a moisturizer, you can put it right on after using the cloth.first place and toss it.  </li>
      <li>Soft, feels clean and fresh with no need to rinse off after using them, and the smell doesn&#x27;t punch you in the nose.</li>
      <li>That would be ok if they double the number in the pack.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely L-O-V-E these towelettes!</li>
      <li>These wipes are highly recommended!!  </li>
      <li>I really like these!  </li>
      <li>seriously love them and am going to try the orange peel ones next!</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>I wipe my eyes first around the rim of the lashes and the rest of the face and neck.  </li>
      <li>my face always feels clean and clear.</li>
      <li>And being able to keep one side clean and moist for later makes frequent use very inexpensive..  </li>
      <li>Keeping the eyelids super clean is crucial in fighting blepharitis.  </li>
      <li>It pretty much gets all my makeup off.</li>
      <li>These have by far been the best facial wipes that I have  tried, but still prefer to use facial soap and water over facial wipes.</li>
      <li>I love how it&#x27;s packaged so that the towelettes won&#x27;t dry up.</li>
      <li>The amount of chemicals, parabens, etc in all these facial products couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for your skin in the long run.</li>
      <li>But the large size they are now is a plus.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, and they certainly didn&#x27;t do everything I use Tea Tree Oil for (excess oil + toning).  </li>
      <li>These are nicely moistened and of heavy towelette quality, and quite large.</li>
      <li>so this was much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I bought it from GNC and wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
      <li>I really really like these, but they don&#x27;t do a deep clean and they don&#x27;t exfoliate.</li>
      <li>But that isn&#x27;t necessary if you just want to clean your eyelids and freshen up.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m also pretty lazy taking off my makeup at night, so I wanted something easy and natural to help keep my face clean.</li>
      <li>The SD database does not list this as an ingredient, so if you are pregnant, I definitely would not recommend purchasing.  </li>
      <li>But I do think they are a &amp;#34;find.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend them for sensitive skin and eyes that need frequent cleansing without having to do the whole soap and water thing at the sink.</li>
      <li>Well, probably more than anyone wanted to know about these little things!  </li>
      <li>Also, they are kinda small and more</li>
      <li>I love these on nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to take off my makeup or going to/from a workout.  </li>
      <li>Contains salicylic acid (derived from nature, not sure what that means :)  and tea tree oil as a bonus..</li>
      <li>also considering there are 30 wipes, the price is better than I see in the drugstores for other facial wipes...</li>
      <li>I love these wipes for lazy nights when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my face.</li>
      <li>They clean without feeling sticky or slimy, which I&#x27;ve found to be the case with a lot of the other towelettes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I wake up really early for work</li>
      <li>These work wonderfully on my sensitive combination skin.</li>
      <li>They are convenient, and the ingredients are natural.</li>
      <li>Whole Foods used to carry them, but not anymore, and neither do any of the local pharmacies/shops.</li>
      <li>Thankfully they don&#x27;t hurt like a towel does, but, I think I&#x27;m going to try another brand of natural makeup remover wipes once I finish off these ones.</li>
      <li>After that I wash my face with the olay pro x brush (clarisonic dupe) and use all natural witch hazel as a toner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really disappointed with this product it hardly removes any makeup! will not re purchase</li>
    <li> Favorite face wipe - my face always feels clean and clear.</li>
    <li> These are nicely moistened and of heavy towelette quality, and quite large. In comparison to other brand I have bought, I will definitely buy these again. I love that they are a natural option for cleansing, and I use them post workout!</li>
    <li> I will be ordering this product again. It smells delightful and takes off all of my makeup; the natural way. I love it!</li>
    <li> Go-to product after the urban insults of pollution, dirt, extreme temperatures, and the occasional sleep loss busy lives can&#x27;t always avoid. Easy and healthy and good for you, even when you&#x27;re tired. And who needs more harmful chemicals, so thank the angels assigned to city girls for ORGANIC. May continue to buy these for the rest of my life. Unless maybe zombie apocalypse.</li>
    <li> I bought Blum&#x27;s facial cloth to try them on my combination oily skin.  Usually I use them in the morning to refresh my face before putting make up on.  The thick towelletts are great and the scent is light and pleasant.  I got them cheaper at Marshall&#x27;s but I will buy them here since haven&#x27;t seen them in the area drug store.</li>
    <li> My teenager uses this every day and it really seems to make a big difference with her break outs.</li>
    <li> I purchased these makeup wipes thinking they were all natural (they recieved a great rating on the Skin Deep Database).  Being pregnant, I can&#x27;t use products containing salicylic acid, which these wipes DO CONTAIN.  The SD database does not list this as an ingredient, so if you are pregnant, I definitely would not recommend purchasing.  I can&#x27;t attest to how well they work, since I have not tried them yet.</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout, but it did smell good and it felt refreshing just wasn&#x27;t great for me</li>
    <li> I love these! They remove most of my makeup before I wash my face, plus they smell nice and are soothing :)</li>
    <li> Not really a fan of the smell but these facial wipes are very refreshing</li>
    <li> These wipes are great.  I was looking for something with few ingredients to just clean my skin at night, as I tend to be too lazy to wash my face. I remove my eye makeup with the wipes too, but its prob better to take off eye makeup first as these are not best option for removing eye makeup.  These are perfect for my oily acne prone skin. Contains salicylic acid (derived from nature, not sure what that means :)  and tea tree oil as a bonus..It smells like the tea tree oil,fresh and they are a big, thick wipe...also considering there are 30 wipes, the price is better than I see in the drugstores for other facial wipes...If you&#x27;re in Canada, you can find them at Winners...seriously love them and am going to try the orange peel ones next!</li>
    <li> These make my skin feel somewhat clean. Not cleaner than a citrus-based face wipe but good enough. These wipes are more for if you don&#x27;t want to completely strip all the oil off your skin, which could be good for some as your skin tends to produce more oil than usual when that happens. Smells good and is decently priced. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t remove mascara very well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely L-O-V-E these towelettes! Lately Ive been trying to use only use products with natural ingredients. The amount of chemicals, parabens, etc in all these facial products couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for your skin in the long run. Natural is better! I read the reviews on amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I bought it from GNC and wasn&#x27;t expecting much but oh my gosh they&#x27;re fantastic. My face is the type that gets super shiny and oily an hour or two after washing it. When I get home I wipe my face with these before I hop in the shower and wash my face. It pretty much gets all my makeup off. After that I wash my face with the olay pro x brush (clarisonic dupe) and use all natural witch hazel as a toner. I love how it&#x27;s packaged so that the towelettes won&#x27;t dry up. Overall it&#x27;s a great product. I will continue to use it as long as they make it. I definitely recommend this if you have oily skin and want a natural product to use!</li>
    <li> After having tried other products for occasional eye and face cleansing, I didn&#x27;t expect the positive experience I have had with this product.  I fight blepharitis all the time and also have bouts of rosacea (face and neck turn bright red).  I can&#x27;t wear eye makeup because of eye sensitivity.  Keeping the eyelids super clean is crucial in fighting blepharitis.  Special eye wipes for this condition are very expensive.  So what to do in between showers and eye cleansing with special cleaning solutions ... that can be a challenge.  I&#x27;d read that tea tree oil was good for some kinds of blepharitis (maybe all, I don&#x27;t know), so I thought I&#x27;d give these little cloths a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the first time I tried one that this was going to be a good thing.  There is a slight fragrance, but it is not perfumey.  It has a very light natural tea tree oil smell.  The cloths are plenty large enough, about the size of a baby wash cloth, and they are very moist, almost wet.  I wipe my eyes first around the rim of the lashes and the rest of the face and neck.  No irritation whatsoever!  No drying!  No residual oiliness.  If you use a moisturizer, you can put it right on after using the cloth.first place and toss it.  But that isn&#x27;t necessary if you just want to clean your eyelids and freshen up.  I hope the company doesn&#x27;t figure this out and start making them smaller!  That would be ok if they double the number in the pack.  But the large size they are now is a plus.  And being able to keep one side clean and moist for later makes frequent use very inexpensive..  Well, probably more than anyone wanted to know about these little things!  But I do think they are a &amp;#34;find.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend them for sensitive skin and eyes that need frequent cleansing without having to do the whole soap and water thing at the sink.</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully on my sensitive combination skin. I use them pretty much every night because I am far too lazy to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and use running water and a washcloth. Environment be dammed, my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I really really like these, but they don&#x27;t do a deep clean and they don&#x27;t exfoliate. In a pinch, it&#x27;s fine to use them for a night&#x27;s cleaning, but I found that when I started getting lazy and ONLY using these (they are so convenient!), my acne started coming back. So use sparingly, but do use these! They are great!</li>
    <li> I am just too lazy to buy these. If I have them I use them every night, instead of washing my face properly, and I just can&#x27;t justify the expense. Also, they are kinda small and more the once I used two to get all my makeup off. Sigh. For this price, there should be 90, not 30, in a package.</li>
    <li> The wipes work great if you use natural makeup, otherwise the chemical based makeup will feel like you are rubbing it hopelessly all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What I like the most about the wipes is that the cloth is soft and contains an ingredient to prevent breakouts. The smell is pleasant and not too strong. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are the wife&#x27;s favorite face wipes after trying many different brands and types. She uses one a day of the pink and green ones. She said she slightly prefers the green, but we get one of each a month on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice refreshing wipes. I sometimes take them while traveling to refresh my face.</li>
    <li> These wipes clean my combination skin well, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can. They make it so quick and easy to clean your face! These are great  -- and can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower. Sometimes my sensitive skin gets red or breaks out from products, but I have had no problems with these wipes, with occasional use. The scent is a clean, fresh tea tree oil smell. They are made in Israel. These wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. These wipes are highly recommended!!  The Yes to Cucumber face wipes have a refreshing cucumber scent, while the Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent and are also worth considering. If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
    <li> These clean well and are astringent. Gets all that excess oil out and the tea tree oil kills the germs!</li>
    <li> I love these. They clean without feeling sticky or slimy, which I&#x27;ve found to be the case with a lot of the other towelettes I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t have a crazy smell, either. I wish they were easier to get - Whole Foods used to carry them, but not anymore, and neither do any of the local pharmacies/shops.</li>
    <li> Removes all of my make-up, does not dry my skin and keeps the oil at bay. So great you don&#x27;t even need to wash your face with soap.</li>
    <li> These are good and seem to clean and remove sunscreen, makeup, etc. quite well without leaving an unwelcome residue. The critical thing is that while they clean well, they don&#x27;t seem irritating at all. Valuable combination.</li>
    <li> These work great!  They will remove makeup easily without irritating your skin.  They do not contain many of the harmful ingredients found in other face wipes, but are just as effective.  I have many friends that have started using them as well.  They are part of my monthly subscription, because I can&#x27;t imagine not having them with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> I use these wipes when I go on vacation especially when I go camping or hiking. These have by far been the best facial wipes that I have  tried, but still prefer to use facial soap and water over facial wipes.</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift off of my wishlist for two years in a row now. I wake up really early for work and I&#x27;m also pretty lazy taking off my makeup at night, so I wanted something easy and natural to help keep my face clean. Other types of wipes that were even naturally derived made me break out or I still felt like I needed to rinse off my face after using them. But these are the pinnacle of awesome. Soft, feels clean and fresh with no need to rinse off after using them, and the smell doesn&#x27;t punch you in the nose. I&#x27;m definitely going to get these as long as they make them and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out other Blum products.</li>
    <li> My very thoughtful girlfriend got these for me at the store, because she knows I use Tea Tree Oil on my face.  She was sweet, but these are horrible.  They didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, and they certainly didn&#x27;t do everything I use Tea Tree Oil for (excess oil + toning).  Instead, these are just not-very-good-cleansing, non-gentle, non-soothing, expensive cloths with a TERRIBLE smell.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to Tea Tree Oil- in fact, I think I&#x27;ve grown to like it- these don&#x27;t smell anything like Tea Tree.  Just bad.</li>
    <li> Purchased to help with Blepharitis. To use as an eye lid scrub. Brand name cost $43.00 so this was much cheaper. Can smell the Tea Tree but did not help. Worth a try and a good value for the price</li>
    <li> These are super convenient.  I wish they sold the cleanser that is on these on its own.  I love these on nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to take off my makeup or going to/from a workout.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes for lazy nights when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my face. Even though they have tea tree oil, they aren&#x27;t irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They are convenient, and the ingredients are natural. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I just bought these for a good price and was super excited to try them out since they&#x27;re all natural and aren&#x27;t tested on animals! I already have a face wash that I love so I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking for something to get oil off of my face or anything. I was more excited to have a makeup remover wipe to use. Sadly, these are extremely poor at removing makeup. It kind of just smudged around my eyeliner rather than really REMOVING it. It had the same effect as if you were to remove your makeup with a towel. It smudges around, removes makeup slightly, but mostly just gives you annoying halfway-gone makeup streaks everywhere.Thankfully they don&#x27;t hurt like a towel does, but, I think I&#x27;m going to try another brand of natural makeup remover wipes once I finish off these ones.</li>
    <li> I really like these!  I really hate washing my face in the sink, and so in between showers I typically use whatever face cleansing wipes are on sale at the drug store.  I really like these Blum Naturals a lot better than even the Yes to Grapefruit or the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones.  Other cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve used in the past have dried out my skin or left behind a residue, but these don&#x27;t and leave my skin feeling clean.  My only complaint is their hard to describe smell, which I don&#x27;t find overly offensive, but I don&#x27;t care for.  At least the smell dissipates quickly. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> Wipes were dry and did not last long at all. There was not a noticeable amount of Tea Tree Oil in them to do an adequate job. Disappointed.</li>
