      <li>I&#x27;ve been a user for many years  </li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My gums seem to be the better for it.</li>
      <li>Mentadent seems to keep our teeth smoother than most brands.</li>
      <li>Getting them at a descent price, that&#x27;s worth a good search on Amazon, though.</li>
      <li>my husband &amp; I love it</li>
      <li>keeps teeth in tip top shape.</li>
      <li>Just love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad we purchased in bulk because we saved quite a bit of money this time.</li>
      <li>I love Mentadent toothpaste - it has baking soda and peroxide in it, to kill bacteria under the gums.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Mentadent for many years.  </li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased with Mentadent</li>
      <li>Love the stuff and can not get it in Brazil, so I have friends that visit, they brush teeth a lot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using Mentadent</li>
      <li>My family&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love the way it foams up and gives a very clean feeling</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is fine, as most are.</li>
      <li>The twin refills are nice and the price was right.</li>
      <li>The convenience of being able to buy multiple refills at once is a great time saver for me.</li>
      <li>Great product, increasingly available only online.</li>
      <li>I hope it will continue to be available.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
      <li>Makes my mouth feel so fresh and inimitably clean!</li>
      <li>I love the dispenser, which is what drew me to the brand in the first place.</li>
      <li>Love the easy dispenser and my teeth are peraly white.  </li>
      <li>Once that was accomplished, all was fine.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Chicago area, and you would think that this is an easy product to find, but not always.  </li>
      <li>This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive!</li>
      <li>It is a great toothpaste and real convenient to use in the pump(less mess).</li>
      <li>this product is hard to find great value</li>
      <li>The best part is that I don&#x27;t get any weird after taste in my mouth after I am done brushing.</li>
      <li>The product has kept my teeth healthy over these past many years.  </li>
      <li>I hope the rest aren&#x27;t like the first.</li>
      <li>So, since I know it is exactly what I want</li>
      <li>I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find locally but I feel it is the best product.</li>
      <li>(  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste</li>
      <li>This is the only one that leaves my mouth free from pain.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Prime, the shipping is taken care of.  </li>
      <li>The Mentadent Toothpaste refills were received very timely and as described</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpast.</li>
      <li>Used M for years -- even though the mixture is thinner and now use up a refill twice as fast -it</li>
      <li>The delivery system is good in concept, but appears to have quality control issues:  Only one of 3 refills, so far, has produced equal amounts from the two containers without a lot of manipulation on my part.</li>
      <li>My mouth hurts like I ate something I was allergic to after I use any other toothpaste, even the sensitive kind.  </li>
      <li>Mentadent does a slightly better job of whitening my teeth than other toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>I never feel as clean and fresh when I use other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this toothpaste as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&amp;S option for the Advanced Cleaning formula that they still carry.</li>
      <li>love this toothpaste and it is hard to find on the shelves anymore.....</li>
      <li>I wonder if we were sent OLD toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>They are old and have been opened.</li>
      <li>I also like that you can peel off the label and have a plain white dispenser, sans advertising!  :-)</li>
      <li>Since the density of the paste and gel are not the same, for the first 2-3 applications you only get the paste product until the two mixtures balance out.  </li>
      <li>When you first start a new tube, there is a slight problem.  </li>
      <li>I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on the Advanced Cleaning formula Mentadent that I had been buying from them for years.</li>
      <li>The same old problem returned.  </li>
      <li>&gt;:o</li>
      <li>Suddenlythey won&#x27;t even offer this formula of Mentadent at all? :o</li>
      <li>&gt;:o</li>
      <li>That is worth the little extra price.</li>
      <li>While the product is just as I expected, I was surprised by the volume that was apparently a part of the offer.</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned about it sitting out while being shipped or not being the real deal, but we didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a retired Dentist.  I have been using Mentadent for many years.  I think it does what a toothpaste should do and it does it neatly.  It should not leave a messy tube.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have noticed some products just don&#x27;t stay on the shelves.  Thank goodness for AMAZON, I thought I had Lost Mentadent forever. It is a great toothpaste and real convenient to use in the pump(less mess). Thank you AMAZON.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It mixes a paste and a gel by using a dispenser that pushes out the two parts onto your toothbrush.  When you first start a new tube, there is a slight problem.  Since the density of the paste and gel are not the same, for the first 2-3 applications you only get the paste product until the two mixtures balance out.  The product is excellent and has a very pleasant taste.  It is convenient and does not make a mess.  I will continue using this toothpaste as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> The twin refills are nice and the price was right. I always believed toothpaste was toothpaste. I have no complaints about Mentadent and like the convenience of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> Love the easy dispenser and my teeth are peraly white.  Been using this product for over a decade.  I sure hope they never use the word discontinued with my fav toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpast. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. The best part is that I don&#x27;t get any weird after taste in my mouth after I am done brushing. My teeth also look whiter from using it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> My dentist put me on to this toothpaste years ago.  My mouth hurts like I ate something I was allergic to after I use any other toothpaste, even the sensitive kind.  This is the only one that leaves my mouth free from pain.  It is also cheaper in bulk.  When the stores in our area stopped carrying this product I tried everything again.  The same old problem returned.  I was so happy that Amazon had this in bulk!</li>
    <li> I have looked all over our city and they seem to have just stopped selling it hear. So I got the idea of checking Amazon. I was very appreciative when I saw you carried them. It is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mentadent toothpaste for years now. I like the taste and my mouth feels very refreshing after brushing my teeth. I love the dispenser, which is what drew me to the brand in the first place. The only problem I have now is that I can only find the toothpaste on-line.</li>
    <li> We had to scrape out the beginning of the blue side, which was unusual because usually the blue comes out faster than the white.  Once that was accomplished, all was fine.  I wonder if we were sent OLD toothpastes.  We ordered several, as our local stores no longer seem to carry Metadent, and we like the product.  I hope the rest aren&#x27;t like the first.</li>
    <li> I love Mentadent toothpaste - it has baking soda and peroxide in it, to kill bacteria under the gums.  Does a good cleaning job.  It is difficult to find in local stores, so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon has made it convenient to obtain.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste we need!</li>
    <li> If you like Mentadent toothpaste, this is a very good deal to buy this 6 pack from Amazon. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using Mentadent and I&#x27;ve been searching this in the nearby stores and couldnt find it. Finally I was so happy to see this in Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> The Mentadent Toothpaste refills were received very timely and as described</li>
    <li> Wehave been using it for years and prefer it to all others.  I hope it will continue to be available.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find in the stores.  Great deal on the price, shipped quickly and in the mfg&#x27;s boxes.  Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I never feel as clean and fresh when I use other toothpastes. Mentadent is the way to go, the baking soda and fluoride toothpaste leave you with a very good clean. Getting them at a descent price, that&#x27;s worth a good search on Amazon, though.</li>
    <li> Please keep this in your warehouse my husband &amp; I love it We been using this since 1997. Our adult children are amazed that we haven&#x27;t switched to other cheaper toothpate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and continue to appreciate it. I usually can only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste and it is hard to find on the shelves anymore.....</li>
    <li> I have used Mentadent ever since it came on the market. I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product. I always thought that it was doing a great job cleaning and protecting my teeth and eliminating tartar, and my feelings were validated when my dentist asked me \\&quot;How come you don&#x27;t have any tartar this time??\\&quot; (I had been using Mentadent for approx. 8 months at that point)  I told him what I was using and he just sort of nodded and said \\&quot;well, something is working!\\&quot;  At my next checkup it was the same story---little to no tartar! He could not believe it and remarked that it was also whitening my teeth---1 shade whiter in about a year of use! (Mentadent contains peroxide)  A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  I could not be more pleased with Mentadent and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!  I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.  I have stocked up from Amazon (bought 18 refills in May 2011) and will continue to do so at every  opportunity as I dont&#x27; ever want to do with out my Mentadent.  :o)    UPDATE - MAY 2011: I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on the Advanced Cleaning formula Mentadent that I had been buying from them for years. &gt;:o(  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price.

    <li> Used M for years -- even though the mixture is thinner and now use up a refill twice as fast -it by far is the best on the market.  Wil buy as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste but it is getting harder to find it in local stores.  Thank you Amazon for carrying it.  Thanks to Prime, the shipping is taken care of.  Stocked up so I don&#x27;t have to hunt it down for a while.</li>
    <li> i swear by this product. keeps teeth in tip top shape. im 50 and no cavities in 7 years.</li>
    <li> I order this toothpaste a few weeks ago and just opened it. They are old and have been opened. I throw all of them away. I could not even use them. Waste of money will never order toothpaste online again. Otherwise this thoothpaste is a great one. But buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> I live in the Chicago area, and you would think that this is an easy product to find, but not always.  So, since I know it is exactly what I want, I order it from Amazon.  Why run around from store to store to hope to find what you want?!</li>
    <li> The convenience of being able to buy multiple refills at once is a great time saver for me.</li>
    <li> Mentadent does a slightly better job of whitening my teeth than other toothpastes.  The delivery system is good in concept, but appears to have quality control issues:  Only one of 3 refills, so far, has produced equal amounts from the two containers without a lot of manipulation on my part.</li>
    <li> Mentadent toothpaste is very hard to find in retail outlets anymore.  I like the fact that I can just purchase the refills and can reuse the pump.</li>
    <li> My family&#x27;s favorite toothpaste. Lately can&#x27;t find it in pharmacies, thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Get this on Amazon as we can no longer find it in the stores.  It is convenient, tastes good and what we need for healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years &amp; am very pleased.  the package arrived as described.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste combo available!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Can&#x27;t find locally</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is fine, as most are. The great thing about mentadent is the dispenser. There is only one way to get the toothpaste out, so no more fights over tube squeezing. That is worth the little extra price. I also like that you can peel off the label and have a plain white dispenser, sans advertising!  :-)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think of stopping to make this product, I have loved it since trying it some many years ago now and my girlfriend also loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve used Mentadent for years but it is increasingly hard to find at local stores.  Makes my mouth feel so fresh and inimitably clean!</li>

    <li> The product has kept my teeth healthy over these past many years.  It is hard to find locally but I feel it is the best product.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I will use and I am a dentist...I love the way it foams up and gives a very clean feeling</li>
    <li> Same as in the store except less expensive.  Delivery was fast.  Four boxes each with two refills &#x3D; 8 individual refills &#x3D; savings.</li>
    <li> We have used this toothpaste for years and always great checkups with the dentist!  I was very disappointed when my local stores stopped carrying it.  The best toothpaste I know.</li>

    <li> Great product, increasingly available only online.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. This the only place to order it, and it arrived timely and packaged well. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Mentadent seems to keep our teeth smoother than most brands. We have less plaque when we use this regularly. I don&#x27;t know about the whitening part, but even being tea and coffee drinkers, our teeth are not stained.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I were very happy after ordering this product online. We have used Mentadent toothpaste for quite some time so we were already fans, but we had never ordered it from an online retailer. We probably wouldn&#x27;t have, but for some reason we have had quite a difficult time finding it in the normal drugstores and grocery stores now. I was a little concerned about it sitting out while being shipped or not being the real deal, but we didn&#x27;t have any issues. I&#x27;m glad we purchased in bulk because we saved quite a bit of money this time.</li>
    <li> Just love this product. If I don&#x27;t use it for a week my gums get infected. I&#x27;ve been a user for many years  thank you AMAZON for offering it on the web</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Mentadent the toothpaste I prefer. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> Love the stuff and can not get it in Brazil, so I have friends that visit, they brush teeth a lot.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste we have used for years.  It has become harder and harder to find so we stocked up.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t use any other!</li>
