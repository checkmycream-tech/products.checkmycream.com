<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> see no difference from mascara half the price</li>
    <li> Using this in conjunction with GrandeLash serum. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this.  It&#x27;s a nice mascara to use as a base.</li>
    <li> I used the enhancer first, then the mascara.  My lashes grew so long, the look like false ones..... I was so happy</li>
    <li> Great.  thickens without clumping.</li>
    <li> After using this mascara, I no longer use the lash lengthening products for night use.  Really love this product.</li>
    <li> Not doing much for my lashes....</li>
    <li> I usually wear waterproof mascara and was a little leery of this mascara since it is not waterproof.  However, it stays on really well and is not flaky.  I have very oily skin and usually end up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  I can wear this mascara all day long including sessions at the gym and not have it come off.  It washes off easily with soap/cleanser and water.  It does everything that mascara is supposed to do-lengthens, darkens, and plumps the lashes.  I really like it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is great and well worth the price. Has lasted a long time and is healthy for my lashes.</li>
    <li> Delivery was late but Received item as described. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I finally have eyelashes people can see.  Sometimes people will think they are extensions.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyelashes look absolutely beautiful !</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Happy customer!</li>
    <li> glamorous and priced right!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive for what I would consider average mascara. Loreal makes a better product. Going back to my tried and true 7.50$ mascara.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. Not sure it is worth the price. The Grande Lash enhancer is a much better option</li>
    <li> Started getting clumpy on the brush after a couple of weeks using it, but it still looks really great on!</li>
    <li> This product is a great addition to the eyelash growth product.</li>
    <li> This product not only was delivered extremely quick in lovely packaging, but is SIMPLY AMAZING and I will continue to order among other items!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty average mascara.  It does smudge a little after a long day.  The volume and length achieved are average, but it is supposed to help with lash growth, so you can overlook that a little.  My best results are to use one coat of this on bare lashes and then finish with another coat or two of your favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> Been using this mascara for a couple years now and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for many years for a mascara that really colors, separates and difines my lashes - and this one did the trick!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara as it accents my natural lashes and seems to add fullness.  I&#x27;m using it with the lash booster serum (every other night because it can irritate my lids), and I saw better results in 10 days.</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it along with the Grandelash MD Eyelash Enhancer for length.</li>
    <li> Was Not happy with this product at all did not make my lashes look fuller at all!</li>
    <li> Have been using this in conjunction with the Enhancer, which I&#x27;d used once before and was effective on its own. It is difficult to determine how much of my current growth is due to this product, so I&#x27;m rating only as a mascara. It doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly, clumps up on the brush a bit and flakes off during the day. Most likely, I would only buy the Enhancer again, as I was happy with the results from that product alone.</li>
    <li> its okay I have a lot of hair and curly and it gives me a lot of body volume which I don&#x27;t need</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mascara so you can imagine how excited she was when she found this product on Amazon. She tole me the mascara doesn&#x27;t make her lashes look lumpy and it isn&#x27;t super thick. It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day with a minor touch up in the evening for going out. She wears this product almost daily and it lasts her 2 or so months, which is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the savings and convenience.</li>
    <li> I purchased the mascara the same time I purchased the eyelash serum.  They do compliment each other.</li>
    <li> This Mascara is rich in color and applies easily!  I have thin short lashes by it really makes they pop!</li>
    <li> love this ....works awesome can totally see my lashes got thicker and longer...of course i was also using the grandlash enhancer too but i do love how this mascara goes on..this is my new mascara for ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge believer in the MD product used at night to grow lashes but I was very disappointed in the mascara.  Made my lashes flat immediately after curling, it flaked off really easy which hurt because I wear contacts and was definitely not even water resistant.  I work out so this was super inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this originally at a salon that I go to. It was nearly $40!  So happy I found the same thing on Amazon for a fraction of the cost and the same exact product and quality. I recommend doing the entire routine - including the serum. My lashes are significantly longer!  Even with out this awesome mascara!</li>
    <li> Really liked this.  made lashes look longer and thicker</li>
    <li> My expectations were high and by the name &amp;#34;GRANDELASH&amp;#34; it&#x27;s hard not to expect anything else but a great mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to say but it did not live up to it&#x27;s name.  It&#x27;s a good mascara, just not a &amp;#34;grand&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara you could ever ask for. Once you use it, you will never buy any other.</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical to use miraculous products but this really works :) I started with the liquid to grow my lashes now I am using this mascara and my lashes look like to die for :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Grandelash MD enhancer for a long time.  I just received the mascara and couldnt  wait to use it. I applied one coat and then a second. My lashes look great!  This is an absolutely great product.  If I need waterproof I will use Mavala on top of Grandelash. I use coconut oil on my lashes daily and Grandelash did not smear or run. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> MD Lash products greatly surprise me, i&#x27;m a great fan of products to fortify lashes and MD make look like i have false lashes, everybody ask about my lashes....Then i&#x27;m so happy</li>
    <li> Very thick and full of chunks. It is not able to even out on your lashes. Used this product over and over. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> It really works and a great mascara!  I love this product and would highly recommend to anyone. Easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Its ok. A little to thick for my taste.</li>
    <li> This mascara leaves my Lashes Soft and not clumpy. It is easy to remove and I notice my lashes over time becoming healthier. I would have given it a 5 star if it did not have the fat brush. I like a thinner brush. But I highyly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Makes full long beautiful lashes great addition to GrandeLash MD!</li>
    <li> Ends up smeared below my eyes in an hour after applying.  Love their booster but not the mascara</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply. Dries out rather fast--doesn&#x27;t last as long as commercial mascaras I have bought in the past. I buy this mascara as a supplement to the GrandeLASH MD Eyelash Enhancer I use. Allow I know it&#x27;s not a good idea to do so, I add hot water to the mascara brush in order to use this mascara after only a month of use, as it dries out.  It goes on much better when the brush is not dry.</li>
    <li> Best mascara you will ever use. Goes on stays on cleans off easy. Lengthens like you are wearing false eyelashes. Really!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before so I was surprised when it came in a black tube instead of the gold one pictured.  It looks as well as the last one I had, I just hope that the formula in this one promotes lash growth like the last one.</li>
    <li> Excellent results after 2 months</li>
    <li> Greatest mascara ever.Keeps lashes pushed up and does not flake off. Just the best! Searched all my life for this mascara,pray they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy on amazon but received it in one of my monthly subscription boxes and I love it.... I have been looking for the perfect mascara forever been through tons of brands high and low end and this one makes my lashes curl up and look long as if I put a few fake ones in and with one or two swipes and it doesn&#x27;t look dry or clumpy.</li>
    <li> I was definitely thinking that this product was going to be a rip off like rapidlash and infinite lash. To my surprise it works. I did have some minor irritation when I first started using it. That eventually went away.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the ease of application.  I rush out to work each morning and don&#x27;t have the time it takes for most other mascaras to achieve the same effect...it goes on quickly and evenly, and surprise, surprise, taking it off at night is just as easy.  It&#x27;s magic.  I would readily recommend it to friends, but as I am the only senior citizen in my group of friends still working, no one else seems to use mascara except to go to a wedding and I guess they are happy with drug store brands.</li>
    <li> Really good mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake and my lashes are still soft. It doesn&#x27;t smudge but washes off easily with soap and water. It&#x27;s great in combination with Grandelash liquid. My lashes are longer and they look great!</li>
    <li> i love it a lot work well</li>
    <li> GrandeLash Mascara does work well for lengthening and making my lashes &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; without having to use an eyelash curler but, my one big complaint is that the tube leaves a lot to be desired. I need to either scrape or wipe off the brush because it&#x27;s WAY too heavily loaded with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they can improve the &amp;#34;delivery&amp;#34; system, this would be at least a 4.5 star review. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear and is easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I hope this will be a good product. If I like it, I will order from someone else in the future.</li>
    <li> Made your eyelashes clumpy and spider like. I Only used it for two weeks because I hated how it looked.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Does not clump, makes my eyelashes full and long! My second time ordering this.</li>
    <li> One of the best mascara&#x27;s available!  Does a professional job with no clumps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara and this is my favorite above all the fancy ones at sephora!</li>
    <li> Please note this review is for the MASCARA.  I am currently using the serum, liner and mascara together. I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results, so I added the makeup as well to see what would happen.  As I am over 50,I had been using the serum twice a day; now I am using the serum at night and the makeup in the morning and the results are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked the - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  When I stopped getting the extensions my lashes were left short and stubby so I decided to try serum to regrow them.  Did some research and based on reviews here and elsewhere I decided to try GrandeLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is a nice black color.  One coat gives good coverage and fullness.  It is NOT waterproof and does not last all day, so I finish with a coat of waterproof mascara to make it stay put.  I use the GrandeLash liner first, then this mascara with my regular eyeshadow. It&#x27;s not the best liner I have ever used, not the worst either, but I am giving it a very good review because once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for a few weeks now and will update when I re-order as to how long the tube lasts and if there are any other issues.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASCARA! It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t have the longest/thickest lashes ever but this stuff makes them look like they are! It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but it&#x27;s worth every penny. It doesn&#x27;t flake off, it lasts all day, and it&#x27;s easy to remove. Only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It defines all of my blonde lashes and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like other products. I use this mascara along with GrandeLASH MD. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that combination.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are absolutely beautiful. I&#x27;ve always had very short lashes, now they are thick and luscious.&lt;br /&gt;Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t break your&lt;br /&gt;bank and delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> I use RapidLash along with GrandeLash Mascara and the difference is amazing. I am sorry I took so long to buy it. I thought it was to good to be true. I am sold!</li>
    <li> amazing mascara.  Very black and all you need is one coat, doesn&#x27;t clump or flake.  Only mascara you need it lengthens and thickens.  Great product and I&#x27;ve tries them ALL!!!!!!!!  worth the money</li>
    <li> This product keeps my lashes long and strong.  It goes on well, is not clumpy and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> Not really happy with this mascara. Thought it would help to make my lashes look fuller and longer but it doesn&#x27;t. I only got it because I got the serum to grow my lashes and that works but the mascara doesnt</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product. I was hoping for more length. It works best with the lash serum which I haven&#x27;t purchased.</li>
    <li> Mascara  did not prove  any of the described  qualities: it is watery , almost dripping of lashes  during the application, then turns into clamps immediately. I managed to remove the excess with a brush and hoped it stays through the day. At lunch I had racoon eyes already...</li>
    <li> Great mascara, performs exactly as described. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara , it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lashes brittle and break , its different , natural type product , but really gives you the lashes! Its a bit tricky to build on tho , seems like you just make sure you got the section done well , before you move on , cauz reapplying , makes them , stick together a little. I think its like that &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; type mascara in application.</li>
    <li> I really like the mascara. My eyelashes are healthy and full.  It does clump which is annoying but I&#x27;m hoping they will change the brush. I&#x27;d purchase it again for sure if they do.  I received it very quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> This really works! My lashes almost touch my eyebrows after 6 wks.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific mascara.  I have used it before.  It does not smudge and cleans of easily with gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these items faithfully and they definitely work. I&#x27;m 61 years old also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok mascara, so far it didn&#x27;t actually make my lashes longer</li>
    <li> This is a great complement to the GrandeLASH-MD serum.  It highlights my light eyelashes easily, without clumping, defining and lengthening each lash individually.  It gives a more natural look than many mascaras I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Seems like old stock..</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara it smudges a little bit.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. Very thick and lush. Definitely better than the average you buy at a drug store. A tad bit pricey though, but if it went on sale, I would definitely buy.</li>
    <li> The mascara we received was very clumpy and many layers had to be applied to get the desired color. Not sure if this is all of them or we got a bad tube.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, and ended up throwing it away.  No matter how careful I was with the application, I ended up with tons of clumps.</li>
    <li> If you curl your eyelashes, you know most mascaras will uncurl them. However, this mascara is great for that and not flaking towards the end of the day. Yes, the other reviews say the it clumps but just on the tip of the brush when you pull it out of the tube. I really like this mascara and suggest trying it.</li>
    <li> this product actually pops out my eyelashes - I&#x27;ve never had eyelashes so powerful before.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube of this mascara.  It has NO flaking!  absolutely none, and it is soft, so if you happen to be someone who picks their mascara off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt your lashes!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use both the Grande Lash and GrandeLash Mascara.  They work very well together.  Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Second time that I&#x27;ve purchased and I plan to continue buying it!</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my lashes look</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This product is fine, but I probably will not repurchase.  As I age, I occasionally try another product than I am currently using to see if there is something out there that will  work better for my situation.  Well, This didn&#x27;t help my current situation and since the color only comes in black and I am sort of a brown/black mascara person, I am going back to my old mascara.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magnificient!</li>
    <li> only mascara that does not get under my eyes, never use another mascara</li>
</ol>
