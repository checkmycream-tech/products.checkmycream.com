### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Best!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Feels good and smells perfect</li>
      <li>Smells great</li>
      <li>great size for travel</li>
      <li>The Jasmine smells great, too.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>I think the smell is nice</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine product and smells nice.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that it is made with safe ingredients</li>
      <li>Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder is better than this.  </li>
      <li>and they are both lovely.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t rely on talc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like hair perfume than anything else.</li>
      <li>Should I be using more quantity?</li>
      <li>I am sure the hair powder works just fine</li>
      <li>Hands down best hair powder I&#x27;ve ever tried - and trust me girls, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>and I can feel fine about using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>but at this price, I really should try mixing up my own stuff.  </li>
      <li>I take this everywhere with me and love the fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I originally got this as a sample from a monthly subscription box and wasn&#x27;t all that excited by it.  </li>
      <li>Yes, the first try is tricky but after using it for more than a year now I&#x27;ll have to say the Vetiver/black pepper version has become a close and trustworthy friend.</li>
      <li>and this allows me to extend that time to nearly a week, whereas without it, I cannot go more than 2 days!</li>
      <li>I liked the lemon sage, but generally speaking Jasmine is pretty much my favorite scent, so</li>
      <li>This takes away greasy, oily looks and leaves nothing but a clean, fresh head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;By the time I wake up in the morning, the powder is largely absorbed and a quick brushing takes care of anything that might remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t help keep my hair looking fresh between showers, save your money and don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
      <li>It is excellent at absorbing extra oil and grease in my fine, wavy hair - and I hardly notice and don&#x27;t mind the light scent.  </li>
      <li>However, once I learned the best way to use it, it became the only dry shampoo I really like.  </li>
      <li>and I really feel it absorbs the grease and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I use more than directed and it also gives my hair more body :) Its expensive but worth it for me!</li>
      <li>But also Cat Marnell likely got it for free, if I had gotten mine for free I might be writing something</li>
      <li>Initially made my medium brown hair look whitish, but I combed it through and color looked ok...</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
      <li>my advice would be to find a cute jar somewhere and fill it up with corn starch - save yourself some money and keep your greasy secret safe!</li>
      <li>I have blonde hair and it works great when i have to go to work in a hurry and dont have time to dry my hair after washing!</li>
      <li>A little pricey, given that I was excited about an exotic smelling product, but does the job.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, full and bouncy the day after I shampoo.</li>
      <li>Smells great, works as well as other dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Cat Marnell is a junkie, she was probably high when she recommended it!</li>
      <li>I especially love to use this product in the winter when it&#x27;s cold</li>
      <li>However, I really like the powder</li>
      <li>I really like the jasmine scent and the product</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would work</li>
      <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to really work well.</li>
      <li>As a new parent who has gone from showering most everyday to maybe twice a week (on a good week) this product has allowed me to look less like a homeless person.</li>
      <li>You can get the same effect by sprinkling corn starch on your hair, which comes in a great big jar and costs, I don&#x27;t know, not very much</li>
      <li>; On particularly oily days, I could probably benefit from a reapplication in the afternoon, but YMMV.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute little container</li>
      <li>My hair also stays fresh the next day.</li>
      <li>Whether I&#x27;m traveling or just feeling lazy, this has pulled me out of sticky situations many times.</li>
      <li>Note that the package is small and I would give it 5 stars if the price were better for the amount you receive.</li>
      <li>I usually use cornstarch then add a bit of this on top for scent.</li>
      <li>While the scent is definitely pleasant enough, I don&#x27;t really detect any recognizable whiff of jasmine which is slightly disappointing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised to read the review saying that the person could not detect a scent.</li>
      <li>I chose it because I always try to go all natural...</li>
      <li>It really beats using baby powder which leaves a grey look to my brown hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me any volume and makes the dry parts of my scalp very visable.</li>
      <li>Just be aware of how small it really is.</li>
      <li>However, it does work well on dark brown straight hair, and it works well.  </li>
      <li>Considering how much I put down for this product, I am dissapointed.</li>

<li> I put a little in my hand, rub it in my hair and the greasy mess is gone, all nice and dry and fluffy.</li>
<li> like to hold off on washing my hair as long as possible after coloring</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
<li> Product smells really nice but scalp had a bad reaction to it.</li>
<li> I have tried every dry shampoo there is</li>
<li> That being the case, I wanted to try out this organic dry shampoo to de-oily my hair on days I don&#x27;t wash.</li>
<li> The scent does not linger at all-you get a faint whiff of it when you first open the container,</li>
<li> I hate the spray kind because it always clogs the spray mechanism.</li>
<li> Like other reviewers, my powder arrived with zero discernible scent, which is not the end of the world,</li>
<li> A life saver in the winter when I don;t want to wash my long hair everyday.</li>
<li> but the powder is too thick and just makes my hair look white.</li>
<li> /&gt;OK, first it does absorb the oil when you put in on the roots of your dirty hair.</li>
<li> I have dirty blonde hair and this does not leave the powdery white look</li>
<li> Heavy and just sits there!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> I, personally, like how faint the smell is.</li>
<li> Hoping for at least a jasmine smell on my hair, nothing.</li>
<li> It is expensive, though, and I find plain corn starch works just as well.</li>
<li> This made my scalp oily, and made my hair look worse than if I had not used it.</li>
<li> but this stuff smells bad, is waaaay overpriced and not worth even reading this review.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m applying it wrong.</li>
<li> Cons:  -Expensive  </li>
<li> But then again guys are stupid and unlikely to notice that anyway.</li>
<li> The smell is very faint</li>
<li> than before I put it in and it made a scalp itch so bad after it sat in my hair for a while.</li>
<li> since bars don&#x27;t let you smoke inside anymore, your filthy hair probably doesn&#x27;t stink that bad anyway.&lt;br</li>
<li> So when you bring a guy home, he might not realize you are trying to conceal your filthy disgusting hair.</li>
<li> AWFUL!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product smells really nice but scalp had a bad reaction to it. I tried using it several times but each time after my hair felt like it was oiler than before I put it in and it made a scalp itch so bad after it sat in my hair for a while. I would scrarch my head because I couldn&#x27;t take it and of course I started getting flaky. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised to read the review saying that the person could not detect a scent. I&#x27;ve been using Lulu Organics hair powder for 3 years and the scent is quite noticeable. I&#x27;ve tried both the lavender and the jasmine and they are both lovely. Essential oils will fade if they sit on your shelf for over a year but I use mine so often that this is never a problem. I especially love to use this product in the winter when it&#x27;s cold and I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair.</li>
    <li> great size for travel</li>
    <li> AWFUL! Dumps out and is the consistency of corn starch. Heavy and just sits there!</li>
    <li> I am the type who always buys organic, always avoids synthetic. That being the case, I wanted to try out this organic dry shampoo to de-oily my hair on days I don&#x27;t wash. It&#x27;s a cute little container and I still appreciate that there are no carcinogens or hormone disruptors... but at this price, I really should try mixing up my own stuff.  Pros:  -No chemicals that will give you cancer.  Cons:  -Expensive  -Cannot detect scent  -Cannot discern effect on my hair. Used a dime-sized amount and smoothed it on my hair. Initially made my medium brown hair look whitish, but I combed it through and color looked ok... but then my hair looked just as unwashed. Should I be using more quantity? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> As a new parent who has gone from showering most everyday to maybe twice a week (on a good week) this product has allowed me to look less like a homeless person. I put a little in my hand, rub it in my hair and the greasy mess is gone, all nice and dry and fluffy. It is amazing. It is a bit white for a couple of minutes before I run my hand through it a couple of times or the wind blows it out. The smell is nice and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I use hair powder alot.  Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder is better than this.  I chose it because I always try to go all natural...but this stuff smells bad, is waaaay overpriced and not worth even reading this review.</li>
    <li> So, I bought this product because Cat Marnell recommended it. I need to learn! Cat Marnell is a junkie, she was probably high when she recommended it! But also Cat Marnell likely got it for free, if I had gotten mine for free I might be writing something nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, first it does absorb the oil when you put in on the roots of your dirty hair. BUT, it costs 10 dollars for 1 oz. The jar that it comes in is about the size of a 35mm film canister. Remember those? Smaller than a spice jar. You can get the same effect by sprinkling corn starch on your hair, which comes in a great big jar and costs, I don&#x27;t know, not very much and you probably have one in your pantry anyway. Like other reviewers, my powder arrived with zero discernible scent, which is not the end of the world, since bars don&#x27;t let you smoke inside anymore, your filthy hair probably doesn&#x27;t stink that bad anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one pro is the packaging, which is definitely sexier than a big jar of corn starch in your bathroom. So when you bring a guy home, he might not realize you are trying to conceal your filthy disgusting hair. But then again guys are stupid and unlikely to notice that anyway. Maybe if you&#x27;re bringing girls home? I&#x27;m too vanilla for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advice would be to find a cute jar somewhere and fill it up with corn starch - save yourself some money and keep your greasy secret safe!</li>
    <li> Smells great, works as well as other dry shampoo.  I hate the spray kind because it always clogs the spray mechanism.</li>
    <li> organic,amazing, The Best!!!!!!! A life saver in the winter when I don;t want to wash my long hair everyday. Feels good and smells perfect***</li>
    <li> This powder works well. I appreciate that it is made with safe ingredients and I can feel fine about using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. We use it between washes. The smell is very faint and you cannot smell anything once it is combed through. I, personally, like how faint the smell is. Note that the package is small and I would give it 5 stars if the price were better for the amount you receive.</li>
    <li> There is no jasmine fragrance whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Whether I&#x27;m traveling or just feeling lazy, this has pulled me out of sticky situations many times. This takes away greasy, oily looks and leaves nothing but a clean, fresh head. I take this everywhere with me and love the fresh scent. It really beats using baby powder which leaves a grey look to my brown hair.</li>
    <li> I am sure the hair powder works just fine but there is no jasmine scent to speak of.  Bummed out.  It&#x27;s also a VERY tiny.</li>
    <li> Considering how much I put down for this product, I am dissapointed. It doesn&#x27;t give me any volume and makes the dry parts of my scalp very visable. Doesn&#x27;t last very long either. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m applying it wrong.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! I have blonde hair and it works great when i have to go to work in a hurry and dont have time to dry my hair after washing! The Jasmine smells great, too. I use more than directed and it also gives my hair more body :) Its expensive but worth it for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine product and smells nice. It is expensive, though, and I find plain corn starch works just as well. I usually use cornstarch then add a bit of this on top for scent.</li>
    <li> This made my scalp oily, and made my hair look worse than if I had not used it.</li>
    <li> Hands down best hair powder I&#x27;ve ever tried - and trust me girls, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Lulu Organics hair powder smells divine and works wonders - both as a styling product and for that non-greasy look. Yes, the first try is tricky but after using it for more than a year now I&#x27;ll have to say the Vetiver/black pepper version has become a close and trustworthy friend. Skip the comb and hairbrush, your fingertips will do.   Keep on rocking!   P.S  If there was ever any plans to make essential oil blends I want to be on the waiting list - somebody on your team has the olfactory sense of a goddess.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about once a week when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. I really like the jasmine scent and the product does seem to give my hair another go after application. The reason I took one star off is the price. It&#x27;s definitely a luxury item versus budget, but since I use it so infrequently, it should last awhile. Love that it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t rely on talc. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would double as a hair texturizing power; which was my mistake because the product is categorized as a hair powder/dry shampoo.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the way the powder sometimes clumps when I sprinkle it onto my hair.  It is excellent at absorbing extra oil and grease in my fine, wavy hair - and I hardly notice and don&#x27;t mind the light scent.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for something to absorb sweat after a mid-day gym visit, or on a day when you would prefer to not wash your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying a sample of the product in the lemon sage scent. I liked the lemon sage, but generally speaking Jasmine is pretty much my favorite scent, so I thought I&#x27;d order that. While the scent is definitely pleasant enough, I don&#x27;t really detect any recognizable whiff of jasmine which is slightly disappointing. However, I really like the powder and I think it works well to keep my hair presentable (and VOLUMINOUS) on &amp;#34;days of unwash.&amp;#34; On particularly oily days, I could probably benefit from a reapplication in the afternoon, but YMMV.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hearing about it from a Beauty Youtuber who had raved about it, especially the smell. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any white powdery residue in my hair, but I don&#x27;t smell anything! A little pricey, given that I was excited about an exotic smelling product, but does the job.</li>
    <li> It is basically talc. Hoping for at least a jasmine smell on my hair, nothing. I&#x27;d rather go &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and buy scented talc powder in the baby aisle.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work but the powder is too thick and just makes my hair look white. Didn&#x27;t help keep my hair looking fresh between showers, save your money and don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried every dry shampoo there is and this is the one I keep going back to.  I have dirty blonde hair and this does not leave the powdery white look the others do.  I think the smell is nice and I really feel it absorbs the grease and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a sample from a monthly subscription box and wasn&#x27;t all that excited by it.  However, once I learned the best way to use it, it became the only dry shampoo I really like.  For me, the key is to shake some into the oily sections of my hair at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I wake up in the morning, the powder is largely absorbed and a quick brushing takes care of anything that might remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to hold off on washing my hair as long as possible after coloring and this allows me to extend that time to nearly a week, whereas without it, I cannot go more than 2 days!</li>
    <li> This gets two stars off for two reasons. 1. It&#x27;s TEENY for $10.  See picture. That&#x27;s a chapstick next to it, and the chapstick is bigger. 2. The scent does not linger at all-you get a faint whiff of it when you first open the container, but then it&#x27;s gone.  However, it does work well on dark brown straight hair, and it works well.  Just be aware of how small it really is.</li>
    <li> Smells great but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to really work well. It&#x27;s more like hair perfume than anything else.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say as it exploded in the mail...</li>
    <li> My hair is soft, full and bouncy the day after I shampoo. My hair also stays fresh the next day. I used 2 quarter sizes, rubbed it into the palms of my hands, then on my scalp and back of my head.</li>
</ol>
