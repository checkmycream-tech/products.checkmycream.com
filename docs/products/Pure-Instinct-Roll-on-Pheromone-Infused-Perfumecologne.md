### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff Smells awesome!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect for traveling.</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells great without being over powering.</li>
      <li>this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>still a sceptic on the pheromones, but the product smells great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those things that if you ran across it you would buy it but not relentlessly search it out or be truly upset if it were to be discontinued like some of the more legendary fragrances that we all feel are a part of our life and it would be drastically altered if it were to be discontinued.</li>
      <li>Like I said though it is a good fragrance</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it as a good buy if someone were to ask.</li>
      <li>boyfriend commented on how good i smelled.  </li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>and we all loved it.</li>
      <li>Happy Shopping:)</li>
      <li>I like this product even better now that it comes in rolll on!</li>
      <li>It has a nice fruity smell, and my wife always loves the smell.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s planning to buy her own tube now too.</li>
      <li>Smells very clean!</li>
      <li>wife loves it , nice smooth smell that keeps here close to me.</li>
      <li>and she fell in love.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for a perfume, but as a roll on Pheromone it does nothing.  </li>
      <li>There are many pheros out there</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the roll-on for its convenience.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make people fall in love</li>
      <li>Will definetly purchase again&lt;br /&gt;ships very quickly.</li>
      <li>it does work and it as well helps calm one self to conversate in mind body and speech more effectivly when in the mood</li>
      <li>I was not totally disappointed, but the blue bottled one seemed to smell much more potent, lasted longer, and seemed overall more effective.</li>
      <li>Saw at fun party but instead bought here for cheaper ;) gotta love it.</li>
      <li>It does have  sweet scent</li>
      <li>, DOUBT IF I WILL USE IT, CAUSE I JUST DON&#x27;T LIKE SMELLING LIKE SWEET CANDY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the extra attention :)  </li>
      <li>Now as a disclaimer, I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones actually work in this product, but the yummy smell sure garnered some attention from both friends and strangers!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cost much compared to the others and works just fine.</li>
      <li>Smells sweet when you first apply it, but changes to a lighter almost musk smell.</li>
      <li>so it is better than many other fragrances that I have, or have tried.  </li>
      <li>it has the good smelling,and it can lasti for a long time,I love it and will buy it the next time</li>
      <li>What stopped me from purchasing the product right away was the price.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it that long, but I really love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;Really light.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and so do others, it is definitely an attractant.</li>
      <li>I am definitely treated differently when I wear it and just feel more confident.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product when a friend of mine hosted a PassionParty at her place.</li>
      <li>and I will most likely reorder.</li>
      <li>I have enough natural magnetism to attract what I desire! :)</li>
      <li>and I really do like it.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for as close as real pheromone as you can get.  </li>
      <li>Will buy again very soon.</li>
      <li>but it fades fast</li>
      <li>Out of curiosity and boredom, I searched it on Amazon and was surprised to actually find it- for a lot cheaper and free shipping, too!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you like the Pure Instinct Roll on sold at parties.</li>
      <li>Both were fine, but or about the same price point, I suggest the Pure Instinct in the blue bottle.</li>
      <li>As far as the pheremones go, I don&#x27;t really think that it is lacking in that area.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact same at a much lower price.  </li>
      <li>has a nice smell, doesn&#x27;t last very long but definitely makes an impression.  </li>
      <li>The company was selling the product for twice as much, plus $10 shipping (essentially, it was 3x&#x27;s as much as I purchased through Amazon).</li>
      <li>I have never really had problem with delivery until this product, so who knows, but other than that, the product works, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this a few time because I love it so much, but unfortunately only received it once, the status said delivered</li>
      <li>; marked down to $10 bucks with free shipping was the first red flag.  </li>
      <li>Third, the scent itself is akin to watered-down pears, and disappeared entirely too quickly.  </li>
      <li>It still is not very long lasting, if you ask me.</li>

    <li> I recently bought this product instead of the same brand/name&#x27;s product in the little blue bottle because it looked easier to apply and I assumed it would be the same product. I was not totally disappointed, but the blue bottled one seemed to smell much more potent, lasted longer, and seemed overall more effective. (I tested both side by side on my wrist to reach this conclusion.) Both were fine, but or about the same price point, I suggest the Pure Instinct in the blue bottle.</li>
    <li> It has a nice fruity smell, and my wife always loves the smell. It doesn&#x27;t work like a magnet to metal, but enhances the overall experience, and is a booster once there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for a perfume, but as a roll on Pheromone it does nothing.  I thought it would get my husband more crazy for me then he usually is, so I put it on and he didn&#x27;t seem interested at all.</li>
    <li> like when you purchase it from a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; party. Highly recommend if you like the Pure Instinct Roll on sold at parties.</li>
    <li> Smells sweet when you first apply it, but changes to a lighter almost musk smell. I will roll it on my wrists and apply behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on the scent. I feel like it does change slightly from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a sceptic on the pheromones, but the product smells great and I will most likely reorder.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and so do others, it is definitely an attractant. I have ordered this a few time because I love it so much, but unfortunately only received it once, the status said delivered but, it never was the last times. I have never really had problem with delivery until this product, so who knows, but other than that, the product works, and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> TWO STARS FOR JUST IN CASE IT DOES WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, DOUBT IF I WILL USE IT, CAUSE I JUST DON&#x27;T LIKE SMELLING LIKE SWEET CANDY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KUDOS FOR THE REVIEWERS THAT DO LIKE THE SCENT, JUST NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Smells very clean! I absolutely love it. You don&#x27;t need a lot for it to work. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to family/friends!</li>
    <li> The scent stay with you all day.</li>
    <li> wife loves it , nice smooth smell that keeps here close to me. just cant wear it out alone, wifes rules</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  has a nice smell, doesn&#x27;t last very long but definitely makes an impression.  boyfriend commented on how good i smelled.  i wish there was a spray version of this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that long, but I really love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;Really light. Will buy again very soon.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. It lasts through about half of the day before it starts to fade so it is better than many other fragrances that I have, or have tried.  It is fruity and not musky so if you are seeking a musky fragrance this is definitely not the one that you want to use.  If you want to smell like you just got out of the shower and applied one of those fruity bath splashes all day then this is the one that you want.  As far as the pheremones go, I don&#x27;t really think that it is lacking in that area.  My husband has never commented on it and no one else has asked me what I am wearing either.  The only fragrances that I have had anyone comment on are the (believe it or not) the cheaper ones like Jovan Gardenia or Loves Rainforest. Weird. But all in all I don&#x27;t regret the purchase and I would get it again due to the fact that I like the scent but I would not intentionally search it out and set aside funds to purchase it. It&#x27;s one of those things that if you ran across it you would buy it but not relentlessly search it out or be truly upset if it were to be discontinued like some of the more legendary fragrances that we all feel are a part of our life and it would be drastically altered if it were to be discontinued. Like I said though it is a good fragrance and I would recommend it as a good buy if someone were to ask. Happy Shopping:)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for as close as real pheromone as you can get.  Try this one. I received my roll-on before my receive date and was package so well.</li>
    <li> This stuff Smells awesome!!! Saw at fun party but instead bought here for cheaper ;) gotta love it.I definitely Use a lot!</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it smells the same on me as it does in the bottle which makes me suspicious of the pheromones. Also, I don&#x27;t think it is very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out on two other people and it seemed to smell VERY slightly different. So I suppose it does work. It still is not very long lasting, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the fourth time and I really do like it.  It doesn&#x27;t make people fall in love but it will make men stop in their tracks and check you out. Love the extra attention :)  Doesn&#x27;t cost much compared to the others and works just fine. It does have  sweet scent so I mask it with perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to wearing first-tier phero products (yeah, I&#x27;m a phero snob, see my other reviews), but bought this inexpensive product out of curiosity.  The $142 &amp;#34;list price&amp;#34; marked down to $10 bucks with free shipping was the first red flag.  Second red flag was the company&#x27;s reticence to list the fragrance notes or identify the product&#x27;s phero.  There are many pheros out there and I have no idea what&#x27;s in this one.  Third, the scent itself is akin to watered-down pears, and disappeared entirely too quickly.  Fourth, and the killer red flag, was that I saw no results.  I wear my better-quality phero products and the results are immediate and numerous.  Bottom line?  The teen-aged girl next door will probably appreciate it.</li>
    <li> it has the good smelling,and it can lasti for a long time,I love it and will buy it the next time</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it fades fast and I&#x27;m not sure if other people smell it because I got no compliments and I don&#x27;t think anyone noticed at all</li>
    <li> I like this product even better now that it comes in rolll on! I use it religiously and swear it works!</li>
    <li> No significant results were notable from this product. :(  Good thing I have enough natural magnetism to attract what I desire! :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I&#x27;ve tested it on other around me. I am definitely treated differently when I wear it and just feel more confident. Plus, it smells great without being over powering.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product previously (from a home part) for $25.  This is the exact same at a much lower price.  Will definetly purchase again&lt;br /&gt;ships very quickly.</li>
    <li> Now as a disclaimer, I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones actually work in this product, but the yummy smell sure garnered some attention from both friends and strangers! I was first introduced to this product when a friend of mine hosted a PassionParty at her place. The rep let all us girls try it on and we all loved it. What stopped me from purchasing the product right away was the price. The company was selling the product for twice as much, plus $10 shipping (essentially, it was 3x&#x27;s as much as I purchased through Amazon). Being a broke college student, I held off. Out of curiosity and boredom, I searched it on Amazon and was surprised to actually find it- for a lot cheaper and free shipping, too! I love the roll-on for its convenience. Perfect for traveling. I let my sister try some on and she fell in love. She&#x27;s planning to buy her own tube now too.</li>
    <li> it does work and it as well helps calm one self to conversate in mind body and speech more effectivly when in the mood</li>
