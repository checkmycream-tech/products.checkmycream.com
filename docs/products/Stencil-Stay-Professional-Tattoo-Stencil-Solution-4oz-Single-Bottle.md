      <li>But it stays far better then other stencile products.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m buying another bottle right now to keep for the future</li>
      <li>you will love this product,because you want have to freehand no more tattoos,because this is the foundation and it stays on.  </li>
      <li>I had to free hand a few lines that came off but that could of been  the transfer paper  </li>
      <li>Even after lightly wiping it a few times, it still has not fully came off.</li>
      <li>Works very well, and of course out of curiosity for when I use this for actual tattooing purposes I attempted to wipe off the stencils.</li>
      <li>when it is applied it is very,very light and hard to see.</li>

    <li> This product works like a dream. We use it for applying stencils before the product dries (unlike the instructions which say to apply stencil after), and it is near impossible to wash off the stencil once it dries.</li>
    <li> ONE THING IS ALL awesome&lt;br /&gt; THANKS FAST GOT IT AND WORKS WELL !!! i RECOMMEND  This 2 all who wants it to stay in case needing break ...</li>
    <li> Tried this 9 times until i threw it away, i let it dry, tried it wet, etc. when it is applied it is very,very light and hard to see. then it smears with the lightest touch. you are better off melting some speed stick and alcohol. maybe i got a bad bottle but i will never waste my money on this crap again.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s claim on the bottle, it is of professional quality indeed. I just received this package today eager to test it out with my Spirit transfer papers( Also available on Amazon, watch for scams though! ) and was very pleased with the results. Seeing as how today is Halloween, my younger siblings wanted &amp;#34;tattoo&#x27;s&amp;#34; on them as well, so I traced them out some stencils and applied it to their skin using this solution. Works very well, and of course out of curiosity for when I use this for actual tattooing purposes I attempted to wipe off the stencils. I did so in vain, and was very pleased to not have been able to wipe off the stencil after allowing it a good 30 seconds to dry. It didn&#x27;t even smudge. It wasn&#x27;t for another THREE (3) hours until it showed signs of fading after the kids came back home. My stencil still is on, 4 hours later. Even after lightly wiping it a few times, it still has not fully came off. VERY good solution, I&#x27;m buying another bottle right now to keep for the future and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Advanced and beginner tattoo artists alike.</li>
    <li> I got it in a few days ago and have only used it once on in casing my friends neck piece it stuck pretty well I had to free hand a few lines that came off but that could of been  the transfer paper  the paper I was using wasn&#x27;t spirit I don&#x27;t think hard to tell when it&#x27;s not yours the stuff Smells great and wasn&#x27;t sticky to the touch after it dried I&#x27;d buy it again I would of gave it 5 stars but I haven&#x27;t used it enough and didn&#x27;t want to be misleading no fault of the product</li>
    <li> You have to let it dry before applying your stencile. But it stays far better then other stencile products. Give it a try. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. It helps keep stencils on, and even the cheap stencils last wipe after wipe. All you have to do is follow the directions. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this has happened to anyone else but i got a bottle and got it open inside the packaging and they send me another one and it was busted open too. im sure this works good but how can i not recieve a undamaged bottle..ughhh im annoyed!</li>
    <li> It works well for a while but the stencil comes off easily. I would recommend you look at \\&quot;Stencil Stuff\\&quot; its white with a green label.</li>
    <li> bought for my tattoo artist friend I guess he used this on me or someone else</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to put a stencil on and it holds the stencil ink very well.</li>
    <li> Work just like they said</li>
    <li> It stats pretty good but once you start getting ink on it it goes away fairly quick but just water it won&#x27;t come off give it probably about 15 20 minutes for a good stencil that&#x27;ll stay</li>
    <li> ve ry fa st sh ip pi ng. lo ve the pro duct sorry. gotta fit it all. stupid comments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use to using the the gel which is kind of sticky it&#x27;s gonna take some getting use to this one</li>

    <li> STENCIL STAY is the best stencil TATTOO Applicator stuff you can buy. it keeps your stencil on and holds your stencil on your skin ,after wiping all you want.i have tried everything out on the market and if you apply this on right, your stencils not going to wipe off. CAUTION, don&#x27;nt use to much or it will smear ,just apply a little where your stencils going and let dry and it will be stcky a little. a four oz bottle will last a long time,if i never tried it ,i would practice with it a couple times,because it don&#x27;nt take much.rememember shake well,its got a ball in the bottle for mixing it.believe me you will love this product,because you want have to freehand no more tattoos,because this is the foundation and it stays on.  crazy rick</li>
