### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>a great bargain when you look at salon product prices!</li>
      <li>at all!!!! The best find I have ever found!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>I think the best solution is to wash your hair in sections since you can&#x27;t work it through your hair at all.</li>
      <li>so this works great.</li>
      <li>BOY am I happy I did.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>Amazing will buy again!</li>
      <li>and I found that 5 pumps was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does smell good and my hair is shinier, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST shampoo and condition I have used yet, it makes your hair clean yet</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I found it at a popular discount retail store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m VERY happy with the product and have found my new go to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product line after trying it together with the conditioner and hair oil treatment.</li>
      <li>In order for me to feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, I ended up using a lot more than I should have...</li>
      <li>Again, make sure that you rinse it thoroughly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the conditioner from this brand but the shampoo is nothing to write home about.  </li>
      <li>you use more of it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great for taming flyaways and frizzy ness, however since it doesn&#x27;t lather you&#x27;ll go through twice as much in the process.</li>
      <li>and I used about 5 pumps of the shampoo so that I can make sure the shampoo hits all of the hair and work it into my scalp as well.</li>
      <li>Oh well, I guess I&#x27;m glad it works for some people.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Just before I was going to get out I rinsed my hair and made sure to rinse it thoroughly, rubbing at the scalp and making sure to ensure that I rinsed it out of all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>My hair is in much better shape than it was.</li>
      <li>but the results are very worth it!</li>
      <li>DEFFINATLY worth a try!!</li>
      <li>(I take 1500 mg of coral calcium too which helps keep hair and nails strong and healthy along with bones and joints!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so shiny, healthy and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>My natural highlights even seem more noticeable, which is something that I don&#x27;t think I have every experienced with a shampoo in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it, I wash it daily and use conditioner a lot because my hair goes between static fly away state and greaseball state.</li>
      <li>My hair type is fine and the shampoo states,&amp;#34;For</li>
      <li>/&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering what kind of hair I have: My hair is fine and straight</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a light, non-creamy shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking to get a Paraben Free shampoo.</li>
      <li>It is also much softer, smoother,  more manageable than before, and feels very clean.</li>
      <li>I first massage the shampoo between the braids directly on my scalp which feels wonderful, rinse, then apply to the braids by just grabbing a bunch and gently rubbing the shampoo to the ends.</li>
      <li>I have just used the Argon Magic shampoo and conditioner for the first time and it has already made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was really excited about it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel clean when you wash your hair with it.</li>
      <li>I want my shampoo to be sudsy and give me a feeling that my hair is clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>hair never feels clean, it doesn&#x27;t smell clean, let alone the way it looks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be of great help to my dry hair...</li>
      <li>I didnt get the feeling my hair was clean.</li>
      <li>and I can get away with not washing my hair for 4 days without it looking super greasy.</li>
      <li>so I was concerned at first, but this shampoo leaves your not just your hair feeling super clean but your scalp too.  </li>
      <li>I have to use more than one pump of it and do two rounds to get it feeling like its actually washing my hair.  </li>
      <li>Even when I tried using way more than I ever thought necessary</li>
      <li>Still it works pretty well with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>but it also strips natural oils from your hair and that leads to dull, frizzy, fly away hair.</li>
      <li>However, after trying this out (by the way it arrived fast) I was just amazed how it left my hair so smooth and silky because I have wavy/straight hair</li>
      <li>And if you are really desiring the foamyness of the hair wash this shampoo will foam up it</li>
      <li>Anyways, this really works you have to try it</li>
      <li>as much as I would use for a premium shampoo and my hair never feels like it&#x27;s fully been cleaned.</li>
      <li>I think the effectiveness of this really depends on your hair type.</li>
      <li>My hair has been extremely dry and this certainly nipped it in the bud very quickly.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Most Paraben free products right now are a bit insane on prices because it&#x27;s all the rage and all the &#x27;celebrity hair stylists&#x27; are coming out with their own lines</li>
      <li>my hair never felt very clean, even though I don&#x27;t typically have greasy hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my braids soft and very silky with no frizz.</li>
      <li>you will have minimal to no lather because of this being paraben free.</li>
      <li>my hair was continually dealing with fly aways, frizz, dull dry hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased a bottle from a retail store, because I wanted to try something new.  </li>
      <li>You will have little to no lather, Paraben free means that chemical isn&#x27;t in here</li>
      <li>The pump action gets hung up</li>
      <li>so so so soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>and my hair is brighter, soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I gave up on the pump completely and transferred the shampoo into a squeeze bottle</li>
      <li>Another thorough rinse followed by towel and air drying to complete the process.</li>
      <li>Also don&#x27;t be surprised if you don&#x27;t see bubbles when your washing your hair</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to work the shampoo into your scalp and when you&#x27;re rinsing make sure to take a few extra seconds to ensure that you are thoroughly rinsing your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so thick and healthy</li>
      <li>highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone with similar hair as me.</li>
      <li>For natural curls I use the conditioning mask and let it dry by itself, or if I want it straight</li>
      <li>It looks like plain clean hair</li>
      <li>Third, it doesn&#x27;t bubble up like a normal shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Normally when I do this, my hair ends up being big, frizzy and unmanageable.</li>
      <li>Ok first off let me just say that I was a bit skeptical about buying this product since I&#x27;ve never really bought a shampoo online and was a bit unsure if it would really work.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t sud up which j thought was kind of weird</li>
      <li>let just say it looks like a hot mess.</li>
      <li>But, this time it is much less frizzy and the waves are more pronounced than usual.</li>
      <li>In fact, on extra dirty days, I wash with a cheap shampoo first, then use this product for the shine.  </li>

<li> And I am not entirely sure it is not the real thing.</li>
<li> My hair remained greasy and flat, no shine.</li>
<li> I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners and other hair products to try to tame my hair with little to no success.</li>
<li> Meant I spent about 15 extra seconds under the water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
<li> It is color treated and about 1/3 of it is grey underneath the coloring.</li>
<li> Like other people who bought the product, I ended up using a bigger amount of it in every wash, cause it always felt like it was doing nothing to my hair.</li>
<li> When using this product consistently over a short period of time I needed to use a clarifying shampoo more than once to get that nasty feeling of build-up out of hair.</li>
<li> Once I rinsed I used about 5 pumps of the conditioner to coat my hair and let it sit while I went about my other showerly duties, shaving and such.</li>
<li> I had really dry and damaged hair</li>
<li> If you have curly dry hair like mine</li>
<li> and I let it air dry.</li>
<li> I blow dry or use the straightening product.  </li>
<li> It does not leave your hair dry...</li>
<li> In the last few year, I have felt only frustration with my hair.</li>
<li> I think the consistency might be a part of it: its pretty thin.</li>
<li> and I have to manually pull the pump back into the up position again before it can push it down again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the worst shampoo I have tried in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like to post negative stuff in general, but it is important for people to know that this is a horrible product and I was too stubborn when I read the reviews to believe it and I still bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair never feels clean, it doesn&#x27;t smell clean, let alone the way it looks!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to give it a couple tries to see if it was just a process of adaptation but sadly the result was always the same!! SO BAD AND SO HORRIBLE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the product in amazon, I got it for discounted price at Marshalls, but I still wish so bad I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money this way!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be of great help to my dry hair... but it turned out to be everything but helpful. I didnt get the feeling my hair was clean. Like other people who bought the product, I ended up using a bigger amount of it in every wash, cause it always felt like it was doing nothing to my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Day 1 and my hair is brighter, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner from this brand but the shampoo is nothing to write home about.  For some reason it doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up.  I have to use more than one pump of it and do two rounds to get it feeling like its actually washing my hair.  I think the consistency might be a part of it: its pretty thin. Still it works pretty well with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I picked up a 2 pack of this at HomeGoods - but will be getting my replacement bottles from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been looking to get a Paraben Free shampoo. For those that don&#x27;t know, Paraben is the chemical that they add to shampoo&#x27;s that allows you to have lots of lather and suds but it also strips natural oils from your hair and that leads to dull, frizzy, fly away hair. Most Paraben free products right now are a bit insane on prices because it&#x27;s all the rage and all the &#x27;celebrity hair stylists&#x27; are coming out with their own lines (See example: Wen Products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So considering I got two big bottles for 20 bucks, I was down for trying and BOY am I happy I did. I have thin, straight hair that I color and my hair was continually dealing with fly aways, frizz, dull dry hair. My hair is shoulder length and I used about 5 pumps of the shampoo so that I can make sure the shampoo hits all of the hair and work it into my scalp as well. Remember - you will have minimal to no lather because of this being paraben free. Once I rinsed I used about 5 pumps of the conditioner to coat my hair and let it sit while I went about my other showerly duties, shaving and such. Just before I was going to get out I rinsed my hair and made sure to rinse it thoroughly, rubbing at the scalp and making sure to ensure that I rinsed it out of all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not dry or dull looking. It FEELS healthier and looks it too. I HIGHLY recommend this product. You just have to keep 3 key points in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1. You will have little to no lather, Paraben free means that chemical isn&#x27;t in here so you aren&#x27;t going to have all that foaming lather and you&#x27;re going to need to use a few pumps. Like I mentioned - I have shoulder length and I found that 5 pumps was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. You&#x27;ll want to work the shampoo into your scalp and when you&#x27;re rinsing make sure to take a few extra seconds to ensure that you are thoroughly rinsing your hair. Meant I spent about 15 extra seconds under the water.&lt;br /&gt;3. Put the conditioner on and let it set for a bit while you do the rest of your business. Shaving, soaping....whatever. Again, make sure that you rinse it thoroughly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY happy with the product and have found my new go to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair very dry.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair rough and not sleek and shiny.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it, I wash it daily and use conditioner a lot because my hair goes between static fly away state and greaseball state. I was sceptical about this shampoo because it has oil in it and I thought it would make my hair worse. I was wrong. Once you pass that period of why is my hair not foaming up while I wash it, and the weirdness goes away you get to appreciate what this product is doing for your hair. I still wash my hair daily, but my hair is not either flying away or is greasy. It looks like plain clean hair and I love it. And if you are really desiring the foamyness of the hair wash this shampoo will foam up it you use more of it. I should also mention that I do not use conditioner since I started using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I purchased a bottle from a retail store, because I wanted to try something new.  My hair has never been so shiny, healthy and easy to manage.  There is not much lather so I was concerned at first, but this shampoo leaves your not just your hair feeling super clean but your scalp too.  It does not leave your hair dry...at all!!!! The best find I have ever found!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and hate to have it dirty with oil OR clean but frizzy dry and damaged.  I fell in love with this product line after trying it together with the conditioner and hair oil treatment. I wash and condition once every five days but I shower and just use the conditioner every day followed by the oil every day before styling.  For natural curls I use the conditioning mask and let it dry by itself, or if I want it straight I blow dry or use the straightening product.  My hair has never been so thick and healthy (I take 1500 mg of coral calcium too which helps keep hair and nails strong and healthy along with bones and joints!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great bargain when you look at salon product prices!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and I was really excited about it. It smells great but when I put it on my hair it didn&#x27;t feel like shampoo... it in fact made my hair greesy. I think I just might be my hair but idk. Probe gunna end up giving it to someone.</li>
    <li> Ok first off let me just say that I was a bit skeptical about buying this product since I&#x27;ve never really bought a shampoo online and was a bit unsure if it would really work. However, after trying this out (by the way it arrived fast) I was just amazed how it left my hair so smooth and silky because I have wavy/straight hair w/  frizz......... let just say it looks like a hot mess. Anyways, this really works you have to try it plus you got nothing to lose. Also don&#x27;t be surprised if you don&#x27;t see bubbles when your washing your hair (I was confused as well that I didn&#x27;t see bubbles like WHERE IS THE BUBBLES?!) because since this is a non chemical shampoo don&#x27;t expect there to be bubbles.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for taming flyaways and frizzy ness, however since it doesn&#x27;t lather you&#x27;ll go through twice as much in the process. Even when I tried using way more than I ever thought necessary my hair never felt very clean, even though I don&#x27;t typically have greasy hair. Oh well, I guess I&#x27;m glad it works for some people.</li>
    <li> Amazing will buy again!</li>
    <li> I also purchased this shampoo because of its ingredients however I was very disappointed in the results. My hair remained greasy and flat, no shine. Almost like I&#x27;ve never washed my hair at all. If I could give that shampoo a zero I would, Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, and wavy hair. It is normally a big, frizzy mess. I have just used the Argon Magic shampoo and conditioner for the first time and it has already made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I tested how well it would work by not adding any extra products and I let it air dry. Normally when I do this, my hair ends up being big, frizzy and unmanageable. But, this time it is much less frizzy and the waves are more pronounced than usual. It is also much softer, smoother,  more manageable than before, and feels very clean. My natural highlights even seem more noticeable, which is something that I don&#x27;t think I have every experienced with a shampoo in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone with similar hair as me. I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners and other hair products to try to tame my hair with little to no success. In the last few year, I have felt only frustration with my hair. But I believe I have finally found a winner!</li>
    <li> My hair is braided with curly synthetic hair so I was looking for a light, non-creamy shampoo. This is IT! I found it at a popular discount retail store. It leaves my braids soft and very silky with no frizz. I first massage the shampoo between the braids directly on my scalp which feels wonderful, rinse, then apply to the braids by just grabbing a bunch and gently rubbing the shampoo to the ends. Another thorough rinse followed by towel and air drying to complete the process. I wash my hair/braids weekly so this works great.</li>
    <li> Product arrived relatively timely. Although I question the authenticity of the product. I have used this product may times and this seems to smell differently. I&#x27;m not sure if it has to do with an age factor or what. And I am not entirely sure it is not the real thing. I have my doubts, and that is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo alot. I had really dry and damaged hair but my hair became healthier and shinier. However, the pump really sucks since I would have to manually pull it up for a pump.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shampoo I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t feel clean when you wash your hair with it. Doesn&#x27;t lather well. In order for me to feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, I ended up using a lot more than I should have... Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I am on the fence with this product. My hair has been extremely dry and this certainly nipped it in the bud very quickly. My hair is in much better shape than it was. However, because it doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL it is difficult to tell if you&#x27;re cleaning your hair. You cannot tell if you are working it through or not. For the second day in a row now I have missed an entire section of my hair and will have to take a second shower. I think the best solution is to wash your hair in sections since you can&#x27;t work it through your hair at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Moroccan oil which uses the same argan additive, but am really disappointed in this shampoo.  I want my shampoo to be sudsy and give me a feeling that my hair is clean when I&#x27;m done. My first complaint is I have to use 3x as much as I would use for a premium shampoo and my hair never feels like it&#x27;s fully been cleaned. Second, the shampoo is very thick, so it&#x27;s not a good choice for a pump dispenser. The pump action gets hung up and I have to manually pull the pump back into the up position again before it can push it down again.  Third, it doesn&#x27;t bubble up like a normal shampoo.  In fact, on extra dirty days, I wash with a cheap shampoo first, then use this product for the shine.  UPDATE:  I gave up on the pump completely and transferred the shampoo into a squeeze bottle instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does smell good and my hair is shinier, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Perhaps skip the shampoo and just use an argan based conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering what kind of hair I have: My hair is fine and straight but I have a lot of it and it&#x27;s shoulder length. It is color treated and about 1/3 of it is grey underneath the coloring.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product do to the fact it&#x27;s paraben-free and that it contained Argan oil for shine.  My hair type is fine and the shampoo states,&amp;#34;For all hair types&amp;#34; which I disagree with.  When I wash my hair with this product it leaves residue behind.  Less than 4-5 hours after cleaning my hair with this shampoo I can see and feel oil build-up starting at the scalp.  When using this product consistently over a short period of time I needed to use a clarifying shampoo more than once to get that nasty feeling of build-up out of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m specific with my hair products, I tried over 100 different shampoos, I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, everything. This is the BEST shampoo and condition I have used yet, it makes your hair clean yet so so so soft and manageable. My hair is prone to tangles but not when I use this. I have thin hair and I use this conditioner almost to my roots and I can get away with not washing my hair for 4 days without it looking super greasy. DEFFINATLY worth a try!!</li>
    <li> I think the effectiveness of this really depends on your hair type. If you have straight, thin, manageable hair then look elsewhere, this is too heavy duty for you. I am of Arab and Irish descent so I have very curly dry hair that isn&#x27;t very thick, but I have a LOT of it ! This shampoo and conditioner did the trick! While I bought mine from a local discount store, this is the same brand and I love it. It didn&#x27;t sud up which j thought was kind of weird but the results are very worth it! If you have curly dry hair like mine then this is def the product for you! Definitely use with the conditioner.</li>
