<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The scent is soapy yet not unpleasant.  Lathers well and affords a comfortable shave.  If you have sensitive skin like I do, you may want to lok for a different product.</li>
    <li> decent, but i believe Proraso is a better quality cream. like the Proraso scent and lather quality.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old and get nostalgia fits once in a while.  This cream reminds me of the time when I was a teenager and learning how to shave, the smell of it, etc.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product now. I can say it has a good amount of lather and the aroma is very pleasant. The lather is not as rich as either Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, or Geo. Trumper. The product comes out of the tube a bit too freely for my taste, but I figured that if you squeeze the tube in the middle, it works better. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, makes a rich thick lather with a pleasant aroma. No irritation with multiple passes with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Classic Shave Cream with great scent. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it because it has coconut oil and alcohol in it. I broke out a little bit from it. I gave it to Dad though. He said he liked it!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try after having used Proraso for a while as my main shaving cream. I&#x27;d heard that Musgo Real was a good, inexpensive cream. On the positive side, it does lather easily with a brush. But in my experience I noticed I got cuts a little more frequently when using this cream than with Proraso, Omega, or Crabtree &amp; Evelyn (my favorite so far, but more expensive). Also, I was not a fan of the scent. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I didn&#x27;t like it either. It had a real cologne element to it that was quite strong and would linger for a while after shaving. It&#x27;s not bad shaving cream, but I definitely prefer Proraso for the price.</li>
    <li> I started using a brush and shave cream 6-7 years and just recently tried the Musgo Real shave cream. It is one of the best products to use with a brush when shaving and is already one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> One of the best ever! A real classic scent. Makes shaving a real pleasure. I also recommend the round glycerin soap as a pre-shave. It has a great soft citrus scent that blends nicely with the shaving cream. Badger brush recommended!!!!!  Musgo&#x27;s regular bar soap has a fresh and soft herb scent that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;scare\\&quot; the world and rinses clean!  Once done I use a no-scent balm or skin moisturizer. No cologne or after shave! I just like the soft classic scent these three leave on!</li>
    <li> I found out about Musgo Real on a fluke while looking up something else on the internet. I had a full beard with no intentions to shave at the time, but the product seemed well-liked and made an impression based on what I&#x27;d read about it.    Fast-forward several months, and it is time for me to start shaving again. No more canned chemicals, no more painful cartridges or battery-powered whirlygigs to shave this time. I&#x27;d decided to start wet-shaving with a double edge safety razor.    I ordered a Merkur long-handled safety razor, an inexpensive badger brush, and a tube of Musgo Real.    My first impression of Musgo Real was the smell. It smells fantastic! I don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;grassy\\&quot; notes out of it (too many hot summers mowing the lawn for me?). It just smells clean, refreshing, interesting, inviting... It does NOT smell like chemicals, medicine, or anything that foams itself out of a can.    The tube is metal and looks a little bit like a standard tube of toothpaste, so store them separately in your bathroom and read the labels on both before using. I&#x27;ve had 2 close calls so far...    One thing I like about Musgo Real is that a little bit goes a long way. A pea-sized amount is all I need to generate plenty of rich lather with a firm badger brush. For me, I&#x27;ve found that starting with the Musgo Real and a damp badger brush and adding water a little bit at a time is the best way to reach the slick, rich consistency my face loves.    On my skin, it feels fantastic. Combined with the smell, I can&#x27;t wait to shave. I think it is the lanolin, a key ingredient of Musgo Real, but the razor just glides over everything, letting my ultra sharp Feather blade take care of all the work. It rinses out of my badger brush easily.     I tell my friends about how great this stuff is, and many people will be receiving a tube from me on their Birthday.</li>
    <li> I purhased this for use with my Badger hair shaving brush.  I shave with both a straight razor and/or safety razor after recently giving up on the disposable types.    This is the best shave cream I have used yet.  Has the classic barber shop scent, not too prefumed as some others seem.  Just a bit of that nostalgic scent of the barber shop.  Scent fades shortly, so dont worry you wont smell like that all day.    Worked up a thick creamy foam very quickly by simply putting a dab onto my damp brush, the applying directly to my face.  Very quick to foam and applies well.  Interestingly, it even seemed to rinse off of my razor cleaner than many of the other products I have tried.    This is my favorite shaving cream, I will purchase more.  I also enjoyed using [[ASIN:B001JY6RSU Proraso Shaving Soap with Aloe and Green Tea - Ultra Sensitive Skin 150ml/5.2oz]] as well and would recomend that to anyone who prefers shaving soaps to shaving creams.</li>
    <li> This is a twelve dollar tube of shaving cream. It has a really nice scent to it and isn&#x27;t full of synthetic junk. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and gives a much more luxurious shave than Proraso. The last tube I used I managed to get almost 4 months out of with the use of a shave brush. It&#x27;s twelve dollars nice. Can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I keep reading how Proraso is the gold standard of shaving creams, but I don&#x27;t like eucalyptus at all.  Musgo Real not only has a pleasantly subtle masculine scent but also provides a smooth glide and rinses clean from face, brush and blade.  Really can&#x27;t ask for more than the moisturizing and stubble-softening that the glycerin and lanolin afford.  Not having tried TOBS or Truefit and Hill yet, I am very pleased with this purchase and can recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself a tube, match up with a nice double-edge safety razor (I got a Merkur adjustable a couple months back after being appalled by the prices of cartridge blades and would never go back) and find out what a pleasure a nice shave can be.</li>
    <li> This shave cream has an unusal and very pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s also very easy to build into a lather.  A small amount (almond sized) will provide enough lather when mixed with water to get me through a 3 pass shave with enough lather left over for touch ups if needed.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with this shave cream and will buy another tube when this one is empty</li>
    <li> The performance of this shave cream is excellent.  It may not lather up quite as well (or with as little product) as some creams like Taylor of Old Bond Street, or Trufitt &amp; Hill, but the it is extremely moisturizing, very protective, and has a wonderful scent.    I&#x27;ve heard from a friend who I turned on to this cream, that if you use this exclusively with a good brush, you might start feeling your brush getting a bit sticky due to the lanolin, but as I rotate my shave products, and rarely use any one product more than one day in a row (L&#x27;Occitane CADE is an exception, just love that scent!) I&#x27;ve never, ever, noticed a problem.  If a brush does start to get a little gunky, a quick \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; of the brush will solve your problem quickly.</li>
    <li> If this is your first \\&quot;real\\&quot; shave cream, then I think that you picked a good one. Great , old school scent, not as cheap as canned goop but pretty far off from the Truefitt and Hills, and Art of Shavings of the world. (which we will come back to later)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At it&#x27;s price point, I think it&#x27;s a hands down winner. If it is reviewed as a shaving cream,including those more and less expensive, we start losing some points , due to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;The smell, the smell , the smell. What a great , understated , scent. Pairs nicely with the ol&#x27; DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin. This has to be the least expensive cream out there that actually has lanolin in it.&lt;br /&gt;Razor definitely glides across this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t goop up the blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if it&#x27;s so great, then why only three stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;You will use a lot of this stuff to get an equivalent lather to Art of Shaving, Truefitt or really any of the other great creams I&#x27;ve tried. I am no stranger to wet shaving and have logged about 11 years on different brushes, creams, preshave oils, etc. (I am new to DE razors, however) So if I have to use twice as much, which I do, is it really that \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; ? I say barely, so it&#x27;s completely fair to compare to the other products mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like handling a an old style metal tube of toothpaste, which means at some point, to get it all, I would have to fight with it. Which I won&#x27;t. I very much prefer the jars of cream, which I can dip the tips of my brush in and charge in my bowl. I can always get the last \\&quot;drop\\&quot; out of a jar, which at the cost of that stuff, is pretty important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line; I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it but it isn&#x27;t going to be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; cream. Maybe for a Saturday shave , when I have extra time to soak in the scent? Seriously, put a few more bucks into a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; cream, which will last for months, and get a richer lather and more rewarding shave. We deserve it, right?</li>
    <li> After trying dozens of soaps and shave creams, Musgo Real is probably my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is complex.  Fresh, masculine, unique.  Cologne-like, but also natural.  There are hints of patchouli and vetiver and, well, who knows what.  It is a strangely nostalgic scent for me...strange because I can&#x27;t nail down where I&#x27;ve smelled it before.  I smell my hand for a long time after a shave just to get a whiff of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream creates a very good lather and gives me smooth, comfortable shaves.  I seem to get a closer shave with Musgo than with almost any other creams.  It leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that my skin is sensitive to most scented products of any kind and I do get a slight burn from this cream.  It might be the lanolin.  Regardless, I use this cream as the scent and performance far outweigh this mild irritation.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a difference when I shave with this. Skin is less irritated and softer after a shave with the Musgo Real shave cream. Best cream I have used so far. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, this shaving cream has a classic barbershop scent. Lathers up extremely well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great.</li>
    <li> This cream is just OK - the lather is not as thick and lubricated compared to others like Proraso.  The smell is quite nice and lingers on your face forever it seems.  It is that old school barber smell which I love.  I will use this as back up or mix it with shaving soap if needed.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this smell, one of the reasons I wanted to try this shaving cream.  It lathers up really well and when it lathers one the face it almost warms up a little bit.  It also provides a nice cushion.  I am knocking off two stars since I think the smell is not great, it smells like soap and a little medicinal.  This is still better than Gillette and considering this is a relatively expensive cream (compared to Gillette, Barbasol, etc) you get what you pay for.  I just ordered Speick and it&#x27;s coming tomorrow.  I would say it&#x27;s worth a shot if your are looking at something old school, just don&#x27;t expect a super modern scent.</li>
    <li> Glycerine, lanolin, Musgo Real classic scent, what could be better? Quality control.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the inconsistency of the product. Sometimes dense, other times more liquid, sometimes with blue flecks, other times no flecks. I don&#x27;t even know what the flecks are, but why would it vary between batches? That said, I&#x27;ve been using it for years with a double edged safety razor and have found no shave cream I like better: not L&#x27;Occitane, not Nutragena, certainly not any of the grocery store brands. It provides a smooth, moisturizing, well lubricated shave with a subtle, pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> My husband will not use anything but this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave cream thus far.  Musgo has incredibly good razor glide.  With it, I can use my Merkur Futur razor on a setting of 4 (out of 6, which is very aggressive) without razor burn.  This cream should definitely be used with a brush.  Also, it works best for me when the lather is a little \\&quot;wet\\&quot; (just a bit shiny and soft), so I make sure to add adequate water when mixing.  The scent is light and masculine - a very old-school barbershop scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good- a bit like old-school Brut, but more refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers terrifically- really slick, really thick lather.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> If you do nothing else to change your shave routine, buy a cheap brush and some Musgo Real.  This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I have tried all the commercial shaving crap in the explosive-filled cans.  I don&#x27;t care how much you pay for it, or what new hotness they have recently added, it all sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a $5 brush, and this stuff based on a recommendation from a friend, and I have never experienced such an amazing shave!  I upgraded the brush for my birthday to a silvertip badger number from Parker, and it&#x27;s great, but it doesn&#x27;t really perform a lot better with the Musgo.  It doesn&#x27;t require a ton of water to develop incredible lather.  I use a dime-sized amount on either brush, and work it for a bit right on my face.  That&#x27;s enough for three solid passes with some left over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife bought me some really expensive jarred stuff from one of the mall body shop places, and while it has a pleasant smell, it&#x27;s 3x the cost of Musgo Real, AND doesn&#x27;t shave as well.  Musgo has lanolin in it and for my sensitive skin, nothing else works near as well without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the stuff smells fantastic!  It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol / butane smell of the giant shave goo company&#x27;s stuff.  I used unscented for the most part in all shave creams I tried before this.  I was leery of anything with a scent, but I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Costs more but worth it. I will never use aerosol can cream again.  Get a good beaver hair brush and be in heaven</li>
    <li> A good cream. Old school scent with better than average performance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m on my second tube and I think it&#x27;s my favorite. You can use it with or without a brush. I usually don&#x27;t bother with the brush. The lanolin makes it super slippery for a great shave, it smells awesome, and it&#x27;s way cheaper on Amazon than someplace like Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> The perfect shaving cream for warmer days or places!! I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite shave creams.  The aroma is great and the cream gives me a great, smooth shave.  For some reason, Caswell-Massey just discontinued it, but Amazon made my day by carrying it.  Maybe next time I&#x27;ll check Amazon first.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shave cream. Can&#x27;t describe the scent, but it&#x27;s refreshing. You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it. Lather some of this up and you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re in another country for a few moments anyways.</li>
    <li> I must say I am a late adopter of using quality shave creams, pre-shave oils, and wet brush shaving.  I tried 2-3 local tubed creams but was not impressed.  I started using Proraso (made in Italy).  The shave and finish was very nice and smooth.  However, the overbearing eucalyptus was a bit much for every day.  I wanted something with a cleaner, masculine fragrance (I even had a coworker asked if I just used Ben-Gay muscle rub ;)  Anyway, I thought I would try Musgo Real (made in Portugal) and the winner for me is Musgo Real.  The velvety, manly result with a hot wet shave brush (Parker which I purchased on Amazon) is spot on!  Sorry Italy, hello Portugal!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to order the Musgo Real shave balm and pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> Nice lather and smells great</li>
    <li> This cream is a great cream it keeps the blade smoothly running across my face and the different smells are wonderful. this one however is not my favorite smell. its a little too musky for my taste not to say its an unpleasant smell. It is not! just not my style the cream however is great and I would suggest it for anyone</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing shaving cream I have found to date.  A great lather and oils which require only a dab or two per shave</li>
    <li> I shave with a traditional double-edged safety razor and a badger hair brush, every other day at most.  And when I do, I intend to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musgo Real is one of those great finds: bargain-priced but delivers a spa-like shaving experience.  You cannot go wrong with this stuff.  There are others in this product space--Proraso, for one--but this is the one I prefer for everyday shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a particularly manly product that does the job very well.  I like the tube approach and just a little bit of this thick shaving cream puts down a very strong moist base for shaving.  It&#x27;s cool looking and beats anything in an aerosol can.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my every-day cream, but a GREAT treat for those mornings when I&#x27;ve a few extra minutes and need some class.  4/27/2016 bought it again and It&#x27;s still gives a 5 star shave!</li>
    <li> Men that use canned shaving foam ought to give this a try. You will never buy a can of foam again.</li>
    <li> Nice shave cream.  On par with Porasso.  Old school scent.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving. This product is awesome. I get super close shaves without any irritation. In my opinion it works better on my face than Taylor of Old Bond Street cream which I purchased first. Musgo Real is much better. It also rinses very well and easily off my razor, unlike the TOBS cream. The smell is very masculine and great, as well. I have become a Musgo Real loyal customer because of the performance of this cream. I will definitely purchase this cream again.</li>
    <li> bought this as a replacement for the one I left at a relatives house after visiting years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious concentrated European, shave paste that lathers-up very nicely &amp; smells great. My favorite travel shave cream.</li>
    <li> One of my three best creams.It is part of my daily rotation and the go to 1 for gifts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting old...28 next month.  But I&#x27;m already bald, so I look 40.  So for me it&#x27;s totally cool to use this and have the definite dad-like 70&#x27;s cologny smell linger for a while.  It builds a great lather, and works up there with my other favorite tube creams.  Try the Sandalwood and the Eucalyptus that are similar.  Those both rock too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proraso (white and green tubs) with a boar brush to lather for several years and I got this for my birthday this summer.  It has not replaced the proraso as I feel I get a similar shave with both but I do find that it does have a few advantages over my previous soap.  First I love the scent of musgo real much more than the proraso but your mileage may vary, and second this is my first cream that had lanolin and my skin definitely appreciates it my skin feels much smoother and hydrated with this than the proraso. Proraso is still my main go to as I really like the feel of the menthol especially on hot summer days, but as the weather turns cooler I think I&#x27;ll be using the musgo more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be warned it comes in a toothpaste shaped tube, my wife has almost brushed her teeth with this stuff twice when I forgot to put it on the proper shelf.</li>
    <li> The soap smells great, lathers thicker than anything I have ever used but it causes me to breakout in a rash. I did a little research and apparently I have a lanolin allergy. If your not allergic to lanolin you should love this soap.</li>
    <li> A clean-shaven man who smells a little soapy is an excellent thing. This is a classic, alluring scent. I can&#x27;t speak to its tonsorial qualities firsthand, but I dig it.</li>
    <li> I expected more scent &amp; the lather wasn&#x27;t very impressive. OK but not for me. Some love it - no problem but I expect lather.</li>
    <li> This is excellent shave cream.  I have used a variety of creams and soaps (AOS, Proraso, Mitchell&#x27;s, etc) in the past and this easily competes with all of them.  Although my general preference is to lean towards soaps, it only takes a pea size dollop of this cream to work up a slick and thick lather, which results in a very comfortable shave (even with aggressive razors like the R41).  After the shave this washes up very cleanly and quickly, and the subtle fragrance that I would describe as earthy but very pleasant does not linger.    I recommend at least trying this product, but it&#x27;s important to note that what is good for one person may not be for another.</li>
    <li> A good shaving cream you should probably try.  Very few creams lather as well as Musgo, and the shaving comfort is also quite good.  The scent is a problem for me and why I can&#x27;t use it but scent is mostly subjective.  Lots of people love the Musgo scent.  This and Speick are two of the best quality values available in a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I had a friend ask me while sitting at a bar how I shaved so close.  That was very unexpected.  I referred him to Musgo Real shave cream.  You only need a dollop for a nice lathery shave.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream.  Smooth shaving and nice masculine scent.</li>
    <li> The closest shave I have ever gotten is with this shave cream. I give it as gifts when I can.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube (first one lasted almost an entire year).  I love the smell- reminds me of fresh cut grass.  Will continue to buy in the future.</li>
    <li> One of the very best shave creams available.</li>
    <li> Musgo Real has a mild scent and is designed for its best use with a shaving brush to create a lather.&lt;br /&gt;I rotate between several shaving creams and sometimes mix them together.  This cream can go&lt;br /&gt;solo or be used with other creams for your grooming.  The price was fine and no skin reactions occured.</li>
    <li> Well, this may be THE best shaving cream I have ever used. If it is not the best, it is in the Top 3, ever.  The lanolin is the ticket here. After applying with a brush, the shave is sooooooooooo smooth and comfortable. The scent is soooooooooo complex and interesting.  If I had to choose on cream to shave with for the duration, it might be Musgo Real!</li>
    <li> I like this shave cream, but I don&#x27;t know that I will reorder. It is a bit expensive for what you get. It travels well. A dollop will produce a decent amount of lather. It smells good and rinses clean. I can get all that and more for a lot less with Van Der Hagen or Col Conk. But, for now, it is a nice change in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Considering everyone&#x27;s skin is different I will say My skin likes Musgo Real better than any cream I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Truffit Hill, Geo Trumper, Taylor of Old Bond, among others. Some of them are great creams.&lt;br /&gt; But I have discovered over the years I always compare them to Musgo Real and always reorder Musgo after a container or two of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musgo  lathers faster for me. I can shave immediately after applying as well. Perhaps due to it being one of the few creams out there with lanolin in it. The the smell is clean and masculine. Honestly the only times in the last few years I have had my styptic pencil out is when I have been using another (more expensive) cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in many situations you get what you pay for. This product does Not fall into that category. It is by far less expensive than some of the other boutique creams and in my opinion is a superior shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Lathered up very quickly and nicely. Provided a lot of slickness/lubrication during the shave. It might outperform Prorasso in these two categories, I&#x27;ll have to try the two back to back to do a fair comparison. Not crazy about the scent.  It&#x27;s not offensive, just not what I was looking for.  A little too sweet, if I can use that to describe a scent. I might give the Oak Moss scent a try next time.</li>
    <li> This might be the worst shaving cream I have ever tried. It did not lubricate my face at all when I shaved with it. Feels like it has lye in it and dried out my skin. Scent is like a mixture of Ivory bar soap and that Clubman&#x27;s powder they use at barber shops. Used it once and threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used, but its also easily 10 times more expensive than other shaving creams I&#x27;ve used in the past. Other reviewers have noted that one tube would last for a longer duration than normal aerosol creams, but I am skeptical based on my current rate of consumption. Either way, if you want the best, this is it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really enjoyed it.  It smells great and performs well.  Top quality!</li>
    <li> My husband likes the smooth, see through shave.</li>
    <li> Having previously tried out Musgo Real&#x27;s soap, I knew what to expect with this product.  That being a high quality men&#x27;s product with a great scent, and this shaving cream delievered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some time for me to get the lather making process right.  (I was using too much water and not enough cream.)  But when I got the right amount of cream and water figured out, great lathers followed.  It is not an extremely thick lather, but it is still luxurious.  My blade just glides over it, giving me a very smooth and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is outstanding.  I am not really good at explaining smells, so take the following with a grain of salt.  It is masculine with a hint of cut hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubes last a long time too.</li>
    <li> Super slippy.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Used with a good brush you can adjust how wet or dry a shave you get.&lt;br /&gt;Good with a straight, safety or disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Over the past year, I&#x27;ve tried several additional high end shaving creams: Taylor of Old Bond Street, George F. Trumper, St James of London, and Truefitt &amp; Hill.  I&#x27;ve liked the Musgo Real better than the TOBS or the GFT, but not quite as well as the T&amp;H or the SJL. I use a brush and a cartridge razor from Harry&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the scent is very pleasant; less of a cologne smell than the other creams I listed, and very enjoyable.  The scent is not particularly strong and does not linger long.  The lather is not as rich as the lather from the T&amp;H or SJL, but protects well and facilitates a good quality shave (though no better than the T&amp;H or SJL).  The price is lower than the SJL and T&amp;H, and on par with the TOBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: this cream and the TOBS both leave a similar texture to my skin after shaving. The feel of my skin is better than with the GFT (which irritates my skin), but it does not feel as &#x27;healthy&#x27; as the T&amp;H and SJL.  I notice a bit more irritation when using the Musgo than with the T&amp;H or SJL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is in the middle of the pack of the high end shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried (though far, far superior to the gels and foams in a can that I used for decades before).  Better than TOBS and GFT, not quite as good as the T&amp;H or SJL.</li>
    <li> Used this today for the first time.  I small dab lathered up beautifully with my Omega big boar.  Amazing amount of lather for such a small amount of cream.  Keep in mind that this cream is \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot;....it likes a lot of water.  But it provides more than enough lather for a thorough 3 pass shave.  Didn&#x27;t dry out, kept a nice consistency.  Slick shave, not the slickest but slick enough.  Clean piney smell, really old school.  Much better product than Proaso green tub.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream on a recommendation from a different site. I typically use Proraso products and wanted to give this a try. I have to say that I feel this cream is very nice and laters and protects just as good as any other cream, including Proraso. It has a nice, light, old school fragrance and overall I would recommend to anyone looking to add new creams to their shaving lineup.</li>
