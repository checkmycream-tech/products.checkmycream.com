      <li>For a while I even made my own deodorant, but it could not keep the stink away.  </li>
      <li>the cream seems to work better for me,but still a good deoderant.</li>
      <li>It does smell nice though.</li>
      <li>She was not allergic to this one, but it was not as effective as an anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light and pleasant and not at all overwhelming.  </li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>

      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this on for 24 hours, and it&#x27;s already 200% better than the cream, it smells nicer</li>
      <li>Awesome deodorant, works wonders, last for more than two days, I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I like the cream/paste better.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a better deodorant than the homemade one I use.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>works really well with no residue and good on your skin.</li>
      <li>and she smells nice and fresh at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>But the fact that I can go all day and not stink is pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have been aluminum free for over a year now.</li>
      <li>Note:  while it is aluminum free, it is not metal free (zinc is used instead).</li>
      <li>The drug store aisle is filled with nothing but antiperspirants for women.</li>
      <li>Not only does it work, it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>This was my first attempt at kicking anti-antiperspirant, and I gave it more than a week to come through</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original lavillin products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind on the shelf at my local stores and none of them have worked for anything more than &amp;#34;covering up&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>then you are probably in a similar situation-- good luck</li>
      <li>Mild nondescript clean scent.  </li>
      <li>can full of rejects and smelly pits.</li>
      <li>This product worked fine at first, but once it starts to wear off, a foul odor of a mix of the Lavilin and sweat has penetrated my skin.</li>
      <li>It says the product is more effective after frequent and repeated use so if there is a major change I&#x27;ll provide an update.</li>
      <li>clean my pits first-  </li>
      <li>I have a very health conscious fiancee who has been looking for over a year for an effective non-toxic deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I like Arm &amp; Hammer natural better.</li>
      <li>Which is all I&#x27;m asking for and is way better than the others I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
      <li>it is OVER QUICK - 1 minute I smell ok and the next grosser than ever!&lt;br /&gt;inconsistent</li>
      <li>I would be contaminating the deodorant with the bacteria that is causing the smell if I didn&#x27;t disinfect the pits first.</li>
      <li>Glad I got it, actually, I ordered two of these.</li>
      <li>Living in a scorching hot, humid area doesn&#x27;t hlp.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>Still, this is better than multiple times a day</li>
      <li>Granted it hasn&#x27;t been terribly hot, so</li>
      <li>I cannot express enough how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Really like this product!</li>
      <li>It did seem to keep BO pretty much at bay.  </li>
      <li>My wife has sensitive skin, and she is allergic to many such products.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s clean and would reapply deodorant 3-4x daily sometimes to no avail.&lt;br</li>
      <li>was just getting ready to order more when I saw the ratings had come down.  </li>
      <li>secret 48 hour and the non aluminum soft and dri worked best -- lasting</li>
      <li>I have super dry, super sensitive skin, and I can stink after workouts.  </li>
      <li>works well but is HIGHLY fragrant.  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t what I would consider feminine, it&#x27;s a lot nicer than what boys in high school use.</li>
      <li>It really did prevent odor longer than any other aluminum free deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;The search continues..</li>
      <li>It also took a little more than a month to show up.</li>
      <li>Even after I discontinued using this product, the foul odor is still there after normal deodorant wears off.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that this lasts 48 hours, but it definitely lasts a full 12-24.</li>
      <li>I really mean it was effective at stopping any odor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a deodorant free of alcohol and aluminum that actually works.</li>
      <li>I read the 1 star ratings and I have to say I&#x27;m very surprised.  </li>
      <li>It caused me to have odor which I usually do not ever have.</li>
      <li>This burned my under arm and left redness the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>So far - this stuff is tops.  </li>
      <li>so far she has to re-apply every morning.  </li>
      <li>the rock and liquid, soft &amp; dri, and a nano silver product and also  a home made coconut oil and baking soda</li>
      <li>To be clear, it works on people like me who genuinely sweat rather than &#x27;glow&#x27;, who live in the basking sunshine and work hard to break a sweat at some point in the day, and when I say the product works</li>
      <li>It dried quick too.</li>
      <li>I could barely go a day with toms.  </li>
      <li>the only natural deodorant that works for me this well.</li>
      <li>I workout 6 days a week and this combo keeps me just as dry as normal aluminum products.</li>
      <li>Smelled subtle and clean in the dispenser.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Lavilin long lasting deodorant (a sticky paste) for years as no other product seems to work with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>This deodorant works amazingly well, only reason it gets 2 stars from me is because it made me break out LIKE CRAZY.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream and the roll-on.  I prefer the roll-on only because it&#x27;s quicker to apply since I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands afterwards.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and use it maybe once a week.  It&#x27;s the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just getting ready to order more when I saw the ratings had come down.  I read the 1 star ratings and I have to say I&#x27;m very surprised.  I have super dry, super sensitive skin, and I can stink after workouts.  I have never had any sensitivity with Lavilin ever and it works for a week at a time.  It&#x27;s absolutelly amazing.  Can&#x27;t have wondering about those reviews....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Best. Deodorant. Ever.</li>
    <li> love it. the only natural deodorant that works for me this well. Have tried about 30 different ones even homemade.</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING! Smells great. Does leave my underarms a little sensitive though.</li>
    <li> It works!!!! Smells great.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the company here, but I think I had an allergic reaction to the product. Be careful.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really works.  I only apply once every 72 hours (3 days).  It has a pleasant scent when applied.  It does take some time to dry after application.  Note:  while it is aluminum free, it is not metal free (zinc is used instead).</li>
    <li> works really well with no residue and good on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a deodorant free of alcohol and aluminum that actually works. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that this lasts 48 hours, but it definitely lasts a full 12-24. Which is all I&#x27;m asking for and is way better than the others I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
    <li> This product smells gross and does not work. It smells like baby powder. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try this deodorant, because I found out as soon as I got it that the ingredients on the label did not match the ingredients listed on the order page. This deodorant has soy oil in it, so I unfortunately can&#x27;t use it due to an allergy. I sent it back and got a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that it has an extremely strong artificial flowery smell that I can only imagine would be unpleasant to have floating around with me for the whole day. I don&#x27;t know if the smell dissipates or not upon application.</li>
    <li> This is not the product I received. The product I did receive contains different ingredients which involves toxins. I am very disappointed I did not receive the healthy product advertised here.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I had used the Lavilin cream for many years, but you have to put it on at night, which is a little inconvenient. The roll-on is very effective. Even my teenager will use it.</li>
    <li> This product worked fine at first, but once it starts to wear off, a foul odor of a mix of the Lavilin and sweat has penetrated my skin. Even after I discontinued using this product, the foul odor is still there after normal deodorant wears off. Also, this doesn&#x27;t even wear for 24 hours without it smelling terrible.</li>
    <li> Did NOT work. I could smell myself by the afternoon and it dried out my skin.</li>
    <li> Only thing I have found that actually works!</li>
    <li> I have been aluminum free for over a year now. I combine this product with Lavilin paste after showering. I roll-on deodorant and then apply a finger tip of the paste, using the roll-on liquid already on my skin to even out the paste.  I then use just the roll-on until the next shower. I workout 6 days a week and this combo keeps me just as dry as normal aluminum products. Love it.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at kicking anti-antiperspirant, and I gave it more than a week to come through but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed all of the directions (shake well, put on before bed, etc.), and I had to keep reapplying every couple of hours. It smells really strong, and when it wore off I smelled really bad. I felt so icky and was hyper aware of my armpits throughout each day. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Lasts long and doesn&#x27;t stain. Really like this product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well: it takes too long to dry, only works for a couple of hrs if you are not active, and there is no expiration date.</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant, works wonders, last for more than two days, I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s and it sucks compared to this. I could barely go a day with toms.  I&#x27;ve noticed that with Lavilin, I can even miss a day, best healthy no aluminum/alcohol deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original lavillin products. Even the regular roll on, I could hardly believe this was even the same product. The foreign language its written in seems the same. But I would not recommend this. It caused me to have odor which I usually do not ever have. It also took a little more than a month to show up.</li>
    <li> This burned my under arm and left redness the first time I used it. I did not use it again as it seemed to be very irritating to my skin.  It did seem to keep BO pretty much at bay.  Please note - this is NOT and antiperspirant - meaning that it does not keep you dry.  It is a deodorant, meaning that it keeps you from stinking.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lavilin products for a year now, and I discovered the roll-on this February.  It has changed my life!  I have a severe allergy to most anti-persperants and deodorants.  I get rashes, break out, and skin peeling.  For a while I even made my own deodorant, but it could not keep the stink away.  This product works so well.  I haven&#x27;t actually gone 72 hours, because I apply every day.  But the fact that I can go all day and not stink is pretty amazing.  I do get sweaty arm pits, but its not stinky.  The smell of the deodorant is pleasant, and feminine.</li>
    <li> This is the only aluminum-free deodorant that actually works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind on the shelf at my local stores and none of them have worked for anything more than &amp;#34;covering up&amp;#34;.  This actually works!!  It&#x27;s not cheap but in my line of work, I can&#x27;t afford to be stinky and if I can avoid nasty chemicals, I prefer to do so.  This does just that!</li>
    <li> Actually works.  To be clear, it works on people like me who genuinely sweat rather than &#x27;glow&#x27;, who live in the basking sunshine and work hard to break a sweat at some point in the day, and when I say the product works I really mean it was effective at stopping any odor.  Zero irritation.  Mild nondescript clean scent.  It dried quick too.</li>
    <li> works well but is HIGHLY fragrant.  Didn&#x27;t care for that at all.</li>
    <li> the cream seems to work better for me,but still a good deoderant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this on for 24 hours, and it&#x27;s already 200% better than the cream, it smells nicer and it&#x27;s actually WORKING and it FEELS nicer, the cream felt sticky.  Granted it hasn&#x27;t been terribly hot, so I&#x27;ll let you know if it fails when the temps get over 85.  For the moment, I&#x27;m a happy camper!  :)</li>
    <li> it works  no aluminium</li>
    <li> I use this daily as my go-to deodorant. The only time I&#x27;ve had issues is when my armpit hair becomes too long and it&#x27;s not getting applied to my skin. One swipe is all I need as an active male during the summer time. These also won&#x27;t leave stains in your clothing unlike anti-antiperspirants. The smell isn&#x27;t what I would consider feminine, it&#x27;s a lot nicer than what boys in high school use.</li>
    <li> So far - this stuff is tops.  I have a very health conscious fiancee who has been looking for over a year for an effective non-toxic deodorant.  She tends to stink by the end of a stressful work day and workout and it&#x27;s pretty unpleasant.  She&#x27;s clean and would reapply deodorant 3-4x daily sometimes to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s been using this product for about a week now and she smells nice and fresh at the end of the day.  It says it works for 72 hours but so far she has to re-apply every morning.  Still, this is better than multiple times a day and she still stinks.  She&#x27;s reported that although it is not an anti-perspirant she feels that she&#x27;s sweating slightly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mentioned the scent but it&#x27;s light and pleasant and not at all overwhelming.  I&#x27;ll take it over onions any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank GOD she finally found something... I was losing hope.  It says the product is more effective after frequent and repeated use so if there is a major change I&#x27;ll provide an update.</li>
    <li> Pavilion is all you need! I would never be without it.</li>
    <li> My wife has sensitive skin, and she is allergic to many such products. She was not allergic to this one, but it was not as effective as an anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lavalin paste for 20 years and this is easier to apply, works as well, easy to handle--paste was difficult to apply and then wash off hands--doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes. Lastly, it does not cause irritation and itchiness as other liquid roll-ons.</li>
    <li> While exercising or mid day this did not work. I like Arm &amp; Hammer natural better. Plus it is appropriately $2.00</li>
    <li> Can i give it a half of a star?  Smelled subtle and clean in the dispenser. Took half an hour to dry and made me almost pass out after an hour of wear. Its like it took an armpit bomb and exploded it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works amazingly well, only reason it gets 2 stars from me is because it made me break out LIKE CRAZY. My arm pits were completely raw after using it a few times and took over a month to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer! It really did prevent odor longer than any other aluminum free deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;The search continues..</li>
    <li> Great product, works just as advertized.  Glad I got it, actually, I ordered two of these.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lavilin long lasting deodorant (a sticky paste) for years as no other product seems to work with my body chemistry. This roll on is so much more convenient and easy to use, hallelujah!</li>
    <li> Lavalin works good mostly&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;effective for most of a day ( on my body chemistry  ) -&lt;br /&gt;no aluminum!&lt;br /&gt;acceptable scent&lt;br /&gt;Cons- why I did not give 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;1)can not wear dark sleeveless clothes white powder rubs off&lt;br /&gt;2)rolls on goopy &amp; takes a long time maybe15 min? to dry&lt;br /&gt;3)costly and is not available in stores&lt;br /&gt;4)when the effectiveness is done it is OVER QUICK - 1 minute I smell ok and the next grosser than ever!&lt;br /&gt;inconsistent odor protection 6-15 hours&lt;br /&gt;5) dries out my underarm skin and makes it flaky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you continue to read the rest- and are researching like I did- then you are probably in a similar situation-- good luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI  I wash my body and then wash my pits at least 3 times in the shower with antibacterial soap daily! I get smelly within minutes of getting out of the shower if I do not apply something asap -and I tried non aluminum , toms, natures gate, crystal -both the rock and liquid, soft &amp; dri, and a nano silver product and also  a home made coconut oil and baking soda concoction.&lt;br /&gt; I  gave up on natural  and went to aluminum and tried arm n hammer, degree, dove, secret tropical and secret 48 hour&lt;br /&gt;The secret 48 hour and the non aluminum soft and dri worked best -- lasting only few hours before I began to wreak again.&lt;br /&gt; The home made recipe and silver worked good but both gave me terrible deep sores and rash.  degree and toms were the biggest failures for my chemistry.&lt;br /&gt; I now carry alcohol wipes and the deodorant in my purse is lavalin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how the re apply is meant to be done - the instructions are not clear-&lt;br /&gt;I clean my pits first-  before applying or re-applying--I am assuming if I am stinky- I would be contaminating the deodorant with the bacteria that is causing the smell if I didn&#x27;t disinfect the pits first.</li>
    <li> Concerned with the toxic aluminum in anti-perspirants, I stopped using them. The drug store aisle is filled with nothing but antiperspirants for women. If there is a deodorant only option, it usually has another toxic chemical hiding in the ingredient list ( like triclosan or triclocarban). I tried numerous natural deodorant products and they either worked for only a few hours or not at all and some made me break out in horrible rashes. I finally found one organic spray made with essentials oils that worked well ( I only needed to reapply it once a day), but they stopped making it. Boo!! So it was back to searching. I had a trash can full of rejects and smelly pits. Finding a healthy alternative that actually worked seemed impossible and I found myself having to apply the horrible antiperspirants whenever I was in situations where I knew the ineffective deodorants would leave me offending everyone around. Living in a scorching hot, humid area doesn&#x27;t hlp.&lt;br /&gt;Then ... I found this deodorant!!!! Not only does it work, it smells amazing! I cannot express enough how much I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I apply it when I get out of the shower and wait until it dries to get dressed. If I&#x27;m not doing anything too extreme, like working up a sweat in the heat, it seems to last for days without needing to reapply. Another benefit, it leaves my armpits feeling like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that I have found myself needing to reapply it when I am outside working up a serious sweat in the summer sun, but once I reapply it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but I seriously think if you are on the fence about buying this, you should go for it!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did. This is THE BEST deodorant out there!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. I was looking for a better deodorant than the homemade one I use. I didn&#x27;t get irritated, it just didn&#x27;t keep odor away. My husband and mother, however, use the deodorant without any odor issues. Seems to work for them. The roll on Lavillin  goes on wet and stays wet for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like the cream/paste better.  This roll on takes forever to dry, I have to use a blow dryer to get it to dry faster! It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> Does not work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product because it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews stated. I have stayed odor-free and dry for less than a day, definitely not 72 hours.</li>
