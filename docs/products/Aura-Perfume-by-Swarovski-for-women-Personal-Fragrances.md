    <li> Blind buy for me this was, ordered it solely because of the brand name and the beautiful bottle, and BOY was this an unexpected -and wonderful!- surprise. I will never understand how this is not a top seller. BEAUTIFUL fragrance, suuuuper classy.</li>
    <li> Product was fine, price was right… A little unnerved by the fact that the package had been opened.</li>
    <li> I searched retail locations for the product due to my girlfriends request.  The prices were pretty high so I figured I would check out Amazon.  The product was received promptly and was packaged well.  She loved the gift.  I would recommend purchasing this item.</li>

    <li> I bought this as a present for me wife and she totally loved it so I guess it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Read the instructions before opening. It will save you a lot of time if you are new to it.</li>
    <li> This is a very lovely scent, a light sexy musk that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. My complaint is that when I received the package I could tell the box had been open before. Also there was a promotional code on the box to use on Swarovski.com and someone had cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed that Amazon would send someone merchandise like this.</li>
    <li> My Girl was very impressed with this Fragrace. Will buy the larger bottle next time. We did not know that Swarovki produced Parfume.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and wish it will always be available.  Thank you for helping me get it!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife still thinks that this is a duplicate version of the original that she tried at the store. YMMV</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this perfume when I was overseas at a perfume store. Since I could not find it in the shops near where I live, I ordered it from Amazon. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The bottle is very nice and larger than I expected. Love the perfume!</li>
    <li> A very pleasant smell suited for an elegant lady,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the box reads:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Aura of love&lt;br /&gt;Crystal transforms into a luminescent perfume. A sparkling floral bouquet for an aura that dazzles with happiness.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is adorned with a floral patterned lace veil. This is a limited edition and on the cap of the bottle there is a big Swarovski crystals and a few smaller ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is outstanding. It lasts and lasts, and I got compliments galore.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this fragrance, but make sure you get the Eau de Parfum.</li>
    <li> Love my Aura Eau De Parfum ... and even though I wore it for the first time today --- I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it!  Great blend of sweet, yet spicy, mellow yet musky scents in a most attractive bottle ... worthy of display as artwork!</li>
    <li> BUT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I NOTICED INSIDE THE BOX WAS A CODE TO GET A FREE PRODUCT AND IT HAD BEEN REMOVED WITH A RAZOR BLADE OR SOME SHARP OBJECT SO THAT I COULD NOT CLAIM IT.</li>
    <li> My friend loved the fragrance and display case..bought another one!</li>
