    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a little pricey but you honestly get what you pay for. Sets really well and doesn&#x27;t flake and isn&#x27;t greasy either.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.  Gives you the ability to manipulate the hair when you put it on and then stay firm for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this on his very short, thick hair for several years now.  He loves it.  Keeps his hair in place and smells great.  Washes out with just water, too.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for men on the market.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been happier!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Next parchase will pay a faster delivery&lt;br /&gt;Use this product on dry hair for best results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every day for close to 4 years.  In that time I&#x27;ve had anywhere from 1inch to 6inch length hair, and it works great across the spectrum.  Not too sticky and definitely not hard like gel.  Provides just enough hold to keep hair in place throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Only stuff that holds without the crunch, defiantly recommend this product to any guy who wants a hold without a crunchy feel..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product ( and buying it from this source) for well over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part: it WILL not give you that gel or greasy mousse look. People don&#x27;t even know I have this in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments. Gives you that &amp;#34;I spent 20 minutes on my hair&amp;#34; look, but I spend less than 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are kinda vague though. If you have fine hair, (read: me) putting this in towl dried damp hair and letting it dry will give you TONS of volume after you style it. And no greasy look. And keep frizz and fly-aways down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells quite manly. Like a musk I think.</li>
    <li> Hands down the absolute best hair product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is a personal favorite of mine and it lasts all day in all kinds of weather and humidity. A little pricing over the big box stores but well worth it.</li>
    <li> One of the best Molding Paste without changing your hair nature color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair pastes, gels, creams, etc.  My light wispy hair is uncooperative and easily messed up.  The Redken paste is the first hair product I&#x27;ve used that looked great all day.  It keeps the hair in place but looks natural and isn&#x27;t sticky to touch.  It&#x27;s easy to apply after a shower.  By far the best hair product experience I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Works great no matter if your hair is wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want the wet crusty look of traditional gel. This paste is white but once you apply it to your hair it isn&#x27;t noticeable. Hold the hair extremely well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite style wax / paste. It was great to be able to find it on Amazon for a competitive price.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have every used. I have tried everything for my hair and this is the best by far hands down. It holds my thick hair in place without the look of a firm gel. There is also no white residue. I used to use the Redkin gel but this is by far much better. Once you buy it you will always want it. Be warned. I order these two at a time just so I have an extra at all times. If I could buy a dozen at a time, I would.</li>
    <li> I got this product in time, in good condition, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mix between a gel and a pomade.  Make managing my hair quickly and easily.  I will use pomade on top of this product, mainly after a haircut because hair will stick out.  But after a week or so, my hair is long enough for this product to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> One of my dearest friends is addicted to this stuff.  He absolutely refuses to use anything else.  It&#x27;s hard to find, so when I find it, I try to get it for him.  In a set like this, it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
