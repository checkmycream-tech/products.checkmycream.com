      <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles or many lines yet, but do get some puffiness in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the larger one in a glass container and for some reason this smaller size works better..</li>
      <li>The caffeine is not in the first few ingredients like they make it sound.</li>

<li> am a woman of color and it is very hard to find creams that actually work for our skin type unless its makeup or&lt;br /&gt;foundations, concealers.</li>
<li> I purchased this directly from the manufacturer for a crazy discount on Black Friday.  </li>
<li> Particularioy under my left eye I get a small little poof that makes me look very tired.</li>
<li> (I usually wait 10-15 minutes after all my face products are applied before moving on to makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used many products for my puffy eyes and this one is the worst!</li>
<li> The small tube is very small.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it does nothing for my dark circles but did leave the skin around my eyes feeling smoother.</li>
<li> NOT SO TIRED LOOKING</li>
<li> Waste of money :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wanted to like this coffee bean eye cream but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I broke out with little red bumps around my eyes. But it does smell nice; the fragrance wasn&#x27;t bothersome to me. I may try it on my elbows and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonderful.  Takes the morning puffiness right away. The smell is very nice also.  Gave it to a friend and she loved it too.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is good and moisturizing, but it&#x27;s not life changing.  My eyes don&#x27;t look more awake or anything.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream that fulfills all my requirements of being organic, natural and vegan. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle  worker, but it is a good quality eye cream.  I have seen slight changes in under eye circles but not a drastic difference. I am only 23, but I maybe be helping with preventing premature wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews it seemed that this helped for puffy eyes. It did not for me and left a greasy film and stung my eyes. It does have a funny small but I don&#x27;t care. The caffeine is not in the first few ingredients like they make it sound. I am returning this.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd purchase--keeps area around the eyes moist.  Very pleased with this product.  I will continue to use this cream, best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and did not notice any difference at all. I have used many products for my puffy eyes and this one is the worst! Waste of money :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and even though i like the product, it smells nice, it feels nice but it doesn&#x27;t seem to decrease puffiness or very minimally anyway.  I still use it sometimes because it&#x27;s all natural and a little goes a long way, but i&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s doing much.  I bought I*Light and instantly liked that better.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles or many lines yet, but do get some puffiness in the morning.  I like I*light better.  It might be worth a try for others.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and have to say that overall...I do like it. It smells nice just like coffee and vanilla, and it feels nice on the skin. Most eye creams are basically super moisturizers so you have to keep that into consideration when buying these things. I like it because it has less ingredients and seems more natural than most eye creams. I feel for me it has helped a bit with the bags under my eyes and some of the fine wrinkles I have around the crows area. For it to help with bags under your eyes, you have to consider what is causing it. It is not a cure all and wont help if your bags are a result of some underlying condition in which creams would not work.</li>
    <li> Yes,this cream is PHENOMENAL because it works.&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman of color and it is very hard to find creams that actually work for our skin type unless its makeup or&lt;br /&gt;foundations, concealers. I love the progress of this cream and notice and huge difference in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice daily Am/Pm because I needed the product to work fast and its all natural so what harm could it do to my skin.</li>
    <li> Great for dark circles and fine lines around the eyes- it also smells delicious and it&#x27;s wonderful that it&#x27;s both effective and all natural.</li>
    <li> still dry around eyes after application. Coffee scent old. One of the least favorate of 100 pure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of other products for my under eye bags, but keep coming back to this one.  I purchased the larger one in a glass container and for some reason this smaller size works better..</li>
    <li> May be \\&quot;organic\\&quot; but it caused a allergic reaction for me. It moisterized for me but it did not get rid of my dark circles and somewhat helped my puffiness. But now I have bumps all over my eye area and its itchy. Lesson of the day: just because it&#x27;s organic doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t be sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I have used this before bed and in the morning to prevent swelling under my eyes. No different combination of useasge has made a difference. I do not really have bags or very puffy eyes. It&#x27;s just occasionally they swell overnight. Particularioy under my left eye I get a small little poof that makes me look very tired.This cream did not help at all. It is a very smooth texture and seems to moisturize well. If you like the smell of coffee beans you will LOVE this scent. The small tube is very small. From the pic I assumed it would be larger. But it still lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> With large inherited bags under my eyes, I was so hoping that this product would eliminate them as others have experienced. But it did nothing for me. The only positive is that it is a cream and is easy on your skin and it does not need to be rinsed off.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the same size as I had before, but the packaging had changed and its quite a bit smaller for almost the same price. Next time I will be sure to check the size!</li>
    <li> read that goldie hawns daughter used this so i wanted to try it.  after using 1/2 the tube, i really didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for it.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> i had misread when i purchased this..i was looking for an all natural eye primer to put on before eye shadow...this doesn&#x27;t serve that purpose but does moisturize and has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This one is so far one of the best organic product line which never contains any harmful chemicals inside. I am so happy to find this product in amazon with this price. I also knew that coffee bean cream is also working great to dark circles, so I hopefully have a good results in my dark circle problem. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this directly from the manufacturer for a crazy discount on Black Friday.  I WILL purchase again at full price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have noticeable lines that I am trying to reverse; I use this as a preventive measure added to my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic, like Kona coffee, and doesn&#x27;t last long at all OR make my eyes sting.&lt;br /&gt;It is so smooth when applying.  I try to dab until absorbed, but it is so nice and slippery that I have rubbed it in and there was no tugging.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and hasn&#x27;t interacted negatively with foundation going on over it after it is completely dried.  (I usually wait 10-15 minutes after all my face products are applied before moving on to makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***  2.18.13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for 2.5 months now, and there seems to be at least that long left in the tube, so great value for quantity.  I&#x27;m not so sure about repurchasing though, as over the last 1.5 months or so, I&#x27;ve had a few tiny pimples in my delicate eye area that I assume are being caused by this product.  I&#x27;m not saying that it is THIS product, just that maybe I am personally sensitive to eye creams in general.  For the sake of simplicity, I think I&#x27;ll just be dabbing coconut oil around as I already use it on the rest of my face at night anyway.</li>
    <li> I AM REALLY LIKING THIS PRODUCT MY EYES SEEM TO LOOK BRIGHTER NOT SO TIRED LOOKING ALWAYS HAVE HAD DARK CIRCLES BUT THIS REALLY HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to reduce the appearance of the bags under my eyes.  This product does not live up to its claim.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I love the smell of caffeine so if you are not a fan, please look elsewhere. Unfortunately, it does nothing for my dark circles but did leave the skin around my eyes feeling smoother.</li>
    <li> Makes my under look much better and its all natural.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. It smells wonderful and is moisturizing. It lightens my dark circles a little bit. It doesn&#x27;t make them go away, but I still think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I tend to get puffy eyes in the morning and bought this after reading a recommendation in a popular magazine. I was not disappointed.  It definitely helps with puffiness and I layer another regular cream or eye cream over it for extra moisture.</li>
