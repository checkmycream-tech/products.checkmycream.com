    <li> I received this product in December as a Xmas gift and it was defective as it came out as &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; .  I contacted the seller and they said they would replace the product.  They are out of stock and not good at communication at all throughout this process.  I had to constantly contact them to get updates.  I requested a full refund so I could purchase the product elsewhere.  Again, I have to constantly contact them with NO SUCCESS in receiving my credit yet.  This has been going on for over 4 weeks.  I will go directly to Ulta to purchase this product.  I did not save the $20 as initially thought, as I had to pay $8 to ship the product back and have been nothing but trouble in obtaining either the product and/or my credit.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY FROM THIS SELLER !</li>
    <li> The Murad Resurgence products work fairly well on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used the cleanser, the night creme and the eye creme.  This Firming Mask is OK.  It leaves my skin soft and that&#x27;s a good thing - but that&#x27;s about all.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love using this mask. After just 10 minutes you can see a big difference in your skin. It looks refreshed, smooth and the pores are smaller. Very good product.</li>
    <li> The Murad Resurgence Firming Mask is an okay mask....not one that you can feel drawing your face tight etc. BUT when you wash it off, you can certainly feel and see the difference. As with all Murad products, they are the best.</li>
    <li> Saw a result immediately.  And, my skin felt softer than soft.  I am skeptical by nature, but this really provided instant results I could see and feel.  I will be giving this to my women friends and family for the holidays, cuz everyone can use a little beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab product. Will definitely buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used masks for many years but Murad Age-Diffusing Firming Mask is the best!  I saw a difference after the first use and after on 3 uses I had friends ask me if I was doing something different and that my skin looked so healthy and it glowed.  It goes on clear and only takes 10 minutes. I highly recommend Murad!</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for years and it works.  I am 68 and my school kids who think 40 is REALLY old guess my age at 45 or 50.  It is a good regime.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a firming  but feels a bit more like putting on a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive for the results.</li>
    <li> I like this mask.  I mean I use so much stuff - my skin looks great (I&#x27;m 34) and I&#x27;m sure it is because I&#x27;m constantly doing a mask every day.  But this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT (Bliss oxygen mask, Sanitas vita rich mask, Boscia brightening mask, Murad environmental shield peel, MyChelle apple brightening peel, Burt&#x27;s Bees intense hydration mask, Dr. Perricone chlro plasma mask, Eminence chocolate &amp; Acai masks, Zuri by sleek Chapter Eight Brightening mask, Meaningful Beauty by Cindy Crawford RICH MOISTURE MASQUE MASK etc). This is a good one for moisture, anti aging, firming, all that.  Try it!</li>
    <li> The best - firms well and in five minutes.</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE ANY BLACK HEADS IN YOUR SKIN  IT WILL GET RID OF THEM SOON. YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw that the reviews were very good.  I have used it a few times however I dont really see anything&lt;br /&gt;big as of yet.  It is still new to me and I am sure it will take time.</li>
