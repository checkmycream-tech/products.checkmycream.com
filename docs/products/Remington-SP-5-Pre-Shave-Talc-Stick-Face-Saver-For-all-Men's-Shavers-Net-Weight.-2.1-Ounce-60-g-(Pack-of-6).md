### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Shaving sticks are awesome.</li>
      <li>I ordered the FaceSaver product from Remington, it is an excellent talc in stick that helps your electric razor</li>
      <li>THE  BEST!</li>
      <li>Which would be a shame because shaving powder sticks are the perfect prep for electric shaving.</li>
      <li>I can tell you that this is the best pre-electric treatment I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product, received on time</li>
      <li>This stuff works great with electric shavers.</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t answer that one, because Remington Face Saver IS THAT GREAT.</li>
      <li>also questioned why this stuff is not in every store, if it is so great.</li>
      <li>I use to buy it at Wal-Mart, but Wal-Mart does not sell it anymore, so I saw it here and buy a box of six for a great price.    </li>
      <li>Used on the area of the face to be shaved before shaving, it allows for a very comfortable and close shave, providing you&#x27;re using, also, a top-notch shaving product.  </li>
      <li>It smells good, even though you wash it off afterwards anyway.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good quality for a fair price and speedy no-cost delivery.</li>
      <li>Price is fair.  </li>
      <li>Remington Face Saver is great, but stores are not handling this product any more.</li>
      <li>My husband says this product is outstanding!  </li>
      <li>Everything was easy and worked out great.</li>
      <li>Honestly, using powder doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but I tried talcum powder to see if it helped.</li>
      <li>pack)]]I&#x27;ve used face saver for many years and love it.</li>
      <li>for  many,  many  years,  and  compared  to  liquid  </li>
      <li>It works 10 times better than those electric shave liquid products are supposed to.  </li>
      <li>Works much better for me that the liquids like LectricShave...and without the odor.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s no problem -- just leave the top</li>
      <li>Even better than I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years, and I just love it.</li>
      <li>Better more comfortable electric shave</li>
      <li>My husband and I love the close shave and smooth feel.  </li>
      <li>Easy to rub on and shave immediately.</li>
      <li>Makes every electric shave easy and smooth.  </li>
      <li>is all that is needed for a smooth and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems bizarre to me.</li>
      <li>Your price was higher; I am glad to get the product.</li>
      <li>It is clean, does the job very well, every time, nothing more to add.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>AFTER SEARCHING SEVERAL WEB SITES LISTED FOR REMINGTON, I FINALLY HIT AMAZON.COM, AND THEY HAD THE BEST DEAL OVER ALL THE REST.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find this packaging of six shave sticks, priced as they were, no tax, no shipping, also allowing me to be part of Amazon&#x27;s program that will provide for the shipping of this product every so many months, at an even lesser cost per talc stick than advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I&#x27;ve used since.  </li>
      <li>&quot;,  but  it  is  worth  </li>
      <li>After 50 years of use I agree with the other observations and can add that the Remington product is softer and leaves a heavier coat which is good under severe temperture and humidity conditions.</li>
      <li>Helps the shaver glide over face even on hot humid days.</li>
      <li>It has never failed.</li>
      <li>Sure, it only lasts a day, but it looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I bought a 6-pack of these, thinking the Derma Bloc was probably a knock-off of the Remington product in the first place.</li>
      <li>excellent product, no oily feeling, it seems expensive but will last a long time,nothing better on the market, and amazon makes it an easy purchase.</li>
      <li>I bought an average, every Joe kind of electric shaver, and I could not avoid the rash, no matter what I tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Should you be a tad sweaty, you can easily re-apply the shaving stick as needed to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to throughly rinse your razor after shaving (assuming your razor enjoys a bath), or manually clean the shaver a few times each year to prevent build up of powder and hair.</li>
      <li>Not to get too conspiratorial, but you really can&#x27;t find this in any drugstore that I have looked in.</li>
      <li>I prefer the talc for shaving because it doesn&#x27;t clog my razor as fast as liquid pre-shave</li>
      <li>An absolute necessity in humid environments.  </li>
      <li>This powder stick really works well.  </li>
      <li>strongly recommend this product to all electric shave users who shave after a shower and want a close and dry shave.</li>
      <li>It has a stronger short lived but not unpleasant to me odor.</li>
      <li>I wish Remmington would market it a little better so the stores would stock it.</li>
      <li>And when finished you don&#x27;t need as much after shave to cool it down, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin as much.</li>
      <li>I have been using these sticks for nearly 20 years and would highly recommed them to anyone using an electric razor.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply to those trouble areas.</li>
      <li>Much easier shaving using this, especially on humid summer days.  </li>
      <li>the container between shaves and nearly all of the perfume smell goes</li>
      <li>A few simlple swipes across your beard area followed by a light rubbing with your fingertips</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive skin this is a must have for the electric shaver</li>
      <li>&quot;  is  far  </li>
      <li>This is a great pre-shave product that is very difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
      <li>my decades old shaver, finally needed to be retired.</li>
      <li>I can barely tolerate the smell.</li>
      <li>It works similarly to baby powder, but I find it both less messy and also better as it gives me a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I basically hated shaving so much that I just gave up and grew a beard. Then I had to shave for a job, so somebody left me this shave stick. I trim my beard down to where it is really short, rub this stuff on my face and use my electric shaver. I can&#x27;t say that there is no irritation, but it is significantly less than with any other product I have used. Not to get too conspiratorial, but you really can&#x27;t find this in any drugstore that I have looked in. It seems bizarre to me. So, I just ordered a five pack from Amazon and now I am set for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but could not find it where I previously purchased it (Wal Mart).  Your price was higher; I am glad to get the product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002SJ4ADO Remington SP-5 SP5 Face Saver Pre-shaver Powder Stick (6 pack)]]I&#x27;ve used face saver for many years and love it. My wife even uses it    or for her legs befor shaving them. I know of nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> This powder stick really works well.  Unfortunately it is hard to get at a retail store.</li>
    <li> I ordered the FaceSaver product from Remington, it is an excellent talc in stick that helps your electric razor and you have a closer shave. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years, and I just love it. I use to buy it at Wal-Mart, but Wal-Mart does not sell it anymore, so I saw it here and buy a box of six for a great price.    Thank you.    Martin H.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Derma Bloc\\&quot; shaving stick I&#x27;ve been buying for years seems to have dropped off the face of the earth so I bought a 6-pack of these, thinking the Derma Bloc was probably a knock-off of the Remington product in the first place. Gah - these are perfumed. I can barely tolerate the smell. I imagine by the time I&#x27;ve worked through six of these I&#x27;ll either be used to it or have switched to wet shaving. Which would be a shame because shaving powder sticks are the perfect prep for electric shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades now.  It is clean, does the job very well, every time, nothing more to add.</li>
    <li> excellent product, no oily feeling, it seems expensive but will last a long time,nothing better on the market, and amazon makes it an easy purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using these sticks for nearly 20 years and would highly recommed them to anyone using an electric razor. If you use an electric razor, throw out that Lectric Shave stuff. Shaving sticks are awesome. A few simlple swipes across your beard area followed by a light rubbing with your fingertips is all that is needed for a smooth and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you be a tad sweaty, you can easily re-apply the shaving stick as needed to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to throughly rinse your razor after shaving (assuming your razor enjoys a bath), or manually clean the shaver a few times each year to prevent build up of powder and hair. Even if you use anothe rpre-shave product, cleaning is really crucial to providing a close shave.</li>
    <li> Good quality for a fair price and speedy no-cost delivery.</li>
    <li> Everything was easy and worked out great. Received faster than they said it would take</li>
    <li> For some reason Face Saver is hard to find localy when I saw it on Amazon I ordered 6 of them. It works 10 times better than those electric shave liquid products are supposed to.  You can actually feel the shaver glide across your face as you shave. And when finished you don&#x27;t need as much after shave to cool it down, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin as much. I won&#x27;t use the electric shaver without it anymore. I wish Remmington would market it a little better so the stores would stock it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years with my electric razor.  Much easier shaving using this, especially on humid summer days.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Remington Face Saver is great, but stores are not handling this product any more. So I went to Amazon.com and got just what I needed. I also bought extras just in case.</li>
    <li> Even better than I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the 6-pack without even trying one out. I made the plunge based on the reviews. I can tell you that this is the best pre-electric treatment I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers are well sized in that it can be used for travelling, in other words, not large at all. It works similarly to baby powder, but I find it both less messy and also better as it gives me a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product to all electric shave users who shave after a shower and want a close and dry shave.</li>
    <li> if you have sensitive skin this is a must have for the electric shaver you&#x27;ll get a baby butt smoth shave.</li>
    <li> What is there to say. Better more comfortable electric shave</li>
    <li> My husband likes this  Remington pre shave, it is hard to find .</li>
    <li> Makes every electric shave easy and smooth.  An absolute necessity in humid environments.  Easy to rub on and shave immediately.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps the shaver glide over face even on hot humid days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Remington shave stick for years.  I get a close shave with no neck rashes.  Works much better for me that the liquids like LectricShave...and without the odor. Buying 6 at a time is a money saver...and it&#x27;s getting harder to find in drug and grocery stores.</li>
    <li> AFTER SEARCHING ALL THE LOCAL STORES THAT I PREVOUSLY BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM, I GAVE UP AND WENT TO THE INTERNET. AFTER SEARCHING SEVERAL WEB SITES LISTED FOR REMINGTON, I FINALLY HIT AMAZON.COM, AND THEY HAD THE BEST DEAL OVER ALL THE REST. YOU CAN BET I&#x27;LL BE BACK WHENEVER I NEED ANYTHING!!</li>
    <li> I suppose years back, in the purchase of a Remington product, I was introduced to the pre-shave stick.  It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I&#x27;ve used since.  Used on the area of the face to be shaved before shaving, it allows for a very comfortable and close shave, providing you&#x27;re using, also, a top-notch shaving product.  I was pleased to find this packaging of six shave sticks, priced as they were, no tax, no shipping, also allowing me to be part of Amazon&#x27;s program that will provide for the shipping of this product every so many months, at an even lesser cost per talc stick than advertised. guaranteeting that I will not run out of sticks, as I had before last ordering.  You just can&#x27;t beat the deal!</li>
    <li> The  Name  says  it  all!   Local  stores  no  longer  stock  the  \\&quot;Face  Saver\\&quot;,  but  it  is  worth  the  effort  to  locate  on  the  internet.  I  have  used  the  product  for  many,  many  years,  and  compared  to  liquid  pre-shaves  \\&quot;Face  Saver\\&quot;  is  far  and  away  THE  BEST!</li>
    <li> After 50 years of use I agree with the other observations and can add that the Remington product is softer and leaves a heavier coat which is good under severe temperture and humidity conditions. It has a stronger short lived but not unpleasant to me odor.</li>
    <li> I have always avoided close shaves. An irritating rash appears around my upper neck, sometimes so bad, it is embarrassing. Sure, it only lasts a day, but it looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my decades old shaver, finally needed to be retired. I bought an average, every Joe kind of electric shaver, and I could not avoid the rash, no matter what I tried. Less pressure, shaving with the \\&quot;grain\\&quot;, pre-shave lotion, warming the face before hand, cooling the face afterwards, and rinsing with rubbing alcohol. All failures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an Internet search, I found these sticks. Honestly, using powder doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but I tried talcum powder to see if it helped. There did seem to be a difference, but it is hard to apply powder to your neck, talcum powder stinks, and there is the question of what it will do to the blades on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also questioned why this stuff is not in every store, if it is so great. I still can&#x27;t answer that one, because Remington Face Saver IS THAT GREAT. It has never failed. It smells good, even though you wash it off afterwards anyway. It is easy to apply to those trouble areas. The container is small, but packs a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question needs to be asked again; why isn&#x27;t Remington Face Saver in every store?</li>
    <li> I prefer the talc for shaving because it doesn&#x27;t clog my razor as fast as liquid pre-shave lotions.&lt;br /&gt;So far this is a bit expensive, even when on sale.&lt;br /&gt;Would still recommend Face Saver to anyone who would be willing to try it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great with electric shavers. However, like other users, I also don&#x27;t like the perfume smell. But that&#x27;s no problem -- just leave the top the container between shaves and nearly all of the perfume smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only rated this stuff four stars because of the perfume smell. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for over 20 years and I always come back to it.  Have tried the liquids and they never work.  This is the only pre-electric shave that works for me.</li>
    <li> My dad swears by this shave stick with his electric razor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, but it&#x27;s getting hard to find locally. This deal was just as advertised, and just what my husband has been looking for.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great product, received on time</li>
    <li> This is a great pre-shave product that is very difficult to find in local stores.  My husband and I love the close shave and smooth feel.  Price is fair.  Would order again from Amazon.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier..</li>
    <li> My husband says this product is outstanding!  No more razor burns!</li>
    <li> Good product. Hard to find in retail stores.</li>
