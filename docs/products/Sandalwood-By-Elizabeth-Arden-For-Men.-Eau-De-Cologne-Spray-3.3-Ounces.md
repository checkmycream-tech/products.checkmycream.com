      <li>THE WORLD&#x27;S GREATEST FRAGRANCE, I HAVE BEEN USING SANDALWOOD FOR MEN ALMOST 30 YEARS.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful, manly cologne, yet is not even close in smell to \\&quot;Piping Rock&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Excellent price and good value.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to find this fragrance  for a lot of years and was so happy to get it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite fragance!!</li>
      <li>time i will byy more than one unit!!</li>
      <li>It smells like earlier:exceptionally pleasant.</li>
      <li>That should tell you how good it is.</li>
      <li>When I saw it, I loved it.</li>
      <li>No odor of sandelwood or anything good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a good sandalwood product, but this is not it.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I do love it, the price was right, and the service from the vendor excellent.  </li>
      <li>Best one I&#x27;ve used so far is Aubrey Organics&#x27; City Rhythms.[[ASIN:B0019GPYS2 Men&#x27;s City Rhythms Aftershave - 4 oz - Liquid]]</li>
      <li>Good, clean scent.</li>
      <li>Must be manufactured in one of those countries where the labor and ingredients are very cheap.</li>
      <li>I was glad to found it again in the USA by now.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s more versatile.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, it&#x27;s got the woody sandalwood smell</li>
      <li>It is a fragrance that more women should wear.  </li>
      <li>Love it and by wife</li>
      <li>But, I smelled better Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>The perfume was just ok.</li>
      <li>I was talking to a client, and really enjoyed the smell...</li>
      <li>I sure there have been alterations in the formula since then</li>
      <li>&quot; But then as the minutes went by, it got better.</li>
      <li>I have searched for it in many years, and now I find it at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hitting my 40&#x27;s and most of the cologne out there smells like metro sexual in a bottle.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite men fragrances that I have used in my life.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of all things sandalwood.</li>
      <li>it smelled better than any fragrance I&#x27;d ever smelled PERIOD.  </li>
      <li>HOW MUCH I ENJOYED THE SCENT.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just  OK.</li>
      <li>Way better.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing it for a very long time and think it is the greatest.</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s old but great product.</li>
      <li>Which is fine to smell like if I was in a shower with that soap, but I don&#x27;t like it as a scent that I&#x27;m choosing to add to myself.</li>
      <li>Cheap looking bottle and box.</li>
      <li>Sandalwood of course is what you will smell, but  it&#x27;s magic is in that it is also composed with the classic ingredients of clary sage, lavender and some oak moss, a bit of citrus, a dash of musk and hint of vetiver.</li>
      <li>it was fresh.</li>
      <li>widely reccomend it to those who likes only the best..</li>
      <li>This classic fragrance will harmonize well with fine sandalwood shaving creams made by Geo.</li>
      <li>Color of liquid is much lighter than original.</li>
      <li>I have sandalwood candles and shaving creams, but this just didn&#x27;t smell right to me.</li>
      <li>and they are doing something right...</li>
      <li>I TRIED A FEW OTHERS WHEN THE ORIGINAL WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE, THIS SPRAY IS FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>The scent was instantly reminiscent of the light, clean, fresh citrus of my youth.</li>
      <li>really lavender to start then a nice lasting soothing sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping</li>
      <li>This Sandlewood Arden for Men is not the same scent as they made 40 years ago but, very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>but this scent remains a classic true to</li>
      <li>It was exactly what i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
      <li>So I bought it, and my first spray was like \\&quot;holy cr*p</li>
      <li>The product came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>really likes it too!</li>
      <li>IT IS EXACTLY THE WAY THAT I REMEMBER IT......</li>
      <li>Particularly appropriate for evening use, as it&#x27;s deep fragrance trends towards warm, dark tones.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume mainly because it reminds me of my youth, it brings back nice memories of old times.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Kudos to Amazon for the always fast and efficient order-delivery procedure.</li>
      <li>Simply the nicest sandalwood fragrance for men available.</li>
      <li>This cologne was very disapointing.</li>
      <li>It is everything (and more) that I expected.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting something that was subtle and pleasant.</li>
      <li>F.Trumper Sandalwood Skin Food aftershave product and then spray on some Sandalwood  by E.A. for men  and upon dry down the scent of this fragrance will simply dance with the scent of the Trumpers products creating a wonderful sandalwood shaving experience.</li>
      <li>This is not the same original box, formula or bottle.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell better than any other Antiperspirant/Deodorant</li>
      <li>Earthy, woodsy, deep and masculine might be an accurate description of this men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>This cologne has a light, long lasting smell (but not strong, your girlfriend or wife might smell it on you if you&#x27;re having a good night</li>
      <li>This is a decent smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t realistic for me to keep using it.</li>
      <li>i get many compliments long after the last spritz.....</li>
      <li>A perfume is always a very personal choice according to our individual taste so it is difficult to rate it objectively &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but this particular essence, in my opinion, is really nice and pleasant, and stays with you all day</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a classic that was first formulated back in 1956.</li>
      <li>but I could&#x27;nt find anywhere in the country (I live in Italy)</li>
      <li>The product was larger than I had anticipated; which means, more cologne for my dollars spent.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; isnt strong, nor does it last long.</li>
      <li>It is watered down significantly.</li>
      <li>I always purchase this item because my dad loves it, he&#x27;s old school</li>
      <li>The fragance isn&#x27;t anything like the Taylor of Old Bond Street or Art of Shaving sandalwood products I have, and I prefer their fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells like my great-grandparents&#x27; old soap.</li>
      <li>took me back to my high school days.</li>
      <li>I had previously owned and worn this cologne,being a cologne fanatic,so when i saw it for such a fantastic price i had to grab it....</li>
      <li>This new version is weaker and does not last.</li>
      <li>This fragrance has nice sillage and longevity and while concocted back in 1956 will never seem outdated.</li>
      <li>I used it for a long time in the early 70&#x60;s until the sale was stopped in Germany.</li>
      <li>It is powerful and long-lasting - only a small amount need be applied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say this doesn&#x27;t smell like Sandalwood Oil, so if you&#x27;re expecting that you might be disappointed.  But that&#x27;s why I also have sandalwood oil.  This cologne has a light, long lasting smell (but not strong, your girlfriend or wife might smell it on you if you&#x27;re having a good night but your officemates won&#x27;t smell it on you if you walk buy their desks {unless you reapply it in the middle of the day}).  I love the way it smells, it&#x27;s got the woody sandalwood smell but it&#x27;s lighter, and smells like a cologne, not an oil, so it&#x27;s more versatile.</li>
    <li> I used it for a long time in the early 70&#x60;s until the sale was stopped in Germany.I was glad to found it again in the USA by now.It smells like earlier:exceptionally pleasant.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something that was subtle and pleasant. What I discovered was a sharp, overpowering scent that was as subtle as a sledgehammer. One whiff, and I knew this was way too stong for me. I prefer sandalwood when mixed with other scents, rather than by itself.</li>
    <li> Earthy, woodsy, deep and masculine might be an accurate description of this men&#x27;s cologne. It is powerful and long-lasting - only a small amount need be applied. Particularly appropriate for evening use, as it&#x27;s deep fragrance trends towards warm, dark tones. If Sandalwood cologne were a singer, it would be sonorous, cavernous bass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a good sandalwood product, but this is not it.  Best one I&#x27;ve used so far is Aubrey Organics&#x27; City Rhythms.[[ASIN:B0019GPYS2 Men&#x27;s City Rhythms Aftershave - 4 oz - Liquid]]</li>
    <li> I always purchase this item because my dad loves it, he&#x27;s old school what can I say plus it&#x27;s old but great product.</li>
    <li> Encouraged by reading reviews while looking for a similar scent to &#x27;Piping Rock&#x27; cologne which disappeared in the late sixties to early seventies, I ordered the Sandalwood.  It is a wonderful, manly cologne, yet is not even close in smell to \\&quot;Piping Rock&#x27;.  That being said, I do love it, the price was right, and the service from the vendor excellent.  Try it - you will like it.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> AHHHH! took me back to my high school days. The scent was instantly reminiscent of the light, clean, fresh citrus of my youth. A delight to find again</li>
    <li> THE WORLD&#x27;S GREATEST FRAGRANCE, I HAVE BEEN USING SANDALWOOD FOR MEN ALMOST 30 YEARS.  I TRIED A FEW OTHERS WHEN THE ORIGINAL WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE, THIS SPRAY IS FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;next time i will byy more than one unit!!</li>
    <li> I was talking to a client, and really enjoyed the smell... So I said, what&#x27;s that cologne, it reminds me of something. He told me it was Arden. Anyway.... So I bought it, and my first spray was like \\&quot;holy cr*p this is awful.\\&quot; But then as the minutes went by, it got better. After about 15 minutes, it was terrific. So, I&#x27;ve learned that it IS the smell I like, but I need to spray and walk into it... and still wait like 5 or 10 minutes. The overpowering strength of this goes away after about an hour, but still provides wafts that people will lean in for, even after a day at the office.</li>
    <li> I used this product from beginnin of 60´s to middle of 90´s, when it leaved the swedish market. I have searched for it in many years, and now I find it at Amazon.com. My happines is total.</li>
    <li> This cologne was very disapointing. No odor of sandelwood or anything good</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume mainly because it reminds me of my youth, it brings back nice memories of old times. I have been looking for this product all over the place for years but I could&#x27;nt find anywhere in the country (I live in Italy), finally I thought of Amazon and there it was! A perfume is always a very personal choice according to our individual taste so it is difficult to rate it objectively &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;, but this particular essence, in my opinion, is really nice and pleasant, and stays with you all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for the always fast and efficient order-delivery procedure.</li>
    <li> really lavender to start then a nice lasting soothing sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;better than a \\&quot;calming\\&quot; aromatherapy product by a country mile.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;get it while you can.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned and worn this cologne,being a cologne fanatic,so when i saw it for such a fantastic price i had to grab it....This cologne is light,great for the day,but does not come off in a few minutes...i get many compliments long after the last spritz.....Elizabeth Arden has been around since the twenties and they are doing something right...maybe it&#x27;s longevity is partly due to this irresitable mens fragrance...lol..try it,nothing to lose...ciao</li>
    <li> When I saw it, I loved it. Will back again.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell, nothing at all like sandalwood. It smells more like a bad mixture of musk and other misc stuff. Thankfully, the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; isnt strong, nor does it last long. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> The fragance isn&#x27;t anything like the Taylor of Old Bond Street or Art of Shaving sandalwood products I have, and I prefer their fragrance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it... It smells like my great-grandparents&#x27; old soap. Which is fine to smell like if I was in a shower with that soap, but I don&#x27;t like it as a scent that I&#x27;m choosing to add to myself. I have sandalwood candles and shaving creams, but this just didn&#x27;t smell right to me.</li>
    <li> my WIFE hated IT she did like it she told me to return it asap  very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good, clean scent. Excellent price and good value.</li>
    <li> The perfume was just ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hitting my 40&#x27;s and most of the cologne out there smells like metro sexual in a bottle. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this that smells like a man.</li>
    <li> I have used this since the 70&#x27;s. This is not the same original box, formula or bottle. Since you cant find this anymore i decided to take a chance. I have a vintage Sandalwood By Elizabeth Arden For Men with a couple of drops left in it. This new version is weaker and does not last. Cheap looking bottle and box. It is watered down significantly. Color of liquid is much lighter than original. Much less active scent. Must be manufactured in one of those countries where the labor and ingredients are very cheap. I now use this in the car. I wont wear this.</li>
    <li> THIS SANDALWOOD PRODUCT IS SOMETHING I WORE 30 TO 35 YEARS AGO. I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I ENJOYED THE SCENT. IT IS EXACTLY THE WAY THAT I REMEMBER IT......SO I&#x27;M DELIGHTED!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle from Amazon.ca.&lt;br /&gt;When I was  a teen I had purchased an Elizabeth Arden Sandalwood Antiperspirant cream that came in a roll on style dispenser. It didn&#x27;t smell better than any other Antiperspirant/Deodorant I&#x27;d ever smelled-- it smelled better than any fragrance I&#x27;d ever smelled PERIOD.  I remember walking around all day smelling my armpits every chance I got.  At the time, speed stick was a couple of bucks.... Even cheaper than it is now, and that stuff cost around 15$ so it wasn&#x27;t realistic for me to keep using it. I would buy it once in a while when I had some extra money.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this cologne would smell like that. It doesn&#x27;t. I love the smell of all things sandalwood. This is a decent smelling cologne. Sandalwood-- not.</li>
    <li> Kind of a horrible scent. Really harsh on the senses. I threw it in the garbage immediately. Oops.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragance!!</li>
    <li> Simply the nicest sandalwood fragrance for men available. This fragrance is a classic that was first formulated back in 1956. I sure there have been alterations in the formula since then but this scent remains a classic true to it&#x27;s vintage heritage. Sandalwood of course is what you will smell, but  it&#x27;s magic is in that it is also composed with the classic ingredients of clary sage, lavender and some oak moss, a bit of citrus, a dash of musk and hint of vetiver. This classic fragrance will harmonize well with fine sandalwood shaving creams made by Geo. F. Trumper and other premium makers of men&#x27;s shaving products. Even if the sandalwood  scent of Trumpers is a bit different you can shave with it and apply afterwards the Geo.F.Trumper Sandalwood Skin Food aftershave product and then spray on some Sandalwood  by E.A. for men  and upon dry down the scent of this fragrance will simply dance with the scent of the Trumpers products creating a wonderful sandalwood shaving experience. This fragrance has nice sillage and longevity and while concocted back in 1956 will never seem outdated.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find this fragrance  for a lot of years and was so happy to get it.  Love it and by wife really likes it too!</li>
    <li> This does not smell anything like sandalwood.  In my opinion it smells unpleasant and cheap.  Fortunately, it is weak and does not last very long.  I&#x27;ll need some way to dispose of it.</li>
    <li> This Sandlewood Arden for Men is not the same scent as they made 40 years ago but, very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It is everything (and more) that I expected.  It is a fragrance that more women should wear.  I have been wearing it for a very long time and think it is the greatest.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I only wish there still was Alexander Shields. It was the best. You&#x27;re somewhat close.</li>
    <li> I use it for bathroom air freshner</li>
    <li> all I expected and then some.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not great. It&#x27;s just  OK. But, I smelled better Sandalwood. Way better.</li>
    <li> The product was larger than I had anticipated; which means, more cologne for my dollars spent. The product came on time and was exactly what I ordered. I was skeptical about the freshness of the cologne, but when I sprayed a small sample- it was fresh. I will do business again with this company.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like sandalwood.</li>
    <li> excelent choice i recomended</li>
    <li> This cologne is an excellent product. My wife loves the way I smell. It has a masculine smell that is very subtle yet definitely masculine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for the last 35 years, but now nobody sells it in my country. So I have to buy it on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;I widely reccomend it to those who likes only the best..</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite men fragrances that I have used in my life. I have been using it for 40 years, and still do! That should tell you how good it is.</li>
