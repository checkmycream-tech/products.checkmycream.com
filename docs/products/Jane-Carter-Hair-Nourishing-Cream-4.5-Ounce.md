      <li>I love Jane Carter</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love for that reason, however, there are better moisturizers out there.</li>
      <li>The original product I purchased had a more lemony smell to it.</li>
      <li>Really a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a very light dress to help control moderately dry and/or unruly hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine permed hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looks super healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>We only use it once a week, but it does a great job with the curly curls of our toddler girls.</li>
      <li>I have super curly kinky 4b/c type hair that knots up faster than I can comb through it, and this stuff makes it so manageable and easy to manipulate even when you haven&#x27;t just washed your hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a favorite for my whole family now!</li>
      <li>Since I started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my hair.  </li>
      <li>That is definitely true.  </li>
      <li>I received the order quickly and undamaged.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and feels great.  </li>
      <li>worth $22 though 0_o</li>
      <li>it is delightfully fresh .</li>
      <li>Unless it&#x27;s super humind my hair looks healthy and I don&#x27;t have to use a daily moisturizer to keep it that way.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a great product, particularly due to the natural oils and nut/fruit butters used as ingredients!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve learned not to use too much or you will have greasy hair!  </li>
      <li>I am sold and just recently purchased some more of Jane Carter&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>The original product was also the first product I used that made my 4c hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>It works GREAT on dry, frizzy ends, and I don&#x27;t know if anyone else with relaxed hair will experience (because my hair is strange)</li>
      <li>Since my purpose was to use it to maintain my straight look</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize hair.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
      <li>Provides hair with shine and moisture but don&#x27;t use too much because you will have to wash it out in order to style your hair.</li>
      <li>BUT it is NOT AS NATURAL AS THEY SAY!!!  </li>
      <li>It is a very light consistency and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>I bought this product mainly because it doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to revert to its curly state.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair looking healthy and moist, not greasy; it&#x27;s very light, but still thick enough to control the frizz; it actually helps with dry hair and scalp; and it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up over time.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when my husband said he likes it too!</li>
      <li>I have natural hair</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and moisturized after use.</li>
      <li>If this wasn&#x27;t an all natural product, I would never buy/use it.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, if you need to stretch your natural 4a/b/c hair without heat.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve got coarse, mildly wavy hair that tends to get frizzy when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>Came on time an packaging was as advertised, the actual product is a smooth consistency, felt very nourishing as the product implies,btw I have natural thick 4b hair,I will order again.</li>
      <li>Provides moisture to my  thick but fine hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair has been flat ironed and when I rubbed some on my hair for daily maintenance, it did not revert back to its natural state but remained straight and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I use it on my natural hair on a daily basis  before styling.</li>
      <li>i have since reordered another bottle and i am just half way through the first one because i cannot imagine ever going without nourishing cream again.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little strong for my taste and does last a long time, but wasn&#x27;t obnoxious enough for me to not use it.</li>
      <li>For me, too expensive to be anything other than delighted.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking that it is way too costly for the size, but then after making the purchase I realize it&#x27;s worth every penny because a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>it has PHENOXYETHANOL, the new substitute for parabens but not much safer (as you can find out researching the net).</li>

    <li> This is a good moisturizer but if you don&#x27;t want your ends to revert, use this very lightly or not at all. Use the nourish and shine instead.It&#x27;s also great if you&#x27;re trying to avoid silicones! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this before I blowdry my hair and after I use flat irons. It leaves the hair moisturized for hours and no more frizz. The scent is very light. I hardly noticed it. It didn&#x27;t flatten my hair and gives enough moisturize for my dry ends. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims. My hair feels so soft and moisturized after use. I was thinking that it is way too costly for the size, but then after making the purchase I realize it&#x27;s worth every penny because a little goes a long way.  I seal this moisture in with the nourish and shine.  Great products!</li>
    <li> I truly want to thank the folks at Beauty4Family.    There was a problem with my shipment and they immediately rectified the problem.    They are a TOP FLIGHT organization and I want everyone to know that they can buy from these folks with the highest confidence!</li>
    <li> This works well on my dry ends and as a leave in conditioner before blow drying.  I am African American with a texturizer.  I have dry ends and depending on the time of year, my hair tends to be dry.  Since I started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my hair.  Unless it&#x27;s super humind my hair looks healthy and I don&#x27;t have to use a daily moisturizer to keep it that way.</li>
    <li> Provides moisture to my  thick but fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize hair.  I received my product from vita cost. I received the order quickly and undamaged.</li>
    <li> This product has a yummy smell of lemons with vanilla.  Provides hair with shine and moisture but don&#x27;t use too much because you will have to wash it out in order to style your hair. All you need is about a dime size amount.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it over and over. This cream smells amazing and the texture is wonderful; you need very little to moisturize your hair; and in adds shine as well; besides the ingredients are wonderful; what else can i ask for. Thank you Jane Carter.</li>
    <li> Just wonderful.... A lil goes a long way...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably not the target market for this stuff -- I&#x27;m a middle-aged white guy -- but I&#x27;ve got coarse, mildly wavy hair that tends to get frizzy when it&#x27;s dry. I don&#x27;t like the feel (or look) of gel in my hair, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other gels, serums, creams, and oils. This is the best I&#x27;ve found by far. It leaves my hair looking healthy and moist, not greasy; it&#x27;s very light, but still thick enough to control the frizz; it actually helps with dry hair and scalp; and it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up over time. Really a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a very light dress to help control moderately dry and/or unruly hair.</li>
    <li> My hair: relaxed, texlaxed, 8 weeks post, colored, and bleached. I got this product yesterday and decided to give it a shot after my roller set hair had dried. I bought this product mainly because it doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to revert to its curly state. That is definitely true.  I used it immediately after taking down my rollers and also when I wrapped my hair&lt;br /&gt;last night. My hair looks super healthy and shiny. I&#x27;m in love for that reason, however, there are better moisturizers out there. Since my purpose was to use it to maintain my straight look I&#x27;ll continue to use. A little does go a long way. The scent is a little strong for my taste and does last a long time, but wasn&#x27;t obnoxious enough for me to not use it. I would continue to repurchase though because I&#x27;m fairly impressed, especially because of its ingredients which is healthy for your hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product, works great</li>
    <li> Not a miracle cream, and its expensive.  Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
    <li> This product is very light weight and moisturizes well. I find i must use it at least once daily though to maintain the moisture. just a little is enough for my shoulder length relaxed hair. The smell is not not too overbearing either. After using for a week my hair was visibly healthier. i have since reordered another bottle and i am just half way through the first one because i cannot imagine ever going without nourishing cream again.</li>
    <li> I have super curly kinky 4b/c type hair that knots up faster than I can comb through it, and this stuff makes it so manageable and easy to manipulate even when you haven&#x27;t just washed your hair.  It&#x27;s amazing.  It also keeps my hair feeling moisturized for an extended period of time.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now, and I have to say, it&#x27;s a bit of a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I am an African-American female with probably 4a/4b hair type and I get relaxers and press my hair fairly regularly. I&#x27;ve had bad relaxer burns that left the skin around my hairline feeling and looking like i had eczema but I used some of this to soothe the area and the ashy, itchy flakiness disappeared! It works GREAT on dry, frizzy ends, and I don&#x27;t know if anyone else with relaxed hair will experience (because my hair is strange) but it made my relaxed ends wavy and moisturized when I put a bit on at night before bed. All in all, this is a great product, particularly due to the natural oils and nut/fruit butters used as ingredients! ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Given that I am allergic to many ingredients found in hair products, including certain natural oils, I am always delighted to find a product to which there is no allergic reaction, and, of course, to which my hair responds wonderfully.  No allergic reaction to ingredients in Jane Carter Nourishing Cream.  However, I did find that it had a drying, dulling affect appearance, rather than shine or softening.  For me, too expensive to be anything other than delighted.  Not delighted.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite for my whole family now! I was surprised when my husband said he likes it too!</li>
    <li> I am picky with creams this cream smells nice but i do not like the way that the cream makes my hair feel after applying.  But try it you may like it!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I was introduced to this product when my beautician used it on my hair. I loved how it made my hair look and feel. It is not greasy at all but it delivers a great shine. My hair has been flat ironed and when I rubbed some on my hair for daily maintenance, it did not revert back to its natural state but remained straight and moisturized. I am sold and just recently purchased some more of Jane Carter&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I think the creme probably works, but the smell is so unappealing that I don&#x27;t really use it all that much anymore.  Also, the consistency is a bit greasy so I don&#x27;t like using it around my edges or anywhere close to my skin. If this wasn&#x27;t an all natural product, I would never buy/use it.</li>
    <li> I love Jane Carter but it&#x27;s pricey, Amazon also have the lowest cost for this product. I  love this product it&#x27;s good for all hair types.</li>
    <li> We only use it once a week, but it does a great job with the curly curls of our toddler girls.</li>
    <li> Great for relaxed hair.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and feels great.  Makes my hair very soft. I love this product.  Order it off of Amazon if you can. It will save you alot of money.</li>
    <li> Great product for any type of hair but I&#x27;ve learned not to use too much or you will have greasy hair!  Just a dab does the trick so the tube will last a long time.  Thank you Jane Carter!</li>
    <li> I have fine permed hair. This product was much to oily and when I applied it to damp hair it made my hair feel really hard and greasy. I paid $28.95 for the product in my home town. I had hoped at that price it would be a diamond in the rough. Guess I will have to keep searching.</li>
    <li> Came on time an packaging was as advertised, the actual product is a smooth consistency, felt very nourishing as the product implies,btw I have natural thick 4b hair,I will order again.</li>
    <li> I had both it to use it for my son and it smells great! BUT it is NOT AS NATURAL AS THEY SAY!!!  it has PHENOXYETHANOL, the new substitute for parabens but not much safer (as you can find out researching the net). I returned it and will never buy none of their products again, as they all contain it.  Very Disappointed!! BTW  I found it here with the cheapest price in NYC!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the same product I purchased from the store. They don&#x27;t smell the same. The original product I purchased had a more lemony smell to it. It was wonderful. I wanted to use it just for the smell alone. The original product was also the first product I used that made my 4c hair feel soft. This didn&#x27;t really do much of anything. It worked as a detangler but just about any cream and water will do that for my hair. I think the ingredients may have been changed over the past couple of years.</li>
    <li> It does not provide enough moisture for my 4b/c hair. HOWEVER, if you need to stretch your natural 4a/b/c hair without heat. This product is for you. On second day hair, I spritz my hair with a tiny bit of water, apply  about a  quarter-size of this cream to my hair and make 5 plaits/braids and then  take down my hair a couple hours later  and it looks as if I had blow-dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth $22 though 0_o</li>
    <li> Jane Carter Nourishing Cream is excellent! I use it on my natural hair on a daily basis  before styling. It is a very light consistency and it does not weigh my hair down. I especially like the scent...it is delightfully fresh .</li>
