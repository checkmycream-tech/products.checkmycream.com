      <li>I do have a lot of hair, but very fine</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m kind of proud to have figured out a simple, inexpensive solution!</li>
      <li>I sleep just fine on them.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Flimsy and cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>My girls were so excited to wake up with curly hair in the morning.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and no curl, stick straight</li>
      <li>but they really aren&#x27;t all that comfortable to sleep in..</li>
      <li>They were OK, but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted as far as a curl is concerned.</li>
      <li>Good for young kids and short hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>These curled my hair nicely &amp; my hair is very thick and doesn&#x27;t have curls in easily.</li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent buy!</li>
      <li>I have Asian-straight, thin, medium length hair, and I was able to get very bouncy curls with these :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this foam roller set.</li>
      <li>The curls lasted all day which was a miracle with my super long hair.</li>
      <li>I wish the foam was a little more thick.</li>

<li> Just plain ole foam rollers.</li>
<li> They were really small.</li>
<li> Too small.</li>
<li> The clips separate immediately making it impossible to fasten the rollers.</li>

    <li> Cheaply made. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have Asian-straight, thin, medium length hair, and I was able to get very bouncy curls with these :) but they really aren&#x27;t all that comfortable to sleep in..also I felt like it was drying out the ends of my hair. But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent buy!</li>
    <li> Work as expected. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and no curl, stick straight and these actually curl my hair with no problem and it holds all day. I am not going to say it will work for everyone, but it works for me. I do have a lot of hair, but very fine, my niece even tried them cause nothing would curl her either and works like a charm for her to as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> The clips separate immediately making it impossible to fasten the rollers.</li>
    <li> I used these roller on my wigs and they were great and I had plenty of curls on the wig when used with setting spray or gel.</li>
    <li> My girls were so excited to wake up with curly hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> They were OK, but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted as far as a curl is concerned.</li>
    <li> Just plain ole foam rollers. Too pricey for what it is (these can be had in the dollar store).</li>
    <li> I love doing wet sets and these foam rollers are excellent. I have very long and thick hair, so I needed to purchase another set to the additional one I have purchased (from this brand). I highly recommend this foam roller set.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with LottaBody Setting Lotion and got great results. The curls lasted all day which was a miracle with my super long hair.</li>
    <li> Really nice rollers for the price, I use them for overnight use. I sleep just fine on them. I wish the foam was a little more thick.</li>
    <li> Yess! These curled my hair nicely &amp; my hair is very thick and doesn&#x27;t have curls in easily. But these worked perfect for my hair. Just make sure you put on hairspray afterwords so it could hold it firmly.</li>
    <li> They were really small. I have a lot of hair and it wouldn&#x27;t hold them. Good for young kids and short hair.</li>
    <li> Just foam rollers, nothing I couldn&#x27;t have bought at walmart.</li>
    <li> These were just what was needed</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these to curl my hair, although I remember them from my childhood!  I bought them to stick one between ear and headphone - I have a pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones which envelop the ears, and are TOO sound-blocking.  I sing along to CDs every morning, and also use a digital timer, and I couldn&#x27;t hear myself sing (so I can stay on pitch) nor hear the electronic beep of the timer go off.  By sticking one of these in one ear (poking out on front, i.e. on my face), it solves the problem!  I can still hear most of the music, and now also hear my voice and the timer.  Since the vendor&#x27;s forum didn&#x27;t offer any solutions (claiming that re open and sound-blocking headphones, &amp;#34;never the twain shall meet&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m kind of proud to have figured out a simple, inexpensive solution!</li>
    <li> Too small. Flimsy and cheap plastic.</li>
