      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Great to work with!</li>
      <li>Very nice product!  </li>
      <li>This is a very good product for being water based.</li>
      <li>My husband loved it!</li>
      <li>Great hold without a sticky finish.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The pleasing aroma is very light.</li>
      <li>So much better than fop.</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;ve received compliments on the look of the can and women love the smell.</li>
      <li>Once it grew to a respectable length, either for a pony tail or a bun</li>
      <li>When using the paste I do sometimes get a bit too much to easily spread out with combing.</li>
      <li>Too much of the paste is kind of waxy and has to be combed out with more water to spread out.</li>
      <li>Applies easily.</li>
      <li>It has a strong hold with out looking greasy.</li>
      <li>However, the hold is perfect and my hair was not sticky or heavy.</li>
      <li>and a unique lemony peppery kind of smell to it, but all together a good purchase i would probably buy it again</li>
      <li>Originally bought this as a gag gift for my boys 30 &amp; 33.....</li>
      <li>Where Art Thou&amp;#34;, arrived fast, i like it because its paste but its super smooth and soft, has a nice hold to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve changed my rating on the clay from four stars to five stars since it turns out that it wears as well or better after multiple re-combings.</li>
      <li>Very very light in comparison to some of today&#x27;s men&#x27;s grooming products that try to knock women flat with the strength of their stink.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair the day after, but it still looked good and was easily brushed out of the cowlick at the back of my head that sleeping produced.</li>
      <li>Beauticians and barbers all recommended one of the American modern brands but it had too strong of both shine and smell.</li>
      <li>The clay also thickens the look of the hair and too much is, well, too much, too.</li>
      <li>It absolutely does not smell like sandalwood.</li>
      <li>The paste is easier to get out of the can and easier to get too much.</li>
      <li>I like the paste better when my hair was too short to tie back</li>
      <li>mainly bought this can because I&#x27;m a fan of the movie,&amp;#34;Oh Brother</li>
      <li>Product is pretty good ,but you sent me the Wrong type, it was the Fresh Scent type in the Red tin container.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>the Clear label in the back Said Bergomot Scented</li>
      <li>Other than the light scent it is not much different from other paste like hair products.</li>
      <li>either way the product is good only my not getting the Scent I wanted was my Disappointment.</li>

<li> Since I&#x27;d not used pomade in decades I got both the matt (i.e. low shine) versions, clay in the red can and paste in the dark gold can.</li>
<li> Both will hold a long time, and will help the hair come back together during the day if it is combed with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> clay version is harder to get out of the can, so you end up wetting your fingers and making several small additions.</li>
<li> So I looked around to find something to tame my otherwise unruly hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It took TWO weeks to get here! Just kidding. It took 2 days. Prime. 2 days from everywhere. The pleasing aroma is very light. Very very light in comparison to some of today&#x27;s men&#x27;s grooming products that try to knock women flat with the strength of their stink. Other than the light scent it is not much different from other paste like hair products.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this as a gag gift for my boys 30 &amp; 33.....you know &amp;#34;Oh brother where art thou&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; LOL&lt;br /&gt;Now we&#x27;re Dapper Dan Men.....no Fop @%^%  We tried all three and like them all, so do the Ladies!&lt;br /&gt;Clean scent(s)</li>
    <li> Great product! Applies easily. Great hold without a sticky finish. Very low shine. Looks like you use no product at all. Also I&#x27;ve received compliments on the look of the can and women love the smell.</li>
    <li> So much better than fop.</li>
    <li> Great to work with! My husband loved it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I am now an official dapper dan man</li>
    <li> After about twenty years of short hair I decided to go long again. So I looked around to find something to tame my otherwise unruly hair. Beauticians and barbers all recommended one of the American modern brands but it had too strong of both shine and smell. So I went with Dapper Dan, a well tried formulation from the UK. Since I&#x27;d not used pomade in decades I got both the matt (i.e. low shine) versions, clay in the red can and paste in the dark gold can. Between the two I like the paste better when my hair was too short to tie back but long enough to be unruly. Once it grew to a respectable length, either for a pony tail or a bun the clay&#x27;s advantages were obvious so now that it is time to re-order I&#x27;m going entirely with the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay version is harder to get out of the can, so you end up wetting your fingers and making several small additions. The paste is easier to get out of the can and easier to get too much. Too much of the paste is kind of waxy and has to be combed out with more water to spread out. The clay also thickens the look of the hair and too much is, well, too much, too. Both will hold a long time, and will help the hair come back together during the day if it is combed with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve changed my rating on the clay from four stars to five stars since it turns out that it wears as well or better after multiple re-combings. When using the paste I do sometimes get a bit too much to easily spread out with combing.</li>
    <li> My husband is a big &amp;#34;Oh Brother Where Art Thou&amp;#34; fan. So Santa got him a can of Dapper Dan, a comb and a hair net for his stocking.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Got it for my boyfriend and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Product is pretty good ,but you sent me the Wrong type, it was the Fresh Scent type in the Red tin container. the Clear label in the back Said Bergomot Scented I found that out when I put some in my Hair.  either way the product is good only my not getting the Scent I wanted was my Disappointment.</li>
    <li> It has a strong hold with out looking greasy.</li>
    <li> It absolutely does not smell like sandalwood. The scent is bergamot, which I loathe. However, the hold is perfect and my hair was not sticky or heavy. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair the day after, but it still looked good and was easily brushed out of the cowlick at the back of my head that sleeping produced. I only wish it smelt nicer.</li>
    <li> Seems to hold well. Haven&#x27;t tried to use it for styling yet. Feels waxy which I guess is the point. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  Was shipped on time and not damaged!</li>
    <li> mainly bought this can because I&#x27;m a fan of the movie,&amp;#34;Oh Brother Where Art Thou&amp;#34;, arrived fast, i like it because its paste but its super smooth and soft, has a nice hold to it. and a unique lemony peppery kind of smell to it, but all together a good purchase i would probably buy it again</li>
    <li> Ordered because always wanted to try it, now I&#x27;m hooked. Officially a Dapper Dan man.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for being water based.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!  My hair still looked the same when I got back home from work as it did when I left.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son as a gift and he loves it!</li>
