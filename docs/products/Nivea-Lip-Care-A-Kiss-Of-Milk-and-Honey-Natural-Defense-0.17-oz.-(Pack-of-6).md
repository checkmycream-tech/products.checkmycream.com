      <li>This multi-pack should tie her over for a couple of years, lol.  </li>
      <li>that is very nice also if you want a bit of color.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is perfect, as is glides on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy feeling on your lips.</li>
      <li>I have tried many others and this is the best product for protection and comfort.</li>
      <li>There are many options for lip care, but I think this is the best choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms and I like this the best.</li>
      <li>, Nivia remains fairly pliant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lasts longer, and feels good.</li>
      <li>that are no where as good as this one.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is FANTASTIC and the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>Price is good too.</li>
      <li>I use one, it is good, as I expected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it has the best smell—simply sweet</li>
      <li>Love this flavor!</li>
      <li>But for now, I love Nivea!</li>
      <li>LOVE these!</li>
      <li>; WHICH IS MY FAVORITE EVER!</li>
      <li>Nivea Milk and Honey has great texture and a scent and taste that are very mild.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I thought it was the kind that you get in Africa and Europe.  </li>
      <li>Honey is supposed to be good for skin and most everything else.  </li>
      <li>I liked it, but it wasn&#x27;t the one.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t taste like any kind of fruit.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>My favorite stuff :) always gotta have one with me and with the six pack I never have to be without one!</li>
      <li>Excellent lip moisture product---goes on very gently and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It is by far, the best lip balm/chapstick that I have *ever* used!</li>
      <li>and I was looking for a healthy, effective lip balm for the winter.</li>
      <li>I think this lip balm is just some of the best on the market and has a nice low price.  </li>
      <li>And has i nice very mild scent of honey as well.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite version yet.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s more of it in a tube than Burt&#x27;s Bees, and Burts Bee&#x27;s isn&#x27;t as organic as it claims to be anyway, so I don&#x27;t mind choosing this over that.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this chap stick.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, gives a nice shine and not sticky.</li>
      <li>love the smell, the feel is moisturizing, but not greasy or waxy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>In terms of moisturization, milk and honey does a better job than most.  </li>
      <li>I love most of the Nivea Lip Care line and this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I received this three days ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Read more at [...]</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so i love drinking milk and honey</li>
      <li>and now I love this chap stick.  </li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite version of the nivea lip balms.</li>
      <li>it has a nice smooth feel without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Nivea seldom disappoints and this lip balm is definitely one of its best products.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>So imagine my surprise when, practically overnight, the price more than doubled here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So glad they offer the 6 pack</li>
      <li>Definitely better that the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34</li>
      <li>That might just be me, perhaps it works better on others.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff -</li>
      <li>As soon as I use it, my lips feel so much better.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and love the honey &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but it still smells great and makes my lips so soft.</li>
      <li>Got a 6 pack at an amazing price ($10), but now it&#x27;s more than twice as much, so figure out cost per stick</li>
      <li>Seems to work fine, according to my SO for whom I bought it.  </li>
      <li>Really cheap smelling</li>
      <li>If I can find a truly organic bees wax balm for cheap, I&#x27;ll consider switching.</li>
      <li>but I was thoroughly upset to get what smells like cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years---comes in many different formulas---they are all good.  </li>
      <li>Just got it today and this lip balm smells great, something familiar that took me hours to finally figure out...</li>
      <li>my lips nicely and lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally found this product at Walmart but after about a month they stopped stocking it.  </li>
      <li>super smooth and emollient.</li>
      <li>My lips are so soft after three days of use and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Not so cool</li>
      <li>this is nice and natural.</li>
      <li>Such a good price to order in bulk.</li>
      <li>recommend to buy Australian Gold SPF 30 Lip Balm, really good one.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think the honey does anything more than perhaps provide scent or flavor.</li>
      <li>I can handle the scent of the original Carmex fine, I want to advise anyone considering to buy this to try and smell it first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually, just one type, if they are mixed with different flavors, it will be perfect.</li>
      <li>like it very much!</li>
      <li>I still prefer to use good &#x27;ole Vaseline myself before bed or before going out for a long run.</li>
      <li>It applies easy, and feels really moist without being waxy like some BB&#x27;s lip balm I know.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is a little spicy on the lips, which is always a nice feeling, but in the end you wind up applying a bit more of it over time</li>
      <li>the price is good, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot as far as protection goes.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a lip balm that was more natural and hopefully contained honey.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this lip balm because \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; website gave it a very positive review</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ve tried many other varieties in the Nivea &#x27;Kiss of&#x27; family, milk and honey remains my all-time favorite.  </li>
      <li>Put this non-waxy, super smooth balm on your lips before you go to bed and awaken with super soft, hydrated lips.  </li>
      <li>I think this stuff is better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried them all from cheap to expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great deal and hard to find.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am so disappointed in Amazon...and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever said this.&lt;br /&gt;I use this lip balm exclusively and bought 12 tubes every two months from Amazon, like clockwork&lt;br /&gt;(yes, I really do use that much!). It is by far, the best lip balm/chapstick that I have *ever* used! So imagine my surprise when, practically overnight, the price more than doubled here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I usually hate it when people give a product a low rating for something other than the product itself. But this seems to be the only recourse I can think of. If enough people notice and refuse to buy it for the outrageous amounts Amazon is asking, maybe, just maybe, Amazon will take notice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - I keep it in my purse, by my bedstead and in my pocket when I am sailing.  During cold, dry weather, skin dries out, especially around the mouth and lips.  Nivia balm really helps.  It is not &#x27;stiff and hard&#x27; like the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lip balm (I love that stuff too - but when it is cold out, it turns to something resembling stone), Nivia remains fairly pliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried them all from cheap to expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, the feel is moisturizing, but not greasy or waxy.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! I switched from Chapstick and will never go back. This is my favorite version of the nivea lip balms.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it on my lips and around my eyes too. I like to have one on me at all times - especially in winter. Some complain about the smell but I don&#x27;t mind it at all (there is a slight fragrance) and normally I am quite sensitive to fragrance. So glad they offer the 6 pack so I can keep one in a pocket of every jacket! Plus my kids and my boyfriend are always pilfering mine if they can&#x27;t find theirs so this way I&#x27;ll keep a secret stash. It is a savings too since normally they retail for about $5 each!</li>
    <li> Nom alert! Yes - this chapstick is in fact as delicious as it sounds.  While I&#x27;ve tried many other varieties in the Nivea &#x27;Kiss of&#x27; family, milk and honey remains my all-time favorite.  The rich, emollient, dark yellow product glides on easily and leaves lips feeling glossy and soothed.  It has a very light, pleasantly sweet smell, though I&#x27;m sad to report the balm is flavorless (wouldn&#x27;t a dose of honey flavor be divine?!?)  In terms of moisturization, milk and honey does a better job than most.  My lips are left feeling smooth and hydrated for at least two hours after application. The only real downside - the tube didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to (approximately three weeks with daily use).    Read more at [...]</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a coworker who swears by this product. I sue the regular blue Nivea. She said it was hard to find this lately and I purchased the pack of 6 for her as a holiday gift.</li>
    <li> Love this.  We are sensitive to petroleum (plus, who wants to put fossil fuels on their LIPS?), and this product does a great job of softening, and hydrating lips, without being too heavy or making me feel like it&#x27;s melting down my throat like most lip products do.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this about four days ago and I must say that it works! My lips feel so refreshed and moisturized. It also repaired marks that I&#x27;ve had since I was little. My lips look perfect now and I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Nivea seldom disappoints and this lip balm is definitely one of its best products.  Silky smooth and moisturizes without ultimately drying out my lips like other lip balms I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Really great product....love it. Try the hint of mint and mineral if you like mint. Doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it. Really great product.</li>
    <li> I think this lip balm is just some of the best on the market and has a nice low price.  It doesn&#x27;t color your lips and it doesn&#x27;t taste like any kind of fruit.  If you have chapped lips or don&#x27;t want chapped lips, this is for you.  As soon as I use it, my lips feel so much better.  I like getting it from Amazon.  It comes in a 6 pack.  I sometimes have a hard time finding it in stores. I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Just got it today and this lip balm smells great, something familiar that took me hours to finally figure out...it&#x27;s jasmine scented w/ a hint of nature&#x27;s herbal touch, a little sweet honey scent maybe...I know, I was expecting some milky/honey scent.  It applies easy, and feels really moist without being waxy like some BB&#x27;s lip balm I know. I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms and I like this the best. Price is good too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip balm because \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; website gave it a very positive review and I was looking for a healthy, effective lip balm for the winter. This lip balm is FANTASTIC and the best I have tried. It is smooth, has a very faint fragrance/taste, and stays effective for a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried $28 lip balms (Dr. Weil Origins) that are no where as good as this one. Its fantastic and priced low enough that I can keep extras in the car, at work, bedside, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a version with SPF 30 that is ideal for daytime if you are outdoors.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this chap stick. Beware when you get it, it has a sort of flower/honey smell to it. I got used to this smell and now I love this chap stick.  I put it on every night before I go to bed. It makes my lips smooth, but it does give a slight tint to them because the chap stick is a yellowish color.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine, according to my SO for whom I bought it.  This multi-pack should tie her over for a couple of years, lol.  I still prefer to use good &#x27;ole Vaseline myself before bed or before going out for a long run.</li>
    <li> I use one, it is good, as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, just one type, if they are mixed with different flavors, it will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Best lip gloss. I have tried many others and this is the best product for protection and comfort. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product at Walmart but after about a month they stopped stocking it.  I have used the regular Nivea lip balm, but it is substandard compared to Milk and Honey.  I have looked for it everywhere I shop and was repeatedly disappointed.  Finding it on Amazon was a bonus as I could buy it in multiples and save some cash.  Nivea Milk and Honey has great texture and a scent and taste that are very mild.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used. Sinks right in and moisturizes my lips right away. And has i nice very mild scent of honey as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only chapstick I&#x27;ll use. it has a nice smooth feel without feeling greasy. It lasts a long time on the lips. I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite lip balm and it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores. The price is great as is the quality! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> I used so much Chapstick this year. Normally I would get the regular brand or Burt&#x27;s bees. Once I got on vacation I sort of lost track of all my Chapstick and I stopped putting some on regularly. I bought this product a few weeks ago, and it works miracles. As soon as I started applying it regularly I&#x27;ve found that I have less chapped and dry lips then I used to. I totally Redmond this product to other buyers.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these stashed everywhere - purse, car, nightstand, makeup bag, &amp; coffee table. Goes on smoothly, gives a nice shine and not sticky. Love this flavor!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home w/o it. Moisture without a greasy feel. Great</li>
    <li> My favorite stuff :) always gotta have one with me and with the six pack I never have to be without one!</li>
    <li> I could no longer find this at Target, so I turned to Amazon.  I love this lip balm.  Leaves my lips soft. Does not wear off too quickly, but isn&#x27;t overly thick.</li>
    <li> I received this three days ago and I absolutely love it. I got the six pack because I like to carry them around in different purses or book bags. My lips are so soft after three days of use and it smells amazing. I usually like burts bee&#x27;s, but I decided to give this a try. I might use this in place of my burt&#x27;s bees now.</li>
    <li> This has become the only lip balm I will use.  Living in a dry area, my lips were constantly in need of moisture.  This product works so well on me, has no smell or nasty taste and had decent ingredients.</li>
    <li> First off Iove all of Nivea&#x27;s products. I bought this thinking it would smell like vanilla. Wrong. It smells very weird almost like expired honey or something. It gives my lips moisture but it does stink.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like slightly shiny lip care, and this has a nice shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;Coats my lips nicely and lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not into the smell. It&#x27;s not *bad*, I just personally think it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;If you like to really coat your lips (like I have a tendency to do when they&#x27;re really dry), the product leaves a slightly yellow tint on your lips (which is the color of the actual stick.) The yellow isn&#x27;t crazy noticeable, but I can tell it&#x27;s there sometimes and it bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it using it and wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone not to buy it.</li>
    <li> There are many options for lip care, but I think this is the best choice. Lasts longer, and feels good. Buy in bulk and save $$.</li>
    <li> I have tried Eos (I really wanted Eos to work because the packaging is so cool and the balm is so tasty) in multiple flavors, different kinds of Nivea, Carmex, and chapstick. I have tried Burt&#x27;s Bees as well. This is a little cheaper than Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it works as well (I may even dare to say it works a little bit better). We all have a different set of biology and mine favors bees wax when it comes to my lips. I don&#x27;t dehydrate easily, I always have a bottle of water close at hand and refill religiously, especially when I&#x27;m in school, so even when I chap, I don&#x27;t crack all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I have had two tubes of this stuff since the beginning of last semester (in August). Somehow I managed to keep track of both, and both are almost empty. So I bought this six pack as a reserve. I expect it to last all year. Burt&#x27;s Bees is a little spicy on the lips, which is always a nice feeling, but in the end you wind up applying a bit more of it over time than you would this Nivea A Kiss of Honey stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Nivea a kiss of moisture, and that did not work for me. I liked it, but it wasn&#x27;t the one. This, this is THE ONE for me. There&#x27;s more of it in a tube than Burt&#x27;s Bees, and Burts Bee&#x27;s isn&#x27;t as organic as it claims to be anyway, so I don&#x27;t mind choosing this over that. If I can find a truly organic bees wax balm for cheap, I&#x27;ll consider switching. But for now, I love Nivea!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Keep lips moist.</li>
    <li> My lips are always dry and I use lip balm constantly.  This lip balm is perfect, as is glides on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy feeling on your lips.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Price has nearly doubled in 18 months. I paid $11 and change for this same 6-pack in May of 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but the price increase? Not so cool</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms, especially in the winter when the weather is really cold and dry. This is thicker than some of the other Nivea lip balms, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll wipe off very easily but it&#x27;s still not waxy or sticky like some bees wax containing brands. There&#x27;s no taste and only a very faint scent. Best lip care out there!</li>
    <li> Excellent lip moisture product---goes on very gently and smoothly.  I have used this for years---comes in many different formulas---they are all good.  You can get tinted that is very nice also if you want a bit of color.</li>
    <li> To put it simply, this lip balm literally stinks. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this when I bought it from the store -I was expecting a sweet scent similar to shea butter or vanilla but I was thoroughly upset to get what smells like cheap perfume. Really cheap smelling perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a defective balm. I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;Considering I can handle the scent of the original Carmex fine, I want to advise anyone considering to buy this to try and smell it first. This sad lipbalm will remain in the dark corners of my drawer for last resort situations.</li>
    <li> She started using this product to break her addiction to Chapstick after seeing it on the DR Oz show. She swears by it.</li>
    <li> super smooth and emollient. the honey gives it a nice tack which i love because i hate gloppy lip glosses. it has the best smell—simply sweet—i have never been a fan of artificial fruit smells on lip balm, it always makes you feel like you ate something weird. this is nice and natural.</li>
    <li> THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED, BUT DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE &amp;#34;MILK &amp; HONEY&amp;#34; WHICH IS MY FAVORITE EVER!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years.  This is my favorite version yet.  Such a good price to order in bulk.</li>
    <li> it shipped wrong items twice, both returned, and re-ordered another brand. recommend to buy Australian Gold SPF 30 Lip Balm, really good one.</li>
    <li> I always purchase six when I run low. Great product.</li>
    <li> Allergic. Horrible. Had to return.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I live in Alaska and it gets very dry in the winter. Put this non-waxy, super smooth balm on your lips before you go to bed and awaken with super soft, hydrated lips.  I wear it all day long when at home.  I&#x27;ve given it as a small. Gift to a number of people who&#x27;ve all given it rave reviews. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I like this since it covers the lips but doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feel.  I like the taste as well.</li>
    <li> I love most of the Nivea Lip Care line and this one is my favorite.  Got a 6 pack at an amazing price ($10), but now it&#x27;s more than twice as much, so figure out cost per stick and then see if you can buy it locally for less.</li>
    <li> Great taste, long lasting, yet does not melt too bad when exposed to the heat. We like it!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and love the honey &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have these all over the house.  They have a great feel and taste.  Definitely better that the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; other brands!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I have A LOT of lip products and this one is just on a whole other level. So moisturizing, has a great scent but not too overpowering. The moisture is long lasting, I don&#x27;t end up reapplying this to dry lips over and over.</li>
    <li> Ok, so i love drinking milk and honey and I have milk and honey lotion from bath and body works and this stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly mell like I thought it would but it still smells great and makes my lips so soft.</li>
    <li> I find most lip balms to be ineffective and only make my lips feel waxy and gross. This stuff feels a little greasy when it goes on, but after a short time my lips feel soft again. In a pack of six, I can keep the sticks lying around so they&#x27;re there when I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: This stuff will absolutely melt in a hot car.</li>
    <li> Not the same as in the stores.  I could tell as soon as I tried it on that this was not the same as what I purchased in the stores.  The consistency was different and it irritated my lips.  Unfortunately I returned the products.</li>
    <li> I had bought Nivea lip balm because I always had a problem with chapped lips. When I first started using it, it did not feel greasy and made my lips very soft very fast. Later on, the lip balm started feeling very greasy and took longer to soften my lips.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Sensitive to everything else but this.  Great deal and hard to find.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t survive winter in the north without these.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lip balm that was more natural and hopefully contained honey.  Honey is supposed to be good for skin and most everything else.  I was looking at Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s balm, but it seemed pricey and I saw a review by someone recommending this instead.  It&#x27;s ok.  I like the large size of the tubes and the price is good, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot as far as protection goes.  That might just be me, perhaps it works better on others.  Another thing is to get the benefits of honey you have to have raw honey and this isn&#x27;t, so I really don&#x27;t think the honey does anything more than perhaps provide scent or flavor.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it was the kind that you get in Africa and Europe.  The packaging is very similar, but the product is very different.  It has a much different, and for me, unpleasant flavor.  It might please others, though.</li>
