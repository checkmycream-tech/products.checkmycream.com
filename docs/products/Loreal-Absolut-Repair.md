      <li>still, really worth buying.</li>

      <li>Worth the price?</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>The Power Repair does its job beautifully by giving your hair that extra boost in hydration, silkiness and shine that it needs every once in a while, especially before and after coloring and/or highlighting.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a joke, for the hair was much better, although still healing from the second time, but my hair was falling also</li>
      <li>I use every 4-6 weeks to help repair damaged hair and like to use with L&#x27;oreal Intense Repair Masque!</li>
      <li>This product worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>I put it all over in my hair first thing in the morning tied up my hair and put on a headband and went about my day.</li>
      <li>After using all treatments I could find out to be best, the hair was about to get better, and it took me a year for each trouble, when the third hairdresser whom I bought products for years to fix the hair did her part in destroying my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This product is really absolute repair, if u have damaged hair, u should try it.</li>
      <li>Nothing to really write home about.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes your hair so much healthier.</li>
      <li>It was real and it hurt.</li>
      <li>My hair is very damage.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, shine and so pretty.</li>
      <li>I received the products complete and my wife and daughter said that it works fast</li>
      <li>protein-based so it makes my hair feel very soft and strong without weighing it down at all.</li>
      <li>I have had my beautiful curly hair destroyed 3 times by three different hairdressers whom I did not even know well, to do the ordinary thing on my hair, dye and dry.</li>
      <li>Its magic thing that repairs hair in 5 minutes, after shampoo, in a towel dryed hair apply small amount and leave in 5 minutes, than u need to rinse, thats all.</li>
      <li>Too many years of highlighting and sun created dull, thinning ends.  </li>
      <li>Wow...</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal professional product.</li>
      <li>The hair treatment the salon sent me home with just made the hair too soft to doing anything with it.</li>
      <li>This makes your hair silky, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had these power doses done in the salon many times before but they are pretty expensive.</li>
      <li>My hair was dry, frizzy and unmanageable, words that can not describe the real deal.</li>
      <li>I am now able to do the treatment at home for less than half the cost!</li>
      <li>These really make a difference I use 1 vial every other week or every 3 weeks</li>
      <li>The first one started all, after that I went to other hairdresser that were referred to me few years back by someone else and told him about the hair being damaged with a relaxer, that was not proper for my hair, which was done by the first one.</li>
      <li>My hair has soft baby hair mixed with a more dry thick her, but not much which I think is what makes it curly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She seemed to have not only dry out the hair and scalp completely</li>
      <li>Now, this time was the worse, the hair was much more dry and breakable.</li>

    <li> This stuff really works. My stylist has been using this on me for years, after coloring/chemical treatments. Since I have moved, I haven&#x27;t been able to get this and my hair has started drying. When I found this here, I grabbed it. This makes your hair silky, soft and shiny. I swear by this product. You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth. And it smells good too by the way. I use 2 vials for my hair because I have long hair. If you&#x27;re gonna do it at home, spray the stuff evenly onto your hair from roots to tips, massage the product thoroughly onto your scalp. Then wrap your hair with saran wrap and leave it on for about an hour. After, rinse it well and that&#x27;s it. Don&#x27;t shampoo your hair the next day to leave the product in your hair longer. This stuff works. Even if you do not have damaged hair, this will just give your hair the extra boost it needs. I can&#x27;t praise this product enough.</li>
    <li> Too many years of highlighting and sun created dull, thinning ends.  I have used 3 times and my hair is stronger and shinier.  Made a big difference.</li>
    <li> I am African American and naturally my roots are very tight.  I went from getting a relaxer every 4-6 weeks to now having gone over 5 months without.  This product is one of the many products in my aresenal,it helps relax my roots and gives my hair a healthy shine.  It is a protein so only use it once a month.</li>

My hair has soft baby hair mixed with a more dry thick her, but not much which I think is what makes it curly.&lt;br /&gt;I could not even put my hair in my pillow. The scalp got dry and started to hurt, I had sores on the scalp, which is still healing. I had to cut the hair as I treated it with some oils and off course \\&quot;Lorea&#x27;l expert power repair B and Renew C treatment\\&quot;, which I still do myself twice a week. It has helped the hair strengthen, soften, and loose from the scalp, for the hair glue to scalp like crazy. The last hairdresser had told me that I would need a wig. I thought it was a joke, for the hair was much better, although still healing from the second time, but my hair was falling also, I got different naked spots on the scalp, and I can tell you the type of pain I felt on the scalp, like needles penetrating it, or like someone knifing you on the head. It was real and it hurt. It has been four years, my hair is very short, like a man, and every time it needs it, I trimm the ends, then do the treatment. I feel I am getting there. My life totally change with this problem, but Lorea&#x27;l have given me hope and and strength to continue my quest for my new beautiful hair.ears, my hair is very short, like a man, and every time it needs it, I trimm the ends, then do the treatment.

    <li> Outstanding repair product for my hair!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product, when I went to reorder it was not available. I have discovered that it has been discontinued; I would love to know why, as it is extremely popular. I wonder if L&#x27;oreal has stopped selling it to consumers, so it can be a pricey treatment offered in salons only.</li>
    <li> This product is really absolute repair, if u have damaged hair, u should try it. Its magic thing that repairs hair in 5 minutes, after shampoo, in a towel dryed hair apply small amount and leave in 5 minutes, than u need to rinse, thats all. The effect woulb be better if use cellular shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. I was going to my hairdresser and it costs me $25 each time just for the treatment. Now I can do it at home on my own schedule and for a great price!</li>
    <li> I used this and it was amazing. I put it all over in my hair first thing in the morning tied up my hair and put on a headband and went about my day. (I was at a spa that day so it was fine that my hair was like that.:)&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair the following morning and as I was rinsing it I could feel the difference already! Wow... like silk. I finished up by styling my hair as usual and it was glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed and styled my hair one more time since then and I am amazed at the level of shine and the look and feel of health in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use every 4-6 weeks to help repair damaged hair and like to use with L&#x27;oreal Intense Repair Masque! Great product</li>
    <li> No works immediately, you need to buy 3 o 4 times more if you want to see the results in your hair</li>
    <li> Love this, seems to be helping my hair and I love how my hair feels after.</li>
    <li> Used as directed - even though I am not a hairdresser, I went to L&#x27;Oreal website to get specific instructions. Absolutely no change, improvement, or benefit to my hair. I got a much better result by using a Joico keratin pack and then a home-made hot oil treatment (warmed avocado oil) two days later (no washing in between treatments). I question whether or not this is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; L&#x27;Oreal professional product. It may be, but if so - not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It makes my hair soft, shine and so pretty. Everybody is asking what kind of product I&#x27;ve been using....no words! I just cant live without it anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have any kind of hair issue just buy these. I have THE WORST thin, brittle, hair. It just breaks off when I brush or do anything with it. These really make a difference I use 1 vial every other week or every 3 weeks or whenever I need a boost before a vacation or a big event. I used to have the sprayer that came with them but since have lost it so now I just concentrate distributing the product evening with my hands. I leave it on in the shower for a few minutes like a deep conditioner and wash it off.</li>
    <li> This product truly works!  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> did nothing, would not buy again</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the way my hair looks and feels after a treatment.It even seems to help curtail falling hair ( After a illness last year my hair started to thin and fall).This product really helped. However, in my case, the treatment needs to be repeated at least weekly...still, really worth buying.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. The power dose worked just like it does at the salon I go to.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much or you got more for your money. Then I could use it more often.</li>
    <li> I received the products complete and my wife and daughter said that it works fast and it is an excellent product</li>
    <li> These came quickly and worked great for my dry and colored hair.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Seriously. I cannot use heavy waxy conditioners but this product is mainly protein-based so it makes my hair feel very soft and strong without weighing it down at all. I actually use just a dime size amount when I get out of the shower as a finishing conditioner. It&#x27;s a style/condition product but again without weighing it down. My hair has never felt softer or stronger.</li>
    <li> love these treatments. It repaired my hair tremendously.</li>
    <li> Received a color bath at the salon to lighten my over dyed dark brown hair. That process left me with a damaged frizzy mess. The hair treatment the salon sent me home with just made the hair too soft to doing anything with it. I remembered this power dose treatment I received once at a L&#x27;Oreal Salon. It definitely works. I&#x27;ve read you should use it every 14 days or every 5 washes. So, I will follow the directions .Leaves the damaged hair smooth and easier to maintain until it grows out or you cut it out! Quite a deal price wise. You pay $20 to $25 at a salon for this treatment.</li>
    <li> They are ok. Almost not enough in each bottle.</li>
