      <li>This oil is powerful and seems to be pure.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item, it was because on the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; appears with a photo saying \\&quot;2 pack\\&quot; and in specific seller listing it said \\&quot;multi pack\\&quot;, meaning it was being sold as 2 - 1 oz bottles with the deal of \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;, which makes sense since there are many offers for a 2 pack for around $5.49 etc, plus \\&quot;shipping\\&quot;.</li>

      <li>I mixed it with eucalyptus and the bugs don&#x27;t come near.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use a mix of citronella oil and water as a cat repellent. It has work great. Citronella&#x27;s odor is really strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. As long as it keeps cats away.</li>
    <li> Great product - strong scent.  Seems to be excellent grade.</li>
    <li> great  for  me,  pets, and  house.  Arizona  has  no  shortage  of  bugs  in spring and summer. I  hate  chemicals.  have  sensitive  skin  and  don&#x27;t  want  pets  exposed  to  toxins.  this  keeps  bugs  away  without  danger</li>
    <li> I mixed this oil with witch hazel in a small spray bottle. One part oil to ten parts witch hazel. It works pretty good&lt;br /&gt;at keeping mosquitoes away but you have to reapply often. Smells nice and it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I sprinkle a few drops throughout my house also put a couple drops on burning candles.  Put a couple drops near the litter boxes.I use other aromatherapy too but this seems to be the best at covering the litter box smell.</li>
    <li> I love it because it keep bugs way and the scent is very good .</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality Citronella oil. Extremely strong scent. I put several drops on a cotton ball, set in a small dish on the patio. The mosquitoes are &amp;#34;NO shows&amp;#34; to the party. So many other uses too. Do the research. Amazing.</li>
    <li> This oil hold their scent very well and the quality is very rich.  I will buy from this company agin, and will encourage all who want to purchase their oils do it they are excellent</li>
    <li> I bought this in order to make my own mosquito repellant before I went on vacation. It was great, thanks(:</li>
    <li> When I got it in the mail it was bigger than I imagined it would be I am happy with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to find this! It&#x27;s helps a lot wit my health conditions! Defiantly will buy again!</li>
    <li> It worked to keep the bugs and Mosquitos outside and off the dog. Put sone in a candle and made a spray.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful. I am using it to create my own oil blend for hot flashes. Received my order quickly and it was packaged very well to avoid breakage. A generous amount for the price compared to similar products. Definitely will be a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> very good price for a the size of bottle.  I had been getting the citronella oil from Hobby Lobby and their bottles were a lot smaller.  And quick shipping.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more that I hate than false advertising, sales gimmicks, bait and switch, or \\&quot;programming glitches or errors\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item, it was because on the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; appears with a photo saying \\&quot;2 pack\\&quot; and in specific seller listing it said \\&quot;multi pack\\&quot;, meaning it was being sold as 2 - 1 oz bottles with the deal of \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot;, which makes sense since there are many offers for a 2 pack for around $5.49 etc, plus \\&quot;shipping\\&quot;. So I order eager to try the product because its a 2 pack with free shipping, but then somehow after ordering, my order then turns in to a single bottle! I am eager to try product, but because of the \\&quot;mix up\\&quot; , I must give only 2 stars. I am always a very careful shopper and don&#x27;t have money to waste, I do not like being lied to either purposely or \\&quot;by mistake\\&quot;. There are dozens of websites offering the 1oz bottle for around $2.39 to $2.79 (look up the price online for a single 1 oz bottle), so why would I choose a single 1 oz bottle for over $5.49???, so once again do yourself a favor and take a \\&quot;screen grab\\&quot; of the original ad with seller listed, before ordering to \\&quot;prove\\&quot; the offer from a specific seller, just in case! I am furious at being mislead, its no secret that many offers possibly \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; from second to second, but not when you click on to order. Very Disappointing, watch out for those random \\&quot;glitches\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this as a natural insect repellent this summer, but the smell is nauseating. Be warned that this smells NOTHING like the citronella candles.</li>
    <li> I put it on myself and in the dog&#x27;s soap to keep the bugs away...seems to work, but once the scent dissipates, it is no longer working and the bugs do come back.  Thinking about putting it on some light bulbs to see if it keeps the bugs from swarming them at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own citronella candles, and I have to say just keeping the jar in my purse was enough to repel mosquitoes! I was very impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> Great for home made bug reppelant</li>
    <li> Using it for my chemical free buy spray, works wonder and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I use this oil to repel mosquitoes. It only take a few drops rubbed on the skin (behind ears, on arms etc) and no bothersome insects.</li>
    <li> I prepared insect repellent candles using biodiesel, citronella and lemongrass oil and bugs don&#x27;t even get close to my house.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic citronella oil.  In many cases, citronella reminds me of overly strong bug candles (which it is used for).  This particular brand, however, is sweet, floral, citrus-y, and slightly grassy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does put me in mind of warm summer nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that it is a strong oil.  If you intend to mix it with other essential oils, be sure to do a small test batch first.  This citronella will easily overwhelm any other oil you might be using.  I personally mixed an oil with 12 drops pine, 18 drops juniper, and 4 drops citronella - and all I can smell is the citronella, with a very faint juniper undertone.</li>
    <li> Excellent versatile oil!  Seller shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> This stuff really keeps the mosquitoes away! I mixed it with baby oil and sprayed it on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Good for putting in candle for outdoor great for Mosquitos you must try</li>
    <li> Smells nice and muggy, love it! I think i&#x27;ll go throw some in the diffuser now &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly than I aspected. I mix it with oil to repelling the mosquitoes but by time I decided to go outside it was raining. Therefore not an 100% sure works to repelling but I must say this oil smells just like the stuff that&#x27;s in burning candles for mosquitoes</li>
    <li> This oil is powerful and seems to be pure.  Does the trick for insect repelling.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so potent and was really pleased at the quality.</li>
    <li> Im desappointed... One bottle came half..with loose cap..package. Smelling with citronella..</li>
    <li> I made my own mosquito repellent using this oil for a recent trip to a city with West Nile Virus. I was very careful to cover myself and don&#x27;t go out during peak mosquitoes time so I can&#x27;t guarantee how well my mixture worked but with all my precautions I didn&#x27;t get stung so overall I&#x27;m pleased with this oil. Nice size at a good price.</li>
    <li> I mixed the oil with some ethanol in a spray bottle and spray the yard before a bbq, it works great.. some critters do slip btwn the cracks, but it&#x27;s way better than the insect off which has harsh chemicals and make me feel like i&#x27;m crop-dusting myself.</li>
    <li> Used it to keep dog from using rug as urine spot.  Did not work all that well, but will continue to use it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> no more will you cats even approach my boots, they sniff and run, yes run for there lives, ha ha ha ahhh.&lt;br /&gt;your rain of spray tactics will proceed no more, the battlefield  go&#x27;s to me, the victor.</li>
    <li> I like making my own organic bug repellent, since I hate chemicals. This works perfectly. Put about 10 drops in a quarter cup of olive oil, and put it in a very small spray bottle. This will keep the mosquitoes and other bugs away without worrying about killing you with chemicals. Love this, and you can make half a dozen batches from this, and hand a little sprayer to each of your kids. As long as they are over the age of six, they should be able to use this themselves without too much of a mess. If you get an oil stain from the olive oil, you can just dab some laundry soap or Shout on it and soak it, and it will come out.</li>
    <li> Great stuff use it to ward off those pesky bugs. EOs are the better way to go. Many uses and small amounts go a long way.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for both our cats and dog on things we want to teach them to stay away from (scratching carpet, chewing table legs, etc.) when bitter sprays and everything else failed miserably and this stuff works great. Apply it consistently for a couple of weeks, and they&#x27;ll never touch it again!</li>
    <li> So I bought it for the lovely animal issue I have in front of my house. It seems like all cats and dogs want to take a poo right in my yard so I am hoping this stuff does the trick and scares them off. If it works then I definitely will be ordering more. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> Yes, an excellent product. I use it to dab the ears of one of my dogs so that  another dog will not lick his ears. They&#x27;ve gotten into a fight over this. Apparently dogs don&#x27;t like the smell of citrus. This stuff has a powerful citrus smell and, so far, has put a stop to the bothersome licking. I&#x27;ve also used it to make a spray.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled about it; waist of money for me.</li>
    <li> It does smell like citronella but with a touch of &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.  It does not last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I think NOW products are just as good as Young Living, DoTerra or Aria Cacia. But the difference...price. I go between Now, Aria Cacia and Plant Therapy for all my oils. That way I don;t have to pay the cost of having the sales rep for Young Living and DoTerra.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and a great product very useful to make cat spray to prevent furniture scratching  would definitely buy again and recomend to any buyer</li>
    <li> product arrived timely and intact.  Will be useful in aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> Helps keeps the Cats off my car.  Kept having issues with cats climbing on my car so put a few drops of this in a spray bottle and some water spray around the car and no Cats.  Also smells very good when climbing into my car now.</li>
    <li> Powerful! A little goes a long way. I used this product in homemade candles for an out door picnic.  We were not bothered by bugs getting to our food, but everything smelled of citronella afterwards. Next time, I&#x27;ll use more sparingly.</li>
    <li> Very potent. Use very little! It works!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to be used in homemade bug repellent.  It is wonderful.  I mixed it with eucalyptus and the bugs don&#x27;t come near.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is a part of my daily cleaning. Love it!</li>
    <li> Citronella &amp; Lemon Grass are natural insect repellents and much safer to use than deet.  Smells better too, I recommend this as an alternative.  You can sprinkle it on the dog&#x27;s bed, spray it under the sink and along baseboards to repel ants and other annoying insects.</li>
    <li> My essential oil, all natural mosquito repellent is now complete!  Plus, it will never expire like those expensive store brands that do not work!  Nice and strong scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Product smelled good very strong.i will be using this instead of the other stuff thats  made out of all the chemicals.The price was a  deal and i will keep you updated on future changes.</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with water to make a mosquito repellant. The mosquito is the state bird of Minnesota and with heavy spring rains, we have generations of mosquitos in our country home and yard. This does seem to help quite a bit. I have even sprayed the solution on my chihuahuas and they have few mosquito bites than they did a week ago.</li>
    <li> Just got the bottle today ,very happy!</li>
    <li> This oil came to me in a very timely fashion and was in excellent shape and I would use this company again for future purchases.</li>
