<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this serum.believe me I tried my share .as soon as I start to use this my skin felt smoother  and softer.my husband even said your skin looks really smooth.helped my skin not feel tight after washing and toning.I definitely will buy this from now on.I  am joining to definitely try other products from this company.thank you Sano:)!</li>
    <li> Works great, absorbs quickly and is non greasy. I use it on my face as well as the tops of my hands and cuticles. This product has no scent after application. I didn&#x27;t break out and was gentle on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, 2 times a day. I use it after washing my face. I was surprised to see how fast this absorbed and was able to apply make up after a min or so after application. Its clear, looks like water.&lt;br /&gt;Great list of ingredients, and all you need is about 4-5 drops when putting it on your face and be sure to pat it in, dont rub.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how this makes my skin on my face feel. I can go out in public without makeup and my face is glowing.  Have ordered two more for friends for gifts because I liked it that much .  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I would not buy again</li>
    <li> this is BY FAR, the best serum v-c I have ever purchased---will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really been using this very long, so far though, its great. It makes my face so smooth and soft. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes my skin soft and radiant.  The price is extremely affordable.  I recommend you try Sano Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
    <li> This is likely the best smelling vitamin C serum I have ever used!  I must admit that while I liked the smell and want to trust SANO Naturals for producing a great product, the bottle itself does NOT indicate whether or not it is really a 20% vitamin C solution.  Since most other brands I have used do list it on the bottle, I recommend SANO start doing the same.  Otherwise, from what I can tell, it&#x27;s fine.  Since I use quality Vitamin C serums all the time, I did not see any &#x27;noticeable&#x27; difference but I believe this serum will improve anyone&#x27;s skin with continued and daily use.</li>
    <li> This has brightened ,and evened out my tone. I am guessing that it will continue to improve as time goes by, but in 4 days that is what I have found so far. I feel like my face look fresher, more youthful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll be going through a lot of these bottles! Its too early to see any difference at the moment but I already feel good about it. It immediately absorbs into the skin and super easy to work with. Very fast shipping and securely packaged with a decent dropper. Hopefully will try more of their products. Very excited!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It smells nice and goes on great.  I feel like it was a really good deal</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have just recently started looking for ways to delay the inevitable. I am just starting to see fine lines on my forehead and decided I need to up my game as far as skincare goes. After a lot of research, I found that vitamin c and hyaluronic acid are the way to go when it comes to wrinkles. When I started to shop for products, I almost had a heart attack at how much other products cost. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now so I can&#x27;t report on long term results yet, but I am very happy with the price and the feel of the product. It&#x27;s a nice, lightweight, non greasy serum that layers well with my moisturizer and makeup. I will definitely be continuing with this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my skin dramatically.  I was skeptical at first but read that using Vit C is a great booster for your skin especially entering your thirties.  I started an anti-age regiment when I was 18 and now being 30 I wish I would have started using this sooner.  It makes my skin soft and brighter.  It has helped with break-outs and other skin irritations.  I use this more than on my face, back of my hands works great!  I recommend this to anyone and will continue to buy it.  The under eye cream works great too.  All natural, no chemicals and plant based, they way skin products should be made.</li>
    <li> When it comes to skincare products, I am rather skeptical on how well they they work, and the benefits. Now when I was approached to try and review this product, I wanted to give it a chance, and I had high expectations. For those who are unaware, Sano Naturals is skincare company that acknowledges that whatever you put on your skin inevitably gets absorbed into your body, which is why they use naturally derived, organic ingredients whenever possible. As for the Vitamin C Serum I tried, it’s one of their best sellers, and 96% naturally derived, and primarily organic. Sano Naturals’ products are produced in the USA in a GMP-certified, wind-energy powered facility, but best of all, with no animal testing, and 100% vegan formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a dark colored glass bottle, and has a little dropper attached so it is easily applied. Just squeeze the right amount into your palm, then apply it to your face, neck, and back of hands. It is odorless, colorless, and a bit watery, but that does not cause a problem with the application. Now this serum not only has anti-aging antioxidants, but it helps with hyperpigmentation, melasma, wrinkles, and collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since it arrived, and I am quite pleased with the results. I apply it twice daily. To begin, I cleanse my skin, then apply the serum all over my face and neck. My problems areas are my cheeks, corners of my mouth, and below my bottom lip because of darkened skin caused by PCOS and insulin resistance. So when applying, I made sure to get those target areas. It applied evenly, absorbed really well into my skin, and quickly. It was light, and left my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the next few weeks I will be posting before and after pictures to show the true effective nature this product has after nearly a month of use, but I will say after using this produce for the time being, my face is smoother, brighter, and supple. This product is effective, no irritation whatsoever, which I am thrilled about because skincare products cause redness and irritation easily on my sensitive skin. It’s great quality, I am very impressed with Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested, you can check out this video that Sano Naturals put together. Right now, you can purchase the Vitamin C Serum for less than $20, saving 80% off it’s original listing price. It includes a free bonus Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel ($35 Value), which also worked really well, and brightened my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that I wouldn&#x27;t like this- because you expect skincare to be very expensive- but I really like the consistency &amp; that it isn&#x27;t oily at all. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a lovely pair. The serum is very watery so it goes on the skin light and blends easily. It has no scent, I&#x27;ve tried to sniff it as much as I can and there really isn&#x27;t a smell to it. It&#x27;s moisturizing but takes a little while to set in the skin. Feels cool and fresh on the faces. As for the eye gel, it&#x27;s small but you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to put around the eyes. It smells like clean cut grass to me but it&#x27;s nothing strong. It has a jelly type consistency. And says you can dab around the forehead and cheeks so it&#x27;s nice that you can apply it else where besides around the eyes. It&#x27;s very cooling when you applied. Both of the products work well together and is a good for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal, I recommend it to anyone who loves natural products.</li>
    <li> The vitamin c serum gives a stingy feel onto my dry sensitive skin although no further reaction is experienced. Just a little bit of tingling then it vanishes away after a several seconds. As with all other serums, it is 20% concentration which is the intended usage. I was impressed that they eliminated water in which I find in almost any of my bottle as the first ingredient. It does make a difference because of the high concentrated formula, I need to only use a little bit and it works its magic without being too harsh and in the morning you could really see a difference with the skin. Makes it a little bit more supple, soft and really just a tad better than tired dry and flaky skin. Speaking of which it did treat uneven texture that I had especially around the mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel has a refreshing minty feel, not greasy and helps makeup adhere better. It dries very quickly &amp; smooths out the eye area. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles showing but it really does help in smoothing out creases especially under the eye. A little goes a long way, I dip my finger in the pot and whatever adheres to my finger I gently spread it around the eye area and it is enough so the little pot can last a long time. It is my favorite eye gel for the moment and I love love (1000x) how it really lives up to its claim.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this serum does exactly what it claims. I love that it smells a bit like cucumber and we all know cucumber on the eye is a great treat for the eyes. It has definitely exceeded my expectations I have the glow back in my face!!!</li>
    <li> Sano Naturals sent me a sample of their Vitamin C serum and eye gel to try. The first thing I noticed is that it does not tell you how much of the product to use. I used a dropperful of the serum on my face and just a dab of the gel around my eyes. This seemed to be enough product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been having some skin issues lately - mostly redness on my cheeks and nose. The serum seems to help calm the redness down a bit. I&#x27;m not sure if it had any other effects on my skin but I am happy with the red cheeks gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the eye gel, it was both good and bad. It was definitely a lot less sticky than some other eye gels I have tried. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Perhaps it needs a few more days to have any visible effect.</li>
    <li> This serum soaks right  into my skin, makes it feel great, and after one bottle I have noticed an improvement in my complexion.  The cobalt bottle helps to protect the vitamin c from light exposure.  So far am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product, fragrance-free; makes skin feel nice and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Used this for almost three months and honestly at first seem to improve my skin but then after the second month it seemed to dry it out so I stopped. Looked promising but when dryness started I stopped using and my skin is better.</li>
    <li> Feels nice but I didn&#x27;t see any result. It was easy to use everyday though.  Update: I used this product for a couple months and it had no effect on my skin</li>
    <li> No big changes in skin so far but I like the product and will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! I ordered this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used serums before but this works really well.  Its light and easy to apply.  I can certainly see a difference in my skin texture and my dark spots are fading.</li>
    <li> First time use: after washing face last night, I did my micro derma roller over my face and neck. I applied my Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum. Let it soak into skin then applied my nightly moisturize. I&#x27;ve awaken to incredibly smooth, wrinkle free skin. My liplines are gone! I can&#x27;t wait to see my next few days :) This is a really good serum. I have invested a small fortune in creams and moisturizers that haven&#x27;t worked, this is affordable and shows results. Order it now!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for two weeks now and no change, what a waste of money.  It has dryed out the skin under my eyes and made them look absolutely horrible.  Hopefully if you bought this toreduce the appearance of lines under the eyes don&#x27;t buy it will make them worse.</li>
    <li> Great product! After you applied it, you feel your skin tighten up and feel good.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum! I am on my 2nd bottle - it makes my skin very silky and I feel that it is helping my skin to look better. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and dry areas on my face, and this serum does a wonderful job of moisturizing and soothing my face, neck and chest. I have finally found something that works! I will order this product again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum twice a day on my face and neck. I can seen the improvement in tone especially  around my mouth and my neck.</li>
    <li> Received my Sano vitamin c serum about 10 days ago,,iam very please with this product, it is not greasy and it has no smell . Will use this brand again. Also the package was well wrapped. And shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> Mixes well with my moisturiser with sunblock and absorbs quickly. The dark pigment spots on my face are almost gone after about 4 weeks of daily use. It&#x27;s become a permanent part of my skin care. The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have used the vitamin C serum for about a month and I notice that my skin has a slight glow. However I have not noticed any changes in the blemishes that are on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for around a week so far and I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes but I like that it is all natural and there are no fragrances.  I&#x27;ll have to continue using it to see if there are any noticeable results.</li>
    <li> This face serum is amazing. I have ordered this product twice and it has fixed my problem skin as far as acne and dry skin. I just ordered more! Thank you sano!!</li>
    <li> Started using it in less than a week and I am already seeing a change in the way my face look.  I however use it with jojoba oil.  Great product will purchase again</li>
    <li> Truly amazing! I wish I had known years ago about this... It has transformed my skin making it soft and bright, plus my wrinkles have significantly disappeared and I have started applying to a few scars and they are fading away... Great product... Recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I like Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  It feels very good on my skin.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!  Has a great feel, very smooth.  Have had no reactions to it.  Skin feels and looks better with use.  Used around eyes, unerneath and at the corners.  Can&#x27;t speak for the bonus cream, because I haven&#x27;t used it yet...  I will buy again, and this should easily last 2 months.  Again, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered swiftly. I love the serum as it is non-sticky and does not smell but feels good on the skin. Its only a short time since my purchase but i already feel a nice glow on my skin. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> Everyone knows now that Vitamin C is great on the skin as well as injestion. I have tried everything from Obagi, Cosmetica, and Ole Hendrickson and top of the line Vitamin C gels that I usually purchase from Sephora. I tried Sano which I ordered through Amazon and it&#x27;s 1) effective and 2) affordable . What can I say for any product that anyone purchase?  Compared to the other products I have tried, it is so on-par except fraction of the cost. I have seen the results of Vitamin C and at first, I thought perhaps it would not be as effective b/c of price? Not so. It&#x27;s just as effective and it has brightened my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is very absorbant to the skin. At night, I generally exfoliate to slough the dead skin, and then followed by toner. Once my skin is as clean as it can be, I put on Sano Vitamin C on my face, and particularly on the dark spots. Vitamin C acts to breakdown the dark pigments... Then, I usually use the Sano eye cream and then on top of the Vitamin C, I usually put on my usual night cream. Vitamin C serum can be little tightening so it&#x27;s best to use it under the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For morning, I use it again but on top of it, I usually top it with morning cream and definitely use the sunblock. You might feel tingling but that is the natural acid of Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;For the effectiveness at this price, I can buy a few AND, keep this in the refrigerator b/c the coolness keeps the product fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple weeks as well as eye gel it came with- I had a few wrinkles on my forehead and they are less deep now- I&#x27;ve also been using an AHA gel too. The eye gel is cooling and the skin feels firmer after application (not sure if its a long term improvement or it just firms skin temporary). Got a bottle for my mom for Christmas also, so it will be interesting to see how much it will help her.</li>
    <li> Just Ok but did not meet my expectations.  I used this for more than a month and not planning to continue.  This leaves some residue on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum and the phytoceramides supplement from Sano Naturals. Within just a few days I noticed a big change on the top of my hands. I used 3 drops of the serum and one pill of the phytoceramides each day. After a couple of weeks the change was amazing. I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in the lines on each side of my mouth. I will definitely continue using these products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have a problem with dark spots on my skin, and this has helped significantly. The eye cream is so silky and smooth I use it on my entire face. This is my second time buying it, and if it stays at this price I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> May be it is just me but after using it for a couple of days，i started to have break outs and as soon as i stopped using it，no more break outs.  I will wait awhile before using it again and see if it happens again.</li>
    <li> used for 2 days, so far so good, already see some improvement.</li>
    <li> Loved it, made my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Unlike other serums I&#x27;ve used before this one doesn&#x27;t leave my face too greasy or too sticky. My face looks more even toned and a lot firmer.</li>
    <li> this is a great product</li>
    <li> Irritated my eyes but the serum is very thick.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect for m and just what I was looking for. My skin is smooth, soft, and supple and appears much brighter! I was smart to purchase this item...glad I did.</li>
    <li> Absolute love this skin feels great and even helping with acne so recommend</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is probably the most watery serum I have been used. I like the texture and nearly not much smell of the product. Absorption  is great and fast. The design of the label might not attract me if I have never used this product.</li>
    <li> Received my vitamin c serum today. After 2 uses my skin is feeling tighter already!! I was super excited to receive a sample of their eye cream as well. I just used that now before bed, excited to see the results soon!</li>
    <li> This is a great product I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my skin since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying seeing the chanages in my skin.  Smoother, brighter skin, less redness, less roughness.  Wrinkles?  Time will tell!  Thanks for a quality product!  And thanks Amazon for such careful and prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I have been using this vitamin c serum for 3 days so far and I already notice a difference in the smoothness and firmness of my skin. I was going to wait a week to review but I&#x27;m amazed that only after 3, technically 2, applications that my skin is already reacting well. I am 22 so I didn&#x27;t expect a world of difference on my skin, but believe me it&#x27;s there. I also have been making my mom try it too. She is 59. I asked her this morning if she&#x27;s noticed a difference and she did, but her skin reacted even better than mine did. I think she really needs this serum especially for the hyaluronic acid. She only used the serum twice. Along with this serum we used the Sano Naturals vitamin c eye gel. Seriously, that eye gel is worth everything. Not only did it work wonders for my mom but for me as well. Not only does it make me look more awake, I feel that way as well. My eyes feel refreshed. I will definitely be buying more of the serum and eye gel when time comes!</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. I recommend using it morning and night, right after you wash and dry your face and apply toner. The serum has a very thin, clear, liquid consistency, and so it absorbs quickly. Make sure you follow up with a moisturizer a few minutes after applying the serum. It does not burn or sting, even on my super sensitive skin, and has no detectable smell. I&#x27;ve noticed it helped reduce discoloration (hyperpigmentation) and also improved the overall texture of my skin. Within about a week I have fewer clogged pores and my skin is significantly smoother. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product for your face either - 3-5 drops is plentiful. I wish I was sponsored by them so I could try out more products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the sample eye gel. It smells like cucumbers, so if you&#x27;re not a fan you may not enjoy the product. It has a very thin, lightweight consistency. I think it&#x27;s lovely to use in the morning if I have some puffiness - the gel provides a great cooling sensation. I actually recommend that if you have significant undereye circles or puffiness, keep this product in the fridge. I haven&#x27;t noticed much reduction in wrinkles around my eyes, but the skin is significantly softer. I recommend you follow up the gel with a thicker eye cream, at least at night, because it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> After using the Vitamin C serum for over 3 month now, I can honestly say it is the best!! I highly recommend.  It is true to its statement about being the best. Let me tell you, it truly Revitalizes your skin!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C serum has really improved the texture of my skin.  I was skeptical about whether I would see any results, but I had heard about using Vitamin C serum on Dr. Oz and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  After using it for about a week, my skin looked brighter and more even toned.  After about a month my skin is softer and looks and feels hydrated all day long.  I love the results.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and there aren&#x27;t many things that really work.  This does.</li>
    <li> This is the exact product I have been looking for.  I had a similar product a few years ago but paid $70+ and swore I would never spend that again???however I really liked the product.  This product reminded me of what I had used in the description and when it came today I tried it and I immediately knew it was the product I had been hoping to find again some day!  Same consistency and skin felt so smooth and like it had a protective layer.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Sano Vitamin C Serum and began using it right away. (Cleanse my face, appy the serum - let it absorb, apply my usual moisturizer) I woke up the other morning and realized that my skin had a different look to it. It looked and felt softer - more youthful. I definitely attributed the change to the serum since I havent changed anything else of late. Now, I&#x27;m only 33 so we&#x27;re not talking really troubled skin here, but after 3 kids (no sleep, not enough moisture, etc) a little refresh was needed! I would definitely purchase again and have already given one to my mom.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Visibly reduced my fine lines and wrinkles.  My skin looks firmer and  is glowing.</li>
    <li> I found this product when I was looking for a good eye serum/cream.  I bought it based on the Amazon reviews, but I was skeptical. I am in LOVE with this product.  I usually got a professional facial, to prevent aging, every 4 weeks from a licensed esthetician until February of this year.  I am a 58 years, African American woman who has used skincare systems since I was 18 years old, so my skin is in pretty good shape. My skin is oily, but sensitive and prone to adult acne.  I have been using this product for 3 weeks, and I can see results already: my skin is clear, moist, firm and bright.  I was using an expensive  nightly vital C serum and moisturizer which I thought did a good job; but not as good as this product.  This Sano Vitamin C is comparable to the results I got from my expensive professional treatments.  This vitamin C serum is so good that I can use it alone and my skin is perfectly clear, firm,moist and bright.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to get these results without spending the $100.00 plus each month.  I strongly recommend this product.  I plan to try more of their products and will share the results with you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with a derma roller to get rid of the stretch marks I have on my outer thighs, hips but I don&#x27;t notice a change. The stretch marks look the same to me which I was disappointed about. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to search any further but I do, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my body didn&#x27;t take well to the product, they did send a nice little gift! A face and eye cream that I dab on my face every morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product may not have worked for me, but it might work for you! I&#x27;d give it a shot based on the price alone.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! I have very sensitive skin that has been put through the works with  other products! I was hesitant about trying this but am so happy I went with the positive reviews. It is non-irritating. My complexion appears to be more even. My face is smoother and softer. I wash my face with goat milk soap ( that has tea tree oil ). Then I use a PH restoring toner. I then apply this serum. Doesn&#x27;t burn or even tingle. I apply the eye gel around my eyes ( free gift with purchase ) as well. I  follow that up with an organic moisturizer. I am also using  Phytoceramides by SANO and I am practically glowing! I am hopeful this is the regimen my skin needs and so far, its been great!</li>
    <li> It was my first time purchasing a Vitamin C serum and I like your Sano product very much. It goes on nicely and perfect for everyday wear! I would definitely puchase it again ;)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Serum!  I loved the bonus too - I stuck the small container in the fridge for under eye pick-me-upper and it goes on so smooth!</li>
    <li> Buy the vitamin C serum Sano to gift to my sister will order another one for my self I like the company very much they have and outstanding customers services</li>
    <li> First time using a vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;ve tried the hyalouronic before but not very satisfied.  In this product I am.  I feel it does moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good have not been using it long will see.</li>
    <li> I put two pumps of it right on my face as soon as i got it, and i had sort of a reaction to it. My face was a little numb and my eye started to swell a bit so I took a Zyrtec. The swelling went away and I researched it. This product is high potency and with Vitamin C they recommend starting very low because it&#x27;s so strong, so I didn&#x27;t know that.&lt;br /&gt;I took a little bit and put it on the back of my hand and hours later that spot is soft and smooth. I didn&#x27;t realize the strength of this product so be careful, i definitely used too much.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I order, this serum is great it brightens and makes skin look firm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using many ointments on my face for acne, melasma, and poor skin texture and my skin has improved drastically. Once I began using this i noticed a tighter skin texture, my existing breakouts healed, and my skin seemed to glow. I gave it 4 stars because I did get a cyst on my chin which probably is unrelated since I used it all over my face and I got only one deep down. I&#x27;m going to keep using this serum and see how my skin is after a longer period of using it. So far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only benn using this for a few wk S, along with hyaurolics..sp..and seen a HUGE change in my face, but I do notice my face seems brighter and my complexion is very even, and bright.  Based on results for such a limited time however, I will continue to use this based on what I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  I believe that based on price, and experience, this is a win win situation,  I think I WILL RECOMMEND this...you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
    <li> Loving the vitamin C serum.  It does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> After using for 2 weeks my skin is brighter and firmer. The fine lines are less noticeable.Also the dark areas on my face are disappearing! I would recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of a very expensive Vitamin C skin serum that he recommended. I loved what it did for my skin. I asked my niece, an esthetician if she knew of a more affordable similar product. She suggested I search on Amazon and compare ingredients. I found and ordered SANO Naturals Vitamin C Serum. It gives me the same result. I would order it by 6 ounce bottles and use it all over my body if they had it! My skin was thirsty for this product. Thank you SANO! I am a fan of your business.</li>
    <li> Not for me. The serum really dried up my face, and applied anywhere near my eyes, it stung!  Good sample size, though. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but only started a week ago. (6/5/15)</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum and eye gel for exactly two weeks now. I use it twice a day after washing my face. I&#x27;m 28 years old, white, combination skin, and I am starting to get some wrinkles under my eyes and I have one wrinkle in my left laugh line area. I figure if I start the anti-aging process now, I&#x27;ll be better off than if I wait until I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s to 40&#x27;s.    The serum is thin and absorbs quickly which I love. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or oily. Once it absorbs, it feels as if there&#x27;s nothing on my skin. It has almost no scent. If I had to describe it&#x27;s scent, I would say it&#x27;s almost the faint smell of cucumbers. I don&#x27;t see any results yet from the serum. I plan to use the entire bottle and post an update. If I still don&#x27;t see any results by then, I will discontinue use.    The eye gel is great. You don&#x27;t have to use much so even though it&#x27;s a tiny jar, it will take a while to use all of it. I use it only once a day (at night before bed). It&#x27;s a bit goopy so I don&#x27;t put it on under my makeup. The only change I have noticed with the eye gel is that my dark circles under my eyes are gone. The fine lines are still there and don&#x27;t seem to be going away just yet. Again, I plan to use all of the product before I decide if I will continue to use it.    Overall, this product seems promising. I will update again soon.    UPDATE: 2/3/15    I have been using the products for a month now and have not missed a single day. I&#x27;ve noticed no change in the severity or amount of wrinkles around my eyes. The vitamin C serum seems to just keep my skin hydrated and smooth so I will continue to use it. The eye gel has really helped with dark circles and puffiness but that&#x27;s it. I will update again after using for 2 months and see if there are any changes. Also, I took a picture of my face before I started so I can compare.</li>
    <li> I really like it,  it works for me!</li>
    <li> I love my Vitamin C serum makes my face feel clean and fresh</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product. Love the eye gel too. I have been using Topical Vitamin C on my face for about 6 months and have noticed big changes. Definitely worth finding a product that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg that works just as well as the most expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Misleading picture to start with this product.  The eye gel container is half the size depicted in the picture....and it is only half full.  No way to tell if the product is of any value yet; When I check back I will either increase the stars or decrease based on results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I am a 23 year old female who has a few acne scars and blemishes. I learned about this serum after and how to use it after microneedling to achieve great results. I just started the rolling procedure so no updated on that just yet but the serum makes my skin feel so damn good and silky!!!!! Definitely worth buying. Thank you Sano! 😍😍😍😍😍💙💙💙💙</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any effect so far..</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  In just a few days my skin looked brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I have negative reactions to many products but was thrilled to find&lt;br /&gt;this both works as expected and does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Already reordered.</li>
    <li> This serum is light and not greasy, feels good on face. I have been using it for 1 month now and feel a difference in skin texture.</li>
    <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
    <li> I believe this works.</li>
    <li> my skin looks and feels so much better!!I love it..</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I have used it for 3 weeks now and my face looks clearer, feels tighter, and the fine lines are less noticeable. I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product. It makes my skin feel very fresh and bright.</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  Its really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived with seal open on the bottle and not a &amp;#34;full size bonus&amp;#34; of the eye gel.  If you look at the comparable sizes in the picture, the jar I received was half the size or less.  Going back.</li>
    <li> Finally! I have been trying to find a facial product (not make up) that will help give my skin a natural radiance and I must say this serum does just that for my skin! After using it for just a few days,I see a significant difference. I have very dry skin but these past few days of using this product,my face has felt so smooth. I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> Truly a Super Serum... I am inspired to write this review because it really works.  Living in a dry area, my parched skin is literally drinking in the hydration and antioxidants from the Vitamin C and Hyluronic acid. Great Formula and works like a dream. My skin is glowing after 5 days of using this product. I try a lot of different beauty and skincare products and am super picky about what I put on my skin.  This one is a winner... I will continue to use this and plan on taking it on the road when I travel.  I can definitely see an improvement in luminosity, tone,  smaller pore size and lightening sun damage. I recommend a good exfoliating cleanser before using it to get the maximum benefit of the serum. None of the stickiness and lack of absorption I have experienced in other C Serums. Great value as well!  good price point! And Organic!  Definitely, a Happy Customer... This is a worthy item.  So much junk out there that is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This serum seems to soak right in as soon as I put it on.  It could be me but I can tell it&#x27;s working already. Love the look and feel of my face after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great serum that makes a difference in lines and darkness on my face.</li>
    <li> As for the serum, I did not like the smell. It was hard to apply because it absorbs too fast. Did not seem to do anything for my skin. I did like the gel for eye area very much.</li>
    <li> The product appears to be very good. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I do love this serum. It goes on skin very smoothly and seems to make it look younger and smoother. My skin looks great after this without foundation definitely a glow to it and younger. With foundation (which goes on much more smoothly)--I look great. I have always found Vitamin C serums to be great for my skin. This particular one works very well. It would be great if it came in a larger size however!</li>
    <li> I have just tried the Sano products and love them! Thanks.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This absorbs incredibly well. It is has evened out my skin tone and faded some brown spots rather quickly. I don&#x27;t know if I feel my skin is more moisturized or if it has any other positive effects yet. But I do enjoy using it on my skin and will see if over time there are additional benefits.</li>
    <li> Great product. I saw a difference after only a few weeks and at a fraction of the cost the beauty salon wanted to charge me for Vit C serum.</li>
    <li> A skin care item that delivers amazing results almost instantly, smaller pores, firmer brighter skin in mere days. So wow, just wow. I threw out all the bottles and jars of stuff that just was not as effective as this and it is a real pleasure to have a simpler, easier way to actually do something that works.  I do not wish to spend an hour doing some &amp;#34;beauty ritual&amp;#34; with layers of this or that, expensive layers O goo, grease and who knows what. I wanted, desperately needed, something that did what it claimed to do, this serum did it for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wash face, apply serum, apply any moisturizer and done!&lt;br /&gt;Less clutter around the sink, less crap on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I confess that I have started to use the serum on the backs of my hands also, works just as well on wrinkly hands as it does on the face.&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels light, soaks right in and then my skin looks better. Does more for way less money than the way too many bottles I just tossed in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a spring chicken, I garden, my skin takes a beating, since the serum produces visible, worthwhile results for me I can heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum and use it daily. I do like how it tightens my skin and I love how it works so quickly. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks now and love it and the way it feels on my face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok could not tell it did anything for me</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and I love it! My skin has luster and my complexion is brighter since I start using this serum. A little goes along way...I plan to order more once I complete this bottle.</li>
    <li> Helps you gain and retain moisture in your skin. Hydrating serum to replenish the skin. Plumping up tissue to reduce the look of age-lines or wrinkles.Vitamin C serum helps support skin health by boosting collagen production</li>
    <li> Excellent, I could feel and see the difference this Sano C has on my skin..</li>
    <li> great, my wife love it</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum.  I feel it evened my skin tone and brightened my skin.  I put my daily moisturizer over it and it works perfectly.  Would continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I think that Sano Vitamin C Serum is great!  It goes on easily - and with no odor associated.  I like it much better than some other brands I have purchased.  I also like the eye serum!!  I will buy again!  The company&#x27;s customer service is awesome as well!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t detail any long term effects but so far, so good. I put it on under my moisturizer and it makes my face feel very smooth and it goes on easily. One thing I did notice was that it did leave a somewhat sticky feel but that went away eventually.</li>
    <li> skin feels great,i look younger and my face is glowing!&lt;br /&gt;received for discounted price for my review</li>
    <li> it smells and the density is sus</li>
    <li> Great price for this serum. I&#x27;ll definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price.  This stuff works and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> These products are making a huge difference for me!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a change in my skin, fairly soon too. An unexpected one, though. While I have not really noticed my wrinkles  miraculously vanish, I have had way less acne!! My skin is clearer and brighter. Pleasantly surprised! I will keep using this product for acne control.</li>
    <li> I am 61 and I have been using for a couple of weeks and can tell a difference in my skin already. I use after my shower and my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and my skin is tighter. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed after using. I had age spots really bad on my neck and they are fading. There is no greasy feeling after using and I can apply my makeup right after using. A little goes a long way. I also have less wrinkles under my eyes since using this product.My daughter commented on how well my skin looked and ask what I had been using.</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum product. This product seems to take away puffiness or dark circles in the morning. My mamma loves it!!! She said that I have noticed a significant change in the dark circles after 2 weeks of use. The dark circles do not seem as prevalent as they were before.  Great price. Good product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This goes on easy and you can wear it under makeup if, you wanted . It is better than the super high priced one I was using. I am so glad I found it.  If you are thinking of buying a cream or a different one, don&#x27;t. You get a lot at a good price</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin and already seeing a difference. Definitely recommend this product, does what it says.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!! I love simple beauty products and as an MD, I do not fall for expensive dermatologist gimmick products nor wannabe-fancy OTC products.  Sano makes simple but brilliant products with the consumer in mind. Your skin will just inhale the goodness of their Vit C serum and since it has jojoba oil and other moisturizing ingredients, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the serum being drying. It is so healing. And trust me it is for ALL skin types. Good luck and here&#x27;s to bright, clear skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sano Vitamin C Serum, C Eye Ge, &amp; Phytoceramides for about a month now. The 3 together have been an awesome combo for me. so far I have noticed my skin is brighter and firmer. Pores have shrank on my nose, and more importantly a wrinkle on my head is smaller than it was and not as deep. I will continue using this item.</li>
    <li> Always love their stuff</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice a day for the past three weeks.  The only noticeable difference I see on my skin are the dry patches are gone. I apply this in the morning and at night, on several occasions when applying there was a burning sensation.  It&#x27;s a very thin consistency and has a weird smell. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements to acne marks perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been long enough.  I will continue to use the product but am not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again at this moment in time.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My sister buys C serum and pays $85, on sale!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and has a pleasant smell. I have noticed a difference in my skin since using it.</li>
    <li> This caused some plumping around my eyes but not significant long term difference. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and keep ordering it as soon as I run out its amazing my skin feels good looks good it&#x27;s light on your face not oily and I can wear my makeup over it just fine love these products also the eye serum is amazing</li>
    <li> fabulous product, fabulous service!</li>
    <li> If you are not using this wonderful Vitamin C Serum, get onboard!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 weeks and already see results in my appearance.  My face is smoother and feels fresh when I use it.</li>
    <li> I was using a different vitamin c serum and tried this one because of price and reviews. So glad I did.  Better and less expensive-can&#x27;t beat that combo.  I may give to my sisters for Christmas, or I may just smile and gloat.</li>
    <li> Awesome that&#x27;s all I have to say about this product. I am using it for 5-6 days now and seeing difference in skin as its more supple, and glowing. I am using it with Sano eye gel and both are working nicely. My skin is feeling hydrated all day long which used to feel very dry by the end of the day with use of minerals powder foundation in winter; and there is sort of pink hue now which I am loving, a little brown spot on my cheek is kind of fading which I hope fades away soon. Now I am buying Sano Hyaluronic serum to use with this Vitamin C serum to expedite the process, I think I am falling in love with Sano products.</li>
    <li> I am using your Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum and feel that I am receiving incredible results!  I am in my 50s and have had acne scars on my face for most of my life.  This Vitamin C Serum along with a derma roller has/is making my skin look and feel wonderful!! The scars are not only fading, but are smoothing out.  I am amazed with your product and will be a lifelong customer!!</li>
    <li> These 3 products work great together</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and her skin looks fantastic!!!!1</li>
    <li> My sister told me about the effects vitamin C serum had on her skin. Faded sun spots, line minimization and overall softness. The Sano product is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 60 days and see a definite improvement in my skin. The eye gel is cooling and a great addition to my skin care routine. I plan on using more of these products in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using this product and the eye gel included for a few weeks now. I am starting to see some improvement to the deep wrinkles as well as a better tone on my face. Will write another review after I finish the 2nd bottle I bought.I do wish it came in a larger bottle though. Great price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product. We have ordered it several times and will order it again.</li>
    <li> My face feels hydrated since using this product.  The only thing I would recommend is that instructions be included with the product for application.</li>
    <li> This product seems to do everything it&#x27;s supposed to do!  Very easy to use and gets absorbed really fast into your skin.  I am using it in conjunction with a dermaroller and am anxious to see what a month of usage will bring!</li>
    <li> Best item I have gotten to help battle the aging process.</li>
    <li> I have been using it now for a few weeks.  I really like the hyaluronic  acid/vitamin C serum.  I do believe my skin looks better.  Looks like younger skin.  I am lucky....I am 56 and most people think I am about 40.  I plan to continue using the product!  I am fighting the wrinkles all the way.  :)</li>
    <li> I ordered to use on my face, and as I read what vitamin C serum does I decided to try on my hand.  On June 6th of this year I fell and the back of my hand had some scrapes from the cement.  I have a horrible time healing so I thought why not.  It&#x27;s July 28th, the marks are all but invisible.  A few days ago I thought I would try on another scar I have had for 14 years, and I bet that will become less visible as well.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; c-vitamin serum before, but it always turned brown before the bottle was empty. This vitamin serum has a more gel-like consistency, which I like. It glides on smoothly and seems to keep my skin moisturized. I only need a drop or two to cover my entire face and neck. I can&#x27;t tell if this serum has had an effect on my wrinkles because I use other products as well, but because I like the consistency, moisturizing effect, and the price, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product!  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and my skin feels so good so good.  My skin already looks brighter. I&#x27;m excited to continue using Sano&#x27;s vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> .....to have a daughtet that old! I love hearing that! Being a nurse I&#x27;m usually skeptical about products that advertise to be &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; because most of them are not.I research before I buy and also consider the cost of the product compared to what results it may or may not produce. You will not be disappointed by either with this purchase. The price is very reasonable and I&#x27;m also very happy with the effects it has on my wrinkles.I have definitely noticed the fine lines around my eyes slowly becoming finer with some even being erased. I wish I would have known about this product years ago!</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I&#x27;ve been an esthetician for a couple years and have tried many serums. I work in a busy spa and will recommend this product to all my clients! It&#x27;s better than the C serums we have that cost three times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum brightens, lightens, and hydrates the skin! It really works and my skin has never looked better. I know it sounds like a commercial but it&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s also going to work well with any moisturizer your using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I rarely leave any comments on products but I just had to with this serum. I also love using it with the Hyluronic serum because they work great together! I love this serum and have seen instant results!</li>
    <li> Works real well. I love using this. I can see the difference!</li>
    <li> This product also caused serious skin reactions.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a nice c serum blend, very silky and I can feel a nice softness to my skin, Thanks SANO!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I was not sure if the serum was working until I stopped using it and my skin aged within a week. The improvement had been gradual over about a month so I did not notice it but other people commented on how good my skin looked. Once I started using it again the dryness and wrinkles disappeared.</li>
    <li> Love this product, goes on so light but makes my face feel so good and their eye gel is awesome!  Since I have been using both products i have actually gotten several compliments on my skin and I feel my wrinkles/fine lines are less noticeable! Highy reccomend both products!</li>
    <li> Although I have young skin and not many wrinkles, I have noticed my complexion is brighter and clearer. I used the eye gel that came with it and it too is amazing. Love this product and have bought more since.</li>
    <li> So I have used it for a month now and I love the results!!!!My cheeks are definitely rosy, smoother and the lines really did fade away. I&#x27;m impressed! I will definitely order more! Shipping was fast. Overall great buy for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for 3 weeks now and am thrilled with the results. I use it in the morning after cleansing my skin. Then I put on Dr. Perricone&#x27;s No Foundation Foundation. I live in Southern Florida where it is hot and humid, so during the day I cannot use anything heavy, but still want to take care of my skin. This combination has proven to be perfect for me. It is not sticky (which I hate) and also not perfumed (which I also hate). That it is made in the USA is a plus for me too. I am 65 years old and take very good care of my skin. This product has been a godsend for me in this hot, humid climate.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this product, but the price was right, it&#x27;s organic, and made in the U.S., so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Sano emailed me personally to let me know it was on its way, delivery was exceptionally quick, and, after using the Vitamin C serum only a week, I already notice my skin glowing. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Did receive the product. Still wait</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It leaves my skin feeling and looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and skin is healing where I had a burn.  Also the dark spots have lightened. They are not totally gone but others have noticed they are lighter. skin feels softer</li>
    <li> Great Serum. I put it on after cleansing. All organic no smell at all. I love the eye gel too!</li>
    <li> Works as well as more costly cream</li>
    <li> Doesnt come with an expiration date! Otther brands do!</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve used. It really helps with the puffiness that I get from allergies.</li>
    <li> This is my second time to buy this product, really well,my skin feels very soft. I like this quality product, the ingredients make me smile knowing what I put on my face daily is helping me stay younger looking. I want to order and try all their products and cant say enough good things. This in conjunction with the phytoceramide cream is the bomb, all I can say is get it while you can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night after my dermaroller and my skin has been clearer and much brighter. It has the most amazing texture, it feels like a very light oil on your fingers but once its been applied to your face it dries instantly with absolutely no residue whatsoever. Your skin feels like skin and not oily at all!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum twice a day for about a week. I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin tone and texture. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Anyone else have problems with the pump? Purchased 2 bottles and both are defective. Once they are unscrewed to open, it is exposed to air, therefore not making the serum as effective or lasting very long. Seems like the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; is too long and bent at the bottom. This kink prevents the pump to work. Very disappointed with the design of the bottles!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, skin feels more hydrated for sure! Made my makeup much less cakey! Exactly want I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  I am using it on the back of my shoulders where I have dark acne spots.  The spots are fading!  Yay!</li>
    <li> great product only thing is it doesnt leave your skin moisturize, so if you have dry it wont moisturize it</li>
    <li> Excellent Vitamin C Serum. I can see the difference after only couple of days.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I love this product! It feels wonderful on my skin and I notice a difference in the texture!</li>
    <li> totally works wonders</li>
    <li> A great product  for the price a super quick shipments . Thank u</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural vitamin c serums and this by far is the best!!!  My skin feels so awesome!  Will purchase again.  Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from Sano!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and my skin is so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as promised.  I have just started using this but love how it feels on  my skin already.</li>
    <li> The eye gel that comes with this is good.  I can tell the difference when I use it and don&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t really see or feel any difference from the serum.</li>
    <li> i just recieved my vitamin c serum and im so excited to watch my skin change for the better. it arrived on time and well packaged. and the blue bottle it comes in is beautifull.</li>
    <li> Update:  This Vitamin C Serum has been part of my daily routine since I purchased it.  This is my first serum and I love it.  My forehead wrinkles are a little less noticeable.  My complex wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.  My small crows feet are disappearing and the deeper ones are also becoming less noticeable.  I plan to continue using and have recommended it to my best-friend and my daughter.   My product is still fresh from my first purchase!  I have taken pictures, which I will not be sharing, and the difference in my skin is actually noticeable.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I had a little peeling, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t deal with, and I expected it.  I keep mine in the fridge.  Works well under makeup.  It is also quite moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and plan on continued use.  Affordable and fresh!</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks my complexion was noticeably brighter.  Fine lines seem diminished over about a months time.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have this product.  As I age my neck really bothers me and this is making a real difference in the way I look and feel.  Will continue to use and see just how much skin repair will happen!</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth, my skin feels very soft. I like this quality product, the ingredients make me smile knowing what I put on my face daily is helping me stay younger looking. I want to order and try all their products and cant say enough good things. This in conjunction with the phytoceramide cream is the bomb, all I can say is get it while you can. There customer service is excellent too and educational material on their products and how to use and maximize efficiency A+</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum. I had try many cream most of them very expensive and did not make any difference on my skin. But this serum is helping me so much all the dark spots on my face are almost gone . I going to order 3 more for me and my mother in law.  :)</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, but I only used it for a week....</li>
    <li> This really improved the look of my skin, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sano Vitamin C serum as well as eye cream for a month now &amp; my skin looks great (than ever!). I usually get little blemish when apply new product (my skin is very sensitive), but surprisingly I haven&#x27;t had any problem so far. It&#x27;s definitely the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used so far &amp; I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I noticed the difference in my skin  the second day i used the product. My pores were greatly reduced in size.complexion smoother.face seem brighter. Yes i would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the vitamin C Serum &amp; free bonus eye gel for a few weeks now.  I definitely tell a difference since using it. It goes on smoothly &amp; feels great.  I will continue buying this product.  Thanks for the fast shipment as well.</li>
    <li> Skin feels better and looks better, would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. My face looks clearer, fine lines are diminishing and deep wrinkles look softer . Very satisfied. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, and it really works. It lasts for a long time , since you only need few drops.</li>
    <li> i liked this product because it leaves my skin felling silky, smooth and within a few weeks it now looks youthfull and I hope it helps me even more.</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with these product that I am going to keep buying it. I saw inmediate difference in the tone of my skin with vitamin c serum daily revitalizer. Definitely will buy it again. I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This product definitely works for me. I use this 1-2 times a day.  It cleared up my acne, shrunk my pores, improved my complexion, eliminated fine lines and made my face soft and smooth. It helped reduce eye bagginess, lines, and darkness. This product is like a liquid and a jell (more along the lines of  a liquid). It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and dries fairly quickly. I use it under my moisturizer or by itself. My only negative is that after less than month of use, I&#x27;m almost out of this product. I will either buy this product again or check out more products from this line very soon.</li>
    <li> I just got  this serum two weeks before and I noticed the change within one week after apply the same, My skin was now very soft and radiant It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.I am really satisfied with this product and worth for the money i spend.I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;SK.</li>
    <li> Great product that works</li>
    <li> Right on time, in good condtion.  I feel it is a very great product which I will recommend to my patients.</li>
    <li> Thus far, I like the product very much.  Shipment is fast and the product is packed properly.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Product is great, particularly the fact that it came with the eye cream. My skin becomes slightly more vibrant and definitely very moisturized after using it every morning.  I was actually thinking this morning how I would want to stock up on more the price is still great.</li>
    <li> Purchase 2 bottles of serum and 2 eye cream, give one set to my mom and kept one for myself. Mom and I come to the same conclusion it works incredible!!! We are extremely happy skin feel tighter and looks healthy we apply twice a day been using it for 2weeks and already see results😄</li>
    <li> This is the first timer and I live in Hawaii in where sun is 24/7. I recently moved from the east coast and wanted to protect my skin from sun damaging.  I came across to SANO product and started to use a week ago.  The result is amazing and I feel my skin just soaked up the serum immediately after applying.  I recommend this product for everyone who cares for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I prefer a thicker serum.</li>
    <li> This is the best C serum I have ever used. Great effective ingredients. Put it on at night and my skin looks amazing in the morning. I can see and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Giving this a try, so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen results yet. You are asking for a comment too early. I do like the product.</li>
    <li> I bough this to go with my dermaroller...I roll then put this on..it feels so good and I can Reay tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Great serum I  see  the  difference</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I can not be happier with it, my face is glowing, it has helped to close my pores. I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it is cruelty free, had great reviews and was a great price. I have been using the serum for about 2 weeks and my skin looks amazing! I was just telling my husband the other night how I can&#x27;t believe how clear and tight my skin looks. I feel like it helps with fine lines around my eyes and just plumps up the skin in general. It also gives me a much more even skin tone. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, just a natural powder, so it is important that my skin looks good under the makeup and I feel like this product does that for me. I have told two of my friends already about this and will definitely recommend it to anyone! Next for me is to try the eye cream.</li>
    <li> OMG!  Wrinkles really dimished! Wow!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and started noticing some deep lines and wrinkles, which I&#x27;m okay with, but wanted to take a bit of precaution.  So far the product has evened out my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me look greasy.  I put a few drops in the AM and PM and i&#x27;m ready to go.  Male Tested, Father Approved.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I plan to purchase another bottle soon. I have been using this product for 3 months-a little goes a long way. The eye cream is also amazing, I just purchased a larger size.</li>
    <li> For reference, I&#x27;m 23 years old, have been struggling with acne for 12 years and bought this to try to fade the dark marks left behind from it. I have normal-dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little less than a month now. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I have noticed my dark marks are less noticeable and my skin is significantly brighter. I don&#x27;t know how exactly to describe that. My mom asked me what I&#x27;d been doing because my face was glowing like a pregnant woman&#x27;s! My hyperpigmentation/dark spots are still there, and I suspect it will simply take time + Vit C serum to get rid of them.   Pros: Dark spot fading Glowing/smooth skin Non-drying Great Price</li>
    <li> Being one of those ladies who &amp;#34;wouldn&#x27;t go the mailbox without make-up&amp;#34;, I proceeded to take my make-up off using one of those wipe-off sheets the other day. To my surprise, the sheet turned out clean! I had actually mistaken my face for being &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; when it was not! My face looked actually really good... dome people might say &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;, but I am not sure exactly what that term involves. My face really looked like it did not need the foundation. In summary, I like this product. I was debating whether to give it four or five stars given that the bottle seems to empty out within a month... I was being kind on that dimension :-)</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel like velvet-great product!!</li>
    <li> Two great ingredients to provide excellent anti-aging. Love it!</li>
    <li> Really cleared up black circles under my eyes, in just 2 days!  I am very pleased when a product delivers as promised!</li>
    <li> My skin breaks out in rashes</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much I have used two bottles and I haven&#x27;t found any big difference</li>
    <li> After one use, my face was smoother and more even in tone.</li>
    <li> So good so far! I have skin damage from a laser treatment (I leaned my lesson) and vitamin C serums are the only thing that helps.  This one seems gentle and my skin likes it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I love the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> My mom used this product and she really loved it! I would recommend it to try out to anybody.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t  post accolades about products. I love this one and will continue to order it. My skin has improved dramatically in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  I don&#x27;t have a  lot of wrinkles to begin with and what I do have are less noticeable.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and can use all the help I can get!!</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here due to some amazon error but it seems to be very good for after a dermaroller.</li>
    <li> I just got my bottle of SANO Vitamin C Serum+ the bottle is 1 oz dark blue clear glass very pretty packaging. I tried some on my face and my hands. It&#x27;s a really nice medium thickness formula that blended into my skin perfectly and immediately my skin was soft and smooth. I was surprised to find this serum not oily at all, I really thought it was going to be oily. So far I&#x27;m pleased and will come back after a week or so to give a review update.</li>
    <li> Used it for a few day. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a couple of days now but so far I love it.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or leave a greasy residue.  Also, no unpleasant odor.  Just takes a little bit so should last for a while!</li>
    <li> I AM 65 YEARS OLD AND JUST PURCHASED MY SECOND BOTTLE OF THIS PRODUCT. I STARTED USING SANO VITAMIN C SERUM IN APRIL AND REALLY DO BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. I LOVE THE WAY MY SKIN FEELS AND HOW THE FINE LINES ARE DIMISHING. I HAVE WASTED MONEY ON LOTS OF OTHER NAME BRAND PRODUCTS AND GOT NO RESULTS. I AM  PLEASED WITH SANO AND ANXIOUS TO TRY OTHER SANO PRODUCTS. I GET TOLD ALL THE TIME THAT I DO NOT LOOK MY AGE, MOST THINK I&#x27;M IN MY MID FIFTIES. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this vitamin C serum + daily skin revitalizer by Sano.  I developed adult acne and never had teen acne so I had no idea how to treat it.  :(  I have tried an abundance of different products without success and it has caused so much frustration.  This product is gives such a cleansing, natural feel that I&#x27;m hoping to try their other products soon!  Plus I love the little dropper which helps me apply the serum to direct bothersome spots on my face and even other scars that I have on my body.  5 stars for this serum!! :)</li>
    <li> Works great, skin looks younger and smoother after first application.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have ever tried. The price is right and you will not be disappointed. Please try. I bought a bottle for my daughter as well and she loves it. It controls the amount of break outs she has.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but while it was ok  it was not that good. I had been using a different brand and some of my dark skin patches went away . After 3 weeks of using this I notice some of the darker skin was getting to where you could see them again.  I also had  to use more of this product.  It came with a eye gel with vitamin c in it . But since it was in a open little pot the vitamin c was no good once the air hits it. I keep it in the fridge and I use it in the mornings for puffy under eyes . This was a miss for me.</li>
    <li> This was one of the high quality product purchases I have ever made for so little money. Impressive results for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Natural non greasy and effective</li>
    <li> I love this serum! This is my second bottle and I will continue to purchase it. I have tried other brands, more expensive, and really can&#x27;t claim them to be any better. Sano keeps the cost reasonable and provide a quality product. My skin looks and feels better instantly. The fine wrinkles are being kept in check!</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day(morning and night) for the last three weeks. I am very happy with this product. It gets absorbed into my skin immediately.  No skin trouble so far. Also my acne scars and pigmentation look lighter.</li>
    <li> I can tell my skin is smoother and firmer than before I started using this product. It really works!</li>
    <li> I am 58 with mature but decent condition skin and am pleased with this serum.  Absorbs well and not greasy.  I do use a moisturizing sunscreen over it. After using for a week my skin seems to getting a brightness and more even tone.  I think I will have to wait longer to see if there is any change with wrinkles.  It is a good serum to use in conjunction with a dermaroller.</li>
    <li> The Serum works well and I look and feel good about my face. My sister says my complexion looks brighter.</li>
    <li> This has a funky almost medical smell that I can&#x27;t seem to get used to.  I want to like it, and I don&#x27;t seem to have any allergic reaction to it, but I am not a fan of the smell.  For this reason I would not reorder it.</li>
    <li> Happy w product, this is 2nd purchase</li>
    <li> Great price will get more. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Results in just a week my skin changed. The acne stopped and dark spots I had are going away</li>
    <li> My experience with this product was great my face got brighter and looked young in a month</li>
    <li> I love, love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I used the bonus gel first and really like it.  Just starting to use the serum, as I was using the remaining portion of a different serum brand.  I have to say, the Sano serum is much better than what I had been using.  It absorbs much better, leaves no tackiness and I am seeing better results already.  The other brand was twice as expensive.</li>
    <li> Great product! It was everything I thought it would be and more! Amazing customer service as well!</li>
    <li> Love this serum, purchased it two time and will again. Smooths over skin and noticing improvement in appearance as I use it. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve. Been using this for a few weeks and already can see a difference in my skin appearance. Good stuff</li>
    <li> After trying it for over four months have really notice a difference in my skin, I love this product, Thank you Sano</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and definitely improves completion and skin elasticity.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. This product gives my skin the softest feel and glowiest look, without making it oilier. I try to use it once a day but sometimes I skip a day and my skin still looks improved. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This product is too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Seems to have faded some sun spots and even my skin tone. I have break out prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. I will say I have nothing to compare it to as this is the only vitamin c serum I have tried, but I am happy. The first bottle looked foggy, almost creamy but the second is clear...not sure why the difference.</li>
    <li> Light weight pleasant scent and does what it promises I will order again , great price point</li>
    <li> great serum - use it all over my face - skin feels great</li>
    <li> Been using this for the past few weeks and finally noticing small changes in my skin.  Also thanks for the quick mailing.  I am hoping this will continue to help my skin glow and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.  Once the product is empty, I will know more.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and seems like it is going to last awhile</li>
    <li> This vitamin. C serum is great .the best i&#x27;ve ever used for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using it for over two months now and my skin is glowing. I also love that it is made with all natural ingredients. Buying another bottle soon!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It has really helped with dark spots.  It goes well under makeup and is not oily or greasy.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This serum is not greasy and absorbs in the skin fast.  I can see a noticeable difference in some of my dark spots.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly in the mail and I have been using it for a little longer then a week. It feels good on the skin and so far I cannot say that I feel a visible difference in appearance. I will take it longer and see how it develops. No allergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I did not receive any eye gel with my purchase, but I think the price is still very competitive even without that extra. Consistency is good, dries quickly and not sticky like other serums I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;d suggest following up after letting it soak in with a moisturizer if you have dry skin, as this doesn&#x27;t add much hydration. I will also note as an acne sufferer, finding products that don&#x27;t make breakouts worse is difficult, and I found this serum is a net zero product: it doesn&#x27;t improve my acne condition, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make my breakouts worse.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It made a huge difference in my skin, including the size of my pores. My skin is at it&#x27;s prime that&#x27;s to this product and the matching eye gel. I highly recommend it. I have oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately a month and I really like it.  My skin is more hydrated and toned.  I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t broken out with this product which is a really good sign.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You know it&#x27;s high quality because it comes in an opaque container to protect the integrity of the serum.  It goes on smooth and dries quickly so you can follow quickly with moisturizer and make up.</li>
    <li> This serum is great for reducing dark spots and adding moisture back into skin. I have combination, acne prone skin, and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused irritation. I layer it underneath my moisturizer and it seems provide that extra goodness that my skin appreciates. I have tried other Vitamin C serums, and this one is the best in terms of price. It does its job well, and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to try a Vitamin C serum out! :)</li>
    <li> I brush this serum on after a good cleansing and it feels great and had diminished sun spots and light wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product very good for brown spots and wrinkles.I bought this at amazon one of my favorite shopping places.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.....  &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I kept using it night and morning for a month before writing this review. So far my skin feels smooth and skin color looks brighter. Not sure if it reduced wrinkles but I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this after I shower and it works as both a moisturizer and face brightener. Very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far, it has worked well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is, because like to use the product a full month at least, for best results.&lt;br /&gt;As of now, the serum soaks in my skin rather fast, dries quickly. I have notice it gives my skin a slight glow. And my dark spots seem to be diminishing,  Excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good..no completes.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for use after Derma Rolling. I wanted to use an all natural product and this exceeded expectations. Absorbed perfectly into my skin without any oily residue or irritation.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best! I use with Evian facial spray then spread on fact, neck and décolletage and have seen dramatic results in just a few weeks. I&#x27;m about to turn 30 this week and have been taking a more serious concern about my skincare and the reviews I have read about this particular C serum and the results I&#x27;ve had will keep my using this well into the next decade.</li>
    <li> this isn&#x27;t a fair rating because i just got it yesterday and i only applied it on my forehead after doing my derma roller treatment. i don&#x27;t like all the ingredients in this stuff, like phenoxylene, witch hazel, jojobo oil, etc, I prefer just vitamin C and water, but I will see what happens. I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my forehead, and if it doesn&#x27;t harm my forehead, I&#x27;ll try it on my face. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve noticed light brown spots on my skin since using this product. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this or not. but ever since I used the serum, I noticed spots on my hands and forehead, the places I&#x27;ve used the serum. so for now i won&#x27;t be putting this on my face or forehead. i will just use it on my hands and neck and will probably have to order a serum without the vitamin c in it. maybe my skin is sensitive to vitamin c?</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel good, I see a little difference when I wake up in the morning but not a big  difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update more in a few weeks but I think I&#x27;m noticing a difference. My face is so much smoother! I don&#x27;t want to leave 4 or 5 stars until I see more of a difference because this is an expensive product.</li>
    <li> There are many folks who haven&#x27;t tried Vitamin C serum yet, like those under 30. But believe me, it works on the rest of us. Who doesn&#x27;t get sun spots? Or how about dark circles and fine lines. If you are over 45, many people can see the changes in their face, and other places. This stuff works. Jfr</li>
    <li> This product is not miraculous but I am satisfied that it has helped reduce crows-feet  wrinkles as well as subsurface discolorations on my nose.  I did not take photographs of the various 60 years worth of age spots to compare, but those on my face, if not my hands (from years of farming) do appear to be lighter after about a month of 2-3x/day.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and firmer!</li>
    <li> My skin feels different just after two days...I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone that wants to brighten up their skin.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try some of their other products; you can&#x27;t beat their prices for the quality.</li>
    <li> Just got this product last week.&lt;br /&gt;Upsides: It is non-irritating, feels good and smells like green tea.&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: Bottle had leaked during shipping. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any significant change in skin quality (though it is early).</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a week.  At nearly 62...thought I would give it a try.  Absorbs quickly, not sticky..inexpensive..makes your skin nice and soft...no irriation.  I use it over my other products before bed.  Just a little something more in my arsenal to combat this aging thing..:-) According to Dr. Oz...this has everything you need.  Give it a try...I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month. I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my skin, but the wrinkles I wanted to see disappear haven&#x27;t lol. I do notice that it does make a difference with the moisturizer I use. The serum seems to help the moisturizer penetrate my skin better, which leaves my skin soft and more supple.</li>
    <li> This Serum is amazing, it makes my skin glow and has cleared up my adult acne.  I use this serum daily and will not go a day without it.  It is a high quality serum for a very reasonable price, and I can now leave the house without heavy makeup!</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product again! I am married to this product for life. This makes all of the difference in the world between having good skin and enviable skin!</li>
    <li> Already feel a difference in skin tone after a week using this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My face feels so dry when I do not use it and afterwards it feels really moisturized and smooth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the consistency. Kind of tacky feel on skin. Don&#x27;t see any improvements, but didn&#x27;t use it very long.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase. I definitely see a difference in the lines on my face. I will order the product again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a couple weeks but I can really see the difference in my skin. It&#x27;s very soft and I can feel my skin tighten when I use it. Good stuff and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> a friend recommended me sano vitamin c serum for face with hyaluronic acid, she had a great results after using it , so I decided to send for a bottle  , i started using it and can see improvement in my face , lines got smaller and skin got smoother , i am going to continue to use this product and will order another bottle when this one finish , i am veeery satisfied with this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HOHLKY2 Vitamin C Serum For Face With Hyaluronic Acid - 20% Vit C Concentrated Formula - Endorsed By Licensed Esthetician - Vegan, Organic. Perfect With Sano&#x27;s Eye Cream for Dark Circles.]]</li>
    <li> Just got this in mail. I browse  and research and read reviews and try to get the best value for my money, while being really happy with the product! Well let me tell you, while I have tried/purchased &amp;#34;a few&amp;#34; out there...THIS One ROCKS!!! Right as I applied it on my skin, I can tell it firms my skin, it moisturizes it, it goes on smoothly, and it feels rejuvenating. As a beauty therapist, I must say this one is one of the best I have tried so far.... Comes highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Needles to say, there will be more purchases of SANO in the future!!</li>
    <li> I have used Sano Vitamin C for 2 weeks now and can honestly tell you I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin.  At 69, don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I shared a bottle with my 79 year old friend, who wants me to immediately order more, she&#x27;s afraid it won&#x27;t be available when she needs another bottle......dubious at first......how can a little bottle of &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; make such a difference, but it truly does</li>
    <li> I received product earlier than expected &amp; immediately started using. It works great to smooth skin &amp; fine lines. I also put it on the back of my hands. My mother had a liver spot on her cheek. She started using it ans dramatically faded spot with in a week or less.</li>
    <li> I have learned when trying a new beauty product to start using on just half of my face, that way I can really tell if it&#x27;s going to work or not. 3 days after starting with Sano Vitamin C Serum I used on my whole face!! I was already seeing changes, smoother, brighter skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results. Thanks for making a wonderful  product that&#x27;s works and affordable,  that is rare. Try this serum you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have used this product several days and already feel the difference in my skin--much softer and feeling hydrated.  I have been pleasantly surprised!  For the price, this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. When first applied, you can see and feel it working. Cant wait to see results after a couple of weeks. Awesome product, im going to stock up, I dont want to ever run out.</li>
    <li> I love this serum and it doesn&#x27;t m as ke my face shiny once applied.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy this product and will repurchasing it once I have run out. I bought it to help brighten up my skin tone and make it look even. Since this serum does way I had bought it for, it deserves a five star rating. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or have an unbearable odor. I haven&#x27;t seen any cons with the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks and notice my skin looks brighter and smoother. Excited to see what the next couple months will bring with this product!</li>
    <li> I love all the products by Sano.  I have also used the eye cream and hyaluronics acid, love them too.  Give it a try if you are on the fence.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now and have already noticed an improvement in my skin! It looks brighter and more clear and I can tell that it much more moisturized than it is with other products I have tried. I have pretty sensitive skin and this product s perfect! I use in the morning and at night and my skin feels great all day!</li>
    <li> The vitamin c serum has changed everything for me - I love it! Ive noticed such a change in my skin and it really helps with breakouts! It&#x27;s a miracle. Thank you</li>
    <li> Just got this today and after just one use I see a difference. My skin has been glowing ever since. Great product!</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this serum. I gave it 3 weeks and I have to honestly say it has done nothing for my skin. Not a thing. My skin may have felt a bit smoother but no noticeable differences at all. No clarity, no lightening of sun spots, no line reduction. Absolutely nothing. I got better results squeezing a lemon and I paid far less. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for, so I was not expecting much for $10, and not much is what I got.</li>
    <li> Sano products are top shelf, and their 20% Vitamin C serum with other nurturing ingredients is no disappointment. The price here on Amazon is difficult to beat--especially for a product that meets or beats other much higher-priced Vitamin C lines. This product is a staple in my regimen and I use it both morning and night,</li>
    <li> I started using the Vitamin C serum 20% 3 months ago, &amp; definitely see an overall improvement in skin tone &amp; color...</li>
    <li> Recently, I have become addicted to serums. I never used them before but once I tried one, I haven&#x27;t been able to contain my joy anytime I have an opportunity to try another. Facial serums are highly concentrated that are mostly clear and gel-like in composition that can be used for targeted areas on the skin. Since serums do have such a light consistency, they are ideal for penetrating the skin faster and deeper than moisturizers. They are also have an oil-free texture which is ideal for anyone, such as myself, who struggles with oily skin. Since most serums are water based which completely eliminates oils that can end up clogging the pores and causing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent Vitamin C Serum that I have tried is by the brand Sano. What I love most about this brand and their serum is that it is derived from all natural components that are the best for our skin. Their composition does not include water as a main ingredient because water tends to oxidize Vitamin C. Instead of water, Sano uses Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Aloe as an herbal infusion. There are no added alcohols or fragrances which can be harmful to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Vitamin C Serums are known to help drop the years off the appearance of skin. Sano states:  Our stable formula, Made in the USA in an FDA certified facility, reduces the look of wrinkles, fine lines, big pores, melasma, hyperpigmentation, rough complexion, dark spots and dry skin - in just weeks. I tend to have very big pores which end up getting clogged quite a bit due to my skin being excessively oily. This causes my skin to break out and even develop really painful acne that becomes very irritated and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Sano, I have noticed my skin breaks out a lot less and my skin does not appear to be quite as oily. Granted, I still get acne every once in a while and it has gotten particularly bad due to stress since I have finals coming up but Sano helps alleviate my skin irritation and helps prevent my skin from breaking out further. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth and, as I said before, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals&#x27; Triple Action Anti-Aging Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20% Vitamin C (most stable Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate)&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, Sano Naturals also includes a free full size eye cream to help combat dark circles, crows feet, and puffiness. When you purchase their Vitamin C Serum you will receive a .5 oz full-size organically derived eye cream that also contains hyaluronic acid. Honestly, I can&#x27;t find one bad thing to say about this company. This eye cream was a lovely added bonus and I particularly like that they use all natural and cruelty-free products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complementary in exchange for my unbiased reviewalso leaves my skin feeling smooth and, as I said before, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily.

    <li> I can tell this stuff is good just from the first use. It already evened out my skin tone in one use! When I put it on it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy at all. I believe with continued use my skin will be clearer and firmer.</li>
    <li> Sano&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for the face acts like a primer that balances and prepares the skin for whatever is &amp;#34;Next!&amp;#34;. In addition, the product is cost effective and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I purchased the SANO Vitamin C Eye Gel+, Hyaluronic Acid Serum+, and Vitamin C Serum+ all at the same time and I love these products. I have used much more expensive products from salons and these work better. My skin looks healthier every time I use them. Less wrinkles, more volume and better color. I am blonde with green eyes and 46 years old. People have always said I look young for my age but these products have helped me feel like I am getting rid of some of the last few years!</li>
    <li> Skeptic that I am.  I DID like this product.  It definitely smoothed out my skin.  I am in my 50&#x27;s so that fresh smooth skin is NOT what I normally have.  After using the Sano Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid combo I noticed a difference. appearance of my skin was smooth and a bit brighter.  Took about a week or two.  Not a miracle face lift but definitely an improvement in skin appearance.  I used in am and pm and after it dried (30 seconds) I used  a moisturizer.  For the price it is definitely worth the try.  Stick with it for a few weeks and like me you may see a difference.</li>
    <li> wonderful product i would order it again in thanks...</li>
    <li> I had never tried any of the Sano Naturals products so when I was introduced to the Vitamin C Serum 20% I thought I would look into it. I read the things it could do for me and I also read the questions &amp; the reviews. One of the questions was asking why the first bottle a customer received was clear and yet the second bottle was cloudy.  There were responses from users of the product but my favorite answer was from the company itself. In case it is no longer posted when you read this, here is part of what it said. &amp;#34;Our C Serums are individually packed and use natural/organic materials. Because of this, there can be some variation in color and viscosity. In the case with your second bottle, depending on the temperature and time of year when the Organic Aloe was sourced, the color can be milky, making the serum appear slightly thicker. Please be assured that your bottle was not tampered with, and is the same potency and formula as your first bottle.&amp;#34;  From this, I learned that the company cares enough to answer the questions from their customers, the product is individually packed and basically a lot of personal one-on-one care is put into their products. I was also personally contacted by a representative of the company making sure that I was pleased with their product.  All of this made me trust that using their product would be a pleasant and positive experience... and it has been.  I love the dropper. I&#x27;m a bit germ conscious and I don&#x27;t really like dipping my finger into a product (no matter how clean my finger might be) because I used to work with a nationally known makeup company and I know how quickly it can go bad from the oils that are still left on the fingers. So, I just tilt my head back, put a drop under my eye, gently spread it around my eye, eyebrow, nose area and as far as it goes. Then I do the same with the other eye. I then put one drop on my forehead and spread it not only on my forehead but up into the hairline. I put a drop or two on mychin just under the lips, moving it to both sides of my face, and gently using an upward motion, blend it with the under-eye drops. Last I put it on the &amp;#34;decolletage&amp;#34; ... hee-hee... sorry , I giggle when I type that because quite frankly, I had no idea exactly what that was... and for those who are like me, here is the definition... the Decolletage is the upper part of a woman&#x27;s torso, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. I knew it was something like that. Sometimes, it takes more than a drop to cover my expansive &amp;#34;decolletage.&amp;#34; lol  Sorry, I digress.... Anyway, I&#x27;ve been doing this routine since I got the Vitamin C Serum and I can feel a difference. I like the way it feels and like that for some reason, I feel more confident.   I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest  &amp; unbiased opinion. This is my true story &amp; my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Feels good when I put this on and it dries pretty quickly. My skin looks brighter and seems like I have a more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Feels so good on freshly washed skin. Leaves my face feeling refreshed, smooth, and I can visibly see a difference. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great Quality. I recommend buying it. You can feel it working</li>
    <li> Update: I recently ordered another bottle and it was cloudy and smelled bad. I returned it, ordered another and I had the same problem. I contacted Sano and have not heard back. I originally left a good review on this product (which I purchased) because I liked the product and because a flyer I recieved with the product said that if I left a review online I would just need to email them and they would send me free products to try. Again, I never heard back. I don&#x27;t trust a company that makes it impossible to contact them for any reason. I will try another vitamin C serum and I do not recommend this product especially when they have quality control issues. I don&#x27;t want to risk a bad reaction and I want to be honest to other potential customers especially when it looks like most of the reviews on this product are fake or were written because they got the serum for free.</li>
    <li> I use 2 drops after washing my face and I love the cool feeling on my skin. It has no fragrance and I feel that it brightens my skin</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I have noticed a difference in my skin tone with the fading of sunspots.  Also, my face feels softer.  I use it after I wash my face in the morning and evening. I definitely will continue to use vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Using it hopefully it works!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service, excellent product. I love the eyes&#x27; jell. I see already a big difference  around my eyes. I wish the container is bigger, or they can keep that one as a bonus, and we can order the eye jell alone in a bigger container. I used it for only one week plus Sano&#x27;s pills for Phytoceramides. I will post another review after 4 weeks because I read that Phytoceramides work after 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt; I am going to keep ordering again and again.i am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck. The eye creme last fairly long.  You get a free one laterms on and a 5 dollar cupon.... nice. All my scars disappeared.  Use With Phytocerimides Pills.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I have been only using it for about 3 - or 4 days, but I can already tell a big difference. I used to to help even out and fade red marks from previous acne spots, where the darn red marks linger forever! Also for my dark circles under my eyes, due to mainly thinning skin. The vitamin c serum for myself, doesn&#x27;t sting at all for my under eye or upper eyelids, so I apply it with no issues. But I&#x27;m excited to see what the results will be in the weeks ahead. But the red marks have already started fading. I eat very healthy, I have taken every nutrient possible in order to help my skin heal this red marks, etc. But to no avail. But adding this, def has helped. Very excited.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for 3 months and my skin is much brighter. Other people have  noticed.</li>
    <li> I have only reviewed 2 other purchases ever.  I absolutely had to write about the benefits of this product.  I am 62 years old and have suffered with skin problems since my 30&#x27;s.  After using this for only a month along with Revitol eye cream and face cream my skin is perfectly clear.  I can actually go out in public without makeup and not be embarrassed by the way I look.  I ran into a lady I taught with recently and she said I really glowed.  Even when wearing makeup  my skin glows through the makeup.  I don&#x27;t need to wear as much foundation or blush either.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this.  Dr. Oz recommended it on his show and was he ever right!</li>
    <li> Love this so far. Bought it a week ago, I can already see small improvements in the texture of my skin, and it feels so light and refreshing. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I must preface my review by admitting that I am relatively naive about face creams, lotions, serums etc.  I don&#x27;t really know what the differences are suppose to be, and I&#x27;m not into the latest crazes.  However, like most of you, I have skin... and sometimes it could be better.  As a friend so lovingly pointed out, my face is looking a bit dull.  And I can feel that it is dry.  So, for that reason I bought this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on using this serum at night because I was anticipating that it would have an herbal aroma, considering the first ingredient is &amp;#34;organic herbal infusion.&amp;#34;  As far as I can tell, it has no discernible scent at all.  For this reason, one can use it anytime of day, and it would be good for males or females.  It won&#x27;t clash with your other scents like shampoo, deodorant, or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also anticipating that a serum might be oily or heavy.  This serum is not.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my cheek&#x27;s gravitational pull, and extreme thirst, sucked the serum off of my finger and absorbed it completely, before my hand actually reached my face.  I used more than I should have on my first application, because each part of my face behaved in the same manner, and it took a few applications to confirm that the serum was actually making it all the way to my face.  I should have just given it a minute because I think I heard a faint ahhh eventually.  No, I can&#x27;t prove it.  You&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it or try it yourself.  Anyway, there was absolutely no residue left over.  The only evidence that I had put anything on my face was that my forehead no longer felt like it was going to crack when I laughed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, flash forward about a week of using this product everyday.  My skin feels nice, as in, I don&#x27;t think about it feeling dry anymore.  And it isn&#x27;t as thirsty, although the serum still absorbs just as quickly.  It also feels smoother to the touch... or so I&#x27;m told.  I don&#x27;t really see a difference, no miracles yet.  But I wouldn&#x27;t expect to this soon. Time will tell.  I&#x27;ll try to update when I finish the bottle, but let&#x27;s be honest, I have a pea sized brain and lots of other things going on.  However, if I don&#x27;t make it back this way again, just know that I can already tell you, by the way this serum absorbs and makes my skin feel, I would buy it again.ce, no miracles yet.

    <li> Have only been using a short time, but skin is looking better every day.</li>
    <li> Another Great Sano Product!</li>
    <li> It seems too harsh for my face.</li>
    <li> I used this product after using the Dermaroller, and absolutely loved it. It left my skin very smooth and refreshed. Although the Dermaroller can cause redness off the skin, this serum helped very much in relieving the irritation and left my face smooth. It does have an oily, not clear appearance, but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily at all, even though i have an oily/mixed skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the ingredients, especially that it&#x27;s combined with hyaluronic acid that maintains the extracellular space of the epidermis and provides an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients such as Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Nah...save your money</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this. I&#x27;m 29 years old with very oily, acne prone sensitive skin and this just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. After using daily for a month and a half I have not noticed any improvement in texture or brightness, but I have been breaking out a bit which may or may have something to do with this serum as it is the only new item in my routine. Other hyaluronic acid products I&#x27;ve used have helped my moisturizer sink into my skin better and made my skin more supple and smooth but this one did not have that effect.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a great value as well. I like that it also comes in a glass bottle.  Helps my skin look smooth and younger.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum a few months ago after reading the great reviews and doing some research on Vitamin C serum.  I have been using it for almost 3 months, 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good-it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out, over dry my skin, make it oily and it absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad-after using this for 2-3 times a day for nearly 3 months, I have seen absolutely no change to my skin.  I have extremely small fine lines that look the same as they did when I started.  I will look for something more powerful to try next.</li>
    <li> It works great for my face, i love the feeling the next morning.</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish the eye gel was available in a larger jar.</li>
    <li> Great serum! My face love it:)</li>
    <li> I bought this product and started using it because I heard that vitamin C helps cell turn over.  As a result I thought it could help my acne scarring and dark spots.  I really enjoyed this product and its aplication.  The product is smooth and it brightens up my skin.  It has lessened the look of dark spots slightly.  I am quite young so I don&#x27;t need this product for wrinkles or aging (althought it is good to prevent aging before you have it) but I do enjoy this product for the glow it gives you.</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel moisturized and refreshed without being greasy.</li>
    <li> 5 days of use and my husband just asked me if I was wearing makeup! (I wasn&#x27;t) I can see a difference already.</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE THIS SERUM!!</li>
    <li> I received this Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum plus bonus Eye Gel from Tomoson to try for free and ordered it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C serum comes in a glass jar with a squeeze top (lower right photo).  It is totally clear and odorless as there are no additives to this serum.  It is very thin &amp; dries fast so you must work quickly.  I use about a dime for my entire face &amp; neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel is also clear an odorless.  It also dries fast and absorbs into the skin.  I have been using these products in this order: wash face, apply serum, apply eye gel, and then my night or day moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is 98% natural and made of organic derived components.  I *try* to use natural and organic products when I can.  I also like the price of these items as it is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;surveysbystephanie.tumblr.com&lt;br /&gt;www.facebook.com/surveysbystephanie&lt;br /&gt;www.twitter.com/surveysbysteph</li>
    <li> The 4 bottles of Sano Vitamin C serum I received are all challky cloudy in color.  Makes me suspicious that they are oxidised and not so effective.  I wrote to customer service but they insisted this is a variation in their product.  I don&#x27;t think so as I read most of the reviewers stated the color is clear.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with what I&#x27;ve received because I believe the clear ones are the good ones.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am very happy with my purchase of Sano Vitamin C Serum.  I would recommend it highly to others wanting to fight the battle with aging.  I have no sensitivities to the fragrance which can sometimes be a problem for me.  Seems to be a clean product offering great results.  I have been using it a couple of weeks now and do see differences in my skin.  Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This serum works, it makes my dark skin spots lightens!!! :)</li>
    <li> Product came well packaged and fast. Used it right away. Clear serum that comes out by a dropper. A lil goes a long way. I only use this in the morning time. Patted it on my face, neck and declate. And the left over in the tops if my hands. Hasn&#x27;t dried out my face and keeps my oily Tzone at bay. In fact I haven&#x27;t had an oily Tzone at all since using this. The eye gel is great and refreshing for under my eyes. So far I love this product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> My face feels more rejuvenated with this serum leaving my skin softer and less visible wrinkles. Vitamin C eye gel soothes my under eyes and slowly restored my youthful appearance back it had diminished my wrinkles very well.</li>
    <li> The best thing I love about this is that there is no scent. I have tried many products and since I have been living in a very dry area, it&#x27;s nice to find a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky feeling or smelling like a perfume store. The serum acted like a toner for me so that I had no need to use one anymore. My skin feels so soft and the added eye cream was a plus! I highly recommend to anyone wanting to change up their beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I know it takes vitamin C a while to work so I didn&#x27;t expect anything in the first week. Delivery was very fast. Will check back in a month or so to let you know if there is any difference</li>
    <li> Love this. Helps reduce lines and also age spots. Feels light on the skin like nothing is on, absorbs quickly and really does work.</li>
    <li> I love this serum and I purchase it regularly. It works wonderfully and enhances the brightness of my face. The cost is not prohibitive as with most face serums with these ingredients. My face is soft and smooth and I will continue to be a customer of SANO products.</li>
    <li> I love it, its a great serum but without the hayluronic acid, vitamin c can be a bit drying. i just mix it with the same brand of hyaluronic acid serum and get twice as much product as those costing twice the price. The quality is evey bit as good as the more expensive brands. nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> Good quality, does what it says it does.  I waited until about a month to write a review to see optimal results, and I notice a difference in my skin without makeup.  Skin tone is more even, generally brighter, and as a result, gives the appearance of smaller pores  Also works as a primer for makeup, which has led me to using far less makeup and still getting glowing skin.  Use with a mild self tanning facial lotion for maximum effect. Only thing I wish it had is SPF.</li>
    <li> I do like this. Not seen dramatic results but do see a difference when I use it daily. I have numerous products and like to switch around, bought two of these and will buy it again. I think it&#x27;s important you use as directed to get maximum results.</li>
    <li> The only change I noticed in my skin was a drastic and immediate increase in the amount of cystic acne, in areas of my face where I&#x27;ve never broken out before in my life -- massive blemishes, the size of mosquito bites. And worse, when I contacted Sano Naturals about the reaction I was having, I never heard from them.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved this serum! Says it helps her skin.</li>
    <li> One application and my skin looked like glass when I woke up.  It even got rid of that little pms breakout on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to notice a difference after one application?  Im allergic to everything, but not this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  Love it, but here&#x27;s the tea:  wash your face and apply immediately to still damp skin and immediately apply moisurizer.  If not you will experience the dryness other reviewers complain of.  Trust that if you keep skin hydrated, this product delivers its claims and promises.  I was so surprised, and I&#x27;ve tried every serum on the market.  Tip:  use the dropper and apply to the reservoir of your palm, then dip your fingertips into the product and smooth on to skin.  Don&#x27;t use cotton pads.  Its a waste of serum if you use cotton to apply.</li>
    <li> I have been using the pictured products for a couple of weeks and enjoying them. As my readers have probably discovered by now, I&#x27;m a fan of Vitamin C Serum to take care of my skin. When given the opportunity to give the Sano Naturals brand a try-out, I was delighted. And then to top it off with a bonus of their Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel really was a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied both products morning and evening. In the mornings I have applied moisturizer following the serum and followed by makeup. This is my normal procedure unless I&#x27;m going make-up-free for the day. The two products are producing expected results just as other vitamin C products. I&#x27;m still in a toss-up as far as my preference for eye products.  Eye gel is a newcomer to me as I&#x27;ve always, until recently, used eye creams. In fact some days I apply both an eye gel and an eye cream using the gel first, allowing it to completely absorb, and then lightly applying the eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I go a bit excessive with my face care product use. But when you become one of those Southern Ladies-of-A-Certain-Age, you&#x27;ve gotta do what you&#x27;ve gotta do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum delivers 20% Vitamin C which is the acknowledged strength professionals prefer for results. Sanos includes Aloe for inflammation and Hyaluronic Acid for superior moisturizing benefits. Featuring natural products is a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can endorse both of these as good products.</li>
    <li> I received my Serum on time, and have been using it daily! I have seen improvements under the eyes,but will see with further use!</li>
    <li> i have been using this for about 3 days now and i can already see a difference in my skin its lighter and feels really soft . i really like it and will continue to use it unless the price goes up . i love the feel and the price . my skin does feel tighter and it is great</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I like the dropper.  It is easy to use and apply as much or little as you want.  The first time I used this product, I applied about 4 drops in the palm on my hand and then applied it to my face and neck.  I noticed right away that it was light and odorless.  It really didn&#x27;t feel like I had even put anything on my face.  After it dried however my face felt a little tight.  The 4 drops was more than enough to cover my face and neck and I decided to use a little less the next time.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is versatile and can be used either alone or with a moisturizer. It is light and absorbs quickly.  However, I was not a fan of how my face felt when I applied foundation on top of this serum.  It&#x27;s probably just me but my face felt a little sticky.  For that reason, I will most likely only use this product before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals Vitamin C serum uses an \\&quot;organic herbal infusion and hyaluronic acid organic aloe.\\&quot;  This product does not contain alcohol, or any added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product daily for about a month now and I can see a noticeable difference in my dark circles.  It also has seemed to brighten and even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Cream Eye Gel -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I&#x27;m not a fan of the slight cucumber smell.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and seems to dissipate after it dries which is nice.  With that being said, I love the product itself!  It feels smooth and silky on.  The eye gel has a slight cooling or tingling feeling when applied to the eye area.  It has brightened and even calmed the area around my eyes.  I also have used this product on my forehead area and I feel it has helped to smooth and hydrate that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  I am excited to see the benefits with prolonged use of this eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I really do not know what to say about this serum, it is your typical topical serum for providing Vitamin C into your skin in a fast, easy, safe way. It did make my skin firmer and brighter but there were just some things that made it unpleasant for me. One, the consistance of this, it was a very runny, clear liquid and if I put too much on my fingers it was a juggling game to get it to not fall off before I got to my face with them. As you can see in the picture, the serum ran off my hand while taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had no smell and that was lovely since some can have a ton of chemical odor, I also enjoyed that it had an eyedropper for application. However you MUST use a moisturizer afterwards! this will seriously  dry out your skin in a flash. You only need a few drops of this, do not go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I know that I will not buy this when my sample is gone, I will use it until it is though and I hope others out there will as well since I am sure it will work for someone (just not me) The eye serum I got with it (it comes with every order) is wonderful though! Thick and creamy with no smell its easy to apply around the eyes and is not irritating, it made my eyes brighter and my dark circles a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> SIMPLE,EASY AND IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I love these products. I integrated the serum and eye cream with my skincare products and have seen such a remarkable difference afterwards. I also LOVE the fact that all the ingredients are of high quality and that water was not added to affect the potency of the serum. And the price for both the serum and eye cream combo is such a wonderful value. I will continue to purchase these quality products at such an exceptional price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way Vitamin C Serum makes my skin look and feel so when given the chance to try more serum AND an eye cream gel with a promotion for a review I was so excited to try it out and give my opinion.  Vitamin C 20% serum is great.  It makes my skin look and feel radiant.  My skin is oily so I have always been scared that it would make it worse but it doesn&#x27;t.  Over time it has improved the look and texture of my skin dramatically. With this product you can expect diminished appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, hyperpigmentation &amp; pores and improvement in the overall appearance as well as improvements in dark spots and dry skin.  If you don&#x27;t see them improvement you are looking for  Sano offers a lifetime guarantee so what do you have to lose? I have so far been equally impressed with the eye cream gel and look forward to the long term effects of using it.  Love this stuff.  The older I get the more interested I am in skincare but honestly I wish I had started at an earlier age.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and I wish I had taken it more seriously when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product has the consistancy of water. I have ordered vitamin serum numerous times and it has always been somewhat thick. I won&#x27;t order this one again.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this product. When I first ordered it, I was kinda nervous about fake reviews but it ended up being a really awesome serum. I am a grad school student who gets very little sleep, and it becomes very obvious on my face. I had discoloration, acne scars, dull skin, and an overall uneven skin tone. I felt insecure going out without foundation. After a few days of using this product, I realized it was definitely making a difference and brightening up my skin. Pretty soon my discoloration began to fade as well. Now I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I wore foundation because I feel that comfortable in my own skin! I also love how this product is natural and odorless. It is definitely a must have in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom she loves it and she said her age spots are getting lighter.</li>
    <li> Just tried the Sano serum for the first time left my face very smooth, I highly recommend this product, already I see a difference in my wrinkles they are much smoother</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product...its my third order from Sano.Recommend it highly for oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Has made significant changes in my skin.  Smoother, dark spots lightening and my pores are not so noticeable.  Great item for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C serums and while most of them work about the same, this one is my favorite and is also a great price. Current skincare routine is AM: Vitamin C/Sunscreen and PM: Retin-A creme 0.01% and then 1x per week I use a pumpkin mask. Simple but been very effective for me. Combination of the four has drastically improved my fine lines, occasional acne and overall skin tone. This serum covers my face with 4-5 drops and soaks in quickly. The consistency is smooth and I wear in no problem under sunscreen and makeup. 5 Stars :)</li>
    <li> This serum is so cloudy and smell horrible. It is not oily but doesn&#x27;t adsorb well into your skin. I had finished the bottle but no improvement on my skin.</li>
    <li> Use this after derma roller and your entire face will look radiant. I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical but when I used this product I could feel it immediately tighten my skin. It goes on smooth and you skin absorbes it quickly. The quality if this product seems to hold up to the name and reputation.</li>
    <li> I have had terrible skin forever and tried numerous products..nothing worked. About a week after trying serum..I noticed how great my face was starting to look. Irs been about 8 months and still rely on it every day! Love that it is a natural product also!</li>
    <li> I love this and wish Sano made this serum with a moisturizer added as I have dry skin. So for me, I apply moisturizer as a second step which is really no problem. I did buy a second bottle for my friend as a gift because it works so well and the girl at Sephora was amazed at my skin!</li>
    <li> Fabulous products.  After 6 days, I already notice improvement in my facial appearance,,, softer,, glow,, diminishing wrinkle depth.  I am happy I am using this and look forward to further improvement in days to come.  These products are working much faster and better than ever hoped for on my neglected 72 yr. old facial skin.  My only issue is the Eye Cream is excessively heavy and dries very stiff.  I am using a lighter application to try to eliminate the stiffness and still get results.  Both are working wonders.  Miracle products.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Sano&lt;br /&gt;I think this is my favorite .&lt;br /&gt;The combination of this product&lt;br /&gt;And the phyotocerimides is amazing !&lt;br /&gt;No more&lt;br /&gt;Expensive wrinkle&lt;br /&gt;Creams for me . Thanks Sano</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the vitamin C serum. Most skin care irritates my sensitive skin but this was soothing! I see a noticeable difference in my skin. It&#x27;s more radiant. I have seen a slight improvement in my sun spots too. I will definitely order again. Also, the eye gel is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Sano Naturals Customer Care is outstanding.  I had a mishap with the bottle that I caused myself, and they took care of the problem immediately.  Their products are awesome, and I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Been using these for 2 weeks.  Non greasy: absorbs into skin nicely.  No more dry patches. My skin is soft.  I use it after cleansing, but before moisturizer and make up.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, pleasant to no smell and no scary chemicals. Sinks right into my skin (combination/aging) and makes me glow!! Love it. I&#x27;m throwing my pile of other products that haven&#x27;t delivered away!!!!</li>
    <li> After just one use, my skin appeared brighter. It was definitely smoother. After 3 weeks my age spots are showing slight fading.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! My face has never looked better. I focus on putting it under my eyes since I had dark circles there, key word HAD. Highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable and natural vitamin c serum, and this one works amazingly, and without being irritating to the skin.</li>
    <li> Will be anxious to see results.  Seems a bit drying.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I can actually leave the house without makeup now. Never use to do that ,but It has made my skin brighter and I feel a lot better about my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it goes on easily. I am really happy that I found a product I like and it&#x27;s made in the USA. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this serum did anything for me. I bought it because of all the rave reviews and used it for several months, but didn&#x27;t see any noticeable changes (and I have a lot of skin issues to work with!). It didn&#x27;t break me out, though, so I kept using it...But alas, no miracle results.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It makes my skin more brighter. I have over pigmentation on my forehead and jawline and it lightened these areas alot. I&#x27;m using this after I wash my face day and night. I already ordered another bottle. I&#x27;m happy that the price is low too.</li>
    <li> Wish I could rate this product negatively.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about 5 days continuously as directed. But unfortunately had to give up. My skin post 5th day became excessive dry, itchy, cracked and it had a burning sensation for which I am still struggling with.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at all</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it every night and have gotten compliments on my skin. You only need to use it once a day, I did some research and applying it more often doesn&#x27;t reap more benefits. You can read how I&#x27;m using it here: http://www.hautemommyblog.com/2015/01/microneedling-at-home-dermaroller.html</li>
    <li> I really like the Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum so far! I&#x27;m only 28, but I have some issues with tone and early signs of wrinkles so I wanted to be proactive. So far (3 weeks of use) I&#x27;ve noticed a clearer and brighter complexion. What I like most about the serum is how incredibly light it is; once I put it on, it absorbs QUICKLY, and then there is ZERO signs that I even put anything on! This NEVER happens for me with creams and lotions no matter their claims to be &amp;#34;non-greasy,&amp;#34; it always is, but not this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay there have been a few setbacks with the product...I HATE the dropper design and applicator. I don&#x27;t know why beauty companies keep insisting on this design. It&#x27;s terrible for clumsy people! I already knew to be careful with that type of applicator because I had an awful experience with an expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil where I lost half the bottle due to butterfingers. However, this did not stop my sister from forgetting to screw the cap all the way on my vitamin c serum, and (just my luck) later on my cat jumped up on the counter and knocked the bottle over. I found it less than half full inside my sink! :( This was literally the second day I had owned this product, so that was HEARTBREAKING!! I would LOVE to see a pump applicator available SOON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I was given a free sample of the vitamin c eye cream and I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement in that area yet...but it has only been three weeks, so I&#x27;ll give it more time.  I&#x27;m still having issues with wrinkles and dark circles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there are some setbacks, they are not large enough to take a star away from my review.  Despite it&#x27;s design it&#x27;s still doing what it says it does, and it&#x27;s working for me. I think it&#x27;s worth everyone&#x27;s money to give it a try at least! It&#x27;s not that expensive and my half empty bottle is going down slowly since the spill.</li>
    <li> Great service. Prompt delivery. The price of the serum is reasonable unlike some of the other brands. Thank you Sano for making this serum affordable. I already see a difference in my skin :)</li>
    <li> My husband and i uses serum for couple of months ,we have tried two different brands ..when my husband tried sano serum ,he was so happy because he said he can feel his face tightening and doing what it is supposed to do .we be ordering sanum next time...and thanks sano for this product</li>
    <li> I am a big fan for this product! I think that the price is affordable in comparison to the other Vitamin C serums but it works just as effectively! After trying it out I saw that my hyperpigmentation scars have lightened after using this consistently. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what to expect but am waiting</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, but I use other things for moisture.  I use it in combination.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it every night before I go to sleep and it works really well. My face is so much clearer and softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent results like no other facial serum I have used over the years!&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals vitamin C serum has smoothed and brightened my 63 yr. old face after only 3 weeks! Definitely a life time customer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face and really like it!</li>
    <li> I love this product already, a little goes a long way and it feels light on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it 2x a day for 5 days now and I&#x27;m seeing a small change in my forehead wrinkle already,also a noticeable difference in skin clarity. I will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamic C Serum 20% Vit C, Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks and&lt;br /&gt;already notice the difference in smoothness of my skin and the softness of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It feels good too!</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews on items, but I really like this serum. It arrived quickly and I did receive the free eye cream. My completion looked brighter, skin is smooth and love that my face was not greasy after using the serum. I have only been using for a short time, but definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product to enhance and rebuild the loss of collagen.  I spent a lot of time in the sun in my youth and never thought later on I was ruining my skin.  I am seeing a noticeable difference on my entire face and neck.  The dropper make it that much easier to&lt;br /&gt;apply. and a little goes along way. I sue every morning and evening along with my facial moisturizer. The addition of hyaluronic acid is the key ingredient along with the VIt C that make this a no brainer for a skin/collagen builder.  I highly recommend this product and the cost&lt;br /&gt;is much less than other brands.  SANO Naturals is a winning brand company.</li>
    <li> So far this SANO Vitamin C Serum has made a definite change to the brightness of my skin.  In general conversation I was telling a co-worker that I have started walking after work and she commented, &amp;#34;I can tell, the color is back in your face.&amp;#34;  I had only started walking 3 days ago, so I know it was the serum that was making my skin appear brighter and healthier.  This long, hard winter and an illness had left me looking sallow.  The eye gel has made a HUGE difference in the dark shadows around my eyes.  I have large pores and fine lines around the mouth area, but as I continue to use these products I feel they are fading.  I will continue to use these products in hopes that the longer I use them the clearer my skin will become.  The damage didn&#x27;t occur overnight and I can&#x27;t expect it to be repaired overnight.  The reason I first purchased these products was for the reviews and the savings...where can you buy a serum and eye gel for under $12.00?!  Also, the company has been very generous in their email offers and I believe they are very sincere in standing behind their products.</li>
    <li> Did not make much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I truly love the way my face feels and looks just after a couple of days using.....</li>
    <li> Good price, I hope it helps, bought for use with dermaroller .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. I was looking for an economical vitamin c serum that ACTUALLY WORKS. This works better than some of the more expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried. This serum left my skin super smooth after the first application. It helps decrease and minimize acne associated inflammation. Some of my acne scars have started to lighten. I will definitely continue purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum feels so good on my skin and is improving the look and feel of my skin already.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I going to purchase this serum for my co-worker. I love how my skin feels and looks..THANKS!...I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I just got it last week, and I am already seeing improvement on my chest.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I was looking for a product with vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, and this was a great buy.  I use it morning and night under my regular moisturizer and can see the difference in fine lines and skin tone.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is a great inexpensive product that truly helps even out skin tone and protecting against the sun.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff.  Makes my skin feel very soft.  As a 58 year old woman, I realize that NOTHING will erase my hard-earned wrinkles (except plastic surgery, of course :), but this truly does help soften my skin. I apply it to clean skin in the mornings, let it absorb for a minute, then follow up with moisturizer. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> The first bottle I received was clear and odorless. I used that entire bottle daily. I was mainly using it for pimples, acne scars, dry cheeks, and aging. I still get acne, but the scars do seem to heal faster than normal. I&#x27;m also pretty young so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not it&#x27;s helping with anti-aging. Hopefully it is! Either way, I love the way it feels on my skin.  The second bottle I received is milky, or has a slight yellow color, and also has a fragrance. I emailed the company and found out that they improved their formula. The new formula contains Ferulic Acid and extra Vitamin E, so don&#x27;t be alarmed by the color change! I&#x27;m excited to see how this affects my overall skin and will update if I notice any differences.  All in all, this is a wonderful serum and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I just received this. Shipped quickly, good quality, great results on my skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the product!  As a part of my new facial regiment, the Vitamin C Serum is helping to clear up my skin and tighten and tone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum both a.m. and p.m. My skin seems brighter and smoother.  I am hoping that the dark spots caused by past sun damage will be lightened; time will tell.  Right now I do recommend using this product if you want brighter, smoother skin.  It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Only a small amount is needed during each application.  The dropper makes it easier to apply only what you need, thus it should last for months. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go along with my dermaroller. Um...I haven&#x27;t used the dermaroller yet, I&#x27;m kind of scared. I will tell you I&#x27;ve been using this alone and it has helped with my acne scarring I can tell the difference. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a month... the jury is still out on end results, but I think I like it.  (That&#x27;s a wishy washy review!).  I wanted it to fade some of my sunspots and I can&#x27;t tell how well it&#x27;s working on my face.  I do have one sun spot on my hand that I think it&#x27;s lightened (I wish I took a before picture of my hand spot).  I like the way it feels (it&#x27;s silky, not greasy... but I apply it quickly b/c if I don&#x27;t, it starts to dry and gets sticky).  The bottle will go a long way because it only takes 3 or 4 drops to cover my face and tops of my hands....</li>
    <li> I like this product. It helps smooth, lighten and firm the skin.</li>
    <li> I only received this product just a couple days ago but I must say so far I&#x27;m loving the way my face feels after application, refreshed and hydrated. I&#x27;ll continue to use this and see how my skin/face improves.</li>
    <li> i like this and will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have been using almost a month and I notice my skin with less wrinkles and less dark spots. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you.  It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. My wife got rid of a wart with Vitamin C Serum. She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it. She&#x27;s had it so long, she has no idea where she got it in the first place. Vitamin C Serum is doing wonders for her skin. I&#x27;m wondering if it works on boils, which I am going to try today to see what the results will be. This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned. It won&#x27;t make you younger, but it will make your skin look younger. Update-Day two of using Vitamin C Serum on my two boils&#x3D;the pain is gone and some of the swelling has stopped. I will continue to use it to see if this product will actually take boils away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm. After two days, the swelling and burning went away, thankfully. I continued to put the vitamin C serum on the boils and they slowly vanished. This is the coolest stuff they ever made. My wife is now putting it on a boil that she has and it is working for her too. Receiving the free Vitamin C Eye Cream was a great added bonus</li>
    <li> Love it.  Bought 2 and my daughter spilled 1 so I HAD to order another!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a month and feel like it is softening my wrinkles. I feel like my eyes have a more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; look to them. The product was shipped very quickly with no problems at all!</li>
    <li> I ordered the SANO Vitamin C Serum for my wife and she just love it!  She claim it makes her skin more rediant and smooth. This vitamin c serum is a great anti-oxidant against sun and polution damages, She uses it as a daily anti-wrinkle and revitalizing lotion. I highly recommend SANO Naturals products.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be working well, have not noticed any major difference, but I have only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> I started using this product one month ago and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin.  It is softer, more supple and there is a noticeable difference in the fine lines.  I&#x27;m 55 years old, with deep crows feet and lines around my mouth. I would say that the wrinkles are more than 50% reduced and my skin looks generally more healthy.  I plan on ordering other products from this company as their customer service is also excellent.</li>
    <li> Saw definite improvement in the sun damage to my skin under my eyes. I used a few drops of serum in the morning under my make-up and again at night under a layer of Olay Regenerist and saw improvement in the tone of my skin and a lessening of the brown spots from sun damage.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid for about a month or so.  Of course, I still would like to find a &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34; that would make my deep wrinkles and sun damage vanish overnight.  But like my Fairy Godmother, I don&#x27;t think such a thing exists in this reality.  I do see improvements in my facial skin, however, and am going to place another order.  I also do believe that a younger woman with less dramatic wrinkles and skin damage would see even more improvement.  In my mid-seventies and sun-worshiper for a ton of years, I must keep my expectations reasonable.  I like this product and am glad I found it!!!  Please note as well, that the company is efficient, provides a lot of information, and is a pleasure to do business with.</li>
    <li> The texture and feel of this serum is very slippery. Kinda reminds me of saliva? But it may just be th aloe Vera in the ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for month or so now and have not noticed any of th hyped that this product received from other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;This serum came with a gel eye cream that smells ok (like cucumber) by because it is a gel, it &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to my skin pretty nicely that I didn&#x27;t like because it felt like it was making the skin under my eyes cracked. So I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this and I just love it! My skin just drinks this up! It feels wonderful on the skin and I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works after some time.</li>
    <li> This product really work. Ive been using it for 2 weeks and i can see the different. I totally recomend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this product.  After a couple weeks I could see a marked difference around my eyes and even laugh lines don&#x27;t seem so pronounced.  It&#x27;s probably now close to a month of using the product but I&#x27;ve  already started planning my next purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for a couple of weeks and already seeing improvement. My skin is brighter and more clear. This serum is everything it says it is. I don&#x27;t write reviews but took the time for this one because I really do love it. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can see a huge difference in my skin just after using this serum for only a week! Softer, more radiant, smaller pores and fine lines. My skin feels tighter as well! Love this product and will continue to use and recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with every type of acne for 15 years. I&#x27;ve tried every product in the store and some specialty ones. In one week of using this 2x/day my skin cleared almost completely and after a month now all I&#x27;ve gotten were miniscule pimples I can barely notice. Even if I pop one I put this on before bed and it&#x27;s healed the next day. I have scarring, uneven tone, oily skin and dark undereye circles and it&#x27;s improved everything. All I do is wash my face, put 10 drops in my palm then smooth onto my face. It&#x27;s scentless, painless and instantly absorbs leaving my skin feeling silky. I really wish I would&#x27;ve found this sooner but I&#x27;m just happy I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
    <li> The eye cream certainly does its job.  After only two weeks all signs of bags have disappeared  and the fine lines seem to be less visable.  As far as the serum,  can&#x27;t  tell yet.  So far i have not noticed any change.</li>
    <li> Serum changed color and has a bad odor. I won&#x27;t be using this product or ordering again. Not sure what happened because this is my 2nd time purchasing. My first serum was great but now that I&#x27;ve received a bad batch I&#x27;m reluctant to try again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it along with the hyaluronic acid serum from sano. The combo is so good that one of my friends asked me what kind of eye cream I use.</li>
    <li> It feels good to apply to face and hands.  Used one month but have not seen any visible changes yet</li>
    <li> I love the Sano Vitamin C serum and also the vitamin C eye cream that came with it.  Have only been using it for a few weeks and already see an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles.  I will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I had used this for over a week so I think that&#x27;s sufficient to write a review. Initially I bought this to help lighten some pih scars I got from some papules I got a few months back. I don&#x27;t get horrible acne, but I do get blind pimple that turn into dark purple scars for monthssss. So it has been over 3 months and neither bha or aha has helped me lighten it up. I ordered this and it arrived 3 days later. In the mean time I had 4 mores blind pimples lurking on my cheeks. I put this on at night, and next morning all those pimple and shrink into oblivion. I can&#x27;t believe that they just gone like that. I&#x27;m so used to put bha on it and wait around a week for them to subsided. I didn&#x27;t expect this to help that at all. All I wanted was it to lighten some scars I have. After a week, I do noticed both the 3 months scars and the 2 weeks old scars lighten at lightning speed. The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t burn at all like the l-aa I tried in this past.  I can i corporate this into my routine easily. The smell is pleasant, typically of natural products. I took off one star just because mine came a little cloudier and tiny tiny tinge of yellowish compare to the other pictures posted. Other than that, it works just fine. So if u have some acne scars issue, I really recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this serum to help with acne scarring and hyper pigmentation. It works pretty well at reducing scars but makes your skin feel baby soft. I also use this as an &amp;#34;morning after pill&amp;#34; for sunburns which turns out to be its best use. Vitamin C is great at absorbing free radicals and serums are about the only form of this that actually works. I put the serum on burned skin as soon as I get home when I have accidentally been in the sun too long and leave it over night. It is AMAZING how well this works for burns, every time I have used it I wake up with no redness at all the sunburn is GONE.</li>
    <li> As a 50ish mom who&#x27;s spent a good bit of time outside, I have been searching for a reasonably priced, multitasking serum for my combination skin that has hyperpigmentation. So far, I think I may have found a keeper (will need to update later on its effect on my spots). This serum has a nice weight - not too thin and absorbs well without leaving a &amp;#34;tight film&amp;#34; feeling that another vitamin C serum I tried did.  It is fine alone under makeup though I have fairly dry cheeks &amp; forehead, so I add Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream over and at night I like a little more heft so I layer on some rosehip oil.  My skin feels dewy without the additions and I feel like I&#x27;m helping correct issues without harsh chemicals.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t notice the package deal for the same price which included the eye gel - oh, well, maybe next time!</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few weeks, I can honestly say that this serum does exactly what it claims.  My skin feels so much smoother and looks visibly brighter. It has definitely exceeded my expectations. The bonus eye gel is a great add on - it has a light, cooling effect. Great value, and a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a products girl. I love trying out new products, and I love telling other people about the good, the bad and the effective. I have been wanting to try some of the vitamin C serums for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The Sano Naturals was a great fit for me. It is a natural product, which is something I like.&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived, I immediately washed my face and started to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum + High Potency Formula Daily Skin Revitalizer comes in a cobalt blue glass bottle with a dropper top. I applied it in the morning with no additional product. I noticed that it soaks into the skin very quickly. Extremely quickly. That was nice, especially if you are going to be doing makeup and are pushed for time. The ingredients list is good, and the product is made in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;After the first day of use, I noticed that my skin started to appear firmer. That&#x27;s nice! After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin was looking a lot brighter. Also nice. However, I also noticed that this is a bit drying. I now mix my serum with my face moisturizer and that issue has been resolved. I like this product a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The second item that I reviewed is the Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel + Concentrated Formula with Silk Peptides. Here is where things get a little confusing. There is no ingredients list on the packaging. That would be nice, so that those who have allergies can check it out and see if they are safe. The next part is the instructions. This is marketed as an eye gel product. The instructions, however are confusing. It reads as follows: Use: Dab around eyes, forehead, and cheek areas daily. Um, eye gel? I think you are confused about where you go! I use it on my eye area and I like this product a lot. Again, had to use my moisturizer because I noticed that there was a bit of dry skin, but from what I am reading, this is common with Vitamin C products.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like how soft my skin feels. I like the firming action. I like the blue bottle and little blue tub that the eye gel came in. This is a solidly good product. #SanoSerum #GotItFreethe blue bottle and little blue tub that the eye gel came in. This is a solidly good product. #SanoSerum #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. It&#x27;s not greasy, not watery it&#x27;s perfect. I enjoy the eye gel as well very soothing.</li>
    <li> Works wonders!. Words don&#x27;t do it justice! Will keep it in stock from now on.</li>
    <li> no strong smell just a clean soothing smell that gives you a relaxing feeling as it absorbs into your skin it’s giving you the nutrition it needs to help keep a younger look.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love your product! It Not only lightened and brightened my face, but it also had a firming effect! My challenge has been under eye puffiness from allergies, which has led to an crevice under my eyes. This has slowly built up that area and tightened it a bit. The overall firmness of my skin is definitely improving!  I&#x27;m going to purchase my second bottle, as well as one for my daughter! I have tried so many products..and this one really delivers!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have use quite a few serums. I would have to say this would have to be my most favorite so far. It goes on smooth and dries really fast. The serum and eye cream doesnt have a strong smell at all. And I have problems with eye creams making my eyes burn and water. But I havent had a problems at all with this one. It has improve the look of my skin in about 2 and 1/2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOP SELLING VITAMIN C SERUM WITH FREE $35 VALUE EYE TREATMENT BONUS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Vitamin C Serum is immersed in Hyaluoronic Acid, and has a 20% concentration of the most stable form of Vitamin C, Sodium Ascorbic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our serum is effective for improving skin brightness and anti aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Sano Naurals. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Made face very oily as well. Smells a bit odd as well.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my skin.  Not sticky or tacky like other vit. C I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I love this, I keep it in my purse and apply it whenever I feel I need a lift, I see a difference in my skin after only a week ...so glad I bought this!!</li>
    <li> This serum works!!  I am seeing more even skin tone, decreased fine lines around my eyes, and am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and I feel like I can see and feel a difference!  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  There is no odor to it. I feel like my skin is not only brighter and tighter too!  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this product!</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic. Made my skin feel so soft and smooth, Pores seem smaller as well. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice aroma to it. Will definitely be buying more of this serum.</li>
    <li> Love it so far and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this vitamin C serum for almost 2 months on my sensitive skin and have been pleased.  I have rosacea, which can make treatments risky,  and those ugly dark spots from growing up at the beach. By combining this serum with a licorice extract, I have fought against those discolorations with positive results. They aren&#x27;t gone but are reduced. One area on my jawbone has particularly decreased.  I doubt that they will ever go away completely without laser treatment but I am thankful to see an improvement.  There&#x27;s no bad odor to the serum and I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, both big pluses to me. This is an item I will order again.</li>
    <li> It is drying out my face. Usually Vit C product helps hydrate and soothe my facial area. This has not been the case with this product</li>
    <li> Sano Vitamin C Serum+:&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle it states the product is of high potency and a Daily Skin Revitalizer. The bottle is a beautiful cobalt blue in color and the dark hue aids with preserving the product, which is rated at 20% concentration. I next looked at the ingredient list and you have an Organic Herbal Infusion, Aloe, and then Vitamin C. So far I am happy that water is not the delivery agent and other good quality binding ingredients were used along with the vitamin. The list goes on but everything is recognizable and friendly, not something I am use to in the &amp;#34;beauty world&amp;#34;. You get Hyaluronic Acid, which helps with inflammation (puffiness) and dry skin. It&#x27;s an ingredient you see for treating Eczema. Sano also uses kosher Vegetable Glycerin to Organic Jojoba oil. Jojoba has many good properties from being used as a fungicide and preventing mildew growth, to being able to deliver moisture without leaving an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results-&lt;br /&gt;Even though most studies for Vitamin C ranged from a month to 12 weeks, I used the product for a period of 2 weeks. I eat a pretty balanced diet that is rich in greens, vegetables and fruit but I have those days that I wish I could say I ate bad, but it&#x27;s mostly that time gets in between meals and I eat late. Inconsistency happens! I noticed when I apply the Sano Vitamin C Serum+, my skin quickly absorbs it. It was so quick that my skin felt soft but with no product residue. I even tested one side of my face by applying just simple H2o and even water does not get absorbed at this rate. It usually would roll off but not this serum. So far I was happy with my first application and in not getting an oily appearance and/or feeling. I continued use and by day 4 saw what appeared as smoothness. Let me add no blemishes, pimples, blackheads or any skin occlusions. This serum is friendly when it comes to any acne suffers and even though people say mine is in the mild range, I myself is the one that deals with it so I rate it moderate at times to those moments that you get the monster bump that never comes up. My pores appear smaller just because my skin looks smoother and plumped up but in a good way! I continued use and noticed less was needed as I continued to use the product. My skin was hydrated enough that where I used 2 to 3 drops in one area, then changed to only needing one drop. The one drop then glided better when applied because my skin did experience positive changes. I don&#x27;t feel I have lost &amp;#34;years&amp;#34; when it comes to aging but I definitely look better. I look like I slept well, drank all my 8 glasses of water, and even ate well......even though that is not always the case. I was definitely happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sano Vitamin C Eye Gel+:&lt;br /&gt;This is a bonus item with purchase.  You again have a cobalt blue colored jar and I love that the product comes with a safety seal that you peel, so no air or anything that can damage or eat up the Vitamin C benefits while in storage. Easy to store and even pack in an overnight bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results-&lt;br /&gt;I never thought a gel could deliver moisture I was happy with but this one did the trick. Being that it&#x27;s a gel, the product goes on cold and instantly starts working on my morning&#x27;s puffy eyes. The Aloe in the product is very gentle to the skin in that area and I love how my make-up glides on after. Some eye creams would roll up sometimes due to the residue left behind and I had to then try to collect these little eye cream left-overs while at the same time not messing up my make-up. Not with the Sano&#x27;s Vitamin C Eye gel+. The product is rich in Peptides to Hyaluronic Acid. Do not be fooled, this gel does moisturize but the area is left with a supple and replenished look. I had zero eye irritations and found the gel friendly to my allergy suffering eyes. A little goes a long way, I used what I could as lightly dab out of the container, maybe the size of two rice grains per eye. The instant results alone of reducing puffiness is hard to beat and I used it with the Sano Vitamin C Serum +, just to get that extra help in my problem areas. My only small con is the product coming in jar form. I prefer bottles with pumps or that have an applicator like a dropper. I&#x27;m just not a fan of dabbing into a jar due to bacteria/germs, but due to the performance of the product, it would not deter me from buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#SanoSerum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Sano Naurals.

    <li> A lot of skincare serums promise vitamin C but it&#x27;s important to actually check the ingredients. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;best\\&quot; type of topical vitamin C, but the most effective and stable is ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbyl phosphate and a few others. This serum has sodium ascorbyl phosphate which is encouraging. Most of the research has focused on 0.3% to 10% concentration ranges. This serum rings in at 20%. Is more necessarily better? There&#x27;s no way to know, but it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;ve packed more than the minimum studied amount rather than burying vitamin C somewhere deep in the ingredients like most other skincare products do.    It also contains hyaluronic acid as its main moisturizer. In my research, I came across Paula Begoun&#x27;s recommendation that says \\&quot;it can boost skin&#x27;s moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilitites, and help prevent moisture loss.\\&quot;    When I opened the bottle, it seems pretty plain. That&#x27;s actually a good thing! So many skincare products have all kinds of weird scents added to them. If you&#x27;re looking for a pretty smelling, flowery product, this is NOT IT but that actually makes this product better in my opinion. Texture is kind of odd, but again, you&#x27;re going for good ingredients and this product has it.</li>
    <li> I really like how this serum absorbs quickly! The one thing that I love is the bonus item. The Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel. I have been using this twice daily and it really helps tighten my lower eyelid (baggage, luggages, whatever you want to call them), as well as help with lighten my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also tell, with overtime use of the Vitamin C Serum, that my skin looks brighter with even skin tone. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends - as well as purchase again!</li>
    <li> been using one month.  see a big difference in my face and neclk areas.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second bottle of Sano Vitamin C Serum.  This is great stuff!  I can clearly see a difference on my face.  The fine wrinkles I used to have are completely gone and my skin looks smooth and radiant now.  I&#x27;ve been using this day and night for several months now.  I first noticed an improvement in my skin after about 2-3 weeks of use, and it just keeps getting better.  My face literally looks at least 10 years younger.  Before discovering Sano, I used another brand which cost over twice as much.  This product works as well or better than the other at much less cost.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this serum. She is 39 years old with some fine lines and discoloration/sunspots. She has tried a few others and this seems to make the biggest difference in her skin. Color and texture is noticably nicer. Her skin actually has a glow which it has never had. She also tried the eye gel on one eye for a week and couldn&#x27;t believe that there was a difference. The fine lines and puffiness are definitely less around the eye that she used the gel. Very pleased with this product and will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My face is bright and my under eye circles have lightened!</li>
    <li> 1.Great packaging with pump applicator&lt;br /&gt;2.Love the serum&lt;br /&gt;3.Nice scented&lt;br /&gt;4.Not so watery/sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;5.hydrates my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;6.the gel formula for the eye cream is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;7.absorbed well without making greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;8.Recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Received free for review but would love to buy it again in future.☺</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t what I expected. It&#x27;s real thin and there&#x27;s not much of a smell.</li>
    <li> Omg the eye thing made my eyes so much better this is something ima use the rest of my life</li>
    <li> I Love How Sano Natural had the bonus eye cream with vitamin Czech serum. This my very first time trying the eye cream and I&#x27;m just loving it. Serum is pretty thin consistency and absorbs on the skin as soon as you apply. After that, the skin looks soft and sublte. I would difinitely repurchase the serum with eye cream. I Love it And Thank you guyz for such a natural and simple product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum and eye cream gel for a week on half my face and neck. On the other half I use ACURE organics Seriously Firming Facial Serum. (How ridiculous is this, but nonetheless I try to see if there are any differences from my regular product). While it goes on easily, absorbs well and does not irritate my skin in any way, I have noticed no differences in my skin texture, suppleness, or brightness. I will keep using these two products until they run out and report back any changes.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week I&#x27;ve noticed the pores on my nose aren&#x27;t as noticeable. My face is soft and the skin that was dry near my nose isn&#x27;t dry any more. It is easy to apply and it has no smell. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks. My skin is softer and blemishes are disappearing.</li>
    <li> just started using it but it feels great on my skin let you know in a couple weeks</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a week so far and my skin is already feeling more firm.  It&#x27;s really easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily.  I&#x27;m really happy I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, SANO Vitamin C Serum can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products with the same results as the more cost effective SANO&#x27;s brand. This product last me about a month and sometimes a bit more. I use it every morning after my shower and apply a facial moisturizer on top after 5 mins of applying the SANO&#x27;s V C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product(s) and please don&#x27;t inflate your costs like other brands tend to do.</li>
    <li> It seems, after 3 weeks of using this product, my wrinkles are lessening. I should have taken a before and after photos as the difference is remarkable when I felt it would not work.</li>
    <li> This serum is very light and easily absorbed and acts as a toner (so no need for toner!). And there is no fragrance or scent which is a plus since spring is coming and allergies are starting (even though I do like fragrances, they make me sneeze and irritate my nose). I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I feel it definitely helps with evening out my skin tone, lightening areas that seem shadowed, and healing acne scars whenever I have a breakout. Plus the fact that you get a free Vitamin C eye gel with the serum is spectacular! Whenever I put it on, i feel instant relief from eye tiredness and dryness!</li>
    <li> This product refreshes my face and provides a younger skin appearance. I expect to have more great Sano products.</li>
    <li> This is an effective vitamin C serum that is just the right consistency.  I have used some that were much too watery.  As a user of antioxidant serums for over 10 years I can say that this one is one of the very best, especially for the price.  I noticed an improvement in tone over the course of about a month.  I also found the Vitamin C gel to be a good product.  It was light weight and felt cool.  Because it is a gel and not a cream it didn&#x27;t interfere with makeup or clog pores.</li>
    <li> Reviews are not my thing, but i am so impressed with this serum i must endorse it. I saw results  pretty fast, especially fine lines  and wrinkles. My face is so smooth, a huge improvement in my patchy uneven skin tone.i will definitely continue to use this. I should also mention that its very affordable and high quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have tried and I have tried many..I use it am/pm after cleansing on my neck and face... allow a minute to absorb and continue with your regular facial routine. Its great under makeup too and the results after a few weeks? Well... see for yourself! I never want my bottle to run dry.... it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a miracle product but I call it my m  &#x27;&#x27;miracle in a bottle\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week, but I can already see old acne marks fading. And I&#x27;m positive, because a few were there for months and I already don&#x27;t have to cover them with makeup anymore. Such a relief! My only concern is that, while Sano mentions it having no scent, my bottle is cloudy and smells slightly reminiscent of beer. It could be that I&#x27;m just super sensitive, though. I don&#x27;t mind it, it just seems odd.</li>
    <li> I really love this product it makes my skin feel &amp; look amazing!</li>
    <li> So far so good. No drastic changes, but my skin looks more fresh except for my saggy looking eyes and dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a week now and this Sano Serum is amazing , I use this everyday I will be ordering more when this is gone , You can feel a difference after the first use , I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good vitamin c serum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the serum and the eye cream gel for about two weeks now, and I really like it. I&#x27;m using them in my night routine, after removing my make-up and cleaning my face, and it feels great on my skin. I really helps me wake up with my skin much more relaxed. A plus is also that they don&#x27;t have a scent, which is great because I hate putting on products with scents when I&#x27;m going to go to sleep. It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s not smelly, it doesn&#x27;t feel weird in any way on your face. I really, really like these two!</li>
    <li> Sano naturals has been great for my skin! It has helped the tone, texture &amp; clarity a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely transformed my skin but it has definitely helped so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very much worth it. It took about 1 month to see results but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with how effective the serum has been at making my skin look younger and smoother. I very thrilled with my purchase and will continue to buy the serum in the future. It&#x27;s a product I recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! This serum is fantastic. Goes on easy. Non greasy and no burning. No scent. Great ingredients. One squirt covers my whole face. After the serum dries, my face feels moisturized and...revitalized. I can actually feel my skin breathing. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good,  saw results  after two days of use. I will re order again.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice greaseless feel to my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this vitamin c serum about two months. Now and I can tell my lines in my face are less visible, I am well pleased, I use it at night and under my makeup everyday.</li>
    <li> This serum is so light and feels really good, within 2 weeks of user can clearly see the difference in lines and dark spots</li>
    <li> I switched to this one from a brand that is more expensive &amp; have been very happy!! This works extremely well. If you have uneven skin, sun damage, fine lines &amp; lack firmness this is one of the best products that I have purchased that addresses all of these. I do notice if I stop using it for even a week my skin will appear more dull, not as bright &amp; even more tired. Try this product - you will love it!! I&#x27;m 43 &amp; have very minimal fine lines for my age. Wear sunscreen if you purchase this because it does have Vitamin C in it, but other than that I have only positive praises for this one!!</li>
    <li> The serum goes on smooth and light, not oily at all. I also love that there is no perfumes or fragrances in this. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation. A little does go a long way... I only use a few drops. It dries fast as it soaks into skin. I have been using the serum for a few weeks and can already notice reduced fine lines and wrinkles, brighter and smoother skin and an even complexion. I also notice a youthful plumpness to my skin. I will continue using this product. I have even started to use it on the backs of my hands, neck and decollete. The only complaint I have is that I wish the serum came in a bigger bottle so I can use it on my entire body!</li>
    <li> I think the percentage was too high for me I woke up with bumps on my skin</li>
    <li> Gave my face a nice glow</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic!  I received it as a gift (it was on my Amazon wish list) and since I have started using this I have seen a great change in the appearance of my skin.  Dark spots are minimized, and overall tone is more even.  I also used to breakout often due to my combination skin, but I rarely do now.  This was on my wish list because it was highly recommended by a trust worthy friend, and I now recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to achieve even skin tone and hydration.</li>
    <li> The company&#x27;s philosophy behind their products  not only makes sense but is continuously proven to  work.  They use aloe vera instead of water as their base  ingredient. Since water only serves to dilute ingredients and in  many cases also oxidizes them rendering them useless  on the long term.  Aloe vera serves as the perfect vehicle to  enhance and transport active ingredients to where repair and  rejuvenation count.  And the fact that they use glass packaging  versus plastic also helps the product retain its quality without the  risk of contamination. Only took me two weeks to see results.  If used as directed, your skin will continue to improve over time.  Tone, texture, and overall luminosity of the skin are realistically  achieved with continued use.  Overall, my skin feels baby smooth  and 8 years younger.</li>
    <li> The vitamin serum I purchased was great including the eye gel. I noticed my skin felt firmer and lines less visible after use of the product. I will be buying your product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about done with my first bottle of Vitamin C Serum and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The serum has definitely helped my skin complexion. My skin feels smoother and has a brighter tone to it - didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either!. It also helped with minor lasting blemishes that wouldn&#x27;t go away. In general it has evened out my skin making it look more radiant. Will be continually ordering more from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I just ordered it a few weeks ago. My skin already looks brighter and more even. I use it before bed under my regular face cream and in the morning under my make up. My order came with a little jar of eye cream and that&#x27;s amazing as well!</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE SERUM....MY FACE FEELS SOOOOOO SMOOTH AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE WAS GREAT TOO...WILL BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Bought this for sensitive skin after epilating, who knew ripping out hair with a machine would be so irritating. It smelled nice and citrusy, went on pretty silky, so I put some on my body and face under my lotion. Once it dried, it was awesome. I just kept rubbing my legs on things lol. Word of warning, it takes a long time to dry, so I&#x27;d only do it at night. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this serum, and I love it! I have seen a smoother skin tone and love the way it feels when it goes on. It soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh, and not at all oily. I feel that I look younger and my dark circles have diminished. I&#x27;m coming back for more! I also love that it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This serum is very light and easily absorbed and acts as a toner (so no need for toner!).  And there is no fragrance or scent which is a plus since spring is coming and allergies are starting (even though I do like fragrances, they make me sneeze and irritate my nose).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I feel it definitely helps with evening out my skin tone, lightening areas that seem shadowed, and healing acne scars whenever I have a breakout.  Plus the fact that you get a free Vitamin C eye gel with the serum is spectacular!  Whenever I put it on, i feel instant relief from eye tiredness and dryness!</li>
    <li> I have used this Vitamin C serum for three week and have noticed amore even tone in my skin which tend to be uneven with redness. I will purchase this serum again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that helps diminish wrinkles and improve skin tone-however, it also makes my skin more sensitive, so I won&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!will purchase again thanks so much !!</li>
    <li> I love the product as a man I was reluctant. It made a big difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have used the entire bottle of this stuff, and I&#x27;m coming back for more! It leaves my skin so soft, and absorbs so quickly. I not only use this with my dermaroller but everyday underneath my regular moisturizer. This will definitely be a staple in my everyday skin routine. I will come back later to update on the effects it has had on my hyper pigmentation and acne scars. I feel like a month isn&#x27;t long enough to be able to really review those results.</li>
    <li> 2 Days!!!  I could tell a difference.  I was skeptical, but I am a believer now!  My skin is smoother and I truly am amazed.  I&#x27;ve heard all the Vitamin C rage lately and decided to try it myself.  There is a reason that SANO is rated so high.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Looks very effective and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with your product and plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement--</li>
    <li> Petunia brand is much better. This feels very drying.</li>
    <li> First time trying the Sano Vitamin C serum and this product have really delighted me.  It goes on light and oil-free.  And after only a few days of usage, I can clearly say that my skin feels much hydrated and appears much more even toned.  Dark areas and acne scars appears less visible and more refined with the rest of my face tone.  I&#x27;m really eager to see more results as I continue to use this product.  And most of all the price is unbeatable.  And I have tried some expensive products in the past with less or equal results as this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using daily, in the morning and at night, and have not noticed any major changes. The skin feels very soft and my eyes are less puffy in the morning, but no changes in dark spots or lines. I do work outside in the sun 5 days a week, so even with sunscreen everyday I get sun spots each year. I&#x27;ll keep using daily, I hope to see some change by the end of this bottle.</li>
    <li> smells horrible and maybe cheap because it is way past expiration, no date on it..</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service.  I have dry (mostly on my nose) sensitive skin and this product feels great. It helps prep my skin for moisturizer and really has made a difference with the dryness.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I recieved my vitamin c serum yesterday and started using it when i got home, my skin feels really hydrated and soft, cant wait to see what it will do the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product, because people rated four stars. But one thing I like about this ,when I put it on my face it dry quickly. Make my face feel smooth and soft, and I quest I will still be using this product, until something better come out.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum because of all of the great reviews and at 47, I am getting a few wrinkles and sun damaged areas on my face. I have been using this serum daily for a month now and while my skin is certainly soft right after I apply it, that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s done for me. There has been no difference in the texture of my skin, no fading of the sun damaged spots and not even the slightest difference in my wrinkles or dark circles. I&#x27;m glad it worked for some, but I&#x27;m off to find something else.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and already seen pores shrink. I would recommend this product to gain a healthy skin.</li>
    <li> O Gosh, I&#x27;m in tears this product for such a low price work like a miracle i notice changes in my skin specifically the hyperpigmentation area on cheeks have a change in a week i can see the dark areas breaking up please start with this product then work your way up to a 10% TCA ONCE EVERY OTHER WORK it will work</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Will purchase again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells good, seems to work good, too.  And a little goes a long way.  I use it on face, neck and top of hands.</li>
    <li> This helped my acne prone skin. Loved it.</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased this product my skin feels and looks amazing in the little time ive used it.....definitely will be ordering more love the results I really recommend this product and its also very economic and most importantly it works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. It&#x27;s not only working great making my face look brighter and healthier but I also try it for my belly stretch marks and it&#x27;s also working there my skin looks tighter . My eye cream is also doing a great job, no more bags and dark circles are improving every day.</li>
    <li> This product works well and I like the added gift. The customer service is great too. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> The bonus eye cream is awesome. It smells like cucumbers and is really hydrating and refreshing. Didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference, but I only used it 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a tiny bit of difference in my skin after using the facial serum. It seemed brighter, however something in it did not agree with my skin. My face became full of clogged pores, and oilier. If I had to describe the smell it&#x27;d be jojoba oil and my skin does not like jojoba oil. It could very well be part of the &amp;#34;herbal blend&amp;#34; in the ingredient section. But if its not jojoba oil, then something else is the culprit. I have sensitive, dry skin. So it may be just my skin&#x27;s sensitivity, because it seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> This seems to do wonderful things to the skin, even though it is very early.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product and I am seeing and feeling a noted difference in the texture and look of my skin. Over 50 I have tried many products that haven&#x27;t worked and in fact irritated my skin. These products are superb and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I could feel and see a difference in my skin right away! Been using it morning and evening for 3 days now and already see a huge difference in my skin. My skin is glowing. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> I have used other products (lotions) from Sano Naturals and really liked the quality and effectiveness I felt these products showed.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I recently fell in love with this Vitamin C Serum which smells pleasant and makes my skin feel and hopefully look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I have freckles and spots from sun damage and just plain aging going on and when I use this serum consistently, I feel like it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say I LOVE hyaluronic acid. I have been praising it since I realized it was the active ingredient in my favorite face cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and I must say that when I run out there is definitely a difference in general appearance! I have used so many anti aging products but none have gave me the results that Sano has. Not only are the dark spots under my eyes fading but the skin is not as thin. I am very picky about what I put on my skin and that is why I prefer this product over other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; skin products.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I&#x27;ve noticed a remarkable difference in the fine lines on my face.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 14 days now and love it. Usually my skin breaks out if i try new products but this product didnt dry or cause breakouts. I like the light serum texture and its not dense. Hopefully i will see the result as i continue to use the product/</li>
    <li> I started to use the gel a week ago, I use it at night. Many things I love about it, first and foremost: is not tested on animals! It feels fruity, smells like apple sauce and my skin loves it. I&#x27;m very pleased, and I believe I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I only recieved the Vitamin C Serum, there was nothing else in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The consistency of the Serum is not thick, is more watery than anything. And the smell is not that pleasant. I used it after washing my makeup off, before going to bed. I love that the Serum is absorbed into the skin really fast. Once that happens you can&#x27;t even tell it was there. The smell also, disappears when its absorbed into the skin. Not a problem with my sensitive/oily/blemish prone skin. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Helps skin stay moist and pump. I apply while skin still moist after cleansing but before drying.</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research on anti aging products that work. Vitamin C seems to be the ingredient most recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I am 57 years old and have been using the serum and the eye gel for over a month. My crows feet around my eyes have softened and dark spots are disappearing. I use the products twice a day. The skin on my neck and decollete are also looking better.  This product delivers results as promised and the price is great!</li>
    <li> This serum has repaired my skin beyond belief! It decreases redness and leaves my skin looking refreshed. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use in a home made serum to combat acne and discolorations.  So far seems to be a good product.  Price is good too!</li>
    <li> I just freaking love this!!!</li>
    <li> Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum has definitely improved the overall look of my skin. It is a smooth serum that easily glides on and absorbs into my skin. I can feel the product working immediately after application. Over the past few weeks, I have noticed a marked difference in the reduction of discoloration on my skin. I definitely have enjoyed using this product and look forward to continued results.</li>
    <li> This serum feels so light weight! No fragrance, which is nice! Skin feels firmer!</li>
    <li> I love the serum. Makes my skin soft and I&#x27;ve finally got clear skin!</li>
    <li> So far, I feet the serum is tightening my skin, and I do see more clarity as well. I have been using it for 2 weeks at this point.</li>
    <li> Testing out this products for my husband face. Cause he&#x27;s been suffer oily skin and acne. Also with black spot. He&#x27;s report that he love the way his face look clean and smooth. Ill keep update with the news!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried one other vitamin c serum but this one is seriously amazing. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin too sticky and I feel like (and can see) that this is way more effective!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum feels good on my skin and gives my skin a nice prep for my day moisturizer or my night cream.  Also I just use a few drops so it seems to last pretty good.  I will definately use it again.</li>
    <li> I received the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Natural Collagen Boosting, Anti Aging, Anti Wrinkle Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:  Receive a free gift, Sano Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Making sure I use it everyday to achieve the optimal effect  I don&#x27;t like to admit it but I am guilty of sometimes not washing my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that hence the bonus gift being Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel, I thought why notthrow it in the fridge for an added cooling benefit.  In the morning my eyes are puffy.  After I wash my face I put on Sano Vitamin C Serum and let it dry completely.  Then I head to the fridge and pull out the Vitamin C Eye Cream Gel.  It is so cooling and refreshing when I apply it under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is easily absorbed as is the eye cream.  You can wear both under your make-up, which I do.  Their was an instant change under my eyes and my skin felt better after application.  It&#x27;s only been 4 days and I&#x27;d like to say I noticed a difference.  I am confident I will see much better results with repeated use.  I suffer from a lot of freckles, sunspots and fine lines which are all signs of pre-mature aging.  I love both of these products and hope to see continued changes in all of the above mentioned areas.  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my 100%honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This serum is a part of my daily skincare regimen, as it works wonders on my dry and sensitive skin. I love its anti aging properties as well and the results that I get from using this product has got me hooked! I am in my mid-thirties and I want to take care of my skin as best as I can, so I don’t have to worry about fine lines and wrinkles any time soon. So far, using this serum has been working like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this  wonderful product.  I have been a repeat customer 3X and have been using it for almost 2 months.  1 bottle lasts me about a month, but then I put it all over my face, neck, chest, and the backs of my hands twice a day.  I am 64 with sensitive,  pale, blotchy (brown spots, old acne scars, and redness), combination skin.  All areas I use it on have lightened and brightened quite noticeably and I am thrilled.  In addition my skin is smoother and softer.  I have used vitamin c formulas by other companies that made my sensitive skin burn or feel tingly.  But not with this serum--not one single bit even.  The serum itself  is a fragrance free, silky liquid that spreads easily.  It dries quickly and leaves no sticky film at all--I don&#x27;t even know I have it on.  Once I&#x27;ve put this on my freshly washed, toned skin, I layer on a peptide gel and then my sunscreen during the day (or retinol &amp; moisturizer at night).  It doesn&#x27;t ball up or in any way cause problems with the other products.  During the day I also put  makeup on over my products and it goes on smoothly as well (let each layer you apply dry well).  With my first two orders of the serum, I was sent a free small jar of vitamin c eye gel.  This too is a really nice product and works to add moisture under my eyes (where I have fine wrinkles and dryness). It also decreases puffiness when I&#x27;ve had too much salt.  It smooths out the eye wrinkles and once dry I put my sunscreen over it.  After that I wear my usual concealer with no problems. Sano Vitamin C serum is my favorite facial product due to ease of use and especially the marked difference it has made in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I love that it is natural and has a fair price as I&#x27;ve tried a few high end vitamin c products with much less of an effect on my skin.  It&#x27;s also highly recommended that we arm our skin with vitamin c to combat pollution and UV ray damage as well as to correct old damage.  I know nothing, not even sunscreens, can completely protect our skin, but at least we can use quality products to stay as healthy as we can.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smoother and my pores smaller. My makeup goes on easier after I use it. It is gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness like some other serums do.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing! Such a good product. Can already tell a difference. Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I just  got this in the mail I put some on my face and my skin feels so soft already looking forward to an awesome experience with this product</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of Vitamin C serum but this one is my favorite. It is clear and odorless and I definitely see results.</li>
    <li> I really like what it does to my skin. the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the odor .. probably due to the jojoba oil. however, since it does an amazing job on my skin i decided to still give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin feel so much tighter and brighter. Feels light and not tacky. You can wear it under makeup but I feel like it&#x27;s best used when used right out of the shower for max moisturization.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes the skin soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the dry weather causing my current skin irritation and not this product, since I&#x27;d really like to continue using it.</li>
    <li> this stuff feels great on the skin, and smells pretty good too. Perfect for the morning moisturizer: it&#x27;ll leave you feeling protected and smooooth.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Sano Naturals Vitamin C serum!  I have tried probably 10 other vitamin C serums and while I feel most vitamin C serums help, Sano Natural works better than most!  It definitely helps keep my skin clear and helps with the discoloration on my face from acne and sun damage.  I have spent up to $60 on other vitamin C serums and gratefully will never have to do that again as I will continue to stay with Sano Naturals.  Thank You!

    <li> This stuff works for me.. and I have tried lots of the other offers.  This is the first product I am re-buying.</li>
    <li> So far so good. been using it for a week and my skin is soft and brighter and hopefully it will start to work on my acne marks and small pimples. we&#x27;ll see. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the serum a lot. My skin looks younger, brighter and smoother. I can only recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A great product at a greater price will use the products from them from now on.  Will be a steady customer, this review is from Joan D. Holt not Jack.</li>
    <li> I am a single mother of four and been smoking more than 15 years. I have spent a lot of money on other creams and serums that just broke me out and left scars on my face. This is the only product that I have found that hasn&#x27;t broke me out. I do have sensitive skin so when I apply it I do feel it. Which only last a few seconds, but that tells me it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and I will be buying more. Best skin product out there. I recommend this product for anyone and everyone of all ages and even those with sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> Love it. Started to use it a week ago and it has really help with my redness on face.</li>
    <li> I have to say ive  been using this product since june and the results  are amazing  i would definitely  recommend and will be purchasing again and thats another thing the bottle  last as long as your cautious  of the use .... hope ive helped</li>
    <li> This is the second time I placed an order on this serum. I have been using it everyday 2 times, morning and bedtime. I have seen the difference in my skin, its more soft and supple . The serum is easily absorbed by the skin, no greasy feeling. My skin is usually oily but this serum helps and I don&#x27;t have the oily look the entire day. I have been using this serum for almost 3 months now and seen reduced lines around my mouth and forehead.</li>
    <li> This serum really helps protect and lighten my blemishes. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This serum works so well, and is gently fading the uneven skin tone on my face due to hyperpigmentation. It doesn&#x27;t burn like other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and there is a gentle exfoliation that happens. It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or cause any problems with super dry patches that hampers makeup application. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this serum!!! At 52, I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a product in a bottle or jar that would smooth out my crepey neck so noticeably!!! I started seeing results before finishing my first bottle and now I am on my second bottle. I use Sano Vitamin C serum in conjunction with a DMAE cream by Derma E and I&#x27;m just ecstatic now when I look in the mirror.  GREAT STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> One word - AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have never had dry skin before, and these past months my face was so dry and itchy, that I started getting&lt;br /&gt;red bumps and a rash... so a friend told me about SANO products and I read the review and purchased&lt;br /&gt;the Sano Hyaluronic Acid serum, and they paired this High Potency formula daily skin Revitalizer!&lt;br /&gt;and WOW!!! I used it once and my skin is AMAZING looking, NO MORE ITCHY, NO MORE RASH! and NO MORE BUMPS!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy a gallon of this if they made it... I won&#x27;t ever be with out it..</li>
    <li> I purchased the vitamin c serum daily skin revitalizer after reading the ingredients on my friends 95.00 1 oz serum. same ingredients. it has helped the dryness and dullness on my face within 3 days. I use it after cleansing and then use a little argan oil. I told my friend about the price vs. the price she paid, we went and returned her product the next day. thank you for a great product that does what it says it will do. sharon f.</li>
    <li> Excellent product -- I ordered a second bottle as the first one ran out. My skin looks more youthful and dark spots have faded.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days but I have been putting a small amount on my face after I wash it and I am already in love with it!It is so much more light weight than any cream moisturizer plus it is more natural and anti-aging, which is a win-win in my book! I will most likely be buying this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Help the spots on my face</li>
    <li> I love it! The serum absorbs quickly in the skin and makes my face feel soft and hydrated, and I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have recently started using Serums and found this one to be one of the best I love the way it makes my skin truly glow! I had some sun damage in my face and it is gone now.... I love this product</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin has always been in pretty good shape,  but since I added the vitamin c serum to my daily care, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it used to be,  and my skin is smoother. I also love how affordable it is and the fact that it actually works without it costing a fortune.</li>
    <li> love this product and the also the gel that was sent as a freebie.... I&#x27;ve tried several brands and strengths of Vitamin C serum and Sano gives me a good strength formula for an excellent price.  I&#x27;m 51 and caucasian and the Vitamin C serum makes my skin feel much more hydrated and less tired (if that makes any sense at all) Getting ready to order more.</li>
    <li> I really like your product! After several weeks of use, my facial skin is brighter and softer. I love the eye gel and appreciate the sample!</li>
    <li> I had been using very expensive products and read about the ingredients you use and how they can help with the appearance of your skin and fine wrinkles.  You folks had great reviews on Amazon so I tried your products and have been very pleased.  I can definitely see a difference in fine lines and just seem to look fresher (I get comments about it).  I love them and will continue to use them because they work and are reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> I love your product. I have been using it for a about 3 weeks and I am so happy. My face and neck is so nice and smooth. My under eyes is so smooth and I am losing lines on my face. I am super excited about this product and I will continue using it in the future.</li>
    <li> The first week I used this, my skin felt great and looked good. After that week, my skin started to break out and I had to stop using it. Once I stopped, I started breaking out less. Not sure if my skin is just too sensitive, but I was hoping it would work well since it has many good reviews. I might give it another try, but I am scared it might break me out again. The only thing I do love is the Eye Gel. Works well and my under eye area is looking good.</li>
    <li> Soak right into the skin felt like my pore appeared small after a week of use and my ance disappear.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken out my acne-prone skin. Been using for about 3 weeks now and I love it. Couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received this. It was like the same day! Maybe I am close to a fulfillment center? Idk, but thanks!</li>
    <li> Good product almost like Bellafab Serum</li>
    <li> I Loved*💖the Sano Vitamin C Serum* &amp; I will Definitely be reordering! *😄***</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time buyer of Sano products so, I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would work for me. I have very fair, oily skin with hyperpigmentation, spider veins, dark circles and am prone to severe breakouts. I was hesitant but, gave it a try! It&#x27;s been 7 days I&#x27;ve been using this particular product and can say it has a pleasant smell, the texture is liquid smooth, so it glides on easily and dries quickly. I noticed immediately I am not breaking out and my skin is Shiny and very smooth. Today I realized the lines around my eyes are not as visible anymore. I am looking forward to seeing what following weeks will show. I only wish, I would have known of their eye cream.... I&#x27;m happy with this product and it&#x27;s results thus far. I recommend this Sano product to anyone to try!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been fantastic. I purchased this for my s/o and he uses it religiously now! His skin is very vibrant and bright now. The eye gel has been lovely also. Thanks for a product that actually works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Sano Vitamin C serum on my face for over 2 months now and very pleased with the results. I love the instant tightness and glow it gives my face once I put it on, but most importantly I love what it has done to my freckles and pigmentation. I have seen considerable fading of some pregnancy induced pigmentation around my lip line as well as lightening of freckles on my cheeks and nose area. I love this product. I have been using a nickel sized amount on my face and neck area once a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum to help with my melasma. Unfortunately, after a month of using twice a day, I do not see an improvement for the dark patches on my face. However:&lt;br /&gt;- I feel my skin is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;- The serum has a pleasant neutral scent.&lt;br /&gt;- The serum is easy to use and is not too thick or too thin.&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle with included dropper is very convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have attached before (left) and after (right) pictures.</li>
    <li> Not for hydrating dry skin, but it does make my skin more firm and brighter!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this vitamin C serum. When I use it regularly, I do notice that my skin has a more even tone and a glow to it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! My skin was starting to get very dry from all the swimming I was doing this summer, and from the first day I tried this product I can feel my skin rev up! The eye cream smells like cucumbers to me when I try it on, which makes me feel refreshed. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple vitamin C serums here on Amazon. They all have similar ingredients and packaging. I keep coming back to this one because I like the price and the consistency is a little thicker (not watery) than some others. I find this to be most effective when applied to clean dry skin (cleanse, allow skin to dry, apply this before any other products, allow to dry)</li>
    <li> great service! great product!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this item along with the vitamin c eye serum back in November 2014 and again in March 2015. I love these products! I also purchased one for a friend. I am in my late forties and my sisters friends thought I was in my twenties! Awsome stuff! It makes my skin feel silky smooth and refreshed. I have always had oily skin and this product works well with that. Plus it will work well with all skin types!</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a difference after a week of using this product.  My skin feels firmer and smoother.  I use it after cleansing my face and under my moisturizer.  In the morning, my face is glowing like never before.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this along with the Halyuronic Acid Serum and the eye cream.... Loving it!!!  My skin looks a bit brighter and very clear and much younger!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like sticks dried leaves and weeds. Was concerned if allergic reaction but nothing happened. Just don&#x27;t like smell. Doesn&#x27;t hydrate like put Hyaluronic acid. Looks like cloudy water. Not sure doing anything after several weeks. Not impressed yet.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works well and very easy to use.  Makes your skin soft and radiant!</li>
    <li> Seems like it does it&#x27;s job. The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market. At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away. The color of my skin seems to be improving and the spots on my cheeks are going away.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is the smell, but it goes away fast.</li>
    <li> This product seems like a pretty standard vitamin C serum -- nothing special, but it&#x27;s a good price so one wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.  My only criticisms would be the opaque color (which doesn&#x27;t really matter much, it&#x27;s just not as aesthetically appealing) and also the vague herby smell, which is still preferable to the overwhelming citrus smell some serums have.  I use this in the morning and save my more decadent, expensive vitamic C serum for night time.  This stuff is a great deal for the cost.</li>
    <li> Used product for the first time today.  My skin felt smoother and firmer right away.  Love that it has no scent.</li>
    <li> a little pricey other vendors have twice the amount for the same price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Vitamin C Serum. It has done wonders for my skin. After two weeks, I could see the difference. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too light and I have to wear lotion on top of it. However, I definitely feel and see the difference with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have noticed great results in my skin and will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I noticed that it helps with the fine lines and age spots are fading.  I had an accident and had road rash on my face and I think it really did help heal it faster by putting this on it.  I am glad I purchased this and my other serum (hyaluronic acid) as well.  Thanks Sano!</li>
    <li> I use to work in the cosmetic industry and the one thing I&#x27;ve learned is that these products go a long way and you don&#x27;t need to pour it on your skin.  I use this product religiously every morning on my face, neck and chest...and hands when I can remember to put it on after washing them.  I store it in a dark drawer and out of the heat and I make sure the lid is firmly secure.  I don&#x27;t leave it open very long.  It has a cloudy look but that&#x27;s normal for these serums...brown is the color you don&#x27;t want and it was probably due to shipping or storage conditions.  In other words, don&#x27;t get an order shipped to you mid-Summer when you know it will be sitting in your hot mailbox!  Anyways, it has a light slimy texture but absorbs quickly leaving skin smooth and ready for moisturizing.  You will have to rub a layer of skin off every other morning/night!  It&#x27;s an exfoliant!  If you don&#x27;t lightly exfoliate your skin, the dead skin...not the product...will dry and clog your pores!  You have to do the maintenance.  Use a soft facial brush or a non abrasive facial cloth or just your hands to gently rub your wet skin.  I usually wash first and then find that I can rub my fingers in a circular motion to remove the dead skin.  Your skin feels absolutely wonderful afterwards!  If you have sensitive skin, use with caution!  Remember WHAT this product does!  It exfoliates!  But I&#x27;d recommend this product to most people without sensitivities.  As for SANO?  I don&#x27;t know much about this company but I do like the feel of the ingredients they use.  It appears comparable if not exceeds the expensive brands I use to sell.  The company appears to be what it says.  With so many Vit C serums popping up after the airing on Dr Oz, I researched each company first then looked at the ingredients and then price.  SANO has provided a high quality product at an affordable price.  I&#x27;ll buy it and the eye gel again...esp before our summer heat starts up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product will differently buy again.</li>
    <li> great source of vitamin c for face and neck.</li>
    <li> I use this serum religiously to keep my skin looking young and diminish wrinkles. Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is the best. Follow up with a moisturizer after application, however; it does cause dead skin cells to slough.</li>
    <li> Love it. So great for my skin .  This makes your skin so soft !  I&#x27;m excited about it !</li>
    <li> So its been a month and a half since ive used this and i&#x27;m i got a fee drops left.. So far so good. My husband notice a difference after using this product. Though its a slow progress, but it does work. I use this twice a day with or without makeup.....oh 1 thing i noticed is that it keeps your face smooth after the product is set, like a primer smooth kind of.  Recommend it? YES!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Use it every night and sometimes in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have very delicate skin and rosacea and this liquid has made a major impact and change in my skin. Not only has it toned down the redness but it also prevented breakouts and provided a nice glow. It has also softened my small amount of age lines and the eye cream has significantly reduced my bags and dark circles. There is n need to use more than twice a day which allows this bottle to last over a month. Be sure to syore out of the light and heat to prevent inactivating it. All together I would recommend this to any woman with any skin type.</li>
    <li> I was using vitamin C serum from a different company and have just started with Sano Vitamin C Serum and the Sano is really great.  It feel great and I can already tell it is good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  I have researched vitamin c serum&#x27;s quit a bit, and I have ttied many. I rated this product at a five because Sano&#x27;s offers every ingrediant recommended for glowing skin in one bottle and offers it at a resonable price.  The serum goes on smooth , quickly absorbs, and my face feels soft not sticky.  I use it at night and have noticed an increase in my skin&#x27;s moisture and tone.</li>
    <li> I just finished using all of this product and am planning to re-order. I had never used a vitamin C serum serum before so have no other similar product to compare it to but semi-regular use really seemed to help my overall completion. The serum is odorless, which I also liked, and very thin, absorbing into the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I just received this item, so it&#x27;s too early to report on the results.  But I am excited because it does not include any drying ingredients (unlike my last &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; hyaluronic serum that contained alcohols) and is made from natural and organic ingredients.  I am expecting great things!  I&#x27;ll update in a month.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it every day. It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Sano vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s the best Serum I have used and will buy it again. My face has a brighter glow and my wrinkle are not as deep. You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied with this product!!</li>
    <li> I just received your product and I&#x27;ve only used it twice - but my face felt so much smoother after one application!  I&#x27;ll update my review in 30 days but it looks very promising.</li>
    <li> Love this!!&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
    <li> This product literally came in a few days!&lt;br /&gt;So far loving it, there is no scent and it is quickly absorbed into the skin within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Price is so affordable, especially how much product you get!</li>
    <li> Great product and will be recommending to others.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I like it a lot. It goes on very light beneath my moisturizer and the vitamin C is important to fight free radical from the sun. I recommend this serum for anyone, especially sun babies!</li>
    <li> I am a serum addict. As soon as this came I had to try it. It is super silky. My face looks already like it loves this serum. It gave me a little glow!!! I can already tell this is a superior serum. Also I love that you just need a drop for your whole face. The bottle is also dark amber to preserve the precious serum. This is the serum I am  sticking with. Omg also the price...perfect. It came packaged well too. Well Sano it looks like I found my perfect vitamin c serum. I look forward now to trying other products from your company. I love this one so much already. I just looked up other products to try. Please take it from me. I am 41 going on 29. This has the perfect amount of vitamin c 20 percent along with hyrlaunic acid. Perfect!! Use this serum let it dry then your favorite day and night cream. In just a few weeks your skin will be thanking you and your fine lines will be diminished. Also dark marks from the sun acne etc. Little miracle bottle. Thank you Sano for this wonderful product at such a great price. I will be a loyal customer</li>
    <li> This is a very effective anti-wrinkle serum. I can actually see and feel my skin tighten, lift, and appear glowing, full, healthy. I pair this with several diffferent moisturizers, and the serum works equally well with each one I use. An excellent addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Items were delievered on time. My son loves the sleeky look of the ipod. Just started using the serum and looking forward to a revitalized,  glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I love both of these products! They work very well together. My skin feels very smooth and even has a glow to it. I would highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell the results but the product does not seem to irritate my skin.  I do like the eye gel., very cool and refreshing.  Hope to see improved results over time.</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  The seri feels so good on my face and I really like the eye serum also. I highly recommend this product to anyone that Loves to take care of their skin.  Great price and always Love a bonus with it. I will continue to buy this product and I enjoy seeing the results.  Thank You Sano for quality skin care at sm affordable price.  Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> I would love to give you all my opinion on Sano Naturals’ Vitamin C Serum 20%. I have been using this product 2 to 3 times a day on my skin and I have been noticing a major difference. I am a licensed Esthetician so I have a vast knowledge on skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum 20% has a great list of ingredients, the most amazing being of course the Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C: Helps fight the signs of aging by brightening up the skin, fights free radicals, helps combat dryness &amp; collagen loss.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid: despite it’s name, it does NOT hurt it actually feels very soothing to the skin. Hyaluronic Acid binds 1,000 times it’s weight in water, so it helps moisturize the skin, and it helps drive products down deeper into the different layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil: this is the closest oil to the skin’s natural sebum. It is VERY good for the skin, great for moisturizing, and it won’t clog your pores!&lt;br /&gt;My opinion:&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin year round, so Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum 20% is the perfect product for me. I cleanse my skin, tone, and apply the serum all over my face, neck, and decollete, then I follow up with my regular moisturizer. Adding a moisturizer on top is NOT a necessary step, for most people the serum would be amazing on it’s own, but my skin is so dry I add it as an extra measure. The Vitamin C Serum has made my skin wonderfully soft and smooth, as well as feeling moisturized. My skin looks bright and supple, this serum is in my daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a dark colored bottle, and has a little dropper attached so you squeeze the perfect amount into your fingertips to apply it to the skin. The serum is a little watery feeling, but as soon as it touches your skin it’s instantly absorbed! Also it has no harsh scent!&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking to prevent the signs of aging, or give your skin a refresh try Sano Naturals Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;So far so good&amp;#34;. I have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. Since it is my first time using it though, I use it every other day. A little bit goes a long way and it is very easy to put on.I like the way my face looks and feels. I started using this because I am 53 &amp; asked my doctor what is best to use &amp; he said a high concentration of vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference as of yet.</li>
    <li> Love Vitamin C serum and this one was the cheapest while still being potent. The Vit Eye cream gel was a nice bonus, be aware though it&#x27;s very small!</li>
    <li> Great, it works fast an well</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product.  Great price and I just love it!  I can feel the benefits right away!  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again!</li>
    <li> This serum is refreshing. It leaves my skin feeling radiant and smooth. I love how it evens out my skin tone. I would highly suggest this item to anyone really! Vitamin C has become my favorite part of my skin care routine! I appreciate the company sending it to me to try out!</li>
    <li> Thank you!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Good product, absorbs nicely on skin. No fragraces or sticky tacky feeling. I see a difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> I love the  eye cream, works beautiful.It really has a wake me up  effect in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Serum i wish the texture would be a little different. It absorb in the skin very quickly, but seems a little dry.&amp;#60; Maybe  it will be a good summer  serum?&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Over all good products with GREAT price . Will  buy  again</li>
    <li> I Love this product, but my skin is dry and while the vitamin C Serum is great, it is also drying; So after doing a lot of research I decided to order Sano Naturals Phytoceramides 350 mg Plant Derived Ceramide Capsules. The capsules help the skin build moisture and elasticity from within. I have only been taking them for two weeks and am already beginning to notice some results. I am confident as I continue to use the two together the improvements will be more and more noticeable. Since I have lost quite a bit of weight over the past few years,, my skin needs this boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add to this review every week or two to update everyone on my progress.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that this is a quality product, but I have a sensitive nose and I hate the smell of this Vitamin C Serum. The bonus eye ointment has an unusual smell, but not offensive to me the way the Serum is, I&#x27;ll use it, but I&#x27;m giving the Serum away. It may be the Jojoba oil or maybe the way it reacts to my body chemistry, either way I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I found this product helpful to my skin. It tightens pores and firms areas around the eyes. I will order more.</li>
    <li> I have older skin and have noticed a nice glow and smoother appearance while using this. I would recommend and keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and am amazed at the results.  My skin feels soft and supple with a noticeable reduction in fine lines.  It absorbs into the skin right away without heaving a greasy or heavy feeling.  I love the eye gel as well.  The price is right for such a beneficial and great product. It arrived in a very timely fashion and I have highly recommended it to family and friends alike. I will be purchasing more of this product in the future.  The components are all natural and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon Lewis</li>
    <li> Verry happy with this product, will be buying again. Can tell a difference  in the look and feel of my skin in just a few days.</li>
    <li> This serum dried my skin out very badly, and I&#x27;m not sure why since I regularly use vitamin C serum. I returned this for a full refund.</li>
    <li> The product is very silky and feels good on my skin. Results seem promising as I notice slight lightening of hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast. Came in with a freebie an eye cream. I&#x27;m not sure this product will lighten my skin but it does make it radiant and soft.</li>
    <li> This product has made a big difference in my skin texture and overall appearance. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, I recommend you leave your skin damp before applying.  When I first tried it my skin felt like paper afterward and I was going to stop but I decided to do some research.  I leave my skin damp, place a drop on forehead, cheeks, chin, and throat, wait a few minutes and then apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I will update after two weeks use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised to find this product added hydration,  and soft brightness.  I use this product with trader joes spf moisturizer and lumiere eye cream for a complete daily regimen</li>
    <li> I read several reviews for different products and decided on this one.  The first time i tried it i knew i made a great purchase and wondered why i waited so Long.  I always use it twice a day and noticed immediate subirle results,  cant wait to see how 30 days goes...</li>
    <li> This arrived on time, and I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a really nice scent, and it feels light on your skin. It didn&#x27;t break me out, yet still moisturized my skin and made my complexion brighter. Over time, I&#x27;ve noticed that it fades my sunspots and makes me look less like a corpse in the mornings (lol). So all in all, a good buy.</li>
    <li> After using this product for only 2 days, I immediately felt and saw results. I am a 40 year old female that does not wear much make up and tends to have an oily/dry/flakey face. Since January I have ordered 5 bottles and shared 3 of them with family and friends for them to try for themselves, it&#x27;s THAT great! The first thing I noticed was the texture and hydration of my skin was immediate, after about a week of daily use I started to see a difference in the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I have also asked my teenage kids (19 &amp; 14) to try this on their face....WOW!! It does wonders for teenage acne as well! I wish I had this product 25 years ago. I have also &amp;#34;let&amp;#34; my husband use it on his face and he loves it as well. I would recommend this product to ANYONE and will have to stock up on it before everyone is buying it and the price goes up, yikes! Thank you, Sano Naturals!</li>
    <li> Didnt see a difference in my skin at all. The dropper bottle is very cloudy color and has a strange odour smell of expired product. I did not get the results as stated by the many reviews below. Im sure they got the product for free and thus they returned with a glowing 5 star review to compensate. Not happy with the product and fake reviews!</li>
    <li> Love the Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the Sano Vitamin C Serum for a few months now and love it.  It glides on my face with no unpleasant smell - and never feels sticky or heavy.  I do feel like it is helping to diminish the small brown age spots that come with being 68 years old.  I liked the product so much I ordered a 2nd time to give to my 43 year old daughter - believing she should start with the product to avoid problems in the future.  I’m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Used this product  for 1 week and already fee diff in skin tone!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with the SANO Vitamin C Serum for men or women. I just started the product and love the results so far. It is by far one of the best skin revitalizers I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum and I can already tell a difference in the quality of my skin. My skin already looks and feels smoother and more vibrant and I think I appear more rested in my face. The great thing about this serum is that it is light and absorbs beautifully. I personally use it after I shower/wash my face in the morning and before I apply make-up, and have not experienced any issues with how well my make-up goes on. I have also used it at night too before bed after I have removed my makeup and it&#x27;s also great. I look forward to continue to use this serum as part of my daily skin care/anti-aging regimen. I am definitely a fan of Sano!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am very happy with the Sano Vitamin C Serum 20%.  I am starting on my 3rd bottle now.  Thank you in advance for the free bottlte</li>
