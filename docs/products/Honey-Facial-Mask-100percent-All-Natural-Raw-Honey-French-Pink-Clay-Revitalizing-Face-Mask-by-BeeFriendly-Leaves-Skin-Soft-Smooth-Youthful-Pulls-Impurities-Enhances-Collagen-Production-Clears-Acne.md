<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does feel good for a mask! A tiny bit of water helps putting it on. After rinsing off face feels good. I&#x27;m not young looking again or beautiful but smells good to me . Shipped in good time. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Really liked the results, my completion looked good and my skin was softer. Would reccomend an application brush be used with product it&#x27;s pretty sticky and does not dry hard like some other masks I have used.</li>
    <li> Made my skin very soft and smooth....Love Bee Friendly moisturizers as well:)</li>
    <li> This Honey mask makes my skin super soft. I do it twice a week.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so fresh and younger than before I began using Bee Friendly products. I&#x27;m a huge fan! Treat yourself to an at home facial that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very smooth and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Love all of the BeeFriendly products! I have super dry peeling in the winter skin and they are lifesavers. The mask was a little drippy, but what do you expect, it contains honey! Will be a long time customer, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have one of the most ridiculously sensitive skin, rosacea, eczema, and have tried countless masks and brands to keep my skin calmed and this brand has been by far the best one I have ever tried!! I am a model so I have access to all the &amp;#34;best products&amp;#34; on the market and depend on my image to work and I can say that no mask has ever left my skin so soft, smooth and calmed without causing any irritations! Absolutely love it and will recommend it to every one! I especially love the fact that is all natural, organic and I can actually understand all the ingredients on the label! It smells so good and the whole experience makes you feel ever better than after a spa treatment! I recommend all of the products! The serum, eye and face cream, lip balm! Love love!</li>
    <li> I used this immediately when it arrived.  Smells nice, and it left my skin looking bright and clean and soft.  Since it doesn&#x27;t harden, you do have to watch how much you put on, or it will drip.  I had to keep wiping to keep it from running in my eyes and mouth, but now that I have a feel for it, I will apply less next time.  Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it! It has really helped clear up his acne.&lt;br /&gt;It is very sticky, so remember to use a little hot water to thin it out. I will continue to&lt;br /&gt;buy this product</li>
    <li> I love this Honey mask!  All of the ingredients are great for our skin and with them mixed together in this Facial Mask it&#x27;s amazing! This is made with Raw Hawaiian Wildflower Honey and other Organic ingredients. It really doesn&#x27;t get any better than this, I would recommend to anyone looking for a great facial mask.</li>
    <li> Received product very promptly.  Applied soon after receiving it.  Left my skin feeling new, smooth and radiant.  A very important aspect for me is that this mask is an all natural and organic. I stopped using chemicals in most or all of the products I purchase, and this one smells and feels very natural so much that I had to literally taste a little.  I do not recommend doing so as it is not part of the directions!  However, based on my own experience all the products that are really natural and organic, taste and smell all natural, duh!  I will update if anything changes after subsequent use, but so far I love my new mask!</li>
    <li> The most wonderful product ever. Period!&lt;br /&gt;The Bee Friendly skincare has changed my skin. It is no longer the same. Grateful for this wonderful honey product</li>
    <li> This mask is really good. It is very sticky because of the honey, so be careful!  My face was smooth, pores tightened after one use. The ingredients are fabulous. Thank you for a great new product.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy. I saw a quick results just my the softness of my skin. I will be trying their other products as well. Great customer service, they sent me a nice product info email</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  After only one use, it cleared up a trouble spot on the chin by the end of the day. No joke.  I will NEVER be without this product from here on out and will buy this product to give as gifts to others.  Leaves skin soft and glowing and makeup looks gorgeous when put on afterwards.  Going to check out the other Bee Friendly Skincare products.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! The texture is thick and sticky, the smell is so pure and rich. I used this at night after showering and cleaning my face, left it on my face for 15 minutes and once I washed it off, my face felt so smooth, like a baby&#x27;s! Great product.</li>
    <li> I have never used a honey mask, but I am definitely buying this again. Corrects uneven tones, tightens, brightens, it&#x27;s magical stuff!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! After using it for the first time today, my skin feels so much softer, smoother and firmer. The tone also looked brighter and more even. Is it my imagination, or do the wrinkles looked better, too??? It was a bit of a gloppy, sticky mess putting it on, (and really messed up the white washcloth I used to wash it off), but smelled, and even tasted good when I got a bit on my lips washing it off. With all the natural, organic ingredients, I feel good putting it on my skin. I really love how my skin feels after one use, and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> Like the other products, I am very happy!  Noticeable hydration after just one use.  So happy I found this brand.</li>
    <li> I really love this honey mask. It is real honey, and smells delicious. I bought it because the product has a really good customer reputation, and I have to say that I am not disappointed. The mask looks exactly like in the picture, and is very thick. If you taste it, it is actually sweet; I have to try really hard to convince myself not to just eat it lol. When I apply it to my face, I usually add a little bit water because it is so thick. I usually massage it around my face a little bit too. The mask feels very nutritious. I know it said I should wash it off after 15-20 min, I usually just forget about it and leave it on for maybe 40 min because not like other masks, it does not suck your face dry when it dries up. I can really feel the difference when I wash it off though! My face feels a lot more elastic and watery afterwards. I use another face mask that is a dead sea mud mask from Instanatural at nights I am not using this one; although I don&#x27;t know which one did more work, my skin feels a lot more fine and smooth, and my acnes have reduced so much! This is the first time in about 2 years! I am really happy and I absolutely love this mask. I will definitely buy it again and I 100% recommend it. FIVE STAR~!</li>
    <li> Well, I wanted to try it a few times before I write a review.  It&#x27;s very nice and as other reviewers have said; it gives your skin/face a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 60 and it&#x27;s always nice to find a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with this jar and I found it to be too messy for me. It did not affect my skin: I saw no improvement nor any irritation. It seems to be made by a great company and I like the organic nature of the product, but it&#x27;s just not for me. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I can see the result - my skin loves this mask,</li>
    <li> Love this. Takes away the impurities out of your pores. I use it 3 times a week. Keeps those pesky break-outs at bay!</li>
    <li> Love this mask! Skin felt so smooth and glowing after use. Great product! Will continue to purchase from the Bee Friendly line.</li>
    <li> A great mask, it really clarifies the skin, love the fact it is completly natural. What I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s very sticky consistency, does not glide easily on my skin. But more important, the results are very good, and I&#x27;m using it 1x a week.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product as a gift for my wife. She really enjoys it. Will definitely reorder product.</li>
    <li> It is okay.  Haven&#x27;t really seen any great benefits.  It is very messy to use.  You should use it before a shower and rinse it off in the shower.  It smells nice.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the mask as a pore cleanser and potentially as a replacement for my moisturizering mask. I didn&#x27;t realize how small is 2oZ, it almost the same size with my eye cream, so as soon as I finally found it in the parcel box, I&#x27;ve realized that it should be a real magic to worth the price. It does moisture and smooth well, but not better than my $10 moisturizing mask, which is also ten times easier to apply. Also this mask didn&#x27;t clean my pores at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the mask because of 5-star rating and great reviews, but honestly I don&#x27;t understand how is this 5-star mask. It&#x27;s pricy if you think of the size and inconviniet to apply, but doesn&#x27;t do any extraordinary job. Good, but far from excellent.</li>
    <li> love this new product. It has the moisturizing benefits of honey, with the clarifying benefits of a mud or clay mask. When removing this mask I use my wet hands and as you work the product off it has little granules , so you get exfoliation at the same time. As with any honey based mask- make sure to keep your hair away from the face because its sticky!!!</li>
    <li> This product is pure goodness!  Have used it since receiving it and after one application I truly did see a difference in my skin.  It is very gentle, leaves my skin soft, but taut and rinses off immediately!  So grateful to be introduced to it!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my honey mask. I am a mature gal (age 63) !  and was not sure if this mask would be beneficial at my age. My skin looked clean and bright after the 1st use. I have dry skin and this mask was very nourishing. It is still too soon to tell if it will help with the wrinkles and sag but i am hopeful. It felt amazing</li>
    <li> Have only used once as have not had for long but face felt very soft after using look forward to more results with time. TY!</li>
    <li> I tried this face mask first on my hand to ensure no allergic reaction. Aside from being clear of any reaction, it left my skin baby soft and smelling delish! I then tried it on my face with the same results. This is a keeper in your beauty arsenal for a price that is affordable. I will be getting this product again!</li>
    <li> IT works great on all skin types! Makes me our skin feel fresh!</li>
    <li> This is worth the price. My minor forehead break out, which looked like it was going to develop into something not-so-minor, cleared up after one application and my face has stayed acne-free and smooth for a week since. Yes, it&#x27;s gooey. It does not dry. It&#x27;s sticky and not like a mud mask, but no mud mask ever made any noticeable difference to my skin. Bee Friendly Skin Care is doing something right, apparently, and I&#x27;d rather spend a little more on products that do what they say they will, than waste it on junk that produces no results. I&#x27;m putting their eye-serum on my wish list!</li>
    <li> Love it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Ok first off let me say how many amazing benefits there are for using raw honey on your skin. It is amazing for healing. I could get deep into this subject but its a great antibiotic. My daughter had a breakout on her face. Used this, her face looked 95% better after using it. The redness on her forehead was almost gone. It is a bit sticky and thick. But its honey. It smells so amazing. Heck, I am sure you could even taste if you want. But I didn&#x27;t taste it. When using the mask it feels so soothing. And after taking it off your skin actually feels tighter and I saw a reduction in pores on my nose. I have huge pores. This was a plus for me. Your skin is left feeling so smooth. I just wish this was a bigger container of this stuff. Because it&#x27;s amazing. I will be getting more of this for sure. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for inspection and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Amazing mask recommended for every girl she wants a clean skin and feeling refresh</li>
    <li> Goopy, Gloppy Gold!!  This stuff is amazing!!  I recommend using it in the shower when your face is clean and damp (not wet). It is very sticky to get on otherwise.  After using this for the first time, my face was so smooth and soft.  My pores were noticeably smaller and the texture and color even - so much so that I wore about 1/2 the make-up I usually wear.  My skin glows after I use this...I&#x27;m addicted!!  ...and I love the fact that there are no chemicals! It&#x27;s all natural good stuff!</li>
    <li> 100% Organic Honey Mask leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When opening this I noticed there was no overpowering smell like some organic facial mask have which is great because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  The application process is easy once you get the hang of smoothing it evenly onto your warm dampened skin.  The warmer my hands were the easier the mask seemed to apply. It does not take much to cover your face/neck area.  With have a generous 2 ounces, this will last quite a while.  It never hardened or caked up, just stayed the same and was very easy to wipe up with warm water and my washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and dry my skin, I was amazed at how smooth my skin was.  My skin dry still dry and cracked from winter the cold windy months here in PA.  The mask just took away all the dryness, soothed the cracks and left my skin feeling tighter with smaller pores.  I&#x27;m so please I received this to review as a promotion for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using and recommend to my friends and family.  Knowing you can get this type of result from an all natural, 100 % organic product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am a fan of all the BeeFriendly skin care products and this facial honey mask is no exception. Just as a warning, this mask is VERY sticky and will not dry. It goes on thick and is full of nourishing ingredients for your skin. It leaves skin soft and refreshed. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the facial creams from BeeFriendly &amp; this product is another winner....leaves your skin feeling clean &amp; soft.....</li>
    <li> This product really leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and clean. It smells like honey, not surprisingly and I love the fact that it has no chemicals or fillers and is not tested on animals. I look forward to using it for some time.</li>
    <li> I love the way this mask made my face feel.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and the ingredients are amazing.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the consistency of the honey mask, it is like putting real honey on your face, but the real surprise came when I washed off the mask, my skin looked tighter and even younger, I was very excited , I want to use it every night, just after one use I could tell a difference in my skin, I think it was brighter and younger looking.</li>
    <li> I like this mask but it does have some downsides.  You will definitely need to have a wet face to apply properly.  Very sticky and dries very sticky so don&#x27;t TOUCH it.  After rinse I followed up with my regular toner and I noticed it was a lot of residue left on my cleansing pad so I had to use two instead of the usually one pad.</li>
    <li> my skin looked good afterwards, but the application was very messy</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Raw honey is so good for your skin, and they add lots of great natural ingredients to make it even better. It does take a little getting used to, but just be careful not to use too much and you&#x27;ll be happy. I used it before an event and it really made my skin glow.</li>
    <li> This is so far my favorite face mask. I have been using clay for my face for each time I do it, my face feels dry. The honey mask does not do that. It leaves my face smooth hydrated and it is very easy to rinse off. I also do not have to worry about clogging the pipes with this one. I have been using this for a while now and I am very happy with it. Great product plus it&#x27;s organic. love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff has totally done a 180 for my skin! I use it everyday and especially after I shave. It takes away my acne, the redness, smooths everything out and makes it look more youthful! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to any of the ingredients but my skin does get really red and burn but it&#x27;s more of a tingling sensation. It all goes away within the hour and it seriously looks so much better after that. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more regardless because it&#x27;s my miracle cream!</li>
    <li> It must be good but to me it is too sticky and hard to apply to face evenly. I will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> By far, hands down the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I always do a mask after shaving and this honey facial mask goes on easily and after ten minutes you wipe it off and go on to use toner and moisturizer.  My skin glows after using this product.</li>
    <li> For a facial mask it&#x27;s really quite good! If there&#x27;s a smell to it it&#x27;s fine(I don&#x27;t smell anything) You need a tiny bit of water to apply it well. Your face will feel so good when rinsed off. Do I look younger? Nah. Age is a thing that happens but if it feels and smells good and you like it go for it!</li>
    <li> Great mask ! It feels so good after I use it. I recommend all of their products!</li>
    <li> 1 of Best Facial Mask - 100% All Natural Raw Honey Revitalizing Face Mask by BeeFriendly, Deep Cleansing Formula Pulls Impurities, Stimulates Cell Regenera Arrived on time and I immediately opened the product and applied it to my face per the directions.  I will say that even though I don&#x27;t have immediate notes to tell you I can say that my face feels refreshed and tinglie. I absolutely love the way this feels on my skin.  Seriously some dripped into my lip and dang it it was eatable (hahahaha) Seriously my face, after 7 hours after application is amazing feeling I can&#x27;t wait to put on another mask.  I have posted it on my instagram jewel_jensen if you want to laugh a little  I have no quams about showing the process of beauty Thankyou .  I will update you in the future with my thoughts on this product.  It arrived on time and was in good order upon receiving this product.  Thank you  J Jensen</li>
    <li> I love that it is all natural!  I have only used mine one time, but I love the way it made my face feel.  I will use again.</li>
    <li> I applied it, and left it on for 15 minutes. The smell is a little strong, but you don&#x27;t smell it as much as it dries.It doesn&#x27;t get hard and itchy like a mud mask. Make sure not to get it in your hair. Once I washed it off, my skin felt really smooth. I tend to get some dry skin under my chin, and even that felt softer. I can&#x27;t comment on the cell renewal since this was my first time using it. I may update after I have used it longer.</li>
    <li> Just used the Facial Honey Mask and I love the results. My skin is so soft. You only need a small amount,  so I&#x27;m sure it will last awhile. However, before I finish this jar I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mask. It left my skin feeling soft and looking smooth and dewy. It felt nice on my skin and was easy to remove. I felt my pores looked smaller and my skin had a more refined look. My lines and wrinkles looked smoother and my skin had a glow that gave a more youthful appearance. I definitely want to try more of the products in the Bee Friendly product line as I am so pleased with this and the eye and face cream.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely love bee Friendly&#x27;s products I recently purchased  the facial mask. I love it! My face feels amazing after just one uses. We oils highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The mask is creamy, smells very pleasant and because it&#x27;s made with honey it does not &amp;#34;harden&amp;#34;.  It is not abrasive on my skin so I find that I use it often. allowing it to smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like how gentle this mask is -- it&#x27;s super-moisturizing, with a pleasant, clean smell. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This mask is great for making my skin feel really clean and balanced (not oily or dry). Makes your face feel really smooth! Also I use the night cream and serum from this brand and I really love this company and the real naturalness (not the fake &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; marketing that most companies use). It just makes me feel good to know that I&#x27;m not putting things on my face that are bad for me.</li>
    <li> I have used the mask twice and I am very pleased how radiant and soft my skin feels.  It is the best mask that I have used.  Make sure that your skin is moist and the mask will apply easily.  I recommend this product and I will continue to purchase the honey mask.</li>
    <li> One of the best facial masks I&#x27;ve ever tried!!  My skin loved it!!  Thank you Bee Friendly!!  I love you!!</li>
    <li> Love this Honey Facial Mask. The smell is amazing. It is easy to apply and easy to take off. My face feel so smooth afterward. Thank You</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this new product! It is a bit thick if you do not use with enough water on your face but once you get it on it is very easy to spread. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin, which happens with most other masks. Once removed, my face was so soft and squeaky clean. Please do not ever stop making this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I apply it during a nice soaking bath and leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes. It is very sticky, so watch out! It makes my facial skin very smooth and noticeably softer. Also, I accidentally got some on my lips and it tastes good too! And also, this WILL stain your washcloth. I used a white one and bleach in the washer didn&#x27;t get the stain out.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Skin feels so soft afterwards.  :)</li>
    <li> I do love Bee Friendly products. However this mask is very thick and difficult to smooth over your face.  I mixed with a bit of water, and it was much easier to use the second time.  I do, however really like their products.</li>
