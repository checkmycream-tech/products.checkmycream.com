      <li>I do have a goatee, and without some kind of maintenance it can get unruly and</li>
      <li>I tried it on my beard and it feels like a nice conditioner</li>
      <li>/&gt;*This was sent for review in exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that Mr. Rugged Beard Balm works well in styling my pony tale and keeping the seven or eight hairs involved nicely matted together.  </li>
      <li>I am a Barber and own my own shop so a well groomed beard is a MUST.</li>
      <li>so I do not have a beard, but when I was offered this beard balm at no cost for an unbiased &amp; honest product review I accepted.</li>
      <li>Hairs behaved as they should, since it softens the beard making fly away beard hair easy to shape and style into a neat healthy appearance.</li>

      <li>Its smell still more stronger than he would like,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my beard and mustache for about two weeks now and really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is an interesting product, one I&#x27;d never tried before so when I offered a sample for review I accepted with curiosity.</li>
      <li>To me it is okay.</li>
      <li>The smell is okay</li>
      <li>and it took 40 seconds of rubbing before 90% of them were dissolved, which made the balm even more greasy.</li>
      <li>to value, the jar size is more than generous.  </li>
      <li>For best results, avoid beard balms using synthetic sealants like petroleum jelly as they may irritate your skin and damage facial hair.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite beard balms.</li>

      <li>Adding just a dab of Mr. Rugged Beard Balm after a shower, then rubbing it through, tends to smooth things nicely and keep my beard from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it works better damp).</li>
      <li>/&gt;The balm has a creamy consistency (think of a more gel-like Noxzema) that you massage into your face and beard.</li>
      <li>Two applications and looking much better already.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, so does my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most distinctive and enjoyable part of the balm is the scent.</li>

      <li>so I need more product to work it all in</li>
      <li>So I like balms better than the oils.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smooths the beard smells great!</li>
    <li> Strange hard white tiny balls inside that show up all over your beard and even fall out to your shirt. This stuff is odd. It is super soft, unlike wax. It is white with not much of a smell at all. It is VERY oily feeling but when you scoop some out you will feel tiny hard balls that are part of the ingredients and these do not dissolve or go away. They sit in your beard. I put this balm in and I was asked \\&quot;what are all of those white things in your beard, and on your shirt\\&quot;? I look down and see white dots all over my black T shirt and in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is weak, the stuff is super greasy and oily feeling and the white dots/balls or whatever they are are horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After this review went live I received an email from the company explaining a few things. 1st they told me this is in no way a wax or meant to replace a wax. It is a conditioner only. While they say it will style and tame a beard, what they really mean is it will often it and condition it. I was told the gritty white balls needed to be rubbed between my hands 1st to dissolve them. I tried this and it took 40 seconds of rubbing before 90% of them were dissolved, which made the balm even more greasy. I applied it on day #2 and this time it was much better. Added a shine and managed the beard nicely. No balls this time. As for the smell, I really can not smell it at all and neither can my wife or friends. When I pass around the jar one friends said \\&quot;I can smell something but its very slight\\&quot;. So for me, there is no smell. Not good, not bad. Almost no scent. To those saying it has a scent, I must have gotten a weird batch with white balls and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN any case I will keep using it until my jar is empty and if I like it I will re-purchase. I do like it much better after I was informed about the grit/balls. I think they should spell this out in the instructions..unless, as I said, I got a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review went from 2 stars to 4.</li>
    <li> I would describe myself as a beard bulimic, with the primary motivation to sport one driven entirely by my laziness and reluctance to shave regularly. For the same reason, I wore a full beard for years but also am admittedly too narcissistic to accept the natural greyness of it now when it makes me look my actual age (or older) but not hypocritical enough to dye it. However, I have these episodes of clarity where I try to convince myself get over myself and grow out the full beard and then the itchiness/ skin irritation takes center stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard balm, with a consistency quite comparable to pure cocoa butter and applied in essentially the same manner works very well to provide a degree of relief. Grey hairs seem to have a mind of their own, wandering off in any direction they so please. This application has softened them as well as making them easier to control and style with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides for me are, compared to some other products, the beard balm results in a filmy residue that can stain shirt collars if not fully massaged into skin and follicles and the balm a has light fruity fragrance I don&#x27;t care for but it does rapidly fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for evaluation.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I love it. Enough said!</li>
    <li> The best beard balm ever!  I can&#x27;t say how much I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  I have tried other beard balms and they don&#x27;t come anywhere close to the quality of Mr. Rugged Bear Balm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who has some sort of stubble just about every day.  Sometimes I let it grow for a few weeks, and then I start over, but I&#x27;ve pretty much got some growth all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, there&#x27;s always that &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; stage where the curl of the whiskers can give you a lot of itching and irritation.  This stuff is the perfect answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to try a sample to review it, but I must admit, I originally didn&#x27;t think I needed a product like this because I associated products like this with guys with super long beards or old time mustaches.  What I discovered is that it&#x27;s exactly what I need when my beard is in that rustic stage too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the ingredients, and it&#x27;s all natural, which is important to me.  Another important thing is the scent, especially since it&#x27;s going to be right under my nose.  I&#x27;m happy to report that the scent is perfect.  It&#x27;s got a clean scent, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review helpful.  Questions or comments are welcome.</li>
    <li> I got this today and really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Beard balm is designed to smooth out your beard and to help prevent dry skin. I put this on and I noticed the fragrance at first. To me and my wife it smelled refreshing and had a scent that was like sweet herbs. To me it smelled like the  scent of Herbal Essence products which is a good thing. Someone mentioned little white balls in their review. I didn&#x27;t notice that, maybe a little bit grainy but very little. I tried it on my beard and it feels like a nice conditioner but you have to know how to use it. You don&#x27;t just load your beard up with it, you just put some in your hand and stroke the beard. Too much and your going to overload on the stuff. This is one of those nice little gifts men can give themselves to feel just a little more special. I like it a lot, I really do. I&#x27;ll see how it works over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:eeee9278d845bea836da07537c684a62]] I was reached out to by the guys at Mr Rugged to try out their bold beard balm, since this actually was a going concern for myself I jumped on the opportunity to review this product. I&#x27;m glad I did. Mr Rugged did not disappoint. I&#x27;m used-to just brushing and trimming my beard but now I&#x27;ve worked this balm into my daily routine. I grab a small scoop the size of my finger and work it in between my hands until it looks ready to get on my face. I love the scent, so does my girlfriend. My beard looks more neat and well put together with a nice shine to it. No more dullness. Will be ordering more as soon as this runs out. Looks like one jar can last 2-4 months of use depending on your size of beard of course.</li>
    <li> This happens to be the second beard balm brand that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Rugged will be the brand I buy for now on because it wins in all three categories that matter to me:&lt;br /&gt;1) Bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;2) Eliminated dry skin issues under my beard.&lt;br /&gt;3) The scent is a winner for my wife and I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it now for more than a month. I wanted to confirm that my initial results would last, and they sure did. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has dry skin issues and will appreciate smelling like a man that just left the barber!!</li>
    <li> Contrary to what everyone else who has reviewed this product has said, this stuff stinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an unpleasant combination that (to me) has notes of sandlewood, baby powder and some flowery scent that I can not identify. Not something I want in my beard. The stench never seems to dissipate either. I struggled through a few hours thinking it would eventually go away. Nope. It does wash out with some good pine-tar soap, but that&#x27;s about all I can say good about it. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for my beard as I was too focused on getting the stench out.</li>
    <li> This beard Balm smells great!  It also gives a cooling sensation on the skin. I would dab a little in the morning after I got out of the shower, just rubbing it in with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps the beard become softer and easier to manage.  It also does not leave a greasy oily residue. Overall it really did smooth out my beard. It really makes the beard feel comfortable on  your face. It also seemed to help tame the frizz and relax the curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not look like much with the small bottle, but a little really does go a long way and it seems to work better if you don&#x27;t over use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company. I did not promise them a review but seeing as I used it, and I love to review things, I was more than happy to provide a fair review to help other users make an informed purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently shaved off a 25 year old beard and when it grew in again I had even more white/grey hairs.  Older men will be familiar with how wiry such hairs can be.  I like to shower at night before bed because I leave for work at 4:45.  This balm both softens the beard generally and gets it under control in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were sent the product for review, but I would buy it myself.</li>
    <li> This is the best Beard balm I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed a substantial difference in the texture of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This has softened and conditioned the hair and made it have a nice healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beard balm is a styling and shaping aid as well as a leave in beard conditioner. A good beard balm should moisturize your facial hair, provide hold for styling and make your beard look thicker. For best results, avoid beard balms using synthetic sealants like petroleum jelly as they may irritate your skin and damage facial hair. Find a beard balm that contains all natural sealants like shea butter, beeswax or lanolin. These ingredients are natural, help your beard look thicker and are less likely to irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a patchy or thin beard, consider using a beard balm with shea butter, as shea is especially good at making facial hair appear thicker. In addition to all natural sealants, make sure your beard balm contains all natural moisturizers like jojoba or argan oil. Without the moisturizers, the sealants will just seal in dryness, making your beard brittle and prone to breakage.

If you are looking for an all-in-one leave in beard conditioner and styling aid that is easy to use, all natural beard balm is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product provided for review</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product. I believe, it&#x27;s just not my type of scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sport an &amp;#34;epic beard&amp;#34;, as I prefer mine short and close to the skin. But even without the need to tame any wildness, I really Mr Rugged Beard Balm that I&#x27;ve been trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm has a creamy consistency (think of a more gel-like Noxzema) that you massage into your face and beard. They recommend scooping a dime-sized dab depending on length of beard, but I find that I simply scoop up a bit on my finger and rub it on half my beard, repeating for the other side once that&#x27;s done. It does help soften and smooth any irritation, and it does a good job in keeping errant hairs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most distinctive and enjoyable part of the balm is the scent. It combines a number of oils (argan, jojoba seed, olive, soybean, beeswax, wheat germ, pumpkin seed, and cedar wood essential oils) that blend into a scent that is very outdoor-sy, rugged, and fresh. It smells like something your father would have worn, and that would bring back fond memories whenever you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need some help in controlling a wild beard, definitely take a look at this. It&#x27;s not a bad option if you&#x27;re looking for a new signature scent, either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Vendor&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> This is the first product that works as supposed to. I will be purchasing another real soon.</li>
    <li> The smell has a nice clean and fresh scent  I think it would be terrific for shorter beards, but I seem to have to use a lot of this product since my beard is 6 inches plus.  I will keep using it and see how long this jar will last.</li>
    <li> Dries out in the jar rather quickly, in my experience. YMMV</li>
    <li> I like the fact this balm is in a solid form until you rub it, ever so lightly, in you your hands and it immediately turns to oil. The fragrance is the best I have experienced with any beard product. Not sure what it is but, it has a very rugged, maybe old-school fragrance. My wife also loves the smell of this product. Goes on easy and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, makes my beard feel great and keeps my skin from drying out. It has become my go-to beard conditioner. Definitely will buy when this runs out. I did receive this as a sample to try and review. Glad I did. I&#x27;m now a customer!</li>
    <li> I used this twice to remove eye shadow and liner and it works like a charm. Also works great for cracked heels. Smell lingers for awhile. Glass jar&#x27;s definitely a plus as you dont have to worry about BPA and other toxins leaching into the balm. I plan to reuse my empty jar</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e880f4064afa2b30e32efcfcd5f7a91d]] I&#x27;ve had a beard - or at least a non-clean-shaven face - for almost a decade now. However, I&#x27;ve kept my beard very short - barely past a few days of growth - because it&#x27;s been so hard to control and tends quickly to become scraggly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Mr Rugged Beard Balm has allowed me to grow my beard longer. Much longer. Not ZZ Top long, and probably not as long as yours, potential customer, but... longer than I&#x27;ve had it before since I started going grey (my occasional college beard was longer, but I was a young pup then). A dab in the morning after a shower, rubbed in with my hand, and it&#x27;s allowed for a measure of control I&#x27;ve not known I could have. My beard is softer and more controlled without being greasy. The scent of the balm is lovely. The amount you need to use is very small, so a container will last you, I&#x27;d guess, for a few months (less if you have a heavy beard, more if you have a shorter one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample for review, but I will be buying this once mine runs out. It&#x27;s a product category that, until recently, I didn&#x27;t even know existed - but I&#x27;m surely glad I know of it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Give the beard a nice feel n sheen.</li>
    <li> Growing a beard can become ROUGH and the irritation can truly become unbearable, have you ever tried to grow your beard but within a week of growth the stubs of the hair growing make your face itchy and uncomfortable? No more! I tried growing my beard so many times but for the following reasons I just had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Itchiness&lt;br /&gt;-Uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;-Dryness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These reasons are enough alone to keep anyone running from a beard for a long time but not anymore, I discovered this beard balm brand a few months ago and thus far I&#x27;ve been able to grow a beard much more comfortably. Initially growing a beard can be rough and itchy but this balm supports big time in that the all natural ingredients support in growth and comport. I really loved the cooling sensation I get when I use this stuff, amazing! I&#x27;m all about good quality so when I find a product that actually works and is made from ingredients from the earth intended for our usage, I&#x27;m on board! Thanks guys! :)</li>
    <li> I received this beard balm conditioner free from the manufacturer for review. Having never interacted or used Mr Rugged products before recently, I&#x27;m now a big fan of Mr Rugged beard products. The ingredients used are great, including jojoba oil and other natural oils, and makes this product not only smell manly and good but also work fantastically. Beard growth has nothing on Mr Rugged products: it smooths, soothes and makes less itchy, and also &#x27;keeps it tame&#x27; during that uncomfortable in-between growth period. Having tried the beard oil, the balm and the lotion from Mr Rugged, I&#x27;m now a converted fan. Would recommend Mr Rugged beard balm conditioner for its use, affordability and all around goodness.</li>
    <li> (I was sent this product for free for an honest evaluation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used one other brand of beard balms, and that&#x27;s Honest Amish. I would say this product is comparable in how well it works. It goes on easy, isn&#x27;t greasy, and keeps my beard soft and pliable throughout the day. The big difference to me is that this one has virtually no odor, while the Honest Amish has a lovely, woodsy, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent. That said, my wife isn&#x27;t a fan of how that scent ages throughout the day. She loves it when it first goes on (as do I), but then at the end of the day, she&#x27;s not a fan. By then of course I can&#x27;t smell it as it&#x27;s been under my nose since morning. She doesn&#x27;t *dis*like it, however she&#x27;s &amp;#34;not sure about it&amp;#34;. This Mr. Rugged, however, having virtually no scent at the start of the day, ends the day the same way.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a profuct like this over the winter, when I was letting my beard get long and I was worried about it being scraggly and otherwise unkempt. It jumped on the offer to receieev a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty pleased with it. I have been using it every couple of days to rub into my beard, and it has a nice clean manly smell.&lt;br /&gt;The proof is my wife, she was just commenting last night how nice my beard looked and how soft it is. So I guess that means I should keep on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the smell is strong, so not being used to anyting with aromatic oils near my face, it was bit to get used to. The directions say to use a dime-sized bit, but maybe for me that is too much since in the warmer weather I keep my beard shorter.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Smells great. Easy to apply (basically you just rub/massage into your dry or damp beard but it works better damp). I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &#x27;surprise&#x27; was that the product photo makes it appear bigger than what it actually is (at least it did for me). In reality, it&#x27;s a small 1.8 ounce glass jar with a black plastic screw top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
    <li> I received this to review and passed it along to my husband. Here&#x27;s what he had to say about it: I&#x27;ve tried a few beards, and now also a various beard balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Rugged now ranks among the balms that have been upon my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm contains several oils, such as jojoba and ceder wood, as well seed butter and beeswax. It&#x27;s easy to apply as it is soft but fairly firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one might gather from the ingredients, it is oily, so if you apply too much, your face will be oily. Following the directions should help. I just got carried away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied properly, it does soften the hair, as well as hydrate the skin. It&#x27;s noticeable after using it only once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a beard? This is certainly an effective product to make it as good as it can be.</li>
    <li> My beard was feeling dry until I discovered beard balm. Now it feels really nice and I constantly catch myself stroking it! This works as advertised, rub it in your palms and massage it into your beard. Easy! I don&#x27;t really smell any cedar though and wish I did. Regardless, I&#x27;d order this again as it makes my beard happy.</li>
    <li> As it smells nice, I probably will not use this on a regular basis as I did not notice any difference in my beards appearance with the product in, other than my beard feeling a bit heavier like something was keeping it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; but to the touch it felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;decent amount given&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves beard greasy&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me with the feeling of knowing something is my beard, almost like it&#x27;s wet&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: when opening the bottle the seal didn&#x27;t come off right away as it peeled off in two pieces, a top layer and a bottom layer, minor thing but felt like this should be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;Does not give a strong hold</li>
    <li> I gave this beard balm to my husband, as his beard had recently started getting crazy.  This beard balm is quite greasy, but it manages all the little flyaway problems he had been having.  Additionally, his hands are also quite soft from the balm.  He loves using it, but just says he wishes it was a little less greasy.  A little will go a long way, so this container will last quite some time.  Also, the scent is not too overpowering.  It is light, almost clean smelling.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beard balms. Feels and smells great. Will def buy again and a great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to write a two-fold review about this beard balm.  I got it toward the tail end of having my beard; then I continued to use it in a different way after I shaved -- as a face moisturizer!  I&#x27;m happy to report that it works fantastic for both.  It&#x27;s definitely the best beard balm I have tried (two others before this), and the fragrance is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose of this product, of course, is to make your beard soft.  This offers two main advantages.  First, it helps a lot of guys, like me, get through that really itchy, uncomfortable stage of beard-growing when it feels like the stiff new hairs are about to tear your face skin off.  This beard balm really does make a huge difference.  The second advantage is that, because your beard is well conditioned and the hairs are healthier, beards can be grown longer without getting scraggly and developing split ends.  If you grow a beard, you MUST use a beard balm.  There is no other way, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I shaved, I continued using this stuff as a face moisturizer.  For one thing, the cedar wood oil is a great fragrance that complements my aftershave and cologne.  For another, the ingredients are all natural: argan oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, soybean oil, beeswax, wheat germ oil, pumpkin seed oil, and fragrance.  I have always found that natural oils make better face moisturizers than chemical-based lotions.  It definitely makes a difference in my skin, there have been no acne breakouts as a result, and the smell is wonderful.  Wife loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the price is fairly high.  $20 for this rather small tub is a bit steep.  I dare say that the proper price should be about half the present amount.  But, if you are serious about your beard balm and don&#x27;t care so much about the price, this is your stuff.  Best beard balm I have found.</li>
    <li> Works great, helps so much.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough to describe how fabulous this product is. My skin and Beard were do scratchy and dry to the point it felt like sandpaper. I immediately noticed a MAJOR difference after 1 day of use. My face has never felt good lol. And those wild hairs are no longer an issue.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it feels and I even like the scent but it is a strong scent... so if you&#x27;re easily annoyed by a strong fabric softener smell in your beard you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have a long beard and after I ran out of oil I wanted to try something different and WOW what a difference. After the first use I noticed the curlyness start to go away. Will definately continue using and may never go to any other company. Smells great. Real easy to use. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes the beard shine and look fuller. Has a nice scent to it, but I wish it smelt a little bit better, like more of a moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smooths the beard and makes it smell nice.  Lasts forever as well.  Highly recommend this beard balm</li>
    <li> This balm has a consistency like moisturizer cream, but more of gel side, rather than cream. But, thicker than lotion.  Every time my husband starts to grow beard, he complaint about his face being itchy and newly grow beard seem to be unmanageable.  So, he quit growing beard. He tried several times in the past, but he couldn’t past that initial ‘untamed, itchy’ stage.  Now my husband start to grow beard again and he is already thinking about shaving it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, when my husband was thinking about giving up grown his beard, I was asked to try Mr Rugged Beard Balm and write my review after using it.  Just perfect timing.  I bought a few of similar product for beard conditioner for him, but either, it is too greasy, too strong smell, etc.. None seems to be working for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I convince him to give a few more days before he shave it all off, I also asked him to try Mr Rugged Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been only 3 days since he start using the Balm.  Here is what he told me about the Mr Rugged Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It’s not greasy&lt;br /&gt;*  It feels light when applied to beard – feel natural unlike wax.&lt;br /&gt;*  It makes his beard soft&lt;br /&gt;*  Best of all, this product does make His skin itchy.&lt;br /&gt;*  Its smell still more stronger than he would like,  (He pref&#x27;d no smell at all),  but it&#x27;s pleasant smell and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, he may just keep his beard this time around.</li>
    <li> (free sample supplied for review purposes)  The instructions recommend that you apply when damp and I would say that is practically a must for several reasons but especially if you have a large beard.  The balm is much easier to apply when the beard is damp and like a hair conditioner will have a more conditioning effect when applied to a damp beard.  You will also have to use less when applied to a damp beard, the jar is relatively small and if you used it on a large dry beard you will go through the jar very fast but when applied damp you will use much less and the jar will last considerably longer.  I usually grow a beard during the winter months because it does not itch as much as it does during the warmer months and because of the extended winter we had in our area my beard is very large, I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of Duck Dynasty jokes.  Right now I don&#x27;t have much itching and the balm seems to have lessened the itching so I am going to let the beard go for a little longer to see how it handles the itching during the hot months.  I have thick beard hair and I&#x27;m not joking when I say I sometimes get beard hair splinters when shaving and the balm has definitely made my beard softer.  I really enjoy the scent, reminds me a little of Old Spice Sport scent.  If the several times I have to wash my hands after use is any indication of the quality this is very good stuff and very highly recommended, I like this a lot.</li>
    <li> In another review I mentioned that I&#x27;d recently started working on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Balm is great. Hands down. Be sure to use it in moderation, a little goes a long way— so far I&#x27;ve been using jojoba and argan oil (which are both components of this beard balm) on the average day, and the beard balm when I want just a *little* extra hold. The fantastic sandalwood scent goes a long way too, and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on the denseness and trim of my beard. I attribute a lot of that to good care and the application of this balm and similar oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, I recommend it. Little easier to apply that straight-up Jojoba/Argan mixes. Holds a little better too, and smells nice!</li>
    <li> I got Mr Rugged Beard Balm for free. My 25 year old son tried it, I don&#x27;t have a beard, lol. The smell is great! It definitely helped to keep his beard softer &amp; more under control. What a great product!</li>
    <li> The balm has a manly, woodsy scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  It has a well balanced, inviting scent.  Applying it is easy and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every day now to help the split ends that have formed at the edge of my mustache.  My wife has said is has made improvements and has made my beard less &amp;#34;scragly&amp;#34;.  I can honestly say that this is my favorite personal care product I&#x27;ve come across in recent memory, and I have used it every day since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My estimate is that this amount of product will last me  1 1/2 - 2 months.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS STATED, WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Recived this as a test review from the company. I notice a decline in the softness of my beard from the product i had been using, so that being said there are better products out there. It will do the job. it will give your beard a scent and it will soften it but it does not give you any hold when it comes to grooming.</li>
    <li> Mr Rugged Beard Balm is the first balm I use. The scent is discrete. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very unfortunate way for me to rate this product, I dont know if it good or bad as far as being a beard conditioner.  The very strong perfumey smell was not something I could stand to put directly under my nose.  Therefore as I opened the jar, I immediately closed the jar and sent it back.</li>
    <li> I am a woman so I do not have a beard, but when I was offered this beard balm at no cost for an unbiased &amp; honest product review I accepted. My father has started to grow out a beard, so I figured he could be my &amp;#34;test dummy&amp;#34; lol. My father really likes this product. It comes in an easy to store jar, and dad says that he likes the smell. He told me that it helps moisturize his beard, the dryness and itchiness he felt when his beard was growing or became dry hasn&#x27;t been occurring. He said his beard feels much softer and it makes taming or styling his beard much easier then just washing and drying it with shampoo. He also says this balm does not leave a greasy feeling and that you do not need to use much. He is very satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more in a few months when this container is gone.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the fresh, clean smell (and so does my wife). Conditions well. I will be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> The scent is extremely strong. My beard is a bit long so I need more product to work it all in but the scent is so strong that it makes my nose burn for hours. Still get beard itch at times so I&#x27;m not sure how well it really conditions.</li>
    <li> Two applications and looking much better already. Will be great for my winter blasted dry facial skin. It feels great. Very subtle aroma</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Adding just a dab of Mr. Rugged Beard Balm after a shower, then rubbing it through, tends to smooth things nicely and keep my beard from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a full-on, serious, rugged-man beard. I do have a goatee, and without some kind of maintenance it can get unruly and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great. It feels good. It&#x27;s made of all-natural ingredients: argan oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, soybean oil, beeswax, wheat germ oil, pumpkin seed oil, some proprietary fragrance blend and cedar wood essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I had a chance to try out a sample of this product for the purpose of testing and review.)</li>
    <li> This is the second Mr. Rugged beard product I&#x27;ve tried (the other was the Beard Conditioner). I found that these two products work well together. The Beard Balm is much denser of a product than the conditioner and is the equivalent of a hair gel for your beard (in a good way). The beard balm doesn&#x27;t have any offending ingredients and its aroma, like the Bard Conditioner is pleasant and fades away after a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like the most about the Mr. Rugged Beard Balm is that it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or oily on my face. I apply the balm after the conditioner after getting out of the shower and it does an exceptional job of helping keep the frizz down in my beard (the longer it gets, the frizzier it is). After using it for a week I haven&#x27;t had any skin reaction/clogged pores and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in the condition of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Rugged supplied me a sample for review, but I will continue to buy this product after the sample has run out. Prior to using Mr. Rugged I really didn&#x27;t think much of conditioning my beard, now I can&#x27;t imagine not conditioning it!</li>
    <li> The very first thing that my husband did after retiring from the Air Force was to grow out a beard, and he&#x27;s had one ever since. Every summer I&#x27;ve heard the same story; &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just going to shave it off. It just gets so itchy!&amp;#34;. He never has, but mostly because we&#x27;re afraid the grandkids (who have never seen him clean-shaven) would run from him in terror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us had any idea that a product like Mr. Rugged Beard Balm existed until I was offered a sample to review.  When I think of the years of griping I&#x27;ve listened to unnecessarily ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, back to the review. My man is one of those guys who are always look immaculate, even when working in the barn or under the hood of a car. Even so, he did the Spock-like lifted eyebrow at me when I told him what I got for him to try. He thought it was &amp;#34;fussy&amp;#34;. ONE application and his tune changed completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the man himself:&lt;br /&gt; Mr.Rugged Beard Balm addressed a problem that I assumed was just inherent in having a beard; the dry, itchy skin underneath and the very coarse dry hair of my grey beard. One very small amount, rubbed between my fingers and massaged into my beard and chin and both problems were solved!&lt;br /&gt;Another plus, this balm smells terrific! I like it, and my wife loves it,. Can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;As to value, the jar size is more than generous.  Because you use such a small amount, it lasts a very long time. If you, like me, question as to whether or not this product will benefit your facial hair, I urge you to give it a try. I believe that you, like me, will find out that Mr. Rugged Beard has become your new best friend.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product, one I&#x27;d never tried before so when I offered a sample for review I accepted with curiosity. I&#x27;ve been using this on my beard and mustache for about two weeks now and really love this stuff. Aside from keeping my beard &amp;amp; &#x27;stache looking healthy and smooth, it also has a very pleasant aroma. My facial hair isn&#x27;t very long so some of this balm stays on the skin, I was concerned about a reaction as I sometimes get w/ &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; products but neery a pimple developed so that concern is no more! All in all, it may seem pricey to some but if U have a full-on BEARD beard, Mr. Rugged is a must have.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that I purchased for a friend. It left his beard soft and helped to eliminate some of the dandruff on the local skin. I would recommend this product to other.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, works very well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:332f341a1c2b716fda52fdfde2938015]] I have used natural products before, but there is something special about Mr Rugged Beard Balm. From the Simple elegance of the design to the subtle aroma of manliness, this beard balm is undeniably a finely crafted product. My beard is my identity, and I am very protective of something so precious. But this is a product that I WANT in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made of the finest natural ingredients and presented in a container fit for travel or home, Mr Rugged Beard Balm instantly made my beard feel more nourished and hydrated, as well as gave it a more natural look without feeling like it weighed my beard down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a terribly curly beard, and that leaves me having to blow dry it straight; not the most healthy method. But using Mr Rugged Beard Balm has kept me from having a Bird Nest Beard. Hairs behaved as they should, since it softens the beard making fly away beard hair easy to shape and style into a neat healthy appearance. Simply put, this product works in every way it should, and you should expect nothing less from every product that touches your Face-Blanket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the glass jar will grant you access to the beauty that is this product. A honey yellow balm greets you with a warm \\&quot;Hello\\&quot; every morning almost as if to say, \\&quot;Good morning Bearded Barista! What adventures do we have planned today?\\&quot; The texture of the balm reminds me of clarified butter. This is smooth, not grainy, and with a little heat from the friction of rubbing your hands together, it will melt perfectly. And one that you can apply directly into your not quite dry beard. I have found applying just a small amount will go a long way, but even if you do use too much, no worries as it never made my beard greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, applying just enough to moisturize the beard before blow drying was ideal. Afterward it was primed for a day&#x27;s worth of protection. Apply another small amount as the finishing touch right before you walk out the door for a polished sheen, and just a subtle enough fragrance that compliments the look of a well-tamed beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aromas presented here are a simple blend of earthy and rustic. Not as if I had been working in the grease of a sawmill, but more like I had just spent the weekend on a cruise through the winds of the Appalachian Mountains. Not leathery cowhide, but more like the early sunrise driftwood upon the Northern shores of New Zealand. Fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not heavy, there is enough substance to this product that it will last the entire day. Helping to maintain the body of a distinguished gentleman&#x27;s beard.

Not as if I had been working in the grease of a sawmill, but more like I had just spent the weekend on a cruise through the winds of the Appalachian Mountains. Not leathery cowhide, but more like the early sunrise driftwood upon the Northern shores of New Zealand. Fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not heavy, there is enough substance to this product that it will last the entire day. Helping to maintain the body of a distinguished gentleman&#x27;s beard.

    <li> I have used a few beard balms and the smell of this one beats them all! Plus I love how easy it melts in your hand to apply think Joshua tree salve... Yes I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Mr. Rugged bold beard balm, made in Erie Pennsylvania with all natural ingredients, keeps your beard healthy, manageable, and comfortable.  I simply scoop a dab of beard balm onto my finger and spread it into my freshly showered and dried beard.  My beard is more manageable and less itchy for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I don’t like products with scents.  Mr. Rugged bold beard balm has a manly fragrance added which is obvious when smelling the jar full.  However I don’t notice the scent after spreading a small amount on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used beard oil for years to make growing a beard comfortable.  Mr. Rugged beard balm not only makes growing a beard comfortable, but also helps keep it tamed.  If you’re looking for a good beard oil/balm, Mr. Rugged bold beard balm is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Keeps beard healthy, manageable, and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;100% money-back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance added</li>
    <li> I have been growing my beard for a little over 3 weeks now and it was getting really itchy, so much so that I considered shaving it. I decided to buy this beard balm in hopes that it could alleviate the itching. I can finally have the beard I have wanted for awhile now, the product definitely helps make the growing process much more comfortable. I am very pleased with the product, smells great too!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Especially since they gave it to me for free! Now that i actually look at the price for only1.8oz...it&#x27;s kind of steep...thanks for a great product. But I know of others cheaper &amp; that I&#x27;ve got some kinda allegiance to...if ya ever wanna send me more sample products. I would love to sample them. I like the thickness of the balm....lasts pretty much all day.</li>
    <li> First off let me just say this is a PHENOMENAL product! I am a beardsmen I have tried a lot of balms and oils this is a great product no lumps and it keeps my beard looking good the whole day. I am a Barber and own my own shop so a well groomed beard is a MUST. The scent of Mr. Rugged is perfect and not over powering at all like most. I have read some reviews of this product where people were concerned about it clumping up. What you have to do is really emulsify the product by rubbing desired amount in to your hands until clear. Then you can apply it to your beard. I hope this review helps. This was a FANTASTIC PRODUCT keep up the good work!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first try at beard balm and it rocks!! I also ordered another brand but this one, by far, outshines the other...literally!!! Love the shine, smoothness and healthy texture it gives my beard, and it smells good too!!! I will be buying more of this!!</li>
    <li> Most of the time, I use my beard around 2-3 inches long. However sometimes I go above this length and then taking care of the beard becomes crucial. Otherwise it is nothing but itching and irritation. Proper cleaning is the key element. But it is not sufficient on its own. So it is always a good idea to keep some sort of conditioner around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way of conditioning your beard is using a beard oil. These products are in the consistency of a liquid oil ( like olive oil). They may look easy to use at first but it is very easy to get more than enough which is neither good for your beard nor for your wallet. The alternative is using a beard balm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a beard balm. It has the consistency of a thick butter kept in room temperature. With a little bit of experimenting you can accurately control the right amount and besides there is risk of spilling it to the floor or your clothing. So I like balms better than the oils. All you need to do is carve a little bit with your thumb and then dissolve it in your palm ( or your fingers if you don&#x27;t have that long beard) Then you apply it gently to your beard ( not much to your skin) and leave it as it is. No immediate washing is necessary. It will condition your beard without giving it a oily appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm has a very good consistency which is easy to carve and dissolves instantly without leaving chunks. It does have quite a bit of fragrance. To me it is okay. But if you are very picky about odors you may want to look for non-fragrance items&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that is worth noting is that this product is that it is a blend of natural oils only and is hand made  only. When it comes to cosmetic products it is easy to get trapped into products that contain a lot of petrol based chemicals. So it is always a good idea to have a look at the ingredients and I am happy to see nothing nasty in this one. The jar is sealed which is a good security measure to ensure that no one touches it on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is that it is hard to wash it out from your hands, also it stays on the beard for sometime which may cause smearing of clothes or pillow (if applied before going to bed) So My advice is to apply as minimum as possible and not before the bed time in particular. Washing it after may be another option but it is not very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, beard balms in general are good ways of looking after your beard. This one has the advantage of being all natural, sealed, hand made and having a good consistency. The smell is okay but some may find it off-putting, It has been gentle to my skin but it is a little hard to wash it away and there is a risk of smearing clothes with the leftover.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience I can recommend this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: A free sample was provided for revieward to wash it out from your hands, also it stays on the beard for sometime which may cause smearing of clothes or pillow (if applied before going to bed) So My advice is to apply as minimum as possible and not before the bed time in particular.

    <li> Ah yes, the Viking beard.  Those wild and woolly growths of hair that are thick, wiry, and unruly.  Mine was red and blond in my younger days but has reverted to white at my advanced age--but it is still heavy and hard to tame, much fuller and stronger than the remaining hair on my head.  No matter how I trim it, there is no particular length that is easier to style.  Different parts of my beard seem to have a mind of its own.  Some of it is straight, other areas are curly, and the hair growing out of my nose and ears is long and silky.  It&#x27;s too bad that nose and ear hair are not highly prized by the females of our species, because I would be in great demand. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Mr. Rugged offered me a free sample to try on one of the toughest beards in existence, I jumped at the chance.  I have tried a lot of hair products but that seems to be part of the problem.  This Mr. Rugged Beard Balm is thicker and has more substance than regular hair products. All you have to do is take about a dime sized amount of the product, place it in the palm of your hand, and rub your hands together until it goes from the initial \\&quot;vaseline type consistency\\&quot; to a more liquid form.  Then work it into your beard and comb with your favorite brush.  The results are far better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, so much so that I&#x27;m truly impressed.  I&#x27;ve read that others have encountered \\&quot;little white balls\\&quot; in their formula that can be eliminated by simply placing it in the palm of your hand and rubbing it until the formula turns liquid.  In Southwest Florida it&#x27;s usually hot enough to keep those white balls from forming so no problem there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that Mr. Rugged Beard Balm works well in styling my pony tale and keeping the seven or eight hairs involved nicely matted together.  Just a side benefit, but who doesn&#x27;t like multi-use products?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel my beard softer but it does smell great. Irritation is still there but not as much. Kinda of hard washing out of your hands so It&#x27;s the same washing out of your beard but you can&#x27;t tell on your face.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 out of 5 stars!Buy this,don&#x27;t delay!&#x27;</li>
