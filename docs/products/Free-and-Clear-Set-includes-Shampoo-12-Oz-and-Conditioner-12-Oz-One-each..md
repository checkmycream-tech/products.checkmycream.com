      <li>Love these products and will definitely order again!!!</li>

      <li>The new formula caused itching/rash and makes hair feel like straw.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>look for pure cotton materials for clothing, only.</li>
      <li>look for pure cotton materials for clothing, only.</li>
      <li>However the manufacturer recently completely changed the formula.</li>
      <li>Even my dematologist in malaysia couldnt prescribe me a shampoo, she gave me Polytar liquid, which smells like Lush&#x27;s soak n float shampoo, and leaves my hair soft, but i still had some bumps on my scalp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am using it because it is recommended by my dermatologist. However, I find that it makes my hair dry and hard</li>
    <li> Cleans well despite not really getting very sudsy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works very well.  It lathers well, rinses well, and it does not irritate my skin at all.  I purchased the conditioner and am happy with that as well.  This type of product is more expensive than regular shampoo/conditioner, but I&#x27;ve found that a little goes a long way, and you can really make it last.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to several chemicals and this is super nice for me and it leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny. Would recommend this to anyone, male or female,</li>
    <li> PROBLEM SOLVED! I feel so much better. I look so much better. And now I use all your products. THANKS!</li>
    <li> Daughter has bad eczema and we are loving these products. They have stopped the dry flaking of her eye lids and the irritation that regular shampoos cause her face and body.</li>
    <li> We have purchased this set a number of times and found them to be 5-star. However the last order received had a problem. The shampoo was fine, but the conditioner was thin, runny and had a foul chemical odor, unlike the previous conditioners rec&#x27;d in the sets. It was unusable. Upon placing a call to the number on the bottle, we were basically told that \\&quot;There was no problem with the product.\\&quot; That was it! Very poor response. Very poor attitude. Very poor customer service provided by manufacturer. We have just reordered for another set and hopefully the conditioner will be back to it&#x27;s normal state this time. If not, we will discontinue use of this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner has help to clear all skin problems I had because of other products that left residue behind. My hairdresser even took a picture of it when I took it to her shop so I suppose she might be ordering it to use for her other customers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Free &amp; Clear to anyone like myself who is very sensitive to chemicals.  These are the only shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m able to use, and they leave my hair very clean and manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on the recommendation of my dermatologist. I&#x27;m happy I did. I have had no problem with my allergies since I began using it.  It foams nicely and I don&#x27;t have to use much. The conditioner is also cost effective because you only have to use a little. I&#x27;ll be a good customer for this shampoo &amp; conditioner from now on.</li>
    <li> Helpful for sensitive scalp</li>
    <li> I like that the shampoo lathers well and rinses clean. The conditioner leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t build up. I have only used it twice so I&#x27;m still waiting for my rash from a previous product to go away. I can&#x27;t speak to the skin sensitivity yet, but everything seems to be improving.</li>
    <li> I had used samples of these products and they were as expected. These are excellent if you have sensitive skin and I have less itching on my scalp since using them and the conditioner seems to make my hair more manageable. Since I swim a lot, having products like these helps.</li>
    <li> I have used this for eight months</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair and scalp clean, shiny without additives that may cause allergy.</li>
    <li> Not for me, it made my hair dry and dull, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> After trying many natural products to relieve my allergic reactions to shampoo/conditioner, my allergist recommended the Free &amp; Clear brand of products.  It is, literally, the ONLY kind that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction on my scalp.  I have highlighted hair and it does not ruin my color or over dry.  Being a bit of a skeptic, I have tried other products in the past 4 years on occasion.  I always come back.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner daily.</li>
    <li> I prefer the conditioner over the shampoo. The shampoo is very drying</li>
    <li> Good, mild shampoo. It does not irritate the scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my dermatologist because of an allergy. I can&#x27;t believe the improvement. It solved all my problems.</li>
    <li> Both products worked well as my husband hoped they would, but the conditioner did cause some irritation on part of the scalp after the second or third time he used the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it does not have all of the chemical ingredients (formaldehyde for one) of other hair care products.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo leaves your hair just a very nice clean with no fragrance and the conditioner softens and makes your hair very manageable. I didn&#x27;t expect the shampoo to lather but it did. If you would like to try a good pure, just clean shampoo and conditioner, I highly recomment these products.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair well and the conditioner is not thick and sticky, rinses out of the hair cleanly.  I bought these because of a perceived allergy to laniolin.  My scalp has stopped itching after two weeks of every other day use.  I will repurchase this product for the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> Very mild on skin! I do miss having a bit of fragrance though. My children have excema and I have heard this is a good product to use. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Love these products and will definitely order again!!!</li>
    <li> Please offer in larger, more economical sizes</li>
    <li> I hate to give this one star, but i was just utterly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;About two years ago i started to develop an increasingly terrible allergy to all kinds of shampoo after using kerastase&#x27;s oleo relax shampoo (with great hair loss). I&#x27;ve gone sulfate-free, completely organic, fragrance free, hypoallergenic and even resorted to washing with water alone (nope, didnt work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an allergy patch test done and it turns out that i am mainly allergic to fragrance and formaldehyde. Even my dematologist in malaysia couldnt prescribe me a shampoo, she gave me Polytar liquid, which smells like Lush&#x27;s soak n float shampoo, and leaves my hair soft, but i still had some bumps on my scalp. I bought this shampoo, thinking it would work since it&#x27;s free from everything i&#x27;m allergic to, unfortunately, it left my hair so dry and crunchy (even with the conditioner), and the bumps were still hurting. I used it about 5 times already and i&#x27;ve decided to stop and return to Polytar liquid :-(</li>
    <li> Arrives fast and I love this product, I am allergic to just about everything and this product does not irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> I love these products and I especially love that they have no perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;They make my hair feel clean without the strong perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I found out I am allergic to the fragrance in everything. This shampoo and cream rinse were the only ones I could find with no fragrance. I like the product, but wish I had choices.</li>
    <li> My wife has sensitive skin issues.  She has used this product for some time and feels it is the best in its field.</li>
    <li> this product is on my list of approved products for my allergies.  surprisingly it works as well as my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it it dry your hair</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner for many years. It used to be excellent for sensitive skin. However the manufacturer recently completely changed the formula. The new formula caused itching/rash and makes hair feel like straw. The old formula is no longer available. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner was recommended by my hairdresser because I had a dry itchy patch on the crown of my head.  This was my first order and the itchiness started going away almost immediately.  I still have a little itchiness and dry scalp, but MUCH better than it was.  My only complaint is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very much, but a small price to pay to get rid of most of the itching.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and used it once, I really like the clean scalp feeling i got. So far I am impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and these are the only products that help with itching and don&#x27;t cause itching. They are gentle on my hair and scalp. I&#x27;m very pleased with these products.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. may take a couple of shampoos before you feel the difference, but it does work. Also, arrived quickly and wrapped well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Perfect for sensitive skin. No smell, great lather. The conditioner works well also.  Perfect for children in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Suddenly developed an allergy to most shampoos and conditioners. My dermatologist recommended this product alone and out of ALL the products I&#x27;ve tried this is the ONLY one that is truly hypoallergenic. No more rash, hair feels clean and light and conditioner is great. Couldn&#x27;t find it in ANY stores nearby,  so Amazon Prime online is the easiest,  best way to get a great product without searching from store to store.</li>
    <li> I started to get dry flaky ears last year and I couldn&#x27;t figure out where it was coming from. I&#x27;m almost finished with my second bottles of the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner. But, I&#x27;ve decided to change shampoos and within days my ears weren&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
    <li> UPDATE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Lupus and terrible skin sensitivities which can cause hives, sores, rashes and welts, which can lead to infections. Not fun. I have had to experiment for years but, have found these tips work for me.....&lt;br /&gt;F&amp;C Shampoo, F&amp;G Cream Rinse and F&amp;G Hair Gel are perfect for people with allergies to just about anything and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does clean so well it strips the natural oils from the hair so if you have dry, brittle and/or natural curly, frizzie hair  add a small amount of the conditioner to the shampoo before lathering. You can also add a small amount of organic olive oil to the creme rinse if you have frizzy and/or dry hair. It tames the frizziest hair as well as leaving it very shiny.  Adding  abit of hair Gel helps keep it calm whilst you dry it, and then syle it, or let it air dry naturally. (My preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 years ago I discovered the combo of the conditioner, organic olive oil, and a bit of the Clear Hairstyling Gel all mixed together and massaged into my hair, left  on for a few minutes then gently rinsed, leaving just a small residue really helps with the frizzies, dry, unmanageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO PLEASE NOTE: Massaging your hair gently with a small amount of organic olive oil, leave on for a few minutes, and then a  gentle rinse will help with breakage and with loss. If you do this every 2 weeks it should help with breakage due to brittle hair, and give you a stronger shaft of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Lupus and terrible skin sensitivities which can cause hives, sores, rashes and welts. Not fun. I have had to experiment for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,  I find if I use pure products from washing clothing, towels and sheets all separately and use washing:  (Method, unscented), to drying: (unscented, unscented, chemical free) see: [...], therefore I use Seventh Generation Free and Clear Sheets in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never mix articles like sheets with towels, or rougher fabrics with softer materials. (It will pill your softer materials and make then feel rough on the skin, especially sheets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for pure cotton materials for clothing, only. Doesn&#x27;t have to be organic as long as they are ALWAYS prewashed prior to wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For sheets I do use a microfibre polyester, (I know, I know, but its softness is beyond anything I have found after going thru dozens of brands and styles of cotton sheets), and because I have blistering allergies to latex and all its little minions I can wear only latex free socks like Buster Browns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use most of the F&amp;C products but do not care for the skin cream. It gives me a rash. But them again, other than organic olive oil, which is a simple single natural ingredient, I have not found a single skin cream. to which my skin does not react, so I hope this helps anyone else out there with Lupus, or other immune diseases, and/or hyper sensitive skin.r materials.

    <li> Works well. I no longer get a rash</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome&lt;br /&gt;I have a skin condition and this is the only shampoo that keeps my scalp from itching</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this fragrance-free shampoo and conditioner set. Seller shipped promptly and everything arrived in good condition. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Shipped fast</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this for our family because we all have fair skin and my kids kept getting eczema patches and pimply rashes. We switched to using this shampoo and no more rashes! It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Helpful in fighting allergies to the usual mass market shampoos</li>
    <li> Will order every month...With my disease cannot take any odors at all.  So perfect</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended!  Works for me!!!</li>
    <li> My six year old was diagnosed with Keratosis Pilaris more commonly known as &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;.  She had rough skin all over her body, especially her arms.  The doctor recommended a topical prescription with steroids -- and I wanted to avoid that.  Instead, I followed her instructions in eliminating all fragranced products.  After trying to find something suitable at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, Ulta, Walmart, Target, and the grocery store, I found this online.  After religiously using the product for 4 months, the skin condition has resolved itself and she has no more chicken skin.  My daughter is able to use it herself, and has not had any problem getting it in her eyes and it burning.  I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I used it when I was going to be around people with allergies to frangances.  And it serves its purpose but it does not work well with colored hair, because it does not make your hair feel soft and it makes it rather hard to manage.</li>
    <li> I recommend buying this product. It was good purchase and was cheaper than on most sites. Some reviews said the product had a funny smell. I didnt think so. Good purchase. This item was recommended for my little girl by an African American Dermatologist. It works good in my little girls hair... so if your wondering the product is good for African American hair as well.</li>
    <li> Great products,  they leave hair squeaky clean and manageable.  The shampoo and conditioner do the job efficiently and do not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> With copper and nickel allergies, i will use this product for life. No reactions and hair feels clean! And the shampoo actually suds up!</li>
    <li> I wanted this shampoo and conditioner to work for me, but it does not. I have medium length highlighted blond hair and I feel this product makes my hair feel dirty and dull. By the end of the day, I have the feeling that I want to wash my hair again. It&#x27;s almost as if I did not use anything and just used water in the shower. I also did not like how my hair styled either after blow drying, as I always do. Maybe it would be  better on shorter hair styles...</li>
    <li> Wife is sensitive to perfumes and fragrances added to soaps. These products are great for allergy prone/asthmatic sufferers. I use it myself and like it.</li>
    <li> A must have for my daughter who has Eczema.</li>
