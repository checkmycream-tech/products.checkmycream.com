    <li> Love, love , love this product.  Good for even the driest hottest New Mexico elevation in both winter and summer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for over a year and love the way it feels and smells. I usually purchase the coconut scent and bought these for my husband who loves vanilla.  I normally don&#x27;t wear vanilla scents but after smelling this one I became a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different brands of body butters and use to love the body shop brand but did not love the price. These are better than the body shop brand and after trying for the first time I am a fan.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> great smell love it and moistures lovely.Try it and see how the shea butter feels so wonderful after a shower.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Strangers have told me that I smell really good and want to know what it is.  They go so far as to ask me the name of the lotion and where I bought it because they want to buy the same thing.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering.  A couple of friends that are sensitive to smells and can&#x27;t stand candles, perfumes, etc. aren&#x27;t bothered.  It is a mild vanilla that is absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments from wearing this scent. It&#x27;s light, never over-powering. It goes on smooth, dries, and comes back if you&#x27;re active. You never know it&#x27;s there if you wear it for years like I have. My skin is always soft because of it and I know it&#x27;s helped me stay younger looking.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful and works really, really well. One of the best smelling products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s thick and moisturizes my skin very well. I&#x27;ve been a fan of this brand for years.</li>

    <li> Very happy with scent and silky creamy texture; feels great going on, no stickiness, feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing and pampering, makes you feel good about your skin. But, it doesn&#x27;t cure really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Delon products for years and just love all their flavors.  Does wonders foe my skin.  I normally use Coconut but this time I&#x27;m going to use Vanilla.</li>
    <li> So smooth, fragrant in a non threatening way. I love it, and use it every day!</li>
    <li> This body butter has become my favorite daily moisturizing cream.  The fragrance is just right, not too strong. I will buy again.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and vanilla is my favorite. It offers deep, penetrating moisture without feeling sticky on my skin.</li>
    <li> thought this was a balm but it is cream.  Has a nice vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this stuff! She got a single can for a gift and had to have more. She won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> It was first given to me as a gift &amp; now I gift it often. , wonderful texture, is not greasy &amp; absorbs  well. The scent is a definite  plus too</li>
    <li> I love this. I often make my own body butters, but when I&#x27;m short on time, this is my go to brand. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, and the scent is lovely. I&#x27;ve been busted, on several occasions, sniffing my arm throughout the day because the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I buy this by the four-pack, I like it so well. Smells good, and it WORKS.</li>
    <li> I have loved this lotion ever since I bought it at Costco.  Now I have to order it.  I use it for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter!  The vanilla has a clean and fresh scent and I also recommend the Olive scent also.  Leaves a lovely glow on my skin!</li>
    <li> Like this brand so much. It makes your skin smooth and moist. Smells good!</li>
    <li> I love the vanilla scent of this lotion. I have received many compliments when wearing it. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more body butter!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years...smells awesome, moisturizes extremely well in both summer and winter, great price!</li>
    <li> Usually i buy the amazon shea butter but i was prompted to buy this one in wanting to try something new.i tell you ibwas npt disappointed also its not greasy what sobever compared to the amazon shea butter</li>
    <li> Nice consistency but overpowering vanilla scent.  I would choose mango.</li>
    <li> great product .....2nd purchase</li>
    <li> Love this body butter. I am out-of-doors often for my job and it keeps my skin soft and supple. An added benefit is that I don&#x27;t get as many mosquito bites as I do using repellants.</li>
    <li> My skin feels silky all day long. The scent is light but plesant.</li>
    <li> one of the best....if not the best!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is what vanilla is supposed to smell like, natural with no chemical smell. Goes on smooth, not greasy after.</li>
    <li> I have just opened my second container and it is starting to dry up it seems. The seal was on it and the first one was fine...not sure what i&#x27;ll find in the next two. I love this product and this was very disappointing...I guess after opening the next two I&#x27;ll decide if I want to order it again. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my last order of 4.</li>
    <li> This is the best body butter!</li>
    <li> While I was disappointed with one order ( because the consistency was so different than it had been ), I tried once more because I missed &amp;#34; an old favorite&amp;#34;.  So glad I did 😄 . Just like the old days.  It is a GREAT  product- love it!</li>
    <li> The most incredibly deep moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for face and body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, loved that. Packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;These lotions are gifts for co - workers. I have the smooth vanilla, fabulous, light scent, deep moisturizing. I know these well be loved, happy to give something I know well be used and appreciated.</li>
    <li> Overall a good product, not greasy &amp; has a nice lasting smell that isn&#x27;t over powering.  I would recommend this product to a friend looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I can smell the subtle vanilla all day.  I have used it for 3 months now and still love it.  The product shipped right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla-scented products.  I tried this because of the reviews, and suddenly I&#x27;m a HUGE  fan of vanilla as long as it&#x27;s this particular vanilla.  Wow.  It smells fantastic!  And the scent lingers on your skin for a long time. Most butters (at least in my low-temp home) are too solid, and it takes a thumb nail to scoop some out, then rubbing hands together to melt it enough to smooth on.  This is solid also, yet so incredibly creamy I can just swipe my fingers over the top. It feels luxurious going on, gliding over the skin.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter, it goes on like silk and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Makes my skin feel great!! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My favorite body butter and recommend to many friends and gave them as gifts!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Great moisturizing butter. I alternate between the vanilla and the coconut. I definitely recommend the product after shower.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever!  Love the scent, feel and texture.  Keeps skin moist and refreshing for at least 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this body butter. Hope I can get more. This smells so good, a lot of days I don&#x27;t even wear my perfume.</li>
