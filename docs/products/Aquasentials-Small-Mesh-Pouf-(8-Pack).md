      <li>Exactly as described, great deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the first one out of this pack for three months, and it is still in great shape.  </li>
      <li>They were very cheap, so I gave them a shot; but I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
      <li>Good price and quick shipment.</li>
      <li>I love the 4 pack of mesh sponges</li>
      <li>I do worry about the quality and it holding up for more than a month (or so) of showers.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I need to give them more to soften.</li>
      <li>These are more of a mini travel pouf.</li>
      <li>Sure beats buying them one-by-one at the supermarket.</li>
      <li>These are the PERFECT size and work just as well as the larger sponge.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these and price is good for the quality.</li>
    <li> These are great. I am still using my first one. Last forever. Downfall...I didn&#x27;t realize they were the small ones. I thought I was getting a great deal lol.</li>
    <li> The strings on the poufs are a little flimsy but these &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; poufs are what I would say you see as regular size in the stores. Other than the strings fairly soft product, seems to be holding up well and I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. Would recommend and likely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are a lot smaller than the standard luffas.</li>
    <li> Good bath poufs. It&#x27;s always cheaper to get them in multi packs like this. They hold up great, better than ones I get at my local grocery store for more than double what I paid. Not as big as the ones from Bath and Body Works, a little smaller, but big enough for any grown up to have enough lather. It&#x27;s kind of cool too, they come with a suction cup thing on each one. i am giving a few away in Christmas gift baskets with some other stuff like body washes.</li>
    <li> These were a lot smaller than i was expecting, but i guess I had just been used to my big one.</li>
    <li> Works great...just like the ones you buy in Bath and Body works</li>
    <li> Size is good, they feel pretty good quality but I got all girl colors! I got a bag of 3 dark purple, 2 turquoise, 2 light pink and one magenta. I was expecting a multi color pack and not a girls day at the spa. I have a husband and 3 sons whom I bought these for. The turquoise ones are not so bad but my husband is using the light pink one and my oldest son is using purple. I will have to look elsewhere to get a combo pack of consistent colors for them. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Small and cheap they dont last very long at all.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I love these things.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for kids. I like having some back up ones for when we need to swap them out for new ones, plus there&#x27;s different colors so the kids enjoyed getting to pick their own color! The only negative is that I&#x27;ve only had these for a few months and the strap broke on the one that we use the most. I do like that the strap is a thick ribbon instead of the usual white cord thing. It seems more durable, maybe the one that broke on is just a rare occurrence. I will update if any more break!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great value, and exactly as described!!!</li>
    <li> These mini mesh sponges are excellent. I use them in my business and have personally used them and they are a real deal. They are nice and thick and foam up with very little soap or facial cleanser. I highy recommend them!</li>
    <li> These things tear up way too quick and easily..I found better ones</li>
    <li> Nice size and colors.</li>
    <li> Very basic sponges. Impressive quantity for the price. Good for guest bathrooms. They are of the small and tightly-packed variety. Not necessarily the most luxurious item for yourself but perfectly adequate for guests.</li>
    <li> Smaller sponges/loofas/whatever, but they&#x27;re cheap and are lasting me a while.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and came in a pack of 8 multi colors which is great .</li>
    <li> Love these! So great to find these small poufs for such a discount price</li>
    <li> the pouf sponges are verrrrrrrry small and come apart after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I use them in the shower. They seem to the job.</li>
    <li> Usually when I get these types of mesh sponges, they don&#x27;t last very long before they begin to unravel and then you have to throw them away. These seem to hold together very well.</li>
    <li> As other reviews stated they are very small. Smaller than the typical ones you get at the store or see in line at some retailers. I&#x27;m going back to those as these are simply too small to be very useful. The quality is good but the size renders them obsolete.</li>
    <li> These are listed as &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; but are actually fairly good-sized as far as mesh bath poufs go. These are large, well made, don&#x27;t fall apart on first use, yet are inexpensive enough to replace regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good quality, especially given the modest price point. I would highly recommend this Aquasentials set.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! These are not small!</li>
    <li> They are pretty small, but you get used to it. They also don&#x27;t seem to unravel as quickly as the bigger ones, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Used them as gifts for a baby shower and everyone loved them. The loop on  the poufs worked very good to put the thank you note on</li>
    <li> These things are for kids.</li>
    <li> For the price, the quality is very good. The loop is a nice ribbon material. Good poufiness and staying firm over weeks of use.</li>
    <li> What are these made for infants? Fell apart after the first use!</li>
    <li> I wish I had read a little carefully, I didn&#x27;t see that these were small.  These are good for travel, but I prefer the larger bath poufs for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is a good value. My only issue with these sponges is that they&#x27;re much smaller than I expected. I usually buy one each month from Rite Aid, and they&#x27;re about the size of my open hand, whereas these sit in my hand and barely extend past my palm. However, as small as they are, they still lather quite well and are made of a decent quality material. They&#x27;re not scratchy, but they&#x27;re also not silky. Like I mentioned, they&#x27;re a good overall value and I use them whenever I travel, too.</li>
    <li> We bought these to travel with and they are great to use and dispose of after a couple days, especially if you are moving from place to place.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these in retail stores.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> When the product title says small, I should be more careful about buying the item. These poufs were quite small but had decent quality. If you have a big hand or if you want something that is decently sized, go for a bigger and slightly more expensive item.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Sometimes the ribbons come undone but its easy to tie back together. The colors include teal, bright pink, cream and white.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mesh pouf - slightly smaller than the average pouf you&#x27;d see hanging at the cash register at most department stores, but a pouf nonetheless.  The smaller design seems to work rather well at lathering up the soap, while at the same time preventing the pouf from falling apart after a few uses.  And the 6-pack value deal ensures you have a spare pouf laying around should yours eventually fall apart and/or friends/family come visit and forget to bring their own hygiene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that the colors advertised in the picture are not the colors you should expect to get - as stated in the text of the item.  Colors are randomly selected and I ended up with 3 sets of colors in my pack.  Nothing to complain about, but wanted to point it out, as some people will be upset that their favorite color pictured above wasn&#x27;t in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a loop attached to each pouf to allow for easy hanging and the material isn&#x27;t too scratchy, but strong enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting some exfoliation.  Overall, the price is right and the product does the job.</li>
    <li> A little small, good price compared to other brands. A little on the weak side for durability. Seems to be fraying a bit already and its been only 2 weeks. I keep it out of the shower when not in use, and only used by one person once a day.</li>
    <li> This is a good pack of bath sponges and a great price. However, I wish I would have gotten more colors. I received 2 blue, 2 red, and 2 pink. I was expecting a little bit of everything.</li>
    <li> They are Small but work very well! They don&#x27;t come apart and lather the body wash well!</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and were exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Great value for the quantity, so far so good with the build quality after using one for a few weeks now it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
    <li> The poufs I buy usually fall apart very quickly, so I purchased a bunch of them.  These have lasted so long that I still have most of them under the cabinet!  Great Item.</li>
    <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  These poof sponges are excellent for exfoliating and are inexpensive enough that tossing each out after using them daily for2-3 weeks is not a financial hardship.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These have a nice presentation.  I only got the blue, green, and pink; however they were nice and bright in color.  The size is larger than I anticipated and the quality is excellent--nice and full.</li>
    <li> perfect travel size which was exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with these sponges. I haven&#x27;t even gone through 1/2 of them yet.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Good size and durable sponge.&lt;br /&gt;* Good Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Colors were not as vibrant as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;* Packaging was literally some sponges in a bag.</li>
    <li> I got tired of buying the expensive, well 4.00, ones everywhere and tossing them after a month or so.  These are great, they only last about a month anyway, toss and use a new one! They re ugly though.  My pack had 2 green and the rest were pink!  lol.</li>
    <li> The ribbon used to tie to the loofah isn&#x27;t ideal, and came off on the first one I used. But that&#x27;s the only flaw in a well priced, high-quality product</li>
    <li> after reading a few articles i learned that shower poufs are to be change at least every 3 weeks!!!! so do your self a favor and get these and be sanitary.</li>
    <li> Good Value, but rarely lasts more than a month before unraveling.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for my 5 year old and 7 year old. I also like the smaller size myself. Got 2 of each color: green, cream/pale yellow, pink, an purple. Not sure on durability, but they seem fuller than dollar store 4pk.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 6-pack in order to receive a variety of colors but out of the 30 individual (description of the merchandise very inaccurate; the merchandise does not come in packs of 6 sponges but loose individual sponges)  not 6-pack of sponges that I ordered I received 10 green sponges, 10 purple sponges, 3 pink sponges, 4 aqua/turquoise sponges, 2 white sponges and 1 ivory sponge.  No red, orange, blue or yellow sponge.  I did not expect to get an even variety since they were described as 6-pack but I truly did not expect what I received.  I was truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> They are made out of a great material, work perfectly during showers. You won&#x27;t regret buying and i can&#x27;t believe theyre so cheap! They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> These are soft but seem well made and are holding up well. And at less than $1 per sponge, I have no problems with the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 so far.  The hanging loop feel off the first one within a few weeks, but I was not expecting high quality at this price.</li>
    <li> Great! Definitely a product i will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> These are smaller than the ones you see in most drug stores - they are palm-sized, but it didn&#x27;t take any longer to wash with them. I personally throw mine out and use a new one every month for sanitary reasons. It&#x27;s actually what most of them recommend. So to be able to get a bulk pack at a low price was great. They do hold up.</li>
    <li> A bit scratchier than I might have liked but not bad otherwise.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine, but I was really trying to buy SMALL ones for travel and they&#x27;re full sized.  :-(</li>
    <li> These are definitely a better quality than the $1 you get in the stores. Another use:  cleaning animal cages, I use them to clean my bird cages, they hold up well and don&#x27;t scratch.</li>
    <li> these are ridiculously small!! I cannot believe the hype!! Should never have bought this. Not sure what else I can say</li>
    <li> Best bath sponges ever they last a long time and take a while to unravel these lather up nicely and get you nice clean and exfoliated (:</li>
    <li> Small diameter maybe 4 inch</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read clearly but these are tiny. Quality seems fine just extra small.</li>
    <li> They are loofahs. What more do you want. The price was cheap but they don&#x27;t feel cheap. Definitely meant for a female, not nearly rough enough for my husband.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people would opt for those 5-10$ poufs when they start stretching and becoming flimsy after about 2-3 months. These stretch out to the perfect size in about 2 weeks and last for the same amount of time as any pouf. Will always buy these until I find a cheaper alternative</li>
    <li> Can never have enough of these on hand - like to grab one to pack when I travel and use them at home as well.</li>
    <li> These are the smaller poofs. Work as expected, shipped within 2 days. Assortment of colors. You can&#x27;t go wrong with an add on like this!</li>
    <li> These mesh sponges were all and more than expected for the money.  I  will definitely buy again!  The size and  soft texture is great.</li>
    <li> I know it says small in the title, but these are almost too small for use in  my opinion. Instead, I suggest going to the grocery and picking up 98 cent ones that are bigger, and you can select the color. I say this because the colors that came in mine included 2 green poufs that looked like barf green: not appealing for gifts. So skip this purchase and head to the grocery store instead.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my home and upon one week of use they started falling apart. Also they are about half the size of a regular loofah. They completely unravel from the center and the strap falls off. Not recommended</li>
    <li> So, these are SMALL. (Yes, I know it says that, but I didn&#x27;t realize how small). Think the size of your fist, not a big lush pouf, but a compact one. It gets the job done, and for the price, I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as advertised. I do worry about the quality and it holding up for more than a month (or so) of showers.</li>
    <li> Good. a little small, good for travel size. good value. none of my colors were the ones on the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the first one out of this pack for three months, and it is still in great shape.  The last few cheap pouf sponges I&#x27;ve bought from the drugstore have fallen apart at the 2-3 month mark, so I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> I love the Mesh Pouf Sponges. They are great to use and sanitary. The colors are beautiful and can be used by all family members. They were easy to order and delivery was a breeze.</li>
    <li> Colors not as shown~ i needed bright colors for bday party. Instead I received baby blue white and 1 pink.</li>
    <li> These come in a bag but when you use them, they are a little rough on the face.  I have used other sponges that aren&#x27;t as harsh.  For the price, I guess they do the trick but if you are looking for something softer, this is not the product.</li>
    <li> These were larger than I thought they would be. They were full size pouf&#x27;s like I would buy at Walmart.</li>
    <li> The small size isn&#x27;t as much as a problem as the fact that they do not build a lather.</li>
    <li> they are small, but after you start using they seem to open up a bit.  And they are a lot cheaper here then at stores. will buy again</li>
    <li> Not Bad Quality, Really Soft. The String doesn&#x27;t come untied like so many others at this price. Overall Great Item</li>
    <li> Love these! Very well made</li>
    <li> These are just terrible quality. No amount of soap or water has softened them. It feels like you are rubbing sandpaper on your body.</li>
    <li> The mesh were good for my kids not for adults. They seem to be holding up. I probably will reorder.</li>
    <li> Great value! Good size</li>
    <li> These last about two uses and then two washes (to clean them) and they begin to fall/pull apart.  SO disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at the density of the sponges. Normally &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34; are thin and rip and fall apart pretty soon. Since there was 6 to a pack and only 3 of us, I figured they were worth the price. Yep! We are still on the first ones with the spares safely away in the closet!&lt;br /&gt;So aside from quality, one issue I had was the colors. Not to be picky about colors, but one of the reasons I bought the combination 6-pk was to get different colors. I have 2 little girls and I was hoping to color code all our loofah sponges. You&#x27;d think with all the color combinations from 8 different colors, I wouldn&#x27;t have ended up with 2 Blue, 2 Green, and 2 Pink. The green is a pretty ugly green too. So the original goal of color coding couldn&#x27;t happen with the mix I got because the girls didn&#x27;t like the green or blue (I love the blue color so I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t stick me with the green!). The funny thing is any of the other colors - red, purple, orange, yellow, white - would have been fine for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, for the price and quality, I&#x27;d risk a funky color combination again!</li>
    <li> When these say small....they are not kidding. They are very small...like the palm of my hand size. It would be great for little kids though.</li>
    <li> These poufs are perfect -- they are soft and put together very well and do not shred or split apart like the harder poufs do. They suds up very well - love the ribbon rather than the cord also - seems classy.  They also fit the hand nicely and are much easier to use than the large ones the stores sell.  I will purchase from this Supplier again when needed.</li>
    <li> take on vacation and for the price can leave them.  work perfectly and stands up to many washings.</li>
    <li> This product arrived well packaged. I got 3 colors in pairs. I don&#x27;t care about the colors personally, but we got white green and pink. This product works MUCH better than any of the &amp;#34;poufs&amp;#34; i have previously bought for a much higher price. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> These are okay, especially for the price.  The reason they&#x27;re not being ranked higher is that they&#x27;re on the small side and after just a week of use, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being scrubbed.  Not much better than a regular washrag.  They were very cheap, so I gave them a shot; but I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> ...hold their sturdiness and don&#x27;t unravel quickly.  There really is not any more words to say to this review but since I have to.</li>
    <li> Great addition to our welcome bags at our destination wedding!</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of softness and right size. Loop is made from ribbon so not sure yet how that will hold up in a shower setting, so that is why I gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These are nice poufs.  I got 2 pink, 2 white and 2 blue.  I got them for the whole family.  Its great because my kids like them and use them in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nice soft sponges with vibrant colors. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality, highly impressed!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have bought these as their own purchase if they weren&#x27;t an add-on item for Prime orders. So in that sense, it was a great deal. Just a word of warning, I didn&#x27;t really think about what colors would come in the pack and the photo is a multi-colored array of poufs. The pack I actually got was 2 whites, 2 blues, 2 greens. Those, incidentally, are my favorite colors so it worked out. But if you were expecting a more diverse set of colors, you may be in for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really if you don&#x27;t need specific colors or anything this is a great add-on purchase. The colors don&#x27;t affect the utility of the product after all! :)</li>
    <li> I have used these types of sponges for years with body wash.. this item was an add on.. as it was so inexpensive buy it&#x27;s self.&lt;br /&gt;Using one now and works well and as expected. easy to rinse out when you are ready to get out of the shower, buy getting so many at one time, they should last for over a year or two.. great price, good quality, works as expected,would recommend to anyone who likes to use body wash in the shower.. Make sure you rinse it out and then hang up to drip dry.. don&#x27;t want any chance of it smelling.</li>
    <li> THis is a great product good price for how many you get I will definitely be buying these again next month love them.</li>
    <li> They are small, but that&#x27;s not the problem. The smell that they have is the problem, will have to air them out for a month before using</li>
    <li> is cheap made but works just fine nothing wrong with it only if the price can be a little lower</li>
    <li> These shower puffs are okay but could have easily been a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I would use as a baseline to the Aquasentials small puff at $0.92, is the Target small puff at $0.99 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison the Target small puff is smaller, approximately ¼ of the overall size smaller than the Aquasentials small puff. In my opinion, the smaller the puff the longer lasting and more durable, i.e. the larger fluffier puffs fall apart during initial use. It is my experience that the fluffier the puff the less useful it is for the intended purpose as a body scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area where the Target small puff really excels beyond the Aquasntials puff is durability. The Target small puff will last months sometimes, as long as six-months before the puff begin to unravel, requiring replacement. The Aquasentials puffs have been lasting about two-weeks before they start to unravel and in one-month, they are so loose that I find them useless and discard the puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you find this review useful in your search for a useful small shower puff. The question remains would I purchase these again, only if the Target small shower puffs were discontinued.</li>
    <li> Yes, finally, poufs that don&#x27;t have to take up your entire travel case.</li>
    <li> My wife bought these for the shower, using one a month and then throwing them away.  The old ones make good scrubbies for dishes!</li>
    <li> This is what I need! Good price and quick shipment.</li>
    <li> I love the 4 pack of mesh sponges so I thought I would try a 6 pack of smaller ones.  They are not the same!  I am in favor of daily exfoliation, but not taking off layers of skin that aren&#x27;t ready to go!  These are so rough that after one use I threw mine out and am saving the remainder for cleaning.  They probably will do a great job of cleaning the sink or tub, but for personal use they are a no go with me.  I do have to say that my husband didn&#x27;t find them too rough for him, but does prefer the size of the larger ones.</li>
    <li> Ok. Wish I could get other colors.</li>
    <li> They are a bit firm and small, but these work great. They build up a great lather and are great for working the skin!</li>
    <li> Loofahs are loofahs...I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much variety in what you get.  I like these though because they&#x27;re so small.  They don&#x27;t take up much space in my shower and they&#x27;re easy to use.  They lather nicely.  It does say assorted colors which I knew, but I was still kind of annoyed to receive 3 whites and no green.  I got: 1 purple, 2 blue, 2 pink, 3 white/ivory</li>
    <li> The hotel wash cloth -- without regard to whether it is a sanitary option -- and hotel soap are part of what makes me feel away from home, displaced, during my frequent business travel.  One day it struck me to begin packing these small mesh shower sponges and travel-size containers of my favorite body wash (Jack Black All-Over Wash).  What a big difference that small packing strategy has made, bringing one more comfort from home along on my frequent trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect size, not as large as the one at home, but not so small as to feel cheap or insubstantial.  You end up paying less than $1.00 apiece for these quality, compact shower sponges ...so I simply discard them at the end of my hotel stay.  I highly recommend this for the frequent traveler, although they are a high-quality product for anyone hoping to find a nice, but smaller, mesh sponge for the shower or tub.</li>
    <li> Bought these because price was great. They&#x27;re good loofahs. Got at least one of every color shown. Since I found out how frequently they are supposed to be replaced, can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
    <li> excellent product, great service.</li>
    <li> Super soft!  Love the fun colors!!</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped for. Nicely packaged, no problems. Nice vibrant colors to choose from. Good price compared to items of similar quality. Who can complain?</li>
    <li> They seem good, hold together after a month usage. They are just so small. Maybe I bought the wrong size...</li>
    <li> These are smallish poofs for adults but a good size for children. The first one I put in the shower started loosing form after a month of every day use by one person. They feel like cheap plastic with a lot of gaps in the weaving almost like the Baby Bell mini cheese nets. You know what I mean...</li>
    <li> It is not colorful assortments like the picture. Little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I honestly think that these would be larger. They&#x27;re about 3 inches wide. They&#x27;re pretty small. Good to travel with</li>
    <li> They kind of unravel which decreases the effectiveness &amp; increases their size.</li>
    <li> only 3 stars because they are small. i didn&#x27;t realize how small, but they are about the size of your palm. not ideal when you have to scrub your entire body. i should have read closer when i ordered. but other than the size, good product.</li>
    <li> not great quality but great for the price. thats about all i could ask for i suppose. good enough for me.</li>
    <li> These poufs are on the slightly smaller side but are really dense and get the job done. Plus, for the price, I can afford to change them out every month.</li>
    <li> Bought these smaller sized poufs to go in a gift bag...perfect fit!  Great colors.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
    <li> These are good travel sponges because they&#x27;re smaller than others (I&#x27;ll use them for a couple of weeks when traveling, then throw them away without feeling too guilty because they are pretty inexpensive).  They&#x27;re not as soft as the ones that I usually use, but I&#x27;m only using them for travel, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> smaller size, does the job and can discard them after a month or so since there is 8 of them</li>
    <li> Fell apart with three uses not good</li>
    <li> These seem to be a good quality for the price. They are soft as advertised, softer than most cheap ones I have bought in stores. However, I only got three colors, and the colors are not very pretty. If you don&#x27;t mind that, I would say they are a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I hate how sometimes you can buy these in a variety of places and they are so bulky, but these are the perfect size and are very comfortable to use even for my 9 year old daughter. Great product I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Product is acceptable.  It is a little more stiff than similar products.  Perhaps I need to give them more to soften.</li>
    <li> Great bath mesh thingies.  I&#x27;m a dude and don&#x27;t normally admit that I use bath mesh thingies......but the truth is.....I do.  I like these darn things.  They work great and fun fact; chicks dig guys that smell good.  Two things that are a must in my thrown room; 3-ply poopaper and bath mesh thingies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these now.  Your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, lover, mistress, random person standing strangely close to me on the train or whoever, will be very appreciative of the fact that you now have bath mesh thingies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell great after using them (preferably with some soap.......in the shower.......or bath)</li>
    <li> These pouf&#x27;s are super small.  I thought it was a packing thing so I&#x27;ve used one for about a week now to give it time to &amp;#34;expand&amp;#34;.  Without closing my fist the whole thing pretty much fits within my hand, from wrist to fingertip (about 8 inches, 5.5&amp;#34; across the hand).  It&#x27;s taken some getting used to, but the mesh folds aren&#x27;t unraveling from the center tie like alot of the cheaper poufs have done in the past. I&#x27;m not gentle with these things at all, so the fact that it&#x27;s still holding together speaks volumes.  For the price and quantitiy this is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> These are ok. They do not come in all colors, you will receive whatever color they give you. We received 2 pink,2 blue and 4 white. I wanted all different colors for each of us in a family of 8.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I used to use them so often and was phobic of bacteria. Now, I find that products shouldn&#x27;t need to be accompanied by loofahs, if they have what they need inside them. I don&#x27;t use products that are tested on animals and loofahs are another component that just goes to the landfills.&lt;br /&gt;Best to get a product that doesn&#x27;t need the extra scrub and save the environment one less bit of litter.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same sponge for a couple months the colors are kinda feminine since I am a guy but who really looks in your washroom anyway.  I have been saving a lot of money on body wash because I use twice as much soap when I am not using the pouf sponge.  Doesn&#x27;t really mold or get disgusting?</li>
    <li> Great Value!  These are terrific!</li>
    <li> These are a real bargain for the bulk set.  The color combination is fine, and they arrive in just a duple of days.  The last like any other batch sponge.</li>
    <li> These are a bargain. The meshes are on the small side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to big fluffy poufs that hold a lot of shower gel.  These poufs are rough and tiny. They definitely don&#x27;t get the job done.  Spend your money on nice, soft ones at your local CVS or Rite-Aid.</li>
    <li> Mesh pouf sponges at the supermarket are beginning to become hard to find and very expensive ($2+), so I stumbled upon these at Amazon.  While they are smaller than what I am used to, they do the job well.</li>
    <li> These are regular sized body poufs but it doesn&#x27;t really say that in the description. I was worried they were going to be mini, travel sized poufs because the price was pretty cheap comparatively.</li>
    <li> The Best Product. I love it. Great quality for the price. I ordered it before and I loved it so much that in two weeks I have ordered one more because I was afraid if they were going to run out. LOL. Thanks. Great Great Pouf.</li>
    <li> I thought that, since these were not expensive, that they might be scratchy. They&#x27;re soft. The colors are bright except for the orange which looks more like a burnst orange color. But it&#x27;s still pleasing.</li>
    <li> They are perfect, and actually nice quality! Better than what I would buy at CVS, Walgreens, or Target.. and cheaper too. :)</li>
    <li> i like small lufas better, they dont fall apart as easily. these are great especially for the price</li>
    <li> These are JUNK! The first one I used came apart in less then 3 minutes! I had about three feet of fabric hanging from my hand!</li>
    <li> Not too much to say about these other than I am satisfied with them. I have not had any of these fall apart or come unraveled yet, and they are not too rough that irritate my skin either. I would recommend them. Sure beats buying them one-by-one at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a lot smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> I expected from the image that I would get a variety of colors. However, I received only three colors (2 blue, 2 pink, 2 purple). Also, when they say small, they mean it. These are more of a mini travel pouf. The cord... simply is not a cord. It is a string tied around the mesh and a ribbon tied onto the string. These might get about a month or two use before they fall apart. Overall, I am not impressed with this item, but they will work well for my gym bag and travel.</li>
    <li> These are about the size of a softball, if that helps.  I find these much easier to use as they are easier to squeeze, so they clean thoroughly and allow for less expensive liquid soap use.</li>
    <li> These are worth it and they&#x27;re low cost!</li>
    <li> Kinda rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> These are small and fall apart easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are usable for the price, but won&#x27;t last very long. I recommend spending more to get something a little nicer.</li>
    <li> Good deal on a multi-pack.  Big enough, but not too big.  These hold up pretty well.</li>
    <li> I like these pouf, poofs, however you want to say it!  They just fill your hand, not too big, not too small to get the job done though.  I received 2 of 3 different colors, and they last long enough for the good price.  Nothing lasts forever right?  I do get about 3-4 months of good use out of them, and then it&#x27;s on to the next in the pack.  I&#x27;ll be getting these over pricey brand names that last just as long from now on!</li>
    <li> So far out loofa has lived up to the test. No falling apart. Nice purchase for the price. Very good buy</li>
    <li> Pretty simple product, but order these periodically to have around for guests that might stay at my house.  For the cost my guests appreciate them and if they get tossed after they leave it&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is just as good as any I see at local stores around here.  Just cheaper in price!</li>
    <li> Stated they were palm size, not true they are huge. I am looking for truly palm size.</li>
    <li> These are a bit small.</li>
    <li> They were much too coarse. However they didn&#x27;t come apart easily so it depends on what you want from a loofa. Small is right, slightly bigger than a baseball.</li>
    <li> Great value, for 6 of them. Perfect size for the shower, not too big like other ones. They are great for traveling.</li>
    <li> If the loofas were a tad larger, my review would have been five stars.  They are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more to say. They are very dink poufs. Very low quality. lower than low! ............. Garbage in fact.</li>
    <li> THese are normal everyday puffs, but the mini small size - like 3&amp;#34;.  It may say so, but I thought I was getting full size puffs (6&amp;#34;) so these are a little less luxurious and foamy- palm-sized.  Nothing wrong, just know you want the baby puffs.</li>
    <li> these are more travel size than &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased a single, much larger sponge previously.  I liked it, but it was a little TOO large for my hand.  These are the PERFECT size and work just as well as the larger sponge.  I love being able to use a smaller amount of shower gel, get plenty of lather and my skin is so smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I would definitely recommend these sponges and will make sure I always have these!</li>
</ol>
