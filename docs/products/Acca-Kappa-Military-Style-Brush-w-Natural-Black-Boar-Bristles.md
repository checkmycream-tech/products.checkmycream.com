      <li>Thinking at first I can detangle with them, but then I realised that they are good for smoothing and styling hair.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with this very manly upgrade to my plastic Goody brush.</li>
      <li>Works very well and also looks great and very well</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for, good stiff bristles, very nice handle.  </li>
      <li>THAT was my initial review but after softening the bristles using a technique that I discovered online, this is quite possibly the BEST brush that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>The bristles are as stiff as I like, it hold nicely in your hand, it spreads the oils great through out my hair turning softer and smoother, it is easily manipulated because there is no long handle to be in the way</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of wood it is, but it weighs a little more than you would think a block of pine would, and it doesn&#x27;t mar with a fingernail.</li>
      <li>Nice deep luster to the honey toned wood.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>weight gives the right amount of pressure on the hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>If you like a VERY VERY stiff brush, this would def be a great purchase..</li>
      <li>The brush fits perfectly in my large hands.</li>
      <li>And those work very well.</li>
      <li>I was first surprised by the weight.</li>
      <li>For the price I feel that I received a high quality item.</li>
      <li>Specially that the bristles looked long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Well made while it is a little stiff as it should be it does a great job on my hair.</li>
      <li>The bristles are as stiff as I could possibly need for my coarse Mediterranean hair, and they feel good on my scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not new to Boar Bristle and love the military style brushes.</li>
      <li>I gave four stars because the reinforced bristles apparently means boar bristles reinforced with plastic bristles, but I think it would be too soft if it were only natural boar.    </li>
      <li>My only problem was that they made my hair flat on near the scalp and well, I did not like that.</li>

    <li> The bristles were harder than I thought they would be!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush for my dad who is a big fan of the military hairbrush. He is totally pleased with it. I saw it this weekend and it is beautiful. The color and the quality of the wood is fantastic and the bristles are the perfect stiffness. I looked at brushes 3x the price of this one and for my money this one is just as good!</li>
    <li> This was kind of an impulse buy for me, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I regretted it or not until it arrived. This is a GREAT BRUSH! Unboxing the brush I was first surprised by the weight. I don&#x27;t know what kind of wood it is, but it weighs a little more than you would think a block of pine would, and it doesn&#x27;t mar with a fingernail. Nice deep luster to the honey toned wood. Does not have gold lettering as pictured, but is elegantly embossed with &#x27;ACCA KAPPA&#x27;. Also embossed is &#x27;Setole Rinforzate Made in Italy&#x27; Which I guess means reinforced bristles. The bristles are as stiff as I could possibly need for my coarse Mediterranean hair, and they feel good on my scalp. I gave four stars because the reinforced bristles apparently means boar bristles reinforced with plastic bristles, but I think it would be too soft if it were only natural boar.    I am very pleased with this very manly upgrade to my plastic Goody brush.</li>
    <li> Well constructed.  Compact for travel.  Feels very comfortable in my hand.  Very pleased with this product and would happily recommend to others</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This brush is a extremely high quality brush but is also extremely stiff and rough\\&quot;. THAT was my initial review but after softening the bristles using a technique that I discovered online, this is quite possibly the BEST brush that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s the perfect weight and has the perfect spacing of bristles. It costly compared to a Diane or Annie but well worth it. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever have to buy another brush and I&#x27;ve bought dozens of brushes in my lifetime. I&#x27;m actually going to buy the white bristled one just for good measure.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for a long time.It will last a lifetime. The previous hairbrush was not flat after 50 years.</li>
    <li> This brush is a great buy for the price.  Bristles are firm and handle is palm perfect with excellent wood stock.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a really good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. McNally</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother, and he is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> If you want a GREAT brush this is the one. Well made while it is a little stiff as it should be it does a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> I had issues :) with BBBs. Thinking at first I can detangle with them, but then I realised that they are good for smoothing and styling hair. So I started experimenting with that. My only problem was that they made my hair flat on near the scalp and well, I did not like that. I then realised it is all about the direction in which you brush. So once I got that figured out I gave BBB another try. I have a few Spornette ones. And those work very well. But having thick hair I felt I need something strainer to penetrate my hair, massage the scalp and reach all sides.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a BBB that is all wood with no cushion for the bristles, and you don&#x27;t have a lot of options there. I saw this one and though it is intended for men I decided to give it a try. Specially that the bristles looked long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it is one of my best purchases ever, no regrets there. The bristles are as stiff as I like, it hold nicely in your hand, it spreads the oils great through out my hair turning softer and smoother, it is easily manipulated because there is no long handle to be in the way, it&#x27;s weight gives the right amount of pressure on the hair and scalp. It is simply a great brush. Works very well and also looks great and very well made.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a BBB get this one .&lt;br /&gt;P.S I have thick hip length hair.</li>
    <li> It is quite possibly the stiffest bristled brush you&#x27;ll find, it&#x27;s not for everyone but if you&#x27;re tired of replacing brush after brush this maybe the brush for you.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my hipster-doofus brother-in-law and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, good stiff bristles, very nice handle.  This is a good value, highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. For the price I feel that I received a high quality item. It also makes a great beard brush!</li>
    <li> The best brush I have used. grooms well, and fits nicely in your hand. A lot easier at brushing your hair than a brush with a handle. Even my girlfriend likes it.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.  Fits my hand well and bristles do a great job on my hair.  A good replacement for the brush I had for 35 years.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he cannot stop raving about it.  Bristles are perfectly &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; and exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for grooming my beard. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision. The brush fits perfectly in my large hands. Buy one.</li>
    <li> Acca Kappa makes amazing brushes &amp; this one is just perfect for your guy to use daily.  Particularly nice for graying hair to keep it&#x27;s moisture distributed.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair brush.  If you need a mans hair brush, this is the one to pick. Will last a lifetime.  Would also make an excellent gift for someone who you don&#x27;t know their clothing/shoe/hat size.  The quality of this brush is really unbelievable.  You cannot find anything like this at Walmart or Macys.</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely beautiful, and for the price a steal. I&#x27;m not new to Boar Bristle and love the military style brushes. Sadly though the bristles were so damn tuff on this brush it tore my scalp apart and gave me dandruff all over my head. If you like a VERY VERY stiff brush, this would def be a great purchase.. Otherwise I&#x27;d keep looking.</li>
