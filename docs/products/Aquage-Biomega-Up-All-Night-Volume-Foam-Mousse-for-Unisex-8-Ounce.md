    <li> Great product for giving you body.  Even if it gets on your clothes it does not stain.</li>
    <li> This is a foam mousse which gives great volume to thin or fine hair, as well as adding a touch of the most wonderfully clean fragrance.  I like that it adds firmness to my hair but does not leave it feeling stiff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...... One of the few that really works.</li>
    <li> Very good size definitely need to use a lot of it though otherwise hair will be frizzy</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product after I told her how many other products I have tried. I have baby fine ear lobe length hair. I can simply put this product in after my shower, brush through and blow dry with my round brush and go.  It holds all day without feeling dry or hard and, if I want to pull half my hair up I can without showing my scalp. Because my hair roots now stand away from my scalp it also keeps me cooler too.  I live in DC and the humidity doesn&#x27;t seen to cause much issues (a few days when everyone had issues, but that&#x27;s everyone!).  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am gluten free and this product seems to work.  I would recommend it for anyone who has the same problem I have.</li>
    <li> The best volume foam I&#x27;ve found on the market. A little goes a long way. A friend told me to try it, I&#x27;ve been sold on it ever since.</li>
    <li> Great product. Well priced. Gives me the right amount of hold without being gummy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used aquage volume mousse for several years but first time to try the All Night mousse. I have fine hair and this stuff is fantastic</li>
    <li> Product a waste of money. I have baby fine hair. My hair wouldn&#x27;t hold any curl at all when using it.  Very frustrating to spend nearly $20.00 when product doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products.  This is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Works to keep my curls or pull them out.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the use of the Aquage Biomega Volume Mousse, it holds well and I like it narrow flow so that it get right to the scalp.</li>

    <li> I love this mouse product.  It gives a lot of volume to my hair after shampooing.  I t is the best product I have used in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Mousse isn&#x27;t sticky on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> would not purchase again. this product left my hair feeling heavy and with a dull coating. May work well for others but not me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Gives you the style you want without feeling like you glued your hair.  Not stiff but it will stay.</li>
    <li> Up All Night gives texture to my fine, salt/pepper hair which is cut in long layers to a length just below the earlobes.&lt;br /&gt;There is no objectionable coating on my hair and I can run my fingers through it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Everything perfect about transaction.</li>
    <li> I got a sample size from my hairstylist yesterday and LOVE this product! I have soft, thick, white/gray hair and \\&quot;Up All Night\\&quot; held my style all day, was not stiff, and the smell is not overpowering. I wish it were not so expensive though...</li>
    <li> Love this volume foam!!!  Makes my fine hair more manageable.  I really like this whole line of products. The conditioner is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does work. I actually had some volume to my hair. What I did not like about it was it left my hair feeling, I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. It wasn&#x27;t heavy. My hair wasn&#x27;t tangled or anything like that. I could not run my fingers thru my hair. Almost sticky, but not really. I have super thin straight hair that will not hold a curl. With this in it held a wave from my curling iron. I didn&#x27;t like the fact I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers thru my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair</li>
    <li> I have fine, hard to manage hair and this mousse works great to give it body and control with a natural feel all day long.  It leaves my hair shiny and I love the light scent.  My beautician used it first on my hair and I liked it so much I bought some for home.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love the application, that I don&#x27;t have to put it in my hands first.  It also provides good hold for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mousse products I&#x27;ve tried when it comes to body and hold. It&#x27;s a bit sticky on the hands but overall I like it and will keep purchasing. Sometimes I use it combined with a styling lotion for a smoother look but while still maintaining the body. The price is a little lower through Amazon than at my old salon so it saved me a trip.</li>
    <li> Tried a small sample bottle from my local salon.  So decided to purchase this large bottle - Nice and fluffy and strong holding.</li>
    <li> This holds wonderful and is not sticky like most are I will be more than happy to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Not as great as other Aquage products. Not any noticeable volume, little disappointed with product.</li>
    <li> Spent a fortune on mousse only to trash them all. This is the only mousse that actually provides true volume. It&#x27;s a bit sticky when you blow out your hair but that means it works!  It gives a nice lift to flat hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
