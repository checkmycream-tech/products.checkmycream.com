      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>Her twist look so healthy!!</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams &amp; find this to be among the best!</li>
      <li>Jcpenny salon has a lot of good products, that&#x27;s cost an arm &amp; leg or they won&#x27;t sale.</li>
      <li>But thank good for Amazon.</li>
      <li>This product is good for twisting and braiding hair</li>

      <li>This was my 1st time using this product &amp; I can honestly say this is it.  </li>
      <li>The twist and defining cream smoothed my hair nicely and made the curl pattern pop while I was applying the product.  </li>
      <li>It does go on very \\&quot;white\\&quot; in the hair as you twist, but if you have a hood dryer, it dries and clears perfectly.</li>
      <li>Defining Crème Gel did a good job but Defining Custard is without question the better product for my head of hair.</li>

      <li>I thought this line would be great because this was the only line that I would use when I was perming my hair and loved it!</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>

      <li>Love it will buy again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Twists on stretched damp hair works best for me!</li>
      <li>and I like this pretty good.</li>
      <li>👍 great for natural hair.</li>
      <li>I love Keracare&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so soft and great curls.</li>
      <li>This product is great for those with natural hair.  </li>
      <li>A good day for me is getting in challenging am workout and having defined shiny, soft curls with NO FLAKES.</li>
      <li>I dislike the strong scent, takes a couple of days to weaken.</li>
      <li>but this was a HUGE miss.</li>
      <li>it give it a smooth and shinning look.  </li>
      <li>My hair looked fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  </li>
      <li>The price made get over the overwhelmingly strong sweet smell.</li>
      <li>No need to look for more my hair had more shine  &amp; soft.  </li>
      <li>Shine lasts for days, has a nice soft flexible hold.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely fell in love with the results.</li>
      <li>my hair was full of flakes.  </li>
      <li>My hair was super soft, had a nice shine, but the leftover residue was a problem.</li>
      <li>A bit sticky and product builds up quickly</li>
      <li>Smells good and can be used on semi dry hair.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair which worked best with this creamy cream.</li>
      <li>I have tried several products since going natural but this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>Her hair appeared to be professionally curled after and she received so many compliments.</li>
      <li>One of my two favorite lines for natural hair.</li>
      <li>I love how soft and curly it makes my hair.  </li>
      <li>they were soft, shiny, healthy, and they held.</li>
      <li>I tried this product when it first was introduced.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft, frizz free</li>
      <li>my hair looks and how pretty my curls and twists look.</li>
      <li>pretty</li>
      <li>but it works the same and helps my curls have more texture</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>Only drawback as someone who is sensitive to smells - it has a very strong smell although not unpleasant it does take about 24hrs to dissipate.</li>
      <li>It defines my hair without leaving excessive buildup, smells nice, goes on easily, and turns my hair shrinkage into soft, relaxed, well-defined curl.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take more than 30 minutes from washing to styling plus another 30 minutes under hair dryer to dry hair</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this product and it works very well on my daughters hair.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this gel to work</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>However, can be gooey if too much is used.</li>
      <li>I am a natural female with dyed bright red hair, this product leaves my hair shiny, soft and defined.</li>
      <li>My hair is super manageable and the curls last a very longtime.</li>
      <li>Like most naturalistas I have narrowed down my stash</li>
      <li>but I think this has more moisture and shine, and costs a LOT less.  </li>
      <li>After washing, apply the following products as leave-ins in five sections (front, right side, left side, crown - top of head- and back of head): WEN cleansing conditioner and WEN oil and styling cream and KeraCare Hair Milk and Defining Custard for Curls/Coils.</li>
      <li>I was using the Shea Moisture line, now I think I’ve found something NEW.  </li>
      <li>But it makes sense that a product that does so well with processed hair wouldn&#x27;t live up to the natural hair care standards, and that it does not.</li>
      <li>Being new to the natural world, I tried this to see if it would define my curls</li>
      <li>Kera Care in general makes really good high quality stuff, but its so expensive, so</li>
      <li>This product is just what i was looking for ever since I&#x27;ve gone all natural.  </li>
      <li>Supports my natural curl.</li>
      <li>I can say is that so far she likes it, I also bought the leave in conditioner, so I presume it is a winner in her eyes.</li>
      <li>About 5 weeks ago, I bought a sample set of KeraCare Natural Textures line products from JC Penny.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft and conditioned without any residue or flaking.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s transitioning from keratin treatment and is trying to define her natural curl pattern.</li>
      <li>I like it because it does define my natural curls.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know it would be as thick because I have had it be more silky before</li>
      <li>I used this in my daughters hair for bantu knot outs and was shocked at how beautiful and soft they turned out.</li>
      <li>Highly reccoment the twist and define cream, its not too heavy or greasy and moisturizes my hair very well!</li>
      <li>I use for bantu knot outs and it is silky and soft with just enough hold.</li>
      <li>Left a soft texture, non greasy sheen to my 3yr olds hair.</li>
      <li>I have short natural Afro and this works well to give it shine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If your looking for a twisting cream that adds moisture, shine and hold, this is it!  Shine lasts for days, has a nice soft flexible hold.  Very similar to Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Meringue, but I think this has more moisture and shine, and costs a LOT less.  5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> keeps hair nice and moisturized very good for natural hair on braids as a conditioner. will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams &amp; find this to be among the best! It leaves my hair so soft and great curls. I have 4b hair &amp; have a hard time finding a cream that works. For 3 days a after using,I just Spritz with a little water, use some of my honeychild 4b moisturizing cream &amp; retwist in large flat cornrows .on the 4th day I use the cream again.with this combo my shedding &amp; breakage has drastically reduced. I just wish Amazon sold my honeychild cream.</li>
    <li> I have short natural Afro and this works well to give it shine. I have very thick hair which worked best with this creamy cream. Smells good and can be used on semi dry hair.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of reviews about this product and decided to bite the bullet and buy it online. I was not impressed at all. This was very heavy and sticky on my hair. Definitely not a product that I will going out of my way to purchase again.</li>
    <li> The Avlon Keracare line is super amazing!  This product is just what i was looking for ever since I&#x27;ve gone all natural.  My hair is super manageable and the curls last a very longtime.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those with natural hair.  It leaves your hair soft and conditioned without any residue or flaking. Only drawback as someone who is sensitive to smells - it has a very strong smell although not unpleasant it does take about 24hrs to dissipate.</li>
    <li> Smells good and gave my hair shine but left a sticky buildup and flaked like bad  gel.</li>
    <li> They used this to twist my dreads at the hair dresser, but they won&#x27;t sale it in the store.  My dreads don&#x27;t take forever to dry with this product &amp; they are flexible not stiff. Jcpenny salon has a lot of good products, that&#x27;s cost an arm &amp; leg or they won&#x27;t sale. But thank good for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Holds  and curls.  That&#x27;s what it says and that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
    <li> Avlon Keracare Twist and Define Cream does what it says. I use for bantu knot outs and it is silky and soft with just enough hold. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several products since going natural but this is the best by far. I use it at night when I twist my hair and the next day the waves and curls are well defined</li>
    <li> I used it to retwist locs. It didn&#x27;t really have a tight hold like I thought. But I have only used it once maybe I will use it again and see what happens</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this product for my Step Mother, I bought the product for her after she was told about the product.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that so far she likes it, I also bought the leave in conditioner, so I presume it is a winner in her eyes.</li>
    <li> I am a 2a curly girl and I like this pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Although this product is supposed to be for \\&quot;twist\\&quot;  I used this in my daughters hair for bantu knot outs and was shocked at how beautiful and soft they turned out. Her hair appeared to be professionally curled after and she received so many compliments. I learned of this product on curly Nikki&#x27;s blog and am grateful. The product did not dry the hair at all but instead left it soft and shiny. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it does wonders for my hair. It softens my hair while bringing out my curl pattern. Once I shampoo my hair, I apply the leave in conditioner and then add the twist and define cream to twist my hair. I get compliments about hiw shiny my hair looks and how pretty my curls and twists look. I would definitely recommend thisprodproduct. The only downside to keracare natural textures line is that I can only order this product.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely GREAT!!!  I love how soft and curly it makes my hair.  It defines my hair without leaving excessive buildup, smells nice, goes on easily, and turns my hair shrinkage into soft, relaxed, well-defined curl.  It releases the tightly coiled hair and has the power to elongate my curls.  My hair looked fabulous.  I used it as a hair set on perm rods, and it also works with shingling of the hair.  When shingling, you will notice immediate release of your curl pattern.  Wonderful product and glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> really love that this is all-natural!  I was skeptical but, does everything it says it will do. The hold is superb.</li>
    <li> 👍 great for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I’ve searched so long to find something that will define curls and elongate my curls.  As soon as I put this cream on my hair, it curls up. When I put it in my hair for my twist..OMG….The next morning is just unbelievable.  My curls are so  pretty I don’t want to break them apart. It does a weird smell, but nothing I can’t live with. I was using the Shea Moisture line, now I think I’ve found something NEW.  I will be order another jar ASAP.</li>
    <li> I had the most defined twists after using this Twist and Define cream.  No crunch, no flakes...LOTS of definition.  This is one product that will go on my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; list.</li>
    <li> I cannot walk around all day smelling like household chemicals.  One of the things I hate about being natural is the smell from these products.  I can say it was a nice curl but I could not wait long enough for the dry result because the smelll was overwhelming and I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> left a lot of grit....flake like substances...it held and was shinny..but that grit was a big problem</li>
    <li> Its been 7 months since my BC and I was tired of wearing wigs so I set out to find a hair style that I could wear because my twa wasn&#x27;t cuttin it. I made an appointment with a hairdresser and she introduced this product to use instead of Miss Jessie&#x27;s because my 4c hair needed serious moisture. I will be buying it again but in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes my twist out look silky.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL MOISTURE, IT HOLDS, AND SHINE.  I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
    <li> there is just soo much thats not right with this in my opinion. i swear this stuff attracts lint ad dust to yuor hair. it took me a few days for me to see what this crem was all about.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this product and it works very well on my daughters hair.  She&#x27;s transitioning from keratin treatment and is trying to define her natural curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I am a natural female with dyed bright red hair, this product leaves my hair shiny, soft and defined. My hair stylist used this product on my hair when she had to re-touch my color and I absolutely fell in love with the results. My hair was soft, frizz free and I had all these tiny little curls all over my head, it was awesome!Also my hair does not flake from this. I wash my hair once a week and I&#x27;m able to get 5 day hair with this product. It made my hair shrink up like crazy, but after a day or two of doing braid outs it stretched out pretty nicely.  It has a slight hold, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, a semi \\&quot;weird smell\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t smell gross and it goes away by like a day.&lt;br /&gt;  I would strongly suggest anyone to buy this product if they&#x27;re looking for some nice defined curls. This works better than the kinky curly in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like it because it does define my natural curls.  Being new to the natural world, I tried this to see if it would define my curls and it does but it leaves my hair crunchy and next day hair on a wash-n-go is a wash and no.</li>
    <li> A good day for me is getting in challenging am workout and having defined shiny, soft curls with NO FLAKES. These two things I can control mostly. I really wanted to like this gel to work however it was a fail. It is also pricey too. Like most naturalistas I have narrowed down my stash but I&#x27;m always on the look out for the holy grail of hair gels etc. This unfortunately leaves my hair with EXTREMELY noticeable white build up a mere 2 hours after I apply it. ARRRGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my third try without a leave-in conditioner base which I thought may have been the culprit. As it turns out this gel and my hair just don&#x27;t like each other. The price made get over the overwhelmingly strong sweet smell. Let me add I love Keracare&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo but this was a HUGE miss. Imagine thinking you look cute and you have all these white flakes in your hair. Not good!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, wonderful shiny twist on 4C hair. However, can be gooey if too much is used. I dislike the strong scent, takes a couple of days to weaken. Chocolate pudding for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twists on stretched damp hair works best for me!</li>
    <li> I tried this product when it first was introduced. I absolutely loved it for my twists. they were soft, shiny, healthy, and they held. It does go on very \\&quot;white\\&quot; in the hair as you twist, but if you have a hood dryer, it dries and clears perfectly. Great product from KeraCare. One of my two favorite lines for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Smells good. I didn&#x27;t know it would be as thick because I have had it be more silky before but it works the same and helps my curls have more texture</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again. Left a soft texture, non greasy sheen to my 3yr olds hair. Her twist look so healthy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once.  You are supposed to use it on wet hair.  I will use again as I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the way my hair turned out, I just think I need to tweak the amount (maybe I used too little).</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time using this product &amp; I can honestly say this is it.  No need to look for more my hair had more shine  &amp; soft.  I will be ordering more in the future. ..Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is good for twisting and braiding hair it give it a smooth and shinning look.  But I am also a Keracare fan. I tend to like thier product.</li>
    <li> I used the hydration &amp; detangling shampoo and the leave in conditioner before using the twist and defining cream to twist my hair. The twist and defining cream smoothed my hair nicely and made the curl pattern pop while I was applying the product.  However, the next day after it dried and I seperated my twist my hair was full of flakes.  My hair was super soft, had a nice shine, but the leftover residue was a problem.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I have been using it for about the last two weeks.  Kera Care in general makes really good high quality stuff, but its so expensive, so finding this here for 11.00 was great.  Highly reccoment the twist and define cream, its not too heavy or greasy and moisturizes my hair very well! great stuff!</li>
    <li> I use it for my wash &#x27;n go.  My curls are defined and soft--not crunchy.  Only wish it came in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Helps to create great twists. Supports my natural curl. A bit sticky and product builds up quickly BUT the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
    <li> This is the worst twist and defining cream that I have ever used. I thought this line would be great because this was the only line that I would use when I was perming my hair and loved it! But it makes sense that a product that does so well with processed hair wouldn&#x27;t live up to the natural hair care standards, and that it does not.</li>
    <li> I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  this product left my hair dry a using it.</li>
    <li> Hey I like this stuff, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  It keeps your hair well moisturized.  This is a great buy and I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I used Twist &amp; Define Cream for three to four weeks (once per week after washing hair) until my 2 ounce sample jar was empty. I used the product to add moisture to my hair; I do not twist, braid, etc. my hair. I applied the product in five sections (see below), pulled my hair and let the curls bounce back automatically. My hair felt good and lasted for about a week. However, product did flake over time which I did not like.  Previously, I used Design Essentials&#x27; Defining Crème Gel for about 3 months (hairdresser uses product on my hair). I thought Twist &amp; Define Cream and Defining Crème Gel did a good job but Defining Custard is without question the better product for my head of hair. About 5 weeks ago, I bought a sample set of KeraCare Natural Textures line products from JC Penny. It cost about $25, paid $18 with a coupon.  Sample pack contained 2 ounces each of the following products: Hair Milk, Leave-In Conditioner, Twist &amp; Define Cream, Butter Cream and Defining Custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair routine: Use WEN cleansing conditioner and condition with Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner using a steamer or WEN remoist treatment without a steamer or heat. After washing, apply the following products as leave-ins in five sections (front, right side, left side, crown - top of head- and back of head): WEN cleansing conditioner and WEN oil and styling cream and KeraCare Hair Milk and Defining Custard for Curls/Coils. Comb through products, pull sections of hair taut and then release and my curls come back. Doesn&#x27;t take more than 30 minutes from washing to styling plus another 30 minutes under hair dryer to dry hair or you skip the dryer with a wash and go. FYI - I do not co-wash or reapply water or any including steamer time other product after I wash my hair; my hair lasts and holds moisture and shine all over until my hair is washed a week later. (African American Woman with 3C/4A curly hair - when straight, my hair is a little longer than shoulder length.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luckto everyone on their hair journey! K.P.</li>
