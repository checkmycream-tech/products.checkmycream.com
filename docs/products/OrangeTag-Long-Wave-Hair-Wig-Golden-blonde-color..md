      <li>This wig is amazing.</li>
      <li>nice for a costume wig holloween</li>
      <li>but I bought it because I liked how the bangs swept,</li>
      <li>Okay, but wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
      <li>This photo was taken by a blogger who really liked our costumes.</li>
      <li>That was kind of a bummer</li>
      <li>It was fun to wear!!!</li>
      <li>After going through treatment I needed the perfect wig to look normal.</li>
      <li>was a perfect fit, and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>i love this hair.</li>
      <li>This wig is exponentially better than what you could get at a halloween store but not even close to the quality of even a $50-$75 wig you can find at a weave store.</li>
      <li>The wig wasn&#x27;t as curly as pictured, which was even better for me.</li>
      <li>And That&#x27;s Sexy To Me.</li>
      <li>so it is works okay that way.</li>
      <li>I love the wig but the hair keeps coming out of it</li>
      <li>So happy to feel normal!</li>
      <li>which is first for any wig I own, and I own a lot.</li>
      <li>The hair is not as realistic as the photo appears however great for the money</li>
      <li>especially good for the price, slightly different color but overall a good buy!</li>
      <li>thank you so much for getting to me on time she loved</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s kind of like dolls hair as in it doesn&#x27;t carry a static charge very well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a beautiful wig, I would definitely recommend it</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
      <li>so smooth and easily manageable.</li>
      <li>I strongly get the impression that it states the wigs price was lowered when it was truly meant to be a cheap wig.</li>
      <li>the material is nice however it looks nothing like real hair.</li>
      <li>Really nice looking wig, but It had straight cut bangs which wasnt what i was expecting.</li>
      <li>oh well it was cheap</li>
      <li>It does not tangle and rat up like cheap wigs often do.  </li>
      <li>Cheap....</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged just fine.</li>
      <li>It certainly is not high quality, but it is attractive and playful.</li>
      <li>not even good enough to wear as a costume wig to a costume party</li>
      <li>Not bad at all</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s not a bad buy, but here&#x27;s some thing</li>
      <li>I wore this and laughed all night long.</li>
      <li>so it made me very self-conscious when I put a cute hat on or something to cover the net I liked it</li>
      <li>This is an inexpensive wig and surprisingly has lasted a very long time.</li>
      <li>It is very versatile and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>It served its purpose during the 3 days I was at comic con, dressed as Buffy!</li>
      <li>The tips are lighter than I imagined, but overall an amazing wig for the price.</li>
      <li>Strangely lifelike....</li>
      <li>natural looking and good head cup-regular adult size</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t even care about the hair quality, as I knew I would only wear it once.</li>
      <li>Nice blonde color as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the one on the right</li>
      <li>Nice long Emma Swan wig as we cal it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really natural looking and easy to care for.</li>
      <li>I wore this wig for a full night of dancing at a high volume club.</li>
      <li>;).  </li>
      <li>Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t exactly take care of it as I knew I was going to throw it away after the weekend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but misrepresented.</li>
      <li>part and bangs are pretty horrendous</li>
      <li>Looks exactly as displayed.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I dressed as Elle Driver from Kill Bill for a Comic Con.  </li>
      <li>I bought this wig to do my first ever cosplay.  </li>
      <li>won&#x27;t look like real hair but fun for a costume.</li>
      <li>Looks real!</li>
      <li>The first time I wore this wig I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars</li>
      <li>Pretty high quality for the price!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s okay that it indeed looks like a wig and not natural hair.</li>
      <li>It is easy to comb or brush back out.  </li>
      <li>I can easily see using it for future characters.  </li>
      <li>I am a male and it fit my fairly large head.</li>
      <li>The color is very close.</li>
      <li>It is very shiny; and can not be passed off as real.</li>
      <li>Not as much hair as in the picture.</li>
      <li>If the wearer had a hat on, the wig could almost look like real hair.</li>
      <li>This wig is ZERO like the picture the bangs are eyebrow length and straight across.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this so far is that it&#x27;s made entirely of synthetic hair.</li>
      <li>Very soft and very real feeling.  </li>
      <li>mainly the front hair line for mine</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s only worth</li>
      <li>So overall it&#x27;s a nice little purchase if you can over look it&#x27;s flaws.</li>
      <li>I wear extensions very frequently</li>
      <li>what I paid which the ad states is $71 less than original price.</li>
      <li>Really soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Soft</li>
      <li>Hair falls out a lot and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
      <li>Any tangles I&#x27;ve had so far I could finger comb out</li>
      <li>, some people have said theirs was thin on top mine is not so that y very per wig too.</li>
      <li>I would highly reccomend investing in a synthetic hair maintenance spray (can purchase at any beauty supply store) if you plan to wear multiple times.</li>
      <li>Expected a finer quality since I&#x27;ve bought cheaper wigs (about 4x less than this) with a better quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was fun to wear!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It is very shiny; and can not be passed off as real. The top of the wig is thin, so when you move the bangs out of your eyes tracks are visible.</li>
    <li> I love the wig but the hair keeps coming out of it</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to do my first ever cosplay.  I dressed as Elle Driver from Kill Bill for a Comic Con.  This wig is great for cosplaying.  It breaths and won&#x27;t make your head sweat even after hours of walking around on a crowded Con floor.  It does not tangle and rat up like cheap wigs often do.  It is easy to comb or brush back out.  It is very versatile and easy to style.  I think it is one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I can easily see using it for future characters.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 stars is that under bright lights, it is noticeable that the wig is fake as it is a bit too shiny.  It&#x27;s not a wig that someone should use as a regular wig for everyday use.  I have attached a photo of me wearing the wig.  I&#x27;m the one on the right ;).  This photo was taken by a blogger who really liked our costumes.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly as displayed. Very impressed with how the hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> It certainly is not high quality, but it is attractive and playful.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting won&#x27;t even stay on</li>
    <li> Very thin.  Wearing it in a pony tail so it is works okay that way.</li>
    <li> color is good, wig is great quality but the bangs are cut awful, i need to add extensions to the front because the bangs are cut to behind my ears</li>
    <li> Nice long Emma Swan wig as we cal it.</li>
    <li> The tips are lighter than I imagined, but overall an amazing wig for the price. It&#x27;s also really natural looking and easy to care for.</li>
    <li> natural looking and good head cup-regular adult size</li>
    <li> No not really the head peace is way to little and doesn&#x27;t stay on like it should</li>
    <li> Good for a costume or if you plan to wear a hat,headband,bandana ect...I loved it until I realized you can tell it&#x27;s a wig were the scalp should be. You can see the netting,I&#x27;ve never seen a wig that didn&#x27;t have a fake scalp so it made me very self-conscious when I put a cute hat on or something to cover the net I liked it but I bought it because I liked how the bangs swept,oh well it was cheap,you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s not a bad buy, but here&#x27;s some thing you should know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone has said it is thin in some places, mainly the front hair line for mine, some people have said theirs was thin on top mine is not so that y very per wig too. A lot of people have also pointed out it looks fake. It does, but it&#x27;s a cosplay wig for a character that oddly enough wears a wig so it&#x27;s okay that it indeed looks like a wig and not natural hair. The bangs come all the way down the front, there is NO natural part in the bangs (at least not on the wig that I purchased). That was kind of a bummer but trimming them should fix the gravitational pull that beckons the wig to cover my face. My favorite thing about this so far is that it&#x27;s made entirely of synthetic hair. So it&#x27;s kind of like dolls hair as in it doesn&#x27;t carry a static charge very well. Which means minimal tangling!! YAY! Any tangles I&#x27;ve had so far I could finger comb out which is first for any wig I own, and I own a lot. So overall it&#x27;s a nice little purchase if you can over look it&#x27;s flaws.</li>
    <li> If you think for one second you can pass this wig off as your own hair, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Even from 10 feet away people will know this is a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part and bangs are pretty horrendous, everyone (even clueless men) will 100% know you are wearing a wig; it is THAT obvious. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend unless it is for a costume, or if wearing a hat is acceptable. It held up fairly well with the exception of the nape area and I wore it three times. Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t exactly take care of it as I knew I was going to throw it away after the weekend. I would highly reccomend investing in a synthetic hair maintenance spray (can purchase at any beauty supply store) if you plan to wear multiple times. Don&#x27;t ever wear when raining and don&#x27;t ever bother trying to wash it; it will never work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wig for a halloween costume and knew that the crown would be covered by a hat the entire night. I honestly didn&#x27;t even care about the hair quality, as I knew I would only wear it once. When it arrived, I was definitely impressed by the hair quality and color. I wear extensions very frequently so I&#x27;ve had my fair share of experience with horrible synthetic hair that knots up in seconds. This wig is exponentially better than what you could get at a halloween store but not even close to the quality of even a $50-$75 wig you can find at a weave store.</li>
    <li> Very soft and very real feeling.  Does shed a little.</li>
    <li> The first time I wore this wig I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars and it photographed beautifully but when I went to wear it a 2nd time it got all tangled and frayed looking and it just looked dry and dull. Brushing and smoothing it out only made it worse and it shed A LOT!  It was weird it was like a one-time use wig.  Not bad at all if you only plan on wearing it once.</li>
    <li> Not as much hair as in the picture.</li>
    <li> Bangs are cut way differently. Does NOT look like this picture at all except for the color. Hair falls out a lot and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
    <li> Had Time To Play With It &amp; Decided I Love It! I Do Side Bangs All The Time It&#x27;s A Tad Shiny, But Other Than That It&#x27;s Soft And I Deal With It Its Very Long And That&#x27;s Sexy To Me. Great For The Price. Just Style To Your Liking! ;)</li>
    <li> i love this hair. so smooth and easily manageable. was a perfect fit, and looks very natural. i recommend this!</li>
    <li> Cheap....not even good enough to wear as a costume wig to a costume party</li>
    <li> Looks like a Halloween party wig</li>
    <li> Pretty high quality for the price! The color is very close. The wig wasn&#x27;t as curly as pictured, which was even better for me. If the wearer had a hat on, the wig could almost look like real hair. I noticed minimal knotting, therefore knocking off one star. I am a male and it fit my fairly large head. It served its purpose during the 3 days I was at comic con, dressed as Buffy!</li>
    <li> The hair is not as realistic as the photo appears however great for the money</li>
    <li> You must be kidding use for how u wen</li>
    <li> I did not like the finish</li>
    <li> Not as curly or long as I thought. Little disappointed with it. :(</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for a full night of dancing at a high volume club. Not only did everyone ask if I dyed my hair, it stayed in place all night long.</li>
    <li> This is cheaply made, sheds horribly, the top bang area is so very fake looking...it&#x27;s only worth what I paid which the ad states is $71 less than original price. I strongly get the impression that it states the wigs price was lowered when it was truly meant to be a cheap wig. It&#x27;s pretty, but misrepresented.</li>
    <li> excellent product great price!</li>
    <li> good for a cheapish wig. won&#x27;t look like real hair but fun for a costume.</li>
    <li> thank you so much for getting to me on time she loved</li>
    <li> Really nice looking wig, but It had straight cut bangs which wasnt what i was expecting. It&#x27;s also not as curly as pictured.</li>
    <li> This wig is ZERO like the picture the bangs are eyebrow length and straight across. the material is nice however it looks nothing like real hair.</li>
    <li> not like this picture bad quality</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my Martine Bancroft cosplay. It looks as it does on the model in the photo and the curls lasted through three wears before it tangled along my back. A little wig saver and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
    <li> Okay, but wasn&#x27;t so good. More like dirty blonde than golden brown. Uneven dye and tips are very white. Dull. Back of the wig is nothing like it is shown. Need to trim and restyle, and possibly redye. Expected a finer quality since I&#x27;ve bought cheaper wigs (about 4x less than this) with a better quality.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive wig and surprisingly has lasted a very long time. Does shed a little but it&#x27;s a beautiful wig, I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Yellow hair not blonde. not a nice color never used it not even ones very fake looking.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig! You can wear it any wear! Great deal for synthetic wig! Looks real!</li>
    <li> So happy this arrived before my party! After going through treatment I needed the perfect wig to look normal. It arrived quickly and was packaged just fine. So happy to feel normal!</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. Really soft and shiny. Nice blonde color as well.</li>
    <li> Is less realistic than the photo makes it out to be</li>
    <li> nice for a costume wig holloween</li>
    <li> it wasnt anything like the picture</li>
    <li> I wore this and laughed all night long. A total transformation! Strangely lifelike....</li>
    <li> especially good for the price, slightly different color but overall a good buy!</li>
