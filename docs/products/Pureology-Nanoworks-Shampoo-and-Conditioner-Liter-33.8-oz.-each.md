      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is not the original product!  </li>

      <li>I have always used Pureology but now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has been processed since my early 20&#x27;s, I use the Nano line of Pureology and love it!  </li>
      <li>I can also say it is a special product.</li>
      <li>Bought from store right after it won best Conditioner in the USA from Good Housekeeping a few years back.  </li>
      <li>That said, the Pump is really neat - so much more convenient.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is no longer the thick creamy awesome condition it once was.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome!!! I Loooove This product!! The best for your hair!</li>
    <li> Works great without mineral oil. Very expensive though. Still half the price of a salon purchase though. I would recommend even with the price. It is wry concentrated.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware  - This is not the real Pureology Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I purchases the set a while ago as a plastic wrapped duo and just went to use it today.  This is some other shampoo put in the Nanoworks bottle.  This is not the original product!  I had a small bottle that I purchases at a beauty supply store and compared it with this product and they are not even close to the same.  Different color, consistency and smell.  That tells me it&#x27;s a fake. Horrible!</li>
    <li> I also am (probably was) a diehard user of Pureology Nano Work shampoo and conditioner, however after reading the two previous reviews regarding the sale of Purology and the new watered down version I will let everyone know once I use the product I just received.  If it is anything like the previouse reviews, I to will find another product.  Man, the previous product was awesome.  I am sorry to hear that it has been sold to another company and is no longer the same, but watered down.  Good luck to everyone in finding a product that was this great.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there. Your hair feels amazing after you use it. Another plus is it kind of smells like Flex! Through Amazon it was less than half the price of the local beauty supply stores here in Las Vegas.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been happier! It took my years to finally break down and buy Pureology. I reget I didnt spend the money sooner!</li>
    <li> I am one of the faithful die hard users of what used to be a fabulous product, but as the other reviewer wrote, they have been bought out (Pureology has been bought by L&#x27;Oreal) and the conditioner is now definetly watered down. I  have been buying the Liter size bottles here at Amazon for over 3 years, and when I used to pump the conditioner out it was a a very firm pump and the product was thick and rich. Now the pump down it spurts out the watered down version and my hair is dry and not at all supple the way it used to be. Looking for a new product.... Sadley, this is definetly not worth over $100 plus shipping anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used pureology for years, and know exactly how it makes my hair feel, smell and look. The shampoo, when I looked in the bottled was very dilute (almost like dish soap) and appeared to be mixed with what looked like baby shampoo! As a devout user of the Pureology brand, I know the shampoo is thick and concentrated. Within a day or two of using fake pureology, my hair started shedding pretty bad, with clumps in the shower drain. Pureology is an entirely vegan product and it has never made my hair do that before. My hair is now taking on a dry and brittle look just using this fake product for a few days instead of the shiny and healthy look that real pureology makes my hair feel and look. Now I have to wait for a refund (of $140 +) so I can go to my local beauty supply store and buy the real stuff. Seriously disappointed that I was taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this shampoo and conditioner other than the outrageous price.  Thought with the high price it had to be special.  WRONG!  Do not buy.  Wish I could get my $ back.  For those who say how wonderful it is, they must be paid reviewers.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology shampoos/conditioners.  I&#x27;ve used all the different types over the years (Hydrate, Volumize, etc.)..but never wanted to splurge on the Nanoworks until now.  The shampoo is good; however, I had to use lots of the conditioner, and my hair is baby fine.  I ended up using up all the conditioner months before I ran out of the shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t find the Nanoworks to be any different quality-wise than the Hydrate or the Volumize.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money again on Nanoworks - but instead will go back to the Hydrate version.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best product I have found for color treated hair. It extends the life of the coloring and keeps my hair in great condition. I have used other products but none can compare to Pureology! My hairdresser suggested it and I am glad I followed her lead!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it is the best for my highlighted hair and keeps it healthy even though I have very mineralized well water at home. I live in a small town and have paid $$$$ for this product.  I was thrilled to see the large economy size on Amazon but skeptical because of the negative reviews claiming that the product was watered down.  So, when I got the Amazon shipment I did a side by side comparison with my salon purchased product. NO DIFFERENCE. I will be back to save money on this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology and love Nanoworks.  However, this product is not the same, nor the same quality as the one I usually buy at my beauty supply.  The packaging looked the same, but the product was not. I kept it in reserve and just opened a few weeks ago, past the return time, and found the problem  I would never reccommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff.  Good price for a large amount.  I pay over $25 for 8 oz of the regular Pureology.  I think the  Nanoworks is usually around $50 for a small 8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and makes my hair healthy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Pureology products for about 7 years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Nanoworks, and it&#x27;s fantastic!  It&#x27;s very concentrated, like all Pureology products, and leaves my hair feeling incredibly hydrated, even here in Arizona.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Pureology set that I had purchased from Amazon.  My hair was soft and shiny after using this product.  I recommend Pureology Nanoworks to anyone who colors or has permed their hair and looking for a healthly glowing hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. My hair has improved dramatically. I wish the shampoo and conditioner were more affordable. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t the greatest.  It was ok. Not the best shampoo and conditioner. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> A fabulous deal and the push spout makes it easy to refill your smaller bottles.  I Would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Although I use this product and think it is great, it came spilled. I had to return spilled item since that seemed to be the only way I could get a refund. I would have prefered receiving an intact replacement, but that wasn&#x27;t an option with the terms of crediting my account.  I feel sorry for the people who had to open the mess.  I had to purchase the item locally.</li>
    <li> And no, my hair does not build up nor need a change.  When I let my last stylist talk me into trying a different product I have been nothing but disappointed.  But I returned to the best!  Nano Pureology.. simply the best and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Since I have &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; hair these products do the trick.  I&#x27;ve usedPureology for many years and these products have not disappointed.  Won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thinning hair and this shampoo and conditioner make a real difference.  My hairdresser even commented on the different improved feel of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works.  I&#x27;m a guy.  What else did you expect in a review of a hair product?</li>
    <li> great shampoo and conditioner; delivered before promised date</li>
    <li> I know that this is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth the money. This really helps my colored hair feel soft and smooth. It is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use &amp;#34;tons&amp;#34; every time. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I  really like pureology and this is a great deal for what you are getting. alot cheaper than the salon.  Great smell and good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I give this a 3 because like other reviews said the Shampoo is not as good of a quality as the stuff bought from the beauty supply store. It does work and serves the purpose, but for the cost I would like to have the shampoo I have bought in the past. Not sure if something has changed in the ingredients over the last year.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Have been using it for years.  My hair doesn&#x27;t perform the same with other shampoos and conditioners I have tried.</li>
    <li> I just received my replacement order and only one pump. Also only one bottle states Nano Works Gold.</li>
    <li> I have used Redken products for years.  Recently felt is was time to try a different product, I like to switch it up every now and then because it feels like my hair gets to used to a product after awhile so decided to spring for this.  I was hoping for better results, but am a bit disappointed.  Not a bad product just do not feel its worth the money, was expecting better results at this price.</li>
    <li> I have since switched to AVEDA products. Which are all plant based and only tested on people! WooHoo! STOP CRUELTY TO ANIMALS!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year and it has made a huge difference in the health of my hair.  Pureology makes wonderful products!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever! My hair has never been so healthy!</li>
    <li> This is expensive originally. But you need less product and the fragrance is exquisite. You will never want anything else once you purchase this product</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shampoo and conditioner for several years.  Despite other reviews calling this product a fake, I will say my purchase was the authentic Pureology Nanoworks Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have bought enough to know.  Great value.  Prime item.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner does not repair the hair shaft or improve the texture of the hair.  It has made my hair more dry.  I use very expensive products on my hair and this was real expensive and I have not seen the results it promises.  I would not recommend someone to buy this item if they are going by the bottle.  I would like to send it back and get my money back.  It is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been use Pureology products for over 7 years and I am very pleased with everything. I was afraid to continue to use  Pureology because of some reviews here. PLEASE, do not pay attention to those reviews that says the product changed after Loreal bought Pureology company. The deal happened since 2007!!!!! The consistency, quality, smell, and everything else still the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;The Nanoworks shampoo and conditioner are one of the best among the other ones. I am a Latin girl with a wavy and thick hair, so Pureology products.</li>
    <li> Bottles were broken box was to small</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo!!  The only issue is that I look at the price and compare it as the sizes increase - the larger ones, like this pair, just blow away the smaller ones in cost per oz! - but are still pricey.  33 oz is a LOT of shampoo.  That said, the Pump is really neat - so much more convenient. It just sits in the shower nook ready for me.  The only negative is there is no color or shape difference between the shampoo and conditioner - so I have a big S and C scribbled on it.</li>
    <li> Yes! They&#x27;re great! I dont settle for any other shampoo or conditioner. My hair is super dry and I can&#x27;t use other products.</li>
    <li> I have used pureology nano for over 5 years.  The formula has not changed if you buy it in a salon. I compared the product I bought online to the product I bought in a salon and they are not the same  The color and consistency are both different. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Bought from store right after it won best Conditioner in the USA from Good Housekeeping a few years back.  Loved it then -- BUT... others here are right, THE FORMULA HAS CHANGED.  Ordered it here -- Either this is counterfeit product, or the whole formula has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad, because Pureology had it right at a price that was expensive, but most could afford, because it WORKED.  IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE.  Just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for woman hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for the last four years.  It has been the best product I have ever had.</li>
    <li> My wife has really fine hair and has tried many other products. This one works for her, giving her hair much more body and naturalness.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner shipped very quickly, this was a good price for the duo product.  Saved almost half off retail.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Came fast and is very thick</li>
    <li> SOME OF THE BEST HAIR CARE PRODUCTS WE HAVE EVER USED, JUST NOT SURE IF ITS WORTH THE COST.</li>
    <li> Great for damaged hair!</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE replica of the Nanoworks.  I purchased it because I was running out.  I did not use it until after the return window had passed and can not return.  I have used Nanoworks for years and it is obvious this is NOT Nanoworks.  Too much lather immediately when you use the shampoo.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when the manufacturer changed the formula of shampoo and it was very watery when I purchased the last bottle.  However, Nanoworks is worth spending the money. I didn&#x27;t feel like switching to other products.  This time, shampoo was as thick and dense as it used to be and I was very happy with the result.  I am hoping that it was not just an one-time luck!</li>
    <li> Did not do anything. My hair used to not be frizzy and now it is...</li>
    <li> I have been using pureology nanoworks since 2005 or 2006. I buy 1 the liter of shampoo and condition. I pay A LOT of hard earned money for these premium products. I read terrible reviews about nanaoworks ever since it was sold to L&#x27;Oreal... I didn&#x27;t really take it too seriously because I thought they were exaggerating about how awful it has become.  I used it once (and generously I might add) and after 24 hours I need to wash my hair again. I am so upset.. How could they change a perfectly good product? I will be posting reviews so I can to warm future consumers, I was just ripped off and I do not want anyone else to be ripped off as well. I am really disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology for years and was so disappointed to find these sre NOT the same products. I compared them to my current, supposedly identical, products when they arrived.  The consistency and fragrance was totally different from the authentic product.  Unfortunately for me, I am on a tight budget and had saved to be able to purchase this.  Since there is a no return policy with this vendor I am stuck, I strongly recommend you pay more and get the real Pureology.  Do NOT spend your hard earned money buying anything from this vendor!!!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is the first time I have ever felt it necessary to warn other customers.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for awhile now (gray) and this set of shampoo and conditioner make my hair very silky soft and manageable in spite of the ongoing color treatments, which dry out the hair.  And I live in a dry climate, so having the right shampoo and conditioner is very important if I don&#x27;t want a frizzy, unmanageable mess.</li>
    <li> My hair became shiny and healthy looking.  Great smell!  I have fine and thin hair and usually have to wash it every morning but with this product I can skip a day without it looking oily.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I used Nanoworks for years - and now the product is not worth buying.  Used to be the best.  Very sad to be moving on - was a great product.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is no longer the thick creamy awesome condition it once was.  The recipe has been changed and it no longer deserves its high price tag.  Save your money and try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;After I ordered this product I thought maybe the issue was due to the seller.  But then I visited a local beauty supply store and discovered that the product had been changed.&lt;br /&gt;Time to find a new conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years. I heard it had sold to another company. I bought more after running low and when I got it I wasnt to happy. I was always able to use one or two pumps and get a great later but now it&#x27;s three or four. I&#x27;m using it twice as fast but the price is the same. I looked at the old bottle and found that the new compnay added water. I&#x27;m not to sure if I&#x27;ll buy again.The value is no longer there.</li>
    <li> I have always used Pureology but now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has been processed since my early 20&#x27;s, I use the Nano line of Pureology and love it!  My hair is light and is not tangled and doesn&#x27;t fall out and looks healthy!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of negative reviews on how the shampoo had changed etc, but just purchased the set (before reading the reviews and worrying, of course!), and find the shampoo and conditioner to be the same quality and wonderful fragrance I learned to love at my hairdresser&#x27;s. Truly a great product!</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market</li>
    <li> Anyone who has used this knows it is the Rolls Royce of shampoo. Gold bottle for a reason. It takes 30 days of use for your hair to change and it will. It will get thicker and healthier and just shockingly AMAZING. I always suffered from the effects of bleaching, highlights and coloring and chlorinated water (don&#x27;t we all). Simply the best on the market ANYWHERE. You get what you pay for and do not waste your money on a tiny bottle. Best value are these jumbo bottles. TRY IT. I never planned to spend this much on shampoo, EVER, but if your crowning glory is important to how you look and feel, you will, if it works and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Never again with I buy this in a local Los Angeles area beauty store. They charge 30-40% more. They must be out of their minds. That&#x27;s another reason I love Amazon&#x27;s deep discount pricing.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect product never looked back since start using... I have chemical treated hair like Japanese straightening and touch up with Brazilian blowout it works great... My hair are happy and healthy... I get all great compliments for my hair... It&#x27;s outstanding product...</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;for my 46 year old blond (highlights) my hair is as&lt;br /&gt;soft and healthy as my sons is.&lt;br /&gt;Great great product.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my wife.  I decided to try it as I could not imagine any hair product could be worth this price. My wife says her hair has never felt cleaner and healthier. I can also say it is a special product.</li>
    <li> Product is pricey but keeps the little breakages from happening which happens over time with other shampoos.  It helps to keep my hair a longer length; otherwise I have to keep it cut or have lots of split ends which gives it a halo not smooth finish.  It was recommended to me when I had a portion of my hair that would never grow because of excessive breakage.  This product smoothed it immediately and allowed it to grow.</li>
    <li> They are worth the price!!!!  The. Best shampoo and conditioner ever!  If your hair is damaged you need this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this set since the middle of March, 2014 and I wanted to wait to write the review to give it a chance to work.  I wanted to return it but it was past the 30 days, not sure how they think you can give something like this a chance in just a few weeks. It doesn&#x27;t work which is such a disappointment to me.  I spent hours researching this product and was excited to find a product that just might make a difference in my hair.  My hair is colored treated with occasional highlights and tends to be frizzy.  My daughter who has virgin hair that tends to be dry was another reason why I bought it so it could work on her hair.  It did absolutely nothing for either of us.  My hairstylist uses it herself but I didn&#x27;t tell her I bought it to see if she would say anything and of course she didn&#x27;t, she has no idea. I am beginning to think the product I bought from the seller was not legitimate product. This is the reason I try very hard to only purchase from Amazon and not individual sellers.</li>
    <li> it is not the same quality with the last time I bought from the salon near my place.</li>
    <li> Purology is suppose to be made in the USA.  Instead of having a USA bar code number it has a Korean bar code.  Nano shampoo and conditioner is suppose to be good for your hair, my hair is now like straw from using this product.</li>
    <li> I think it is some great shampoo and conditioner. I like it for my hair. It gives it a lot of softness and shine.</li>
    <li> Folks keep complaining that Pureology is not the same since L&#x27;Oréal purchased it,  sorry but they are wrong.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is the best shampoo and conditioner on the market bar none.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a purchase before but felt the need after reading all the other reviews before I purchased.  Very happy to find that this is the real deal - not watered down!  Smells and performs the same as the products I bought in a salon but at a much lower price!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the many comments that the Shampoo and Conditioner have changed over time and are no longer the same quality.  My hair has felt brittle and tangles easily using the last bottles I purchased on line.  Maybe this is true that the formula has changed and is now NOT worth the money - I am SO DISAPPOINTED AS IT USED TO BE GREAT!  WHAT A RIP OFF!</li>
