      <li>and it&#x27;s fresh, bright and sticky again.  </li>
      <li>came exactly on time, and exactly what i asked for. :D</li>
      <li>Easy to use, non-messy, &amp; easy to wash off!</li>
      <li>But I love this product &amp; I love how easy it is</li>
      <li>I put a little more on over the top, and it was perfect until well after midnight!</li>
      <li>this stinks.&lt;br /&gt;The cheap stuff from the Spirit store worked better.  </li>
      <li>It has the consistency of marmalade and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Really nice, wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for (which was a coagulation gel that liquids when heated then gels when cooled again</li>
      <li>Great addition to the blood gel by the same company.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t move) this worked great as a substitute and my zombie was just as boss as it was last year.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll clean off easily.</li>
      <li>Looks real! :)</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this is that it will not stain your skin.</li>
      <li>Very happy with product and 1 ounce will probably last me several years.</li>
      <li>Although it does not dry completely, it has a realistic look to it and will be perfect for making up my neighbors kids this year for Halloween.  </li>
      <li>Had to do some quick blood effects for a wounded soldier look and this captures that look and texture of blood right out of the jar.</li>
      <li>Color is a little too bright.</li>
      <li>Worked exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not shy about applying it.</li>
      <li>I love how fast it got to me, it only took 2 days!</li>
      <li>It does not move at all, awesome for layering and adding a little bit of black body pint made it look scabby.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very fell like</li>
      <li>I received this in the mail yesterday and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I played with it a bit and love the wet coagulated look you can get with this.</li>
      <li>but I really like</li>
      <li>I really like this blood..</li>
      <li>This is the perfect added touch to any sinister makeup look!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it stains fabric or not since I&#x27;ve only put it on fabric that&#x27;s being thrown out afterwards, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain skin very much which is good.</li>
      <li>Stays thick and shiny, overall great product.</li>
      <li>More than enough for multiple times.</li>
      <li>I went as a zombie - but had issues finding realistic looking blood</li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve found yet for my crazy Halloween costumes!</li>
      <li>little of this will go a long way, and it is very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very bright red when applying a thin layer, and quite dark when and congealed when caked on.</li>
      <li>It can be spread out thinner, and has a realistic red hue.  </li>
      <li>very dark - and looks SSOOOO realistic!!!</li>
      <li>I had hoped it would be similar to ben Nye blood and in small amounts it will work just fine</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, nice and thick to make scabs or thick bloody areas that you don&#x27;t want dripping.  </li>

<li> This stuff is awesome, nice and thick to make scabs or thick bloody areas that you don&#x27;t want dripping.  </li>
<li> It is thick, and when put on in a large glob, looks very dark, and very real, just like blood that is drying or clotting.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t dry, and it also gets everywhere easily, so try to apply it somewhere</li>
<li> does stay wet and tacky to the touch, so you have to be careful while its on you, and not to get it on everything you touch, but that just adds to the realistic quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I put this stuff on around six o&#x27;clock in the morning, and by three when I got home, the thinnest layers were just starting to dry.  </li>
<li> The one ounce container doesn&#x27;t seem like much but a little bit goes a long way, I still have over half the jar left</li>
<li> This is thick blood designed to use in large areas.</li>
<li> A lot goes a long way.  </li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t want it to dry or crack.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so I see this batch lasting me awhile.</li>
<li> I used it to make a very big flesh wound and a little goes a long way</li>
<li> Gave my carnivorous plant just what it needed for the mouth and teeth mixed with a little latex.</li>
<li> I got compliments all night on my costume, and scared quiet a few people in the process.</li>
<li> Not really drippy stays put.</li>
<li> Maintains a wet look while not being drippy.</li>
<li> 1 oz, doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot but a little goes a long way with this stuff.  </li>
<li> Extremely sticky.</li>
<li> If applied very thin, it can create realistic bruise marks too.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
<li> A little wipe with a damp towel</li>
<li> /&gt;Sorry, I know the picture is a little blurry, but it&#x27;s the closest one I have.</li>
<li> The color is a little off</li>
<li> This stuff is very thick (aka a paste) and will go a long ways with just a little.  </li>
<li> It stays sticky which is pretty annoying but other than that its alright</li>
<li> Just a few dabs with a Q-tip, or some stippling with a sponge or baby wipe is plenty to pull off any blood effect!</li>
<li> I will never use the liquid version of other fake blood products; blood paste is the way to go!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not ideal for kids costumes.</li>
<li> The color is wrong.  </li>
<li> I will only use this for my bloody needs!</li>

    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found yet for my crazy Halloween costumes!</li>
    <li> This gel blood was awesome! 1 oz, doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot but a little goes a long way with this stuff.  I bought this specifically because I would be wearing it to school and I didn&#x27;t want it to dry or crack.  I put this stuff on around six o&#x27;clock in the morning, and by three when I got home, the thinnest layers were just starting to dry.  I put a little more on over the top, and it was perfect until well after midnight! I would definitely order this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I know the picture is a little blurry, but it&#x27;s the closest one I have.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best products I have ever used. Stayed on all night , did not run and added to the clotted , hemorrhagic look I was after. I will never use the liquid version of other fake blood products; blood paste is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail yesterday and I really like it.  I played with it a bit and love the wet coagulated look you can get with this. Although it does not dry completely, it has a realistic look to it and will be perfect for making up my neighbors kids this year for Halloween.  It also tinted some latex well for a project I am working on for my yard props. Gave my carnivorous plant just what it needed for the mouth and teeth mixed with a little latex.</li>
    <li> It stays sticky which is pretty annoying but other than that its alright</li>
    <li> Color is a little too bright.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s life like.  One surprise is it never dries so it&#x27;s not ideal for kids costumes.</li>
    <li> The one ounce container doesn&#x27;t seem like much but a little bit goes a long way, I still have over half the jar left and I&#x27;m not shy about applying it. I use this and mehron stage blood for some cosplays and it always comes out looking amazing. It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t dry, and it also gets everywhere easily, so try to apply it somewhere it&#x27;ll clean off easily. I&#x27;m not sure if it stains fabric or not since I&#x27;ve only put it on fabric that&#x27;s being thrown out afterwards, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain skin very much which is good.</li>
    <li> Amazing! It has the consistency of marmalade and it is easy to use. Looks real! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff was AMAZING!!!!! I went as a zombie - but had issues finding realistic looking blood - this stuff does not run, stayed in place ALL night!!! very dark - and looks SSOOOO realistic!!! I got compliments all night on my costume, and scared quiet a few people in the process. the price was affordable and it is the absolute best faux blood I have ever seen/used.</li>
    <li> I really like this blood.. just as the Ben Nye Fresh Scab, awesome consistency</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It does not move at all, awesome for layering and adding a little bit of black body pint made it look scabby. definitely going to buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> This is thick blood designed to use in large areas. I used it on my face. I used a sponge to get it from the jar to my face and then used setting spray once an hour or so to keep it looking like &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; blood. More than enough for multiple times.</li>
    <li> stays on forever. never dries. looked great!!!! I will only use this for my bloody needs!</li>
    <li> Great addition to the blood gel by the same company.  This stuff is very thick (aka a paste) and will go a long ways with just a little.  I used this stuff to create some stab wounds on a &amp;#34;victim&amp;#34; for a movie shoot.</li>
    <li> came exactly on time, and exactly what i asked for. :D</li>
    <li> I had hoped it would be similar to ben Nye blood and in small amounts it will work just fine I suppose I shall just have to get the ben Nye fresh scab as well over all im happy with it</li>
    <li> Loved this very very good to use I used it to make a very big flesh wound and a little goes a long way I did my face and a mask to go with it and still have a lot left</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, nice and thick to make scabs or thick bloody areas that you don&#x27;t want dripping.  Use this as part of my Halloween costume (zipper face zombie).  A lot goes a long way.  Very happy with product and 1 ounce will probably last me several years.</li>
    <li> Good product. Very bright red when applying a thin layer, and quite dark when and congealed when caked on. Never dries. Extremely sticky. Awesome still because gore.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as advertised. Maintains a wet look while not being drippy. A little goes a long way, so I see this batch lasting me awhile.</li>
    <li> Best blood paste by far so happy I purchase this !!!!!</li>
    <li> The color is a little off but I really like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s very fell like</li>
    <li> Used this for my son&#x27;s Zombie Halloween makeup. Worked great. Not really drippy stays put.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It works great with the make up... If you&#x27;re into gore.. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This blood paste worked great.  It is thick, and when put on in a large glob, looks very dark, and very real, just like blood that is drying or clotting.  It can be spread out thinner, and has a realistic red hue.  If applied very thin, it can create realistic bruise marks too.&lt;br /&gt;A little of this will go a long way, and it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It does stay wet and tacky to the touch, so you have to be careful while its on you, and not to get it on everything you touch, but that just adds to the realistic quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my twin boys for a Halloween zombie costume, and it turned out great!</li>
    <li> Really nice, wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for (which was a coagulation gel that liquids when heated then gels when cooled again so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t move) this worked great as a substitute and my zombie was just as boss as it was last year. Almost mentholy when it&#x27;s on your lips. Stays thick and shiny, overall great product.</li>
    <li> Stays on longer than regular liquid blood</li>
    <li> This is the perfect added touch to any sinister makeup look! Just a few dabs with a Q-tip, or some stippling with a sponge or baby wipe is plenty to pull off any blood effect! The 1-oz jar will definitely last quite awhile! Easy to use, non-messy, &amp; easy to wash off!</li>
    <li> Had to do some quick blood effects for a wounded soldier look and this captures that look and texture of blood right out of the jar. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and lasts long... perfect.</li>
    <li> this stinks.&lt;br /&gt;The cheap stuff from the Spirit store worked better.  The color is wrong.  It does not stick to prosthetics well.  It just does not look like blood.  The only good thing about this is that it will not stain your skin.</li>
    <li> I love it! I love how fast it got to me, it only took 2 days! I live in Hawaii so when things get shipped faster than I expect it its a big thing for me lol. But I love this product &amp; I love how easy it is &amp; it gives me the effects I need when doing clients!</li>
    <li> Be warned: This never dries! EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s great stage blood.  If you&#x27;re using it on a multiple application prothetic you&#x27;ll have to cover it with powder to keep it from coming off on everything during storage.  A little wipe with a damp towel and it&#x27;s fresh, bright and sticky again.  Worked great for the purpose.  Only reason it lost a star is that I wish I&#x27;d known it never dries.</li>
