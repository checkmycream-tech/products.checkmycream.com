      <li>Slice Of Nature© Rare East Africa Nilotica Liquid Shea Butter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of this</li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t care for the smell you can add lavender or some other fragrant oil to make it more appealing.....</li>
      <li>The texture of this shea butter is just right, between liquid and cream.</li>
      <li>With that, when I do get a pimple, it really bothered me!</li>
      <li>Shea butter is nothing too pleasing to the nose, but boy it sure does work wonders on the hair, nails and skin, especially the face!, (that is for me anyway).  </li>
      <li>I love Slice of Nature and use their products regularly.  </li>
      <li>Try using it on your legs next time when you are wearing a dress, it gives bare legs a healthy glow!</li>
      <li>If I apply too much I just blot my face with a bath cloth to get the excess.</li>
      <li>It is really helpful to control my psoriasis problem.</li>
      <li>otherwise, i feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; if i use a lot to cover whole arm or whole leg.</li>
      <li>and I have not broken out at all.</li>
      <li>It was great to bring some small measure of comfort and relief to him in his last days of life.</li>
      <li>At first you feel it on your skin, and after several minutes it is completely absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I use it in my own personal mixture and it seems to work well with my other ingredients</li>
      <li>Most were either heavily fragranced or have toxic ingredients.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and you feel extremely hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I like Nilotica Shea Butter better for skin applications versus West African Shea butter due to the lighter texture and ease of use.</li>
      <li>He was suffering from a dry scalp and after several uses of this shea butter oil, it reduced the itchy feeling he would get at the top of his scalp and reduced his dandruff finally.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes the skin and makes it soft and supple to the touch.</li>
      <li>Her skin is smooth and glowing after a few months of diligently incorporating this product in her skincare regime.</li>
      <li>Like the description says, the natural smell disappears.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for natural styles.</li>
      <li>It’s semi-liquid, creamy and silky consistency spreads into your skin like butter, leaving your skin glowing and soft.</li>
      <li>I had tried the pure shea butter, but it is too heavy, this oil is just right.</li>
      <li>The results are pretty amazing; no more dryness, no more tightness, no more oily face and the fine lines and wrinkles have obviously diminished.  </li>
      <li>This stuff has softened my skin very much too extreme.</li>
      <li>I like it so far, the container is different than the picture, but I lke it....</li>
      <li>It obsorbes right into skin after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>It gives super moisture for my dry hair from the roots on down to the ends.</li>
      <li>It developed a very disagreeable odor a few months after I got it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love the fact that it&#x27;s in oil form. it doesn&#x27;t glide well so i have to rub in small areas at a time is a bit time consuming. otherwise, i feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; if i use a lot to cover whole arm or whole leg. the smell isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s not offensive. the moisture does last a long time.</li>
    <li> My heels and ankles were very dry and rough almost to the point of cracking.  I have used it for almost a week every night and the difference is amazing.  It takes very little.  At first, it seems greasy but it absorbs in a few minutes.  I would recommend this for anyone who has dry skin anywhere.[[ASIN:B002YV4J3W Slice Of Nature© Rare East Africa Nilotica Liquid Shea Butter. Organic 100% Pure, Raw 2 oz (60ml)]]</li>

    <li> Im not too fond of the smell but this product is great!! Like the description says, the natural smell disappears. I was afraid to put this product on my face but I have been for quite some time and I have not broken out at all. It moisturizes the skin and makes it soft and supple to the touch. It has also started to even out my skin tone.     I use this product every night in the place of my normal moisturizer and it works great. If I apply too much I just blot my face with a bath cloth to get the excess. My skin has never looked so good. You&#x27;ll see the benefits almost immediately.</li>
    <li> WOWOW!!! This stuff has softened my skin very much too extreme. I just love my skin now as it is much of like SILK.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I substituted this with my almond oil and it turned out very nice! It’s semi-liquid, creamy and silky consistency spreads into your skin like butter, leaving your skin glowing and soft. Try using it on your legs next time when you are wearing a dress, it gives bare legs a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> I use shea butter oil to sooth my itchy scalp and to get rid of those flakes out from my head! It gives super moisture for my dry hair from the roots on down to the ends. It works fantastic for keeping my hair protected against dandruff. It has also softened my hard brittle hair.</li>
    <li> The texture of this shea butter is just right, between liquid and cream. Very easy to use. It obsorbes right into skin after a few minutes. I use it both for my hands and for my face. I cannot speak to any special effect yet but it did feel great on skin.</li>
    <li> It is really helpful to control my psoriasis problem. I have started using it for a while now and find that my problems seem to be under control with this short period. Sure I would continue using it.</li>
    <li> My best recommendation so far was to my father. His extreme cancer treatment caused his finger tips to crack severely. I gave him a jar of my East African shea butter oil to try on his hands. All products he had used up to this point did nothing to heal his fingers. I am extremely happy to report the shea butter healed his hands within a couple weeks. It was great to bring some small measure of comfort and relief to him in his last days of life. Thank you Slice of Nature!</li>
    <li> I use it on my skin, face, and hair. I usually use raw shea butter, Works up fine and does not gum up or feel to oily upon use. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 18 now, had trouble skin since puberty and I made her try many, many moisturizers in my short lifetime. Most were either heavily fragranced or have toxic ingredients. She was pretty reluctant about the effectiveness of Shea butter oil, when she first heard about it, but I&#x27;m so glad I made her to give it a try! This oil healed her eczema and got rid of her jawline acne. Her skin is smooth and glowing after a few months of diligently incorporating this product in her skincare regime. It has also helped a bit with fading some past hyper pigmentation and red marks.</li>
    <li> I should have stored this in the refrigerator instead of in the bathroom.  It developed a very disagreeable odor a few months after I got it.</li>
    <li> I must say it is so much better than what I thought it would be. The results are pretty amazing; no more dryness, no more tightness, no more oily face and the fine lines and wrinkles have obviously diminished.  I am stunned with how well this works.</li>
    <li> I love Slice of Nature and use their products regularly.  This one is light and works great for people who have normal skin.  It is nice for the Summer as well.</li>
    <li> My brother uses this Oil and he loves it. He was suffering from a dry scalp and after several uses of this shea butter oil, it reduced the itchy feeling he would get at the top of his scalp and reduced his dandruff finally. He had slight baldness and he could see hair growth on that part too! It has put an end to all his issues.</li>
    <li> I rate this product a 1 the product had my hair dripping when I applied a small amount to my twist for $20 a bottle I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer from this brand and I and my family members have been finding great results from every product.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I love this East African Nilotica Shea Butter and to be able to find it in liquid form is even better. My skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> It has rescued my hair from being dry and damaged. It has restored luster and it makes my hair more manageable. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for natural hair. Its also a good alternative for shea butter in its solid form. The scent is just ok though. I would recommend for natural styles.</li>
    <li> I love this product but the availability can be sketchy. Aside from that, it absorbs wonderfully into the skin, and my skin stays hydrated the entire day. I like Nilotica Shea Butter better for skin applications versus West African Shea butter due to the lighter texture and ease of use.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome!!!!! This is a great value for what you get. It is my new favorite product! I am a mild sufferer of acne. With that, when I do get a pimple, it really bothered me! I used only 2-3 drops on my pimple and it just vanished within two days without leaving any marks. It is really a great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! It lathers up well when I use it as my face wash! I have noticed great difference in my skin texture after using it!  It has become brighter and it has made my skin so much better. I am so glad that I got chance to try it on my skin and I am a regular user now!</li>
    <li> My wife is a fan of Shea Butter Oil from way back. It makes her skin so soft, and beautiful, that she is been using it for over 3 years from various brands and now with Slice of Nature.</li>
    <li> This shea oil is the best.  It goes on smooth and you feel extremely hydrated.  At first you feel it on your skin, and after several minutes it is completely absorbed.  I can&#x27;t imagine that everyone won&#x27;t love it - it&#x27;s that good.  And, a little bit goes a long way - I&#x27;ve been moisturizing my face at night and body during the day.  I was worried I might break out, but not at all!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and I can&#x27;t wait until they sell it in a larger bottle. I&#x27;ll be buying more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I had tried the pure shea butter, but it is too heavy, this oil is just right. I use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need much as well. They make me feel relaxed and I do recommend it for its quality.</li>
    <li> I have lots of split ends and breaks as I use too many styling tools on my hair. But that had spoiled my hair and it went lifeless. When I read about shea butter’s benefits I very badly wanted to try this oil particularly as it was fully natural and organic. I started using it as overnight mask, and it worked bigger than I anticipated. It has made my hair very healthy reducing those spilt ends. Would buy again for sure!!</li>
