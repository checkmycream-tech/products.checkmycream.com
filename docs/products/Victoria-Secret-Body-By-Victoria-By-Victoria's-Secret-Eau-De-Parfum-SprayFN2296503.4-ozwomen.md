      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is a really great, light wearing scent.</li>
      <li>This is truly pleasing not just to the wearer but to anyone catching the sent.</li>
      <li>excellent, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, i really can&#x27;t wear it because the smell is incredibly overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my aunts favorite parfume</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>So I am praying it is ok.</li>
      <li>you cannot find it for a better price than on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I will defiantly be purchasing this lovely sent again and again.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it still available on line.  </li>
      <li>Outer box seems ok.</li>
      <li>My absolutely favorite fragrance for my wife.</li>
      <li>I have loved this perfume for years, so my rating isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s IN the bottle, so much as the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and came right on time</li>
      <li>My item came in the mail very quick.</li>
      <li>VS discontinued my favorite glitter spray so my mom got me a gift set with this perfume in it, this is now by far my favorite spray!</li>
      <li>I gave 5 stars as the original box seems to be fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;While aesthetically the bottle is beautiful, making a great addition to any vanity, the bottle itself is really uncomfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>Perfect spray for everyday use!</li>
      <li>Smells good- but not the same fragrance as the original &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>my absolute favorite perfume....</li>
      <li>I really fell in love with the scent the very first moment, and impulsively bought</li>
      <li>Just right for me... sweet and sexy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it when I purchased a VS perfume sampler last Christmas (2013).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It never fails when I go somewhere someone will compliment me on it and ask what I am wearing.</li>
      <li>First box was damaged.</li>
      <li>I wish I could have more and just wear it all year long ahaha</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean scent, it&#x27;s my go-to daily-wear perfume.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a terrific product!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not sure this is true, but that particular store didn&#x27;t carry it.)  </li>
      <li>usually get the rounded glass bottles (which fit my hand like a glove), but opted for the larger bottle this time.</li>
      <li>My sister gave me a bottle of this several years ago, and when I ran out I raced back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to purchase more, however the sales person said they no longer carried it.</li>

    <li> Perfect spray for everyday use! I love the fragrance and received at a great price! Thanks for a terrific product!</li>
    <li> VS discontinued my favorite glitter spray so my mom got me a gift set with this perfume in it, this is now by far my favorite spray! Very cute bottle I might add. Recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite fragrance for my wife. We both love it!!!  I am told they discontinued this scent, please bring it back!!!</li>
    <li> Sent this as a gift to my mom for Mothers Day and she loved it!! Now I need one for myself</li>
    <li> Nice and come on time, i recomended for any one want to buy this parfume!!! That was a gift for my best friend, she love it!!!</li>
    <li> excellent, I highly recommend it. serious. excellent product</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite perfume....I wish I could have more and just wear it all year long ahaha</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a bottle of this several years ago, and when I ran out I raced back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to purchase more, however the sales person said they no longer carried it. (I&#x27;m not sure this is true, but that particular store didn&#x27;t carry it.)  I was thrilled to find it still available on line.  It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean scent, it&#x27;s my go-to daily-wear perfume.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume so I was understandably upset when I went into Victoria&#x27;s Secrets and was told they didn&#x27;t have it anymore. I was so happy to see it on Amazon and at a cheaper price than anywhere else I had shopped. The packaging has been updated, but the smell is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never fails when I go somewhere someone will compliment me on it and ask what I am wearing. I like that it is not an overpowering and heavy scent. Just right for me... sweet and sexy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> speedy delivery, content was exactly what I ordered and wanted at very great price. I would def buy again.</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL BODY BY VICTORIA. :( ITS not the same in any way shape or form. Beatiful bottle but its too floral/citrus for my liking, I was hoping I would get used to it, just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in two USPS boxes. First box was damaged. Outer box seems ok. It arrived on the coldest day and was left on our porch during -8 degrees temps. No knock on the door as I was home all day. I won&#x27;t know if freezing temps damaged the perfume till my daughter unwraps it for her Birthday in 3 weeks. I can hear through box the liquid was still moving moving. So I am praying it is ok. I gave 5 stars as the original box seems to be fine and it is a perfume my daughter loves and used before.</li>
    <li> This scent is discontinued. I fell in love with it when I purchased a VS perfume sampler last Christmas (2013). It is pleasant without being overbearing and my husband agreed that he liked it, too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My item came in the mail very quick. This is truly pleasing not just to the wearer but to anyone catching the sent. I liked the packaging itself was perfect and not disrupted. I will defiantly be purchasing this lovely sent again and again.</li>
    <li> I really fell in love with the scent the very first moment, and impulsively bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me the smell of cherry blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;However, i really can&#x27;t wear it because the smell is incredibly overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me tired, and gives headaches.&lt;br /&gt;What a pity.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for years, so my rating isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s IN the bottle, so much as the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While aesthetically the bottle is beautiful, making a great addition to any vanity, the bottle itself is really uncomfortable to hold. The size makes it a bit unwieldy, and the plastic leg parts kinda dig into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get the rounded glass bottles (which fit my hand like a glove), but opted for the larger bottle this time. I probably won&#x27;t order this size again. I know, I know, it&#x27;s weird to chose a perfume bottle based on how it fits your hand, but since I use it every day, I&#x27;d prefer not to be uncomfortable doing it.</li>
    <li> Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells good- but not the same fragrance as the original &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Never opened and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> This is a really great, light wearing scent. I get a lot of compliments on it and...you cannot find it for a better price than on Amazon. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> A everyday must for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and came right on time</li>
