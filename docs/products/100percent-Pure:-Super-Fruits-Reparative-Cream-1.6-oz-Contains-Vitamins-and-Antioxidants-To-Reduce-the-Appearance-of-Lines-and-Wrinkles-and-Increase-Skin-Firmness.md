      <li>The scent is mild and it is not greasy.</li>
      <li>The company needs to include this on their product especially for persons who are not too familiar with use of these kind of products.</li>
      <li>Here is a great article that breaks it all down...</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable and the outcome from using it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>Very much worth the cost.</li>
      <li>that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considering moving over to using strictly 100% Pure products because I have had such amazing success with them- also at the 100% Pure store</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I bought this from an actual 100% Pure store and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>I incorporated the use of the Fruits Reparative Cream recently and love that it keeps my skin hydrated all day long and has reduced the redness and given a much more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do.</li>
      <li>Pure recommended this for my 50 yr old face, and so far I love it.</li>
      <li>but this is slightly fruity and not offensive at all) and it has a nice texture</li>
      <li>They really work.  </li>
      <li>This face cream absorbs well and is very nourishing.</li>
      <li>THis product really works.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I really like this skin cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many natural products and different moisturizers-</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell (I don&#x27;t usually like anything scented</li>
      <li>This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend product.</li>
      <li>And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
      <li>My skin absolutely glows when I use this and is SOOOOO soft...</li>
      <li>It makes my dry skin smooth and soft without breaking me out.  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line is I feel better about putting this on my face than all the chemicals in the usual creams that are sold.</li>
      <li>and recently I noticed I am not doing so much to cover my imperfection when I put make up.</li>
      <li>I really recommend it and have decided it is the only moisturizer I will use from now on...</li>
      <li>This product hydrates my skin and does not cause issues with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling soft and hydrated and after about a week</li>
      <li>The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben.</li>
      <li>It has a slight odor, but it really helps both soften your skin and heal scars or intense dryness.</li>
      <li>They feel good on my skin and in the cold dry climate that I reside it, these products really keep my skin moist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Overall the cream has a great light texture, and fragrance. I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural and cruelty free! The only thing that&#x27;s annoying is that it separates a bit, but after all it&#x27;s all natural so that&#x27;s common.</li>
    <li> This product hydrates my skin and does not cause issues with my sensitive skin. I really like this skin cream.</li>
    <li> A reviewer wrote that this cream smells really nice! This is not true at all.!! It just smells of oil..like the oil we use for cooking...you see what I mean?! it&#x27;s a good moisturizer though!</li>
    <li> Dumb move, but I decided to research the ingredients in this (and 6 other 100% Pure products that I purchased) AFTER purchasing them. What I found was disturbing. This product contains Japanese Honeysuckle, and many say using Japanese honeysuckle is a way for companies to hide their parabens. The main issue is a chemical in Japanese honeysuckle called para-hydroxy benzoic acid that acts just like a paraben. Here is a great article that breaks it all down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product gets one star because of the company&#x27;s sketchy marketing when they say \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;. We avoid parabens because they are considered hormone mimickers, and their suspected link to cancers. But 100% Pure still uses this ingredient that does exactly what synthetic parabens do. Unless you do your research, you don&#x27;t know this, and this is what the company hopes, I&#x27;m sure. I had no idea about any of this until I dug a little deeper. And FYI, from what I&#x27;ve noticed looking at their ingredients, 100% Pure uses this in MANY (if not most) of their skincare products.</li>
    <li> Works well did not irritate my face. Love all there products.</li>
    <li> Grandmother loves this product. Can not get a better price. Ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best day creams I have ever used.  I truly recommend it to anyone that wants a really great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This face cream absorbs well and is very nourishing. It also smells wonderful. I hope that the tube doesn&#x27;t break like the one for the serum did!</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff. I love the feel on my skin. It has a slight odor, but it really helps both soften your skin and heal scars or intense dryness. I will definitely continue purchasing it and using it on a regular basis. Very much worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and don&#x27;t want to change!</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good cream as far as the moisturizing ability. However, I just cannot get past the smell. It literally smells like rotten fruit, or at least the odor of an overripe fruit. It does go away after a while, but I just can&#x27;t put something this pungent on my face.</li>
    <li> So I think the product itself is great but the little pump to dispense the product broke inside the bottle after only using this 2x &amp;#62;_&amp;#62; needless to say I&#x27;m not too pleased about that but I like the way my skin is looking and feeling with this product for sure.</li>
    <li> [...]    I haven&#x27;t tried these products yet, but i purchased the brightening toner today and was reading through reviews out of curiosity. I was curious about the article posted on Japanese honeysuckle and did some research myself. Just some food for thought. This site seemed very informed and Japanese honeysuckle didn&#x27;t sound so bad to me.</li>
    <li> Happy with this moisturiser! Nice texture, nice subtle scent, great results.</li>
    <li> my favorite out of all 100% pure&#x27;s creams. nourishing and nice smell.</li>
    <li> The smell is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It makes my dry skin smooth and soft without breaking me out.  It also helps mineral makeup go on more smoothly. Great face cream.</li>
    <li> THis is the best company and the best facial product I&#x27;ve used.  The price is reasonable and the outcome from using it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t use ... burns my skin.  sad as I use all organic .. drying and doing damage.</li>
    <li> Both products smell beautifully. Leave my (dry) skin smooth and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I like even more that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
    <li> I love this! The smell is delicious and it is non greasy! It absorbs right away and leaves skin smelling and feeling great! My skin has begun to plump up and feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom! Buy this for sure!</li>
    <li> I love the Super Fruits Reparative cream.  It was exactly as described.  It leaves skin very soft.  Highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> I have used this line for many years, and it just keeps getting better.  I use the entire skin care and hair care line of products.  They really work.  They are the most natural I have found on the market, and I have tried many others over the years.  Try this line -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell (I don&#x27;t usually like anything scented but this is slightly fruity and not offensive at all) and it has a nice texture and I like the ingredients and the fact that it&#x27;s PH balanced.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually reparative though.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it and will post an update if I see any outstanding changes.  Bottom line is I feel better about putting this on my face than all the chemicals in the usual creams that are sold.</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream.</li>
    <li> Meh. Smells good and moisturized okay, but no results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is my ABSOLUTE favorite.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many natural products and different moisturizers- some feel like they don&#x27;t work at all, some leave a greasy layer, some make me break out.... THIS ONE IS A MIRACLE!  I bought this from an actual 100% Pure store and fell in love.  You can feel it nourishing and moisturizing, it absorbs yet you feel like it leaves some sort of protective layer that isn&#x27;t greasy but acts as a barrier to keep out dirt and pollutants.  My skin absolutely glows when I use this and is SOOOOO soft... and it has helped with discoloration and has not made me break out.  I really recommend it and have decided it is the only moisturizer I will use from now on...I&#x27;m considering moving over to using strictly 100% Pure products because I have had such amazing success with them- also at the 100% Pure store it is buy 3, get 1 free...hard to beat that!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure recommended this for my 50 yr old face, and so far I love it. Smells terrific, moisturizes well, concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> THis product really works. I have been using it for just about a month and I have seen signs of improvement in my skin tone. The scent is mild and it is not greasy. The only thing lacking are directions on how to use. The company needs to include this on their product especially for persons who are not too familiar with use of these kind of products.</li>
    <li> I use several 100% pure products and they are superb! The scents are awesome! I can see a tremendous quality change in the suppleness and softness of my skin while also reducing lines and puffiness. They feel good on my skin and in the cold dry climate that I reside it, these products really keep my skin moist. I incorporated the use of the Fruits Reparative Cream recently and love that it keeps my skin hydrated all day long and has reduced the redness and given a much more even skin tone. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous 100% pur product - I love them all.  Leaves your face feeling soft and hydrated and after about a week you can see the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I tried this proctuct for the first time</li>
    <li> Cruelty free and great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream!  I&#x27;m 47 and I spend a fortune on anti-aging products only to be disappointed time and time again.  I started using this product and I swear my skin is brighter, clearer and my wrinkles are less noticable.  It&#x27;s not that expensive either, I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use this item day time. my skin is oily but it does not leave oily film on my skin. I also have eczema and does not affect my skin at all. Regarding effectiveness, I feel my skin is gradually adjusting it&#x27;s texture and recently I noticed I am not doing so much to cover my imperfection when I put make up.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels good on! :)</li>
