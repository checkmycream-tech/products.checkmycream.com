<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great smelling incense and aroma lingers for hours.</li>
    <li> The most beautifully scented incense!!! Very, very happy!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this incense! I absolutely love it. It is so potent and lovely. It fills the room beautifully and smells amazing. Excellent price as well. 120 sticks will last a while, can&#x27;t beat that price for a really great smelling incense.</li>
    <li> I discovered this incense at a local seller who gave me a free sample. I guess it is a love it or hate it aroma by the other reviews--but I absolutely love it. It is a light, heady scent that just immediately relaxes me and the scent lingers for some time after you light one, which is a wonderful added bonus. I feel rich whenever I use these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local seller no longer stocks the sticks and the cone samples he gave me are really hard to make stay lit, especially for the price he wants for them. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s reasonable prices and free shipping, cause now I can stock up whenever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t burn this type all of the time, but I do burn it a few times a week. My favorite time to light one is right before bed, because I seem to relax for sleep easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of different types of incense, and this one is my hands-down favorite. I gave a few sticks to my sister and she orders it too now!</li>
    <li> Some reviewers are right by saying that the package smells very soapy. One can actually smell the soapy fragrance through the amazon packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you burn that stuff, the soapy smell somehow changes into a nice fragrance. I can&#x27;t say I love it, but it is pleasant and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about these sticks is the amount of smoke that they produce! Wow! A lot of thick smoke that lasts quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you try this product if you like the smell associated with Indian temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this particular incense for over a year through Amazon.  I burn incense many times a day and tend to use charcoal base Incense or Resin for the purest fragrance and the least amount of smoke and impurities released during use.  I have read a couple reviews say that the Incense smelled like soap or smokey soap and I think you must have gotten a defective product.  Something probably happened to it during shipping, though a strong smell of smoke can indicate old Incense.  For me this Incense has always arrived fresh and so full of fragrance that you can smell it through the packaging.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this Incense and I like the price !</li>
    <li> Forget nag champa, this is the best incense ever. Very very strong, though, so I suggest burning in a well-ventilated area if you&#x27;re sensitive to incense.</li>
    <li> Great, calming atmospheric scents. The headline says it all!</li>
    <li> An all time favorite.</li>
    <li> I really like this incense. BUT I have to keep the unburned sticks in a sealed bag. It smells really too sweet when just left out in the room.</li>
    <li> I first encountered this brand when I picked up a free sample of two sticks in the kind of shop where one would find such things. It really exceeded all expectation, so much so that I purchased this immediately. While they may smell a bit soap unlit, they fill the room with a heavenly, sweet aroma when burning. Close to the strength of Nag Champa, which I also like, but a little bit more delicate of a scent. It is a soothing and inspiring scent.</li>
    <li> It smells so much like \\&quot;temple\\&quot; incense, you may think you&#x27;re a monk. A lot of incense ends up leaving a burnt wood smell in your house hours after the burning, but this one does not. Much more pure \\&quot;aftersmell\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding scent in incense form.  I received a sample with another order and was sold immediately.  It lights easily, burns long, the scent is not dense, intense or suffocating.  It is pure, light and pleasant.  I do love nag champa still the best, but this is a nice break from the routine, and you simply cannot find a better price anywhere.  I was surprised at how much I received for so little.</li>
    <li> My favorite incense--good price.</li>
    <li> Smells nice when you open it, only for a day or so - then you realize it is an old package and the aroma disappears. The last few incense sticks do not even smell - it is like burning masala sticks. I bought two of them and both  the packs were stale.</li>
    <li> Smells Nice. I didnt understand the hype. They burn really quickly. The smell is strong, Even when they are not burning. It reminds me of a bohemian market. Alot came in a pack. As expected of incense, it will leave the area smoky...But at least the scent is pretty pleasant and lingers really well.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this and ordered it on a whim &amp; boy am I happy that I did. It&#x27;s just wonderful, smells just like incense that my mom used to burn when I was a little girl.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Use for meditation and peaceful sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this given a few bad reviews but fail to see any real faults. It has a distinctly different (yes, kinda soapy) fragrance and can be overpowering in smaller spaces. Overall I find it pleasant but still prefer Nag Champa and it&#x27;s sisters.    I bought the smaller, 50-stick package because I had not experienced this particular brand before. It&#x27;s not exactly my cup of tea but considering the price I could get used to it.    I have not noticed the \\&quot;burning plastic\\&quot; smell mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> Just love this and is now one of my favorites, will without question order this again in the near future  !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this incense, some say it smells like soap, but I think it has more depth than just a soap smell, my room has filled with it&#x27;s pungent aroma and I haven&#x27;t even opened the box yet, I&#x27;ve bought this brand before from another website, but this is my first 120 count from amazon, I highly recommend this product not just because I like the scent...  I like how it&#x27;s very pungent, you don&#x27;t have to burn much of it for it to fill the space with it&#x27;s aroma..    ...and for those worried about catching your house on fire, you don&#x27;t even need to burn this stuff, just set a few out (on something that won&#x27;t absorb the oil and stain) and it will let the oils evaporate just from ambient room temperatures...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another one who&#x27;s going to have to rain on the parade of 5-star reviews.  Our olfactory settings are all a little different, and smells can be subjective.  So don&#x27;t listen to the people on here saying to go ahead and buy the big box cause this is the best incense ever.  I did, and ended up giving it away to my Mom and sister, on account of I don&#x27;t want my residence smelling like a chick&#x27;s perfume drawer. Try a little bit first before you buy a bunch. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just way too sweet and perfumey for me. If you&#x27;re a female or a dude who likes feminine stuff, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  If you&#x27;re a dude who likes yourself and your place to smell more like a man, you probably won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best smelling incense of all but burns rather qickly. I estimate 30 mins. I would buy again however because it is so relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best incense on earth</li>
    <li> This incense smells terrible.  I have been to India and I don&#x27;t remember ANY temple smelling like this.  This incense has the weirdest smell.  It gave me a headache.  I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> The smell of this incense is one of if not the best I&#x27;ve used ever. The incense lingers for a decent amount of time, in fact I can easily detect the scent the day after it was used. It isn&#x27;t a scent I&#x27;m familiar with, but I swear there&#x27;s not many that I enjoy more. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but is strong enough to fill the room with a great fragrance at a good level for hours.  In my opinion incense is either bad, ok, or great, this one is great and I plan to keep one or more of these boxes around.</li>
    <li> This incense is clearly of very high quality, yet is much sharper and sweeter than I imagined it would be. I will offset this sweet sharpness with other incense. Just know that there is a sharp sweet note in this product when burning. I give this product two stars merely to offset the predominance of five star reviews. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I first experienced India Temple Incense in an LA Restaurants restroom. They sold it as well, so I tried it in my workspace(private recording studio). I used to use Nag Champa quite frequently and was looking for a change. I use incense to create a meditative atmosphere for creativity as well as clear the space itself. Clients and friends began commenting how wonderful my workplace smelt and felt. First time clients have literally walked in introduced themselves then said, \\&quot;wow it smells great in here\\&quot;. I have given packets away of the incense to those who&#x27;ve asked me where to buy it. It&#x27;s powerful in it&#x27;s effect, yet not an overwhelming scent. I highly recommend it for meditation, clearing space and setting a nurturing tone in a home or healing space.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of these. I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe it but it&#x27;s a kind of heavy scent that really seems to help me relax. My only wish is that they were bigger but I&#x27;ll settle for a bigger box.</li>
    <li> These incense are a bit strange. By that, I mean that although they smell okay in the package - kind of sweet and soapy - they smell very strange when you burn them. It sort of smells like plastic. I was expecting something amazing based on all of the great reviews, but unfortunately, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of these while they are burning. And after they finish burning, my house smells like burnt plastic for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these incense I was a little iffy do to the mixed reviews, when I received them they were well packaged, and I could smell them through the packaging. I was still iffy prior to lighting them as the smell coming from the box was slightly soapy smelling, once I lit it it was like heaven, It&#x27;s a very hard to describe scent, not at all overpowering. Light smoke but not too much, and doesnt burn your eyes or throat the way some incense do. Very Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this incense. My 21 year old daughter used to hate the smell of incenses until she smelled this one.</li>
    <li> I was very concerned with the very strong scent coming out of the unopened delivery box!  Definately agree with another writer that the raw inscence is very pungent, but after the first 10 seconds of being lite, the much more pleasant fragrance comes through,  very mellow, which I like to use in the latter half of e day.  More of energy cleansing than for meditation.  Not one of my favorites, but everyone to their own preference.  But great value.</li>
    <li> The box doesn&#x27;t lie,this incense really does smell like heaven.  I found it very useful to meditate, relax in a bubble bath, and make cigarette smells disappear. So glad that this is a high quality item.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this so much! I have not found one that I love better than this one in a long time. Something about this scent brings an instant calm over me.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites; very similar to Nag Champa but with a more concentrated scent.  It&#x27;s a little overpowering for a small room, but it&#x27;s great for larger spaces and even for burning outdoors.</li>
    <li> It is not bad but it is very strong, I get a strong soapy, perfume, sweet floral scent. If you are to close to it you can taste it in your mouth. The sticks are well made they burn good and the price is right, but try it first. I got this box and its going to take me a while to burn them, I burn other scents on a daily basis mostly Satya and Goloka, this one is just another into the mix to change it around. Maybe I will try to burn some sandalwood at the same time to neutralize the sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June/2014 I had to up it one more star, I discovered with these that is better to let them sit for a while and air out, the older the sticks get the better the aroma, it has not changed it is just softer. I guess the ones I got were so new that the scent was extreme, but with time they have mellowed down a bit and I like them better. I guess they start loosing intensity and its scent is a little nicer, I hope they still get better with time.</li>
    <li> I love this incense! My Indian clients tell me it smells just like a temple in India. It certainly creates an uplifting, spiritual vibe in my \\&quot;temple.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I like the scent.  However, the scent isn&#x27;t as noticeable while burning as it is aftwerwards.  The scent lingers for several hours.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon, I actually bought it at a little market on the Oregon Coast. I only paid $5 for it too. :)   Anyway, this is literally the best incense I have ever smelled. I have 5-7 different types of incense right now, and this is the most fragrant of all of them. It gives the space a rather chill feel, which is something that I am always seeking. I definitely recommend this to anyone that loves incense. You will not be sorry.. Although, one complaint that I have is that the incense wood is pretty flimsy.. And I mean FLIMSY. I have had a couple of them break trying to puch them into potting soil.. So be warned.</li>
    <li> This is the best incense I have purchased and have purchased a lot over a lifetime! They smell wonderful and last a long time. I take them out of the package and use them around the house till I am ready to burn them. Great deodorizer!</li>
    <li> Wow - I absolutely LOVE the smell of this incense! It is so relaxing and calm! It&#x27;s not over-powering either. I like a subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t fill the room up and become unbearable, and this is it! Give it a try, it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
    <li> The package insists that this stuff smells just like heaven.    If I were just a little more gullible, I&#x27;d believe it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a truly awesome scented insence.... This is it, some of the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled, dcman2010</li>
    <li> This incense tends toward dark and musky, but without getting bogged down in forest fragrances.  It&#x27;s floral, but also spicy and exotic, and hints at summer nights. It&#x27;s a keeper, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to offer this quick review as it seems like a lot of people are satisfied with this product. First of all, its exactly as described, and the quality of the sticks is apparent. I just am not particularly happy with the scent. I wanted to make it perfectly clear that this stuff is not going to smell great according to everyone. Its my own fault for not having tried this out in a smaller amount, but still needed to be said. It isn&#x27;t as though the stuff is expensive, though...</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome! Found it originally in a specialty store. Sweet and potent, it has the most unique smell. Really strong and inviting.  One of my personal favorites.</li>
    <li> prettiest incense scent for me.  i burn it (attended and away from flammables) in my clothing closet -- scents all my closes. put sticks in my lingerie drawers and drawers at work. some in my car and stationery box.  plus for my religious observance :)  the matching perfume is nice, too.  this price is truly excellent.</li>
    <li> I gave one box to my son who is in college and his room mates love the scent. I will order more</li>
    <li> the first incense i lighted was beautiful smelling but then for some reason it starded smelling smoky.&lt;br /&gt;it also throws a lot of smoke!&lt;br /&gt;and my sister got her appendix removed so screw these incenses. i&#x27;m getting the highly acclaimed blue and white boxed ones or the ones about money/etc or the chakra ones.</li>
    <li> I used these as the finishing touch to my cleaning regimen.Smelled better than we expected.Received many compliments from guests,shipped on time &amp; undamaged.</li>
    <li> This incense is high quality and very fragrant.  However, to me, it smells exactly like the fragrance used in Febreeze fabric refresher spray, almost as if the folks who invented Febreeze went to India and smelled this incense and tried to recreate it for the American market.  In the commercials for Febreeze everyone behaves as if their house smells like heaven, so I suppose if you like it. . . you will like this.  I felt very iffy about it while it was burning.  Some people say it smells \\&quot;soapy\\&quot;, I say it smells \\&quot;Febreeze-y\\&quot;.  Buy the smallest package first, or you might get stuck refreshing your sock drawer with the unburnt leftovers.</li>
    <li> I love these! These incense sticks have a sweet, pleasant scent that lasts even a day or two after you burn it. I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I received this incense as a sample once and it immediately became my favorite.  If I&#x27;m writing or doing some artwork, this incense activates my creativity....I smell it and I have a sense of peace and tranquility.  An amazing smell.  I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something almost hypnotic about Song of India incense.  Against it, all others pale.</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe the heaven that is Song of India.  The cones are amazing also for when you want to fill a room fast.</li>
    <li> Out of all the incense I have ever used this is by far the best! It smells fantastic! You can use it either in the packet like a car freshener or where ever else, or use it as the incense. Which ever way you choose it&#x27;s very pleasing and lasts quite a long time. Burns great. I recommend this to anyone who loves incense and even those who are first time users.</li>
    <li> Love, love , love the scent of this...it has become my absolutely favorite smell! The great smell lingers a long time...my husbands really likes it too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an intense, beautiful scent - this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fresh, heady fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this before from shops, and loved the scent, but only recently decided to just go ahead and order the large box online. What a difference it makes... it is so strong I could smell the incense from within the Amazon box sitting on my doorstep- before I even opened my gate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent when I&#x27;ve purchased this incense before, but when it&#x27;s this fresh it&#x27;s too overwhelming for my senses. Not any problem with the incense itself, in fact, if you&#x27;re looking for a good odor destroyer, this will work wonders- without even being lit.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my all time favorite incense. It smells SO good and it will stain your clothes with smell if you burn it in your room enough. Everyone always compliments me telling me how much they love it and asking me where to buy this incense. They say, &amp;#34;You smell like hippie.&amp;#34; If you find this in a store it will be EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. Usually about 5 dollars for a package of 20 which is insane. I can go through 5  or so sticks in one day. Buying this product online is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Every time I burn this incense, I remember all the 5-star reviews on Amazon that prompted me to buy it. Then I feel torn between letting the uninterrupted torrent of five-stars continue, or post a review that, as an incense lover, provides an honest (if dissenting) opinion. I like this incense, but I don&#x27;t love it. I am disappointed because I imagined something heavenly -- something even better than nag champa! -- and I did not find it with this incense.     My first impression is that it smells like soap. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad. When you burn it, it smells like smoky soap. The other day I put something through my dishwasher that should not have been there, and when the burning smell first floated to my nostrils I thought \\&quot;Gosh, I don&#x27;t remember lighting the Song of India temple incense ...\\&quot; I realized then that I hadn&#x27;t lit it. My dishwasher was burning some piece of plastic.     I haven&#x27;t been to the temples in India. Perhaps this smells just like them. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but something about it seems a bit off. I strongly prefer the nag champa.</li>
    <li> Love love and love...smells beautiful..good deal...highly recommend! Best price I have found online for this incense..you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I love this incense. It smells so wonderful and the scent has saying power. Everyone I&#x27;ve burned it for loves it too, even the delivery guy told me how great my apartment smelled! Large package, lots of sticks, long burn time. I&#x27;ve ordered it again and again.</li>
    <li> omg I love these, nothing in the world could smell better and theyre so strong. When the package arrived EARLY I already knew it was them bc it was all I could smell. I keep a pack in my car under the seat and my whole car smells like a Buddhist temple. and the sticks are really small so they smell exactly the same when you burn them. No &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; odor like something is on fire. Awesome incense!!</li>
    <li> Great product and buy</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  No Hidden Agenda.  The Song Of India gives you a calm state of mind.  Visitors are literally begging for it or asking what aroma is burning.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and the scent lingers for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely favorite incense - makes the house smell so good!  Visitors to my home always comment on how good it smells, it really lingers for a few days and smells really exotic.  They have no idea I burn incense.  Prior to this I always only used Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa.</li>
    <li> A nice supply of these India Temple Incense sticks which light well and burn smoothly for about 35 minutes. Nothing overly special about the scent which does tend to hang around for a day or so after use. Personally I would try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I only gave it four stars because... well... i didn&#x27;t feel like giving it five.  Beside that, the package came on time with no broken sticks :) and it smells really nice, refreshing and flowery but not the kind of whorehouse/nose-blind grandma who smokes kind of perfume smell.  It&#x27;s a little perfumey and not too smokey but over all its worthy of burning in your home.</li>
    <li> The most aromatic scent I have found thus far. It makes morning meditation even more relaxing.  They are well wrapped, dipped, and did I mention the scent it amazing?</li>
    <li> i used to buy this cone incense in the &#x27;60s from the hayward capwell&#x27;s that smelled just like this incense.  this has a very flowery smell that is true even when burnt, although, when i lit the first stick, i thought, \\&quot;OH NOES! it smells like stick!\\&quot;  then i went outside and when i came back in, this heavenly scent was filling the room and i was so happy.  definitely not for guys unless you like real flowery smelling incense, but it also doesn&#x27;t smell like any febreze scent i&#x27;ve ever smelled, either. obviously, it&#x27;s hard to describe how a scent smells to each person, but it&#x27;s medium strength and lingers for a couple hours afterwards. i will be buying more of this wonderful incense.</li>
    <li> My favorite Incense. Recommended highly though, it may be better to try a smaller box at first to make sure it suits you.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of the negative and some of the positive reviews about this product. Ultimately, I won&#x27;t be ordering it again because it&#x27;s SO strong before you even burn it. I could smell it through the box while it was halfway down my sidewalk being carried by the UPS delivery man. I have to store it outside and can still get whiffs of it inside. The actual burning of it is less strong somehow.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this incense for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m surprise that the smell isn&#x27;t very strong when burning it. It&#x27;s quite pleasent and not what I expected based on the strength of it when it arrived. I&#x27;ve upgraded my 3 stars to a 4.</li>
    <li> My fave incense of all time. Love it</li>
    <li> Nice sent. Burns well.</li>
    <li> Now indeed the studio has the scent of heaven; the old gods are pleased as are my pugs. Praise Shiva!</li>
    <li> It is okay. I wish it was fresh stock, not bad. I kept it but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> India temple incense are the best quality and great spiritual scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> We were given a sample of this incense at a shop we were at, it is perfect for a room freshener even without lighting it. Smells so good! By far the best smelling incense I have come across.</li>
    <li> Love it!! The smell last a long time!! Just one stick thank you for the fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a hard core Nag Champa fan but this incense is right up there!  It&#x27;s a little sweeter than Nag Champa but it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was lookin for. Timely delivery and, to me, good quantity and quality for price</li>
    <li> These smell great.  Smells so much like the Balinese temples we were in.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like the incense before it is burned.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> very fragrant and lingers for hours....classic indian incense</li>
    <li> I order these all the time.  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent; I do not have allergic reactions to this brand.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this incense. It smells fantastic. The quality is great -- they always arrive whole (a problem I&#x27;ve seen with other incenses), aren&#x27;t messy like some others and burn nice and evenly. A great product that I&#x27;ll continue buying.</li>
    <li> Really covers the smell great. So no one is wise to my reefer madness. Give it a try. Anyone know dealers dealing Panama Red? Sure would like more of that.Wire Paladin, Denver.</li>
    <li> The package of incense is well made and burns for a long time.  The aroma is pure and not overwhelming.  I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> very fresh good quality incense</li>
    <li> I use incense instead of air fresheners. I have used many kinds and thought my last one was good, but after using this, this one is my favorite!  It is subtly sweet, not cloying or overwhelming, and has a very pleasant fragrance that lingers. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love having this scent during my waking hours and into the evening. A favorite of mine, one I have ordered many times in the past. A Great price as well. I&#x27;ll Be back soon.</li>
    <li> My house smelled so good without them being light. They burn slow and leave a sweat cloud of heavenly smoke. They are strong so if strong smells get to you.... try something different. The box lasted for about three months and i will order again and again.</li>
    <li> These will leave your place smelling great! Great Price. They burn pretty fast but I really love this purchase. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this smell. Very relaxing and been looking for this exact smell for also 10 years. Finally found it! Great buy.</li>
    <li> 2 sticks of this incense came with my [[ASIN:B0011YHH6O Wooden Coffin Incense Burner - Sun and Moon Inlays - Storage Compartment]]. I contacted Tom&#x27;s Incense asking what was this incredible incense and he got back to me in a couple of minutes. This is going to be the incense I use most, if not all, of the time. It is a light perfume that is not overbearing at all. Its also  delicate, beautiful and somehow lingers for days. It was such great luck to buy a burner that had a sample.</li>
    <li> Good price and high intoxicating smell. I would recommend, you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price, sold for much more in other places for less count.</li>
    <li> One if my absolute favorites!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  great price.  burns well, smells great. Thanks</li>
    <li> This will be a regular purchase for me!!</li>
    <li> You feel like you really are in the temple.</li>
    <li> this incense is the most amazing thing I had ever smiled. I bought a smaller pack of it at first and when I received it in the mail I knew immediately that I needed to buy more. This is definitely an amazing purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling incense that does&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> Nice subtle incense fragrance.  A new favorite!</li>
    <li> These incense sticks are truly enjoyable, what more can one say.  The number of sticks will last a long time and the price was a bargain.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite incense and was happy to get 120 sticks in one box.  I got it very quickly and box was in good shape.</li>
    <li> I love this incense and burn it quite a lot so having this larger box is very handy, especially since it&#x27;s hard to find it anywhere but on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really like this scent..it doesn&#x27;t burn for 45 minutes but the scent lasts several hours..  reminds me of patchouli and jasmine mixed together. Arrived undamaged also...can&#x27;t beat that..this incense is slightly shorter than HEM sticks but I&#x27;ll buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me one box once and since then I&#x27;ve been purchasing these. The smell is very soft and pleasant. I purchased them for my mother and she loved it. I recommend it</li>
    <li> The sticks last about 1hr burning in a coffin box . I get comments from visitors my house smells great and it gives a calming effect. will  buy more .</li>
    <li> The best I have ever smelled great stuff</li>
    <li> What is there to say? If you&#x27;re buying this you&#x27;ve probably already had it or heard all about it! Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This incense burns long and the fragrance lingers. It is a highly spiritual scent. Good for meditation. I would recommend this incense  to anyone craving high consciousness.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and also have the perfume oil of the same brand. The incense leaves a nice smell even after it is no longer burning. I will continue to purchase this product as long as it is available. I even like it more than the Nag Champa, which used to be my favorite. It is very sweet and sensual smelling in my opinion.</li>
    <li> In the glove box of one&#x27;s car, you can place the pkg. and your whole vehicle will smell like a wondrous dream...as for your home, you can&#x27;t miss! It dispels tantrums from one&#x27;s toddler-grandson &amp; turns things back to the light.</li>
    <li> I love these incense, they are perfect! They make my home smell wonderful, and I burn them when I meditate and when I&#x27;m doing yoga...I absolutely love them! They remind me of India, and I love the smell!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a huge incense person, but I came across this stuff in a store once and I have been hooked ever since. It really does smell like heaven. Awesome beyond words. Love. It. What else can I say?</li>
    <li> I first purchased these in a gift shop in Seattle. Ever since I have been in LOVE. I ran out and immediately got on amazon to purchase the big box. I am stoked! I feel better to burn them because when I only had a few sticks left I thought the world was going to end. :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed not having to get dressed and go drive across town to buy my incense. This fragrence is truly lovely and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> Great incense, amazing vibes. My roommates love it and it brought so much incense that I gave away a ton to my friends for their homes.</li>
    <li> I did not believe the reviews but they are true. This smells great. I keep lighting this scent even though I also ordered a 12 pack of assorted incense. Really, really smells great. Sort of a light powder smell. My husband usually hates this stuff but he likes this one.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and it is very potent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> GREAT Price for some GREAT incense.</li>
    <li> Shall I say I am transported to some mystical land where the gods run the perfumery factory , perhaps that sounds strange but it&#x27;s most beautiful scent ever</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased a few different incense from Tom , and each time I have not been disappointed , I&#x27;m trying to find some of my flavorite ones, but over the years, well I can remember some, but not all , and this is a great blast from the past , I bought a smaller pack, then immediately bought this size , I  could burn this all day , and not have an attack, I can enjoy it and believe me I do..~!~&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy from Tom , his delivery is spot on..and look forward to more scents, different brands..As always packed well, but because I&#x27;m trying the Amazon Prime { 30 day trial , which it has already been a life saver , ran out of bonito flakes, used the opt to pay $ 3.99 more to get next day...Let&#x27;s just say Kitty Galore { that would be Callie, our Calico } , put her claws away..;-))  ...This was covered also , and I got it today after ordering on the 15th , impressed , in fact so much so we are keeping it after trial is over, for less then $ 8.00 a month .. we buy from here every month , if not , every other , This service will in retrospect pay for itself..there is no $  25.00 limit to get free shipping , any amount as long as the item is covered by prime..the rest if it has s &amp; h , you pay for that..I&#x27;m also signed up for auto-ship on 2 items, but I just did that , so will edit review after a time..Overall I wait less time for order to arrive , pay less, and get other benefits as well..Life is good..Thanks Amazon and Sellers...~!~</li>
    <li> A friend in Alaska got me addicted to this scent. It feels so familiar and so healing. I alternate with this and another fragrance, but this is my absolute favorite. When I want to get into sacred space and be in meditation...this is the fragrance for that. I give it as gifts, and cherish it for myself. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance- although incense is an item that is spiritual and used in worship, I use it to change the &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; and give a wonderful fragrance to the air. My mother in law loves when it is burning and my husband says he just feels better when I have it burning. I am a Nag Champa fan but this is my absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of these incense.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> My water garden was just on a multi-state public tour.  I was burning this incense during the tour and so many people commented on it and asked about it I had to go in my house and bring out the package for people to write down the name.  I&#x27;m glad I just got a package because I fear there may be a run on it!</li>
    <li> Extremely overpowerful and heavily perfumed. Burns clean and smooth but WAY TOO potent for me. I had them stored in  its box in a drawer and the odor filled the entire room without being lit. A little musky and old sort  of like White Diamonds (Elizabeth Arden Perfume).</li>
    <li> Probably the best incense I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Fantastic smell, slow burn, and the scent lingers long after.  I went to a neighbors house, backpack in tow, and when I went to retrieve something from it, I noticed it smelled faintly of this incense.  I&#x27;ve been using incense for close to 20 years now and I&#x27;ve never noticed it attaching to my belongings before.  I love it!  I will forever have this in my personal inventory from now on.</li>
    <li> This box last a long time with it&#x27;s 120 sticks in 2 packages. The smell fills your house with the fragrance of India.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I will have to order more though, because my daughter came and took a bunch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also a Nag Champa fan.  I find this incense just fantastic.  I burn it every day!  The scent is rich without being overpowering and I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love this incense!  I&#x27;ve looked all over for it, and was so glad to find it here.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of it.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but use with ventilation, I wish they would list ingredients so I know what I am inhaling</li>
    <li> its good... came on time..... same product as stated.&lt;br /&gt;looks less in number.... think not 120....&lt;br /&gt;sticks looks very thiny...&lt;br /&gt;but smell is perfect</li>
    <li> Not like the incense I buy in metaphysical store. These fell apart when burning.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and diffuses very well. Very thin sticks, some only filled half way and burns way too quickly. I usually dampen the stick so that it lasts longer. Not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased a small pack of these at a local store, and I fell in love with them. The smell is delectable and powerful. Some people say it has a &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; scent, and at first I didn&#x27;t understand what they meant, but when I lit some other incenses and went back to these, I kind of understood their point. It is not a soapy smell, but it definitely has a more...pungent other than some milder scents, but I think its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last a pretty good amount of time, and the price for this 120 stick box is fantastic. I definitely plan on ordering another batch when I run out of these. A good buy for the occasional and the frequent user of incense.</li>
    <li> I just love this incense. The smell right out of the box blows me away. I don&#x27;t actually burn it, I just stick a few sticks here and there for their long-lasting fragrance. It really gives a bathroom that wonderfully fresh smell.</li>
    <li> These incense smells great. I found this scent once at a music festival and was afraid I would never find it again. Luckily here on Amazon I found them!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this when I ordered another fragrance of incense. This smells wonderful, like a nice perfume. It fragrances a large room nicely and quickly. Really enjoyable and it cleanses the area&#x27;s energy well.</li>
    <li> I got this in the biggest box because it was ultimately cheaper, however I will never use 120 sticks because after a while you just get tired of the smell. I like the smell a lot but it is too much for a small room. It smells a little like soap, of course if you know what and Indian Temple smells like, that&#x27;s what it smells like. I think it&#x27;s much more suited for burning in a large space, it would easily fill up a small apartment.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite incense. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I found this scent to remind me of bananas. Not my favorite for a bedroom I ended up burning them in my living room next to my kitchen.</li>
    <li> One of the hazards of cones is often you buy them and they won&#x27;t burn completely; if at all. These burn all the way to the base and smell like classic India temple as advertised.</li>
    <li> Song of India Temple incense has an smooth soapy scent. It is exotic and pleasing to my Western nose.&lt;br /&gt;The art work on the package is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The box I bought with 120 sticks had two cellophane wrapped bundles to preserve freshness which I appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that I find the quality of the individual sticks to be inconsistent. Some are nice and fat. Some are so skinny and flimsy that they do not even stand up in my burner. They also burn quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a similar exotic scent and better quality I recommend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QVJWW4 Holistic - Box of Six 20 Gram Tubes - HEM Incense]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002U31WXY Sultana - Box of Six 20 Stick Tubes - HEM Incense]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001B844I4 Rajdhani - 100 Gram Box - Satya Sai Baba Incense]]</li>
    <li> Even before I opened the box I smelled the sweet fragrance of angels. This scent is definitely a favorite and I will definitely buy more when I run out. The smell stays in the room for up to two days. the scent is one of a kind and will have people asking you what you use. MUST BUY!!</li>
    <li> A very strong floral with a bit of earthiness. Somewhat sweet, but not too much in that respect. It&#x27;s nicely balanced and is a clean fragrance, but again is very strong, yet not overpowering. I opt for the sticks these days because the cones are way too smokey for my tastes. It&#x27;s a rather intriguing scent that is out of the ordinary, but very nice in my opinion. You may want to try a small package to see if you like this before buying the bulk package. If you&#x27;re looking for something different, I would certainly recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!  I should have bought 2 packages since it was free shipping at that time....I will look for that deal again</li>
    <li> beautiful, aromatic fragrance, very lovely, one of my favs.</li>
    <li> It has an intriguing original smell. Bought this in a new age shop in my home town but they closed down. Glad for find it online!</li>
    <li> wonderful scent, relaxing, not overpowering... doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; like many incense brands do. Also, a portion of each sale goes toward Indian children&#x27;s charity programs - nice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inside TWO baggies now.  I can still smell it.  Have no idea how to stop the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying India Temple Incense, and it still remains my favorite. I buy it as gifts for my boyfriend, and it&#x27;s his favorite too! They are very nice quality. They all burn evenly. The scent is just beautiful and very fragrant. My boyfriend left this in his car for about a month before opening and even once he took it out, his car still smells of this incense weeks after! They are a great price, and great quality. They arrived earlier than expected and were packaged great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will continue to buy Temple of India Incense, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this brand. It settles in the house without being too strong. Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> My fav incense ever! Great price and smells soooo yummy!</li>
    <li> Smell so lovely. I wish my whole house could smell like the inside of this incense box! I have it in my drawer with my gift bags and everyone always comments &amp;#34;why does this bag smell so good?&amp;#34;. I have to say, I think the cones burn too quickly; sticks burn longer. With that, I think I like the smell of them before they are burned rather than after. None the less, I always receive compliments on how pretty the burning incense smells.</li>
    <li> nice amount of insence its strong smell lasts long time i use only once week but nice find on amazon</li>
    <li> Love this and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> It has a mild and relaxing smell that lingers long after it has finished burning.&lt;br /&gt;I light one in the evenings and the scent fills the room without being obvious (if that makes sense).</li>
    <li> I was walking down South street in Philly and I started smelling this wonderful scent coming out of a store. I ran in and asked what it was. Yes, India Temple Incense from Song of India. Now my wife and I burn a few stick everyday. Great quality and long lasting. Will buy this brand and scent as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> My favorite meditation scent.  My intutitive introduced me to this product several years ago and I have recommended it to freinds and family.</li>
    <li> Song of India Temple incense is my favorite incense. It isn&#x27;t thick or overpowering, and you can even put sticks in places without burning them to scent the air. I always keep a stick tucked up under the visor in my car, and my car always smells good inside.  I also put it in vases in the bathrooms and bedrooms. When the scent fades, it still smells wonderful when burnt. An oil that can be used as perfume or in oil warmers is also available. This incense has a warm and inviting scent to it, and I am often asked about it.</li>
    <li> This is some good incense. You get a good amount for the money. It smells great and it&#x27;s strong so it lingers in the room for hours. I would definitely buy more of it and the price is very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> I am one of those who pray everyday the traditional Indian way and have been using different incense since 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;And this one is best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others I prefer are Sai Flora but it&#x27;s very smoky due to oils and Nag Champa is good enough only for small space.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with India Temple Incense. One of my all time favorite scents.  Have some burning as I write this review and I am in heaven.  Great for meditation !!</li>
    <li> I found This to be  a nice deal on Amazon, and I felt it was a good deal to take advantage of. So I say it was a good deal for the buck.  SW</li>
    <li> Just looking at the packaging makes me smile! This incense creates such a peaceful, creative environment without being too sweet or floral...just the right balance.</li>
    <li> Great incense... our favorite. If your looking for a sweet but smooth incense then this is good stuff.... try it.</li>
    <li> What a sensual scent! I absolutely love this incense and the way it smells...would definately recommend it to anyone looking for an incense that makes the room smell delicious!</li>
    <li> i like the india temple incense and this is particularly nice in the sticks; the scent is pleasing and one that i never tire of, and even storing these in a drawer will bring that long lasting scent to everything near by.</li>
    <li> well if you want to smoke up a room, light four sticks as once and it will be just like back in India. Amazing how much you get out of a stick. I learned my lesson and only light one or two at a time. Excellent and they are packaged in groups instead of one big 120 bag so they stay fresh. One hint, they are already opened at one end. Found that out the hard way.</li>
    <li> i thought nag champa was the most awesome scent, but this one is just as good and seems stronger and isn&#x27;t as hard to light</li>
    <li> affordable, lovely incense!  The big box is wonderful as I often burn several sticks at a time.  This box lasts for a while!  The incense oil of the same name is equally as lovely and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this inscence ! Will definitely be buying more :)</li>
    <li> I love the way they smell and it was a good value.</li>
    <li> I love love love this incense!</li>
    <li> Lovely incense for keeping our home atmosphere pleasant! easy fast ordering, great price! Highly recommend India Temple Incense - Song of India - 120 Stick Large Box.</li>
    <li> I like this incense just as much as I like Galooka Nag Champa.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly say that I like one better than the other, I like them both equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the smell of soap at all, I get the aroma of flowers, oils, and wood. This is very nice incense in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing both Galooka, and this India Temple incense in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome scent! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> If you find yourself out of Red Nag Champa and feel like giving something else a try I find this to be a superior alternative.</li>
    <li> They smell like old perfume you&#x27;d find at a garage sale.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted I only wish I could order a larger quantity at one time haha I am in scent heaven</li>
    <li> I burn incense several times a day.  This one is a favorite!  Smells great, even if you have never been to an Indian Temple.  It arrived in quick speed and I am burning one stick right now!</li>
    <li> Very calming scent, my favorite over many incense I have tried. Would recommend and this price for 120 sticks is absolutely amazing. I would never buy incense in a store since their prices on Amazon in bulk are so great. Try this out if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
    <li> I use to use this incense, but now I find that I am allergic to it. Watery eyes and if around it for more than an hour or two I get the beginnings of  migraine headache. Whatever resins are used, they cling to clothes and skin and last for hours. When the temperatures rise, like when I am outside in the summer, the aroma comes off my clothes. I&#x27;d like to know how the contents of the product are produced? Do they  use pesticides or herbicides? I know they make thousands of these a day s I am curious why I would have such a strong reaction?</li>
    <li> Great smelling incense! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell.  Good product.  I would buy Song Of India incense again. Good product. Good product. Good product.</li>
    <li> My son first purchased this product and when I loved the smell from the very first time he used it and I had to have it.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave this particular incense to me, and now it&#x27;s my absolute favorite! I&#x27;m so happy I can order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Its a nice big box and it smells pleasant</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the time I was in India. An aroma so sought after throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me in a peaceful place.</li>
    <li> Great for one&#x27;s underwear drawers too.  It can seem strong while burning but you&#x27;ll likely enjoy the essence once done.</li>
    <li> my favorite incense ever!!! Lasting freshness and beautiful smell and with this seller you get them super cheap and fast!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, relaxing smell. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, fragrant incense is now our household favorite. move over Nag Champa, there&#x27;s a new stick on the block!</li>
    <li> I like the smell. It&#x27;s very pleasant. It&#x27;s almost &amp;#34;spiritual&amp;#34;? I don&#x27;t really know what that means, but it says that it smells like an Indian Temple on the box...and it actually kind of does. I saw some other people say that you can smell it through the packaging, and you can. I don&#x27;t know if they meant that as a bad thing, but for me that&#x27;s a good thing. I don&#x27;t burn as many. I can set one in the incense holder and not light it, and still get a decent smell in my place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s plenty of them. There were two individually wrapped packages in my box, and after some time, I&#x27;m still only about a quarter through the first package.</li>
    <li> A true scent f an Indian Temple. The scent lingers for hours making for a nice scented atmosphere. Excellent.</li>
    <li> My favorite incense in the entire world, makes your home smell like heaven, not overbearing, lovely, lovely, lovely.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this  great product,,  I am very happy with the price, the scent is  unique ,it leaves a sweet smell  long afterwards&lt;br /&gt; ,,it&#x27;s puts you in the mood  for meditation .that&#x27;s a plus!

    <li> My favorite. Awesome smell. Covers dog and cigarette smoke. They give you a lot for not much of a price tag. They even sell a roll on perfume if you really like the smell as much as I do.</li>
    <li> A delicate and beautiful fragrance</li>
    <li> Love these incense!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of incense for years and I love it.  The actual item delivered was just as good as ever.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Excellent incense. Have bought here and elsewhere. The price is almost always better on Amazon. Having been to India, I can say that the smell is pretty close. One stick has a lot of smell power. Definitely will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> My favorite incense is the Black Magic until I got these! This smell put my black magic smell in 2nd place! Its gonna be very difficult to find an incense that can top this Song of India....Big Time! CANT GO WRONG ON THIS ONE!!!  I even burn one every day in my car with some classical music during my lunch breaks...peace of mind!</li>
    <li> Always very satisfied customer. Love the smell and packaging.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite incense in the world! The smell is enchanting, and unlike any other incense smell. I would highly recommend it to those who like a flowery, earthy, strong scent.</li>

    <li> VERY FRESH..good deal</li>
