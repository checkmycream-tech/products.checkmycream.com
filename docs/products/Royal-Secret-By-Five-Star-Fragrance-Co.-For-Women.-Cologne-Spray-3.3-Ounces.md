      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad it is still available.</li>
      <li>I was SO delighted to find this scent on Amazon - it was my grandmother&#x27;s signature, and though the word \\&quot;grandmother\\&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly inviting when describing a fragrance, my Nana was the most elegant person I&#x27;ve ever known in real life.  </li>
      <li>Five stars because it was a very good product that we have been looking for a long time.</li>
      <li>Brought back memories, had not smelled this in soooo long.&lt;br /&gt;There used to be a splash that was great....</li>
      <li>Used this before but didn&#x27;t know it was still available.  </li>
      <li>when others said that what they received did not smell like the original.  </li>

      <li>I received exactly what I ordered in a timely fashion.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it because it has a hint of the real fragrance</li>

      <li>thankyou so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Nana.</li>
      <li>I hope the price remains as reasonable as what I paid on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Chris</li>
      <li>: Be aware that buying perfumes from discount places will more than likely give you an old product which has a different smell -- also, the color can be off.</li>
      <li>So many compliments are received when wearing Royal Secret, the one originally manufactured in 1926.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my Mom&#x27;s favorite and this is one of the few places I can find it anymore</li>
      <li>Have always used, live it</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find the original here, but skeptical</li>
      <li>I have half a bottle remaining from before they quit making it, and the order that I received was exactly the same fragrance as the original.</li>
      <li>It has a soft powder fragrance that</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think young women would like it at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it since the late 60s and have gotten many \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have seen a review stating it was stronger than the old</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s what they say about George Sand:  \\&quot;It opens with shining lemon notes and sweet and fresh bergamot followed by the heart of patchouli rose and amber and drying down to the base of musk and</li>
      <li>I wore Royal Secret all my young life, when I smelled it, it was not quite as strong, but when my husband came home and said,</li>
      <li>I have tried the new version Royal Secret Eau De which smells NOTHING like the original.  </li>
      <li>This is far more expensive if bought elsewhere.</li>
      <li>However, this particular bottle delivers one squirt towards my body and simultaneously delivers another squirt down the sides of the bottle which is so wasteful.</li>

    <li> My mom wore this frangrance for years. Then, for some reason, it just disappeared. No one was selling it. Thanks to Amazon, the fragrance is still available. Purchased it for Mom as a Christmas gift and she was elated! She loves wearing it when she&#x27;s going out with my dad or with friends. And the woodsy, spicy, citrus and floral notes bring back many wonderful childhood mememories.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001RVXPXA ROYAL SECRET - COLOGNE SPRAY 1.7 OZ [Health and Beauty]]]Product was what I was looking for. Have not been able to purchase this for a number of years. I am so glad it is back on the market. I hope the price remains as reasonable as what I paid on Amazon.Lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it has a hint of the real fragrance but there&#x27;s something either missing or that shouldn&#x27;t be there.  I would never order it again.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been perfect for my wife since 1958.</li>
    <li> I was SO delighted to find this scent on Amazon - it was my grandmother&#x27;s signature, and though the word \\&quot;grandmother\\&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly inviting when describing a fragrance, my Nana was the most elegant person I&#x27;ve ever known in real life.  Scents are hard to describe.  This one is delicious.  I know that doesn&#x27;t tell you much.  Let me try this:  before you could find everything on the internet, I bought a perfume called George Sand because it reminded me of Royal Secret, and it cost $175 a bottle.  Here&#x27;s what they say about George Sand:  \\&quot;It opens with shining lemon notes and sweet and fresh bergamot followed by the heart of patchouli rose and amber and drying down to the base of musk and sandalwood.\\&quot;  Royal Secret is the same - only nicer - and actually affordable.  Thanks, Nana.</li>
    <li> After being disappointed once in ordering Royal Secret from another place I am delighted with the Amazon product.  It is very much like the original from Germaine Monteil.</li>
    <li> This is a delightful floral scent. This is far more expensive if bought elsewhere. I was delighted to find this item on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product and value .. will shop again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years and it broke my heart when they said it&lt;br /&gt;was not going to be sold anymore. I love it. It is the best</li>
    <li> I love this - have used it for many years</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance I have used for 45 years. As my mother always told me you know you have the right perfume for you when you put it on and within 5 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it on yourself but others can. Well this is the only perfume that does that for me. This is the only one I use here not that I can no longer buy it at Gayfers. I don&#x27;t buy it from the perfume places in the Mall finding that it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same after a few weeks. (weakens) Even more I have had more compliments from both men and women wearing this you can imagine....especially men! To the women don&#x27;t forget the pulse points 8-)...</li>
    <li> I am Betty Jake and have worn this perfume for years--years before it changed ]names</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered in a timely fashion.  I have used it for 25 years and when I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  Thanks, Chris</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Royal Secret for over 40 years.  I always get&lt;br /&gt;compliments on it.  It has a soft powder fragrance that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having a problem getting it recently, then I discovered it&lt;br /&gt;at Amazon thank goodness.  The 3.3 oz  was particularly&lt;br /&gt;hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat Bohlke</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. HATE THAT THEY DISCONTINUED IT.</li>
    <li> Great price on my favorite perfume.  This was the only web site selling Royal Secret by Five Star Fragrance.  I tried several web site and was unable to find it.</li>
    <li> Have worn this fragrance for over 30 years....I still get compliments and questions about what it is! So glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece who has used this fragrance for years and was unable to find it.  I thought of Amazon !</li>
    <li> Expensive , but was what we wanted .</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this cologne, I get compliments galore!!!!  Used this before but didn&#x27;t know it was still available.  Seems like I had other favorites for awhile. I will reorder for sure!  Came on time and was in perfect condition.  Good product</li>
    <li> love love love royal secret.  not happy at all about the relaunch of this perfume.  Leave it alone!!  do not like new royal secret at all!!  will continue to search for the original!!</li>
    <li> I have used Royal Secret for over 30 years and when I went to buy a bottle I was told that they had changed the formula and I was devastated.  My son told me to look on Amazon and I found the original so that is why I rated it the way I did.  Thanks so much for have the original sent.</li>
    <li> The Royal Secret scent is not the same as the Royal Secret fragrance I have bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning the product.</li>
    <li> Brought back memories, had not smelled this in soooo long.&lt;br /&gt;There used to be a splash that was great....for daytime.....</li>
    <li> i enjoyed getting my fragrance back used it for 20 years</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Always have, always will. However, this particular bottle delivers one squirt towards my body and simultaneously delivers another squirt down the sides of the bottle which is so wasteful. You cannot go wrong with the classic fragrance.</li>
    <li> A product that I thought that I could no longer get...thank you Amazon.  I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This reminds me of a cheap cologne! I can&#x27;t even give it away!</li>
    <li> Excellent condition once received via postal mail and it smelled great , not watered down.  I would definitely purchase this item again and use the same vendor.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the most fragrant perfume ever!  I have used this for many, many years.  Received this as a gift years ago and have continued using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I have worn Royal Secret for over 35 years.  It is (was) my signature fragrance . . . the absolute best perfume for me ever!.  I just dont understand, after being able to purchase this product for many years in some stores and online without any problems, that now its availability is rare (especially the 3.3 fl. oz.) and the price for this product as quadrupled, if not by more. This is ridiculous! The company, because of pricing and availability, has made it almost impossible for some faithful and loyal customers to purchase.  [Does anyone else feel the same?  If so, please make your concerns known, maybe things will change!]</li>
    <li> So many compliments are received when wearing Royal Secret, the one originally manufactured in 1926. I am stocking up as this scent is no longer made.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff; it&#x27;s an annual stocking stuffer item.  She&#x27;s never disappointed and I know there will be no returns!!</li>
    <li> Five stars because it was a very good product that we have been looking for a long time.</li>
    <li> Completely thrilled with this item! I was very unhappy to hear that Five Star will no longer be making my favorite fragrance, Royal Secret.  I have tried the new version Royal Secret Eau De which smells NOTHING like the original.  I was very excited to find the original here, but skeptical when others said that what they received did not smell like the original.  I was COMPLETELY satisfied with the order!  I have half a bottle remaining from before they quit making it, and the order that I received was exactly the same fragrance as the original.</li>
    <li> Royal Secret is the most unique scent I have ever experienced. I&#x27;ve been wearing it since the late 60s and have gotten many \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; questions.&lt;br /&gt;Royal Secret was originally introduced by Monteil of Paris in 1935. It is truly captivating and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Citrus top notes&lt;br /&gt;Middle notes of jasmine and rose&lt;br /&gt;Bottom notes of sandalwood, musk, and myrrh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Be aware that buying perfumes from discount places will more than likely give you an old product which has a different smell -- also, the color can be off. Also, the packaging can be different. This has happened with me in buying Royal Secret a couple of times in the past and it was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another example: I sampled an expensive men&#x27;s cologne in a perfume discount store in a mall, then went to Dillard&#x27;s and sampled the same cologne. It was like night and day!!! So buyer beware. It&#x27;s worth the price difference to get the real thing.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE,  PRICED TOO HIGH!!!! WOULD BUY MORE OFTEN FOR MYSELF AND GIFTS IF PRICE REDUCTION.  I ORDERED 2 BOTTLES THIS TIME,  ONE FOR A FRIEND......THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Wore this for years, am glad to find it again on Amazon and at a  great price.  Exactly the great scent I remember</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this cologne. It&#x27;s my Mom&#x27;s favorite and this is one of the few places I can find it anymore</li>
    <li> I have worn Royal Secret for upwards of 25 years....it is my signature fragrance.  It is not overpowering yet I get endless compliments from men and women alike.  I would recommend it to anyone, in any age group, for day or night time use. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I personally hate the smell. I like Galore, buy my mother (81) loves this and marinates in it. I don&#x27;t think young women would like it at all.</li>
    <li> This is my signature fragrance.  One time a second grader said, &amp;#34;You held my puppy today, didn&#x27;t you.&amp;#34;  When I said, yes, he responded &amp;#34;I could smell your perfume on the puppy.&amp;#34;  You never know what people notice about you!</li>
    <li> Have always used, live it but you overcharge for it</li>
    <li> An old favorite.  I have seen a review stating it was stronger than the old but I did not find this to be true.</li>
    <li> I wore Royal Secret all my young life, when I smelled it, it was not quite as strong, but when my husband came home and said, Oh you smell so good, I knew it was great. thankyou so much.</li>
