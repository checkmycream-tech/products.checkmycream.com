      <li>It is for sure virgin remy, it does not tangle or shed.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it soft and it&#x27;s a great lace front blends nicely with my hair.</li>
      <li>but I took a chance anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Cheap looking thing.  </li>
      <li>A closure this cheap??</li>
      <li>density not too full, just right..natural part undetectable, can style and part as you desire...</li>
      <li>It has not failed me!</li>
      <li>Also came wth a free gift, a pair of eye lashes and the shipping ws fast.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it blended it nicely with my Creme de la Creme Virgin Brazilian deep wave hair, so far I&#x27;ve washed it and re-installed it twice.</li>
      <li>and it was a waste of money compared to the 30$ one I got from aliexpress which is GREAT never again</li>
      <li>I had to manipulate the hair to get it right</li>
      <li>it had a very strong processed smell, I had to co-wash and deep condition it twice and the smell went away.</li>
      <li>top closure by far meets great quality and/or better in comparison to alleged high end closures I&#x27;ve purchased through suppliers outside of amazon.  </li>
      <li>This was actually my first time using a lace front</li>
      <li>It changed over to a different seller and more $$$.</li>
      <li>I have washed this closure a couple times, bleached the knots, died the lace with hot tea and the hair is still holding up very well.</li>
      <li>literally one month all the hair fell out and it looked as if I had a huge bald spot in the middle of my head.</li>
      <li>and it goes with it very well.</li>
      <li>I also bleached the knots and it held up very well.  </li>
      <li>You have a new customer, thanks again...</li>
      <li>The hair on this closure is soft, shiny and DOES NOT SHED and matched the  hair I already own after I dyed it the exact same shade of dark brown.</li>
      <li>It makes my hairline look very natural.</li>
      <li>This is not the same closure I got the first time 2/20/14.</li>
      <li>The first made me order a second.</li>
      <li>I agree with one of the reviewers who said is the same and maybe better than some of the more expensive lace closures.</li>
      <li>I love this closure but unfortunately, I was only able to use it twice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used high quality virgin hair from a long established, reputable US vendor but this is my first closure purchase as I usually blend.  </li>
      <li>however I didn&#x27;t like how the hair went straight back on it.</li>
      <li>Looks real and can path in the middle and the sides.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s early days, I cannot complain about this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I have wand curled it, regular curled it, straightened it bone straight, washed it</li>
      <li>No shedding and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>The reason I want to buy is because I have a few bald spots on the top of my head due to me pulling my hair out when I&#x27;m stressed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks real and can path in the middle and the sides. Hair is good quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used high quality virgin hair from a long established, reputable US vendor but this is my first closure purchase as I usually blend.  The hair on this closure is soft, shiny and DOES NOT SHED and matched the  hair I already own after I dyed it the exact same shade of dark brown. I also bleached the knots and it held up very well.  Great buy IMO.  Even though it&#x27;s early days, I cannot complain about this purchase.  The item was also delivered promptly with free shipping!</li>
    <li> Horrible Horrible Horrible!!! Don&#x27;t order! It&#x27;s a waste of money! Go to aliexpress.com to order your hair! Their hair is way more better quality!</li>
    <li> This was a good closure. The hair was nice and silky and ever got tangled. But the lace doesn&#x27;t least long . And Some time before i put it in i had little patches where you can see the closure.</li>
    <li> I love it soft and it&#x27;s a great lace front blends nicely with my hair. This was actually my first time using a lace front and I love it</li>
    <li> This is not the same closure I got the first time 2/20/14. The 1st one was from China and this other one is from Vegas. My first one was perfect , full and no shedding. This one is a thin mess. I clicked the same order.  It changed over to a different seller and more $$$. Cheap looking thing.  That&#x27;s messed up. The first made me order a second. Don&#x27;t buy this. Can&#x27;t stand sellers that do this.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy. I have washed this closure a couple times, bleached the knots, died the lace with hot tea and the hair is still holding up very well. I love the quality of this hair and will be ordering it again. I agree with one of the reviewers who said is the same and maybe better than some of the more expensive lace closures. The hairline is very believable. I paired this hair with the Moisture Remy Rain Wet and Wavy and it goes with it very well.</li>
    <li> This virgin Brazilian hair lace top closure by far meets great quality and/or better in comparison to alleged high end closures I&#x27;ve purchased through suppliers outside of amazon.  I will definitely buy again from this supplier. density not too full, just right..natural part undetectable, can style and part as you desire...love it!</li>
    <li> Okay let me start of by saying I was EXTREMELY skeptical about buying this closure. I mean hair from Amazon.. A closure this cheap?? This hair has completely proved me wrong! I bleached the closure and I dyed it. I have wand curled it, regular curled it, straightened it bone straight, washed it; you name it. This is my third week with the closure in and I have no shedding or tangles. I will say some mornings I cant get it to act just right; but all-in-all this was a great buy! I will definitely be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Terrible product&lt;br /&gt;After literally one month all the hair fell out and it looked as if I had a huge bald spot in the middle of my head. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and if you do insist on buying, please proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, my weaves typically last three months and I as I mentioned, I had to take it out after one month. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I still have in the package it came after my birthday I have no desire to use it . 3 stars for effort it was ordered in June and received it July 6.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Arrived very quickly. I can part it various ways. Great closure for the price! Would definitely recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it blended it nicely with my Creme de la Creme Virgin Brazilian deep wave hair, so far I&#x27;ve washed it and re-installed it twice. Closure piece has minimal shedding and the unit doesn&#x27;t look like I have on a hat or lace front. Part looks good and people have mistaken it for my hair and scalp. Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the unit is when it arrived it had a very strong processed smell, I had to co-wash and deep condition it twice and the smell went away.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much, I love it! The texture is perfect and the shipping was fast! I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. You have a new customer, thanks again...</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this hair. No shedding and it looks natural. I would purchase this hair again.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS CLOSURE, THIS IS THE SAME QUALITY AS THE CLOSURE I SPENT 200.00 FOR, THIS IS THE BEST HAIR PRODUCT i PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.... I WILL DEFINITELY BE BUYING MOE OF THESE CLOSURES AND IW ILL BE RECOMMENDING THEM TO EVERYONE I KNOW...iI WISH THEY HAD THE HAIR TO MATCH THE CLOSURE BECAUSE THIS IS THE BOMB...</li>
    <li> I ordered this closure and had it for a month it shed like crazy it thinned out it was DRY and I was very unhappy with it..I paid 60$ for this and it was a waste of money compared to the 30$ one I got from aliexpress which is GREAT never again</li>
    <li> Did the job. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Fuller, longer. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about getting this closure on Amazon, however because Amazon has never let me down on ANY other item I thought I&#x27;d take the chance.... First off, this is not a silk base. It is however an excellent closure. The hair does not shed at all, however I did buy an inexpensive knot sealer. I chose to sew this piece down instead of glue. It has not failed me! It makes my hairline look very natural. I am very pleased and I will probably order this one again. It is for sure virgin remy, it does not tangle or shed. Perfect!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical but I took a chance anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This closure is great!! I will be ordering again. Love it😄!!!</li>
    <li> The closure had a nice texture however I didn&#x27;t like how the hair went straight back on it. I had to manipulate the hair to get it right</li>
    <li> I love this closure but unfortunately, I was only able to use it twice.</li>
    <li> Hair was good for a couple days , started to she&#x27;s like crazy after! Bad lace front won&#x27;t last , but pretty soft hair</li>
    <li> Best closure ever for the price ..and they also sent me some bomb looking mac eyelashes .. Beautifully made with baby hairs</li>
    <li> Buy at risk after 1 month I have bald spots started off amazing then ended up losing hair</li>
    <li> I have not purchased this yet. I just want to know can I use this just by itself? It might be a dumb question but I have no idea about extensions and all of that lol. The reason I want to buy is because I have a few bald spots on the top of my head due to me pulling my hair out when I&#x27;m stressed. So can somebody please help me with this?</li>
    <li> The reviews I read on this closure almost made me not purchase it. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance cus for the money this item is great! I would recommend and definitely will be ordering from this seller again. Also came wth a free gift, a pair of eye lashes and the shipping ws fast.</li>
