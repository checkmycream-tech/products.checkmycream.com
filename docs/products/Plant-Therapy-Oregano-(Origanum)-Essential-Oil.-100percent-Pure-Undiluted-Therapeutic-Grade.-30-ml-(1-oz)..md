<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only time will tell if this works for me.........but all the reviews I&#x27;ve read so far, it can only improve things which sounds great.</li>
    <li> ID GIVE IT 5 STARS IF I KNEW BETTER HOW TO USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I can claim the fame to knowing how to use this; use in less fragile areas...arms, legs knees it was great.&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt it would work well for Candidiasis? Impetigo? any kind of fungus?&lt;br /&gt;I think I was treating Molluscum Contagiosum, and it cleared it off of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely strong.&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST USE THIS MIXED WITH A CARRIER OIL.&lt;br /&gt;THE COMPANY I BOUGHT IT FROM WAS VERY HELPFUL.</li>
    <li> Oregano is incredible and this oil as good as any of the very expensive I have used. I can&#x27;t recommend how anyone else uses it, but in our home we use it for ALLERGIES (cannot stress enough how much this has alleviated our terrible allergy symptoms when every drug imaginable has failed), reducing cold or flu symptoms as well as fatigue. It helps with canker sores, all kinds of insect bites, gum diseases, etc.  I have passed the information on to others and they have had same results. Amazing stuff. I am not in any kind of health food, organic, or alternative medicine type business, but always open to trying anything natural. It just makes sense. This oil is fabulous. Good seller, very competitive pricing.</li>
    <li> Would buy it by the quart, if available! Use it every day in the cats&#x27; food (this is an animal rescue shelter) and chronic infections clear up. Great for oral health (animals and humans), too. I&#x27;ve had a broken molar for 15 years and occasionally an abscess will form. Those can be fatal, but I apply a dropperful of coconut oil mixed with this oregano oil (enough to really sting) and it&#x27;s gone in an hour (at most). Put it on cuts and they heal quickly. Works well as a spice (add it to beans, ratatouille, marinara, etc)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have an open bottle and a spare, re-ordering when the open bottle is low. May soon begin keeping two spares because I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it. AWESOME addition to both medicine cabinet and spice rack!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6th NOV 2013: have now ordered from Plant Therapy Essential Oils at least a dozen times and love all of their oils, so far. Will be ordering from them on a regular basis unless the quality of their products or customer service takes a nosedive.</li>
    <li> High quality.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Just be aware,  it&#x27;s got a STRONG flavor.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. I&#x27;m not an expert but I knew it was authentic when it literally started burning me and my family&#x27;s skin when it sat accidentally on our skin, and it is actually now healing us (and quickly).</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the big MLM brands. Enjoy the many uses for oregano oil!</li>
    <li> A number of the reviewers remarked on the potency, they are spot on.  I&#x27;d much rather dilute it myself, gives me control over both the dilution ratio and the quality of the olive oil or the coconut oil I use.</li>
    <li> 100% impressed with the quality, price, manner of shipping. SUPER impressed with the larger sized bottles of oil available and the fact that the large bottles also have droppers. A lot of companies don&#x27;t put droppers in the larger bottles. It is an absolute delight and bonus that all of their essential oils have labels on top of the caps of the name of the oil. Plant Therapy is my official go-to for essential oils!</li>
    <li> I use this in my food and to bush my teeth It is strong so be careful a drop is it....  Came fast and price was real good..</li>
    <li> A wonderful immune boosting aid... but tastes like I was chewing on railroad ties soaked in creosote... My goodness this stuff is nasty but am finding ways to get it down without instantly watering up...</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  But you have to be careful.  Don&#x27;t put it straight on your skin, or ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put one drop on an altoid.  Let it sit.  Then...put it in my mouth.  Intense burning!!  I rinsed it, soaked it in spring water - drank the water, it was strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the altoid back in the box.  Over a month later, my daughter found it.  She put it in her mouth (it had been in the hot car for over a month) and she spit it out and said it burned burned burned!!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful with this stuff.  Very potent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerful! As some herbalists say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hot.&amp;#34; Put a little on your tongue and see what they mean. If you buy the product be certain to go on line and learn the proper ways to use it and all of the wonderful things oregano can do for your and your family&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> Ok so I can&#x27;t bash it for not working I honestly don&#x27;t know if it does or not but I can say it stinks. It smell like I&#x27;ve been working with WD 40 or something mechanical. That might be cool for my husband but I&#x27;m not digging it.</li>
    <li> I had a large, deep wart on the ball of my foot.  My girlfriend who worked in the medical profession for years said that I would need to have surgery to remove it.  But I had read that oregano oil would kill warts in one or two applications.  That&#x27;s not what happened in my case.  In my case, it took about one entire bottle of oregano oil, over about two months of applications a few times a week to kill it.  The wart started out like a cluster nearly a half inch in diameter just off center on the ball of my foot.  In the first few applications, I was seeking to see something dramatic, which never happened, so I got discouraged at first.  But I did notice a few tiny black dots appear, and it began to appear to shrink a bit.  After a few weeks of just two-three applications, I began to just apply it much more frequently, nearly daily, and all over my feet, instead of just a tiny bit on the wart itself.  I had to dilute the oil with a carrier oil, and I chose Almond oil.  About 5 drops of oregano oil and about a teaspoon of almond oil.  Oregano oil is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;, and it feels like it&#x27;s burning my skin if I make it too strong without a diluting oil.  I also just began using the diluted oil all over, as it smelled good.  Finally, when the wart was gone, it was kind of a surprise, because there was absolutely no trace of it whatsoever.  No scar, no indentation, no black dots anymore, nothing.  Just pure, beautiful, smooth natural skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time in perfect condition.  It was even more than I expected.  I added two drops of the Oil of Oregano to two oz. of olive oil my carrier oil. I take two drops of the mixture three times a day.  I started feeling better by the next day.  I will surely  buy more oils from this company.  The only thing that would have been nicer would have been to get an info sheet on the oil and the company.</li>
    <li> Swift delivery, Yes it is very potent.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Definitely will buy&lt;br /&gt;from vender again.</li>
    <li> This was part of my first purchase from this company~ Plant Essentials. I am very, very impressed with the company as a whole (customer service, open honesty about product quality...which is great), and their essential oils are very nice. I love that the EO name is labelled on top of every bottle lid as well as on the side.</li>
    <li> i was very pleased with this product  it is very strong.  i rub it on my painful joints and the pain leaves immediately</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this oil, my husband had an infection on his leg and he used this on the spots that were breaking out and within a day, they were gone. He is all healed now. I Iove this Oil. It can be used for all kinds of infections.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to help my peach tree which has peach leaf curl.  After just one dose, everything looks better and I hope that another dose or two will completely kill off the fungus.  There are tons of little fruits developing, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I have purchased other products in the past and realized that they were diluted... so I was very pleased that this was 100% pure and undiluted, as advertised.</li>
    <li> great oil, as described</li>
    <li> I use oregano oil for just about everything.  I can&#x27;t enough good things about it.  It is a cure-all for anything that ails you.  I have asthma and I use it for an expectorant.  It soothes my lungs and throat.  It relieves my inflammation when I have flare-ups from occasional arthritis and also if I have a scratch or any kind of pain. The true benefits of this powerful oil can only be appreciated through its actual use for anything. A must have in any medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two bottles of this oil about 3 months apart and was very happy with the consistency of the product (the labels were slightly different so I knew they weren&#x27;t bottled at the same time).  My only complaint about the packaging is that the bottle comes already stuffed with an inner top that is meant to control the flow by individual drop.  I take it out because of the way I use the oil and it is difficult to remove (this time I ended up spilling some of the product, which was just a waste).  I&#x27;d like to see the inner top included as an option rather than pre-loaded into the bottle top.</li>
    <li> love it - wonderful product</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very concentrated will last a while. Must be careful with the strength, can burn.Use it in my smoothie.</li>
    <li> Pure and perfect...exactly what I wanted and with speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!! This is 100% pure &amp; for the past 5 years have been taking 75% Oregano to 25 Olive oil. I mixed this last night &amp; it is perfect!!!!!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t like the other brand that I got before - didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent quality and arrived on time</li>
    <li> I use this daily as part of my teeth cleaning regimen and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very strong - Needs to be diluted I use it as disinfectant it can burn the skin . It last longer if you dilute yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in my toothpaste. It is doing the job. It is strong stuff and that is what I was hoping for. I hunted a long time to find the undiluted stuff. While I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison, I believe it is undiluted. I will buy again when I need more for my toothpaste. I may even start finding other uses for it. Good seller and good product.</li>
    <li> Oregano oil is great, bloating subsided, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Using for toenail fungus...works just so-so</li>
    <li> great product &amp; very strong!!!!! more than worth the money I paid... I must be honest I&#x27;ve been trying other oils that are listed on amazon &amp; sadly I have very DISAPPOINTED!!!!!  I&#x27;M GOING BACK TO PLANT THERAPY ONLY!!!!! Unless it&#x27;s one they don&#x27;t carry....  I picked other items based on price and the great reviews given, I&#x27;m not sure if the people leaving the reviews  are used to a poor quality of oil or just starting to experimenting  w/ them no matter what the case...  keep trying other companies to find what works best for you,</li>
    <li> My daughter takes this oregano oil religiously every day. She claims it keeps her healthy. I have taken it when I felt that I was getting sick and it seemed to do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a full strength oil of oregano as described.  Make sure you dilute it down before oral use.  I have been very happy with it and will reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is awesome oil!  Very strong - will take out a wart or skin tag in a New York minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s a very hot oil, you will want to apply it ONLY to the skin tag - and you can expect some tingling when you do.  (If it burns, cut the oil with carrier oil.  It takes longer to get rid of whatever it is that you are getting rid of, but there&#x27;s less chance of a reaction.)  And you don&#x27;t really want to splash it on yourself.  Ask me how I know.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left some with my mom, (in a blend), who is using it to remove a seborrheic keratosis on her scalp. (Yes, she had it checked, by a dermatologist, it IS a keratosis and not cancer. Thank you.)  In only a couple of weeks the  growth is less than half the size it was.  She&#x27;s very excited, and I foresee that I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> I use my essential oils for cooking and medicines, and this is powerful, I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  Thank you. I have made it into a ointment with coconut oil for nail fungus. The radio of coconut oil to oregano essential oil is 5:1 ratio. It is for external use only.  Will be used only on toenails.  To be used by a family member that has nail fungus.</li>
    <li> With this product including a dropper on the bottle, it is extremely easy to measure out consistently each time. Very strong as described.</li>
    <li> Very very potent, but works very well. Be careful as it is very powerful and it will burn your skin if you dont mix it with another oil.</li>
    <li> Be careful using this oil straight up, it will burn u</li>
    <li> for medicinal purposes it works.</li>
    <li> This oil has helped my dog with his allergies!  He is much happier and the redness in his infected ears has disappeared!  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I got the oil of oregano for my grandsons acne. Come to find out it is anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial. It acts as a pain killer, reduces inflammation &amp; aids digestion. Highly recommended by our family for aromatherapy &amp; naturopathy.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use with coconut oil for my daughter&#x27;s plantar wart and in less than 1 month, it is completely healed.  The wart had been frozen 5 times by the dermatologist without too much success in a 3 month span.  This along with the coconut oil has gotten rid of it.  I wish Amazon still carried this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much it loosened up the mucus in my husband and sons chest.Love it. You have try it.</li>
    <li> Reasonaable price/fast shipping/good package. , luv being able to select the size.and the built-in dropper feature. Caution, caution caution, product is undiluted so be very very careful.</li>
    <li> This product arrived as promised. I will say that the 100% pure is true. This is very strong just be mindful that it requires dilution.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after learning about all the health benefits on the Dr. Oz show.  I have used it in several different ways and hope to continue exploring it&#x27;s many healing properties.  I have struggled with chronic sinusitis for the past 2 years and am convinced that this product has helped keep my immune system stronger the past several months.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, glad I got it while it was at a steal on the price. Helps with almost everything you can think of.</li>
    <li> This oil is very useful.  I used 1 drop in some juice and immediately my sinuses cleared up.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This thing is powerful!  Be aware that you can only use 1 or 2 drops undiluted and even then it is serious business.  Please do not play around with this if you do not know what you are doing!</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was exactly as expected. I measured the quantity of fluid and the volume is correct (unlike many other manufacturers). The oil is pungent and fresh smelling and extremely concentrated. Great product.</li>
    <li> First order from this supplier, I&#x27;m very happy with the results from using the Oregano Oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, very potent. .</li>
    <li> Bought this item in desperation to fight sinuses.  I suppose it is good for cooking.  It did not help my sinuses but is now in my kitchen cabinet awaiting the next spaghetti sauce recipe.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to get it so soon. Started using asap to help clear up a tooth infection. Still working on that. Its wonderful stuff for deep cleaning and healing.</li>
    <li> Wow.  This is powerful stuff.  I use a drop or two on my toothpaste for antiseptic properties and can immediately tell a difference.  I&#x27;ve used it on my skin abrasions and it has healing properties.  I recommend but use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> It is great, however very strong, so you must be careful when you apply anywhere on skin. I have been diluting with coconut oil as a carrier. love it though</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my oil of oregano purchase! It came quickly and the quality is excellent! I will certainly recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> smells wonderful, just as expected!  Packaging was very protective.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Everything I wanted!</li>
    <li> Suggested for an ear treatment but when I used it on q-tip in ear I thought I would die from the intense burning.  Burning that made me scream and jump up and down and rinse ears with water.&lt;br /&gt;Do Not use this in ear as suggested on some sites.&lt;br /&gt;BURNS BURNS BURNS.  Can&#x27;t imagine putting this in a child&#x27;s ear for earache.&lt;br /&gt;However, the ringing in my ears is much better now.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt this is some strong, strong stuff! You&#x27;ll know that the moment you open the bottle. Definitely dilute it before you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good quality glass with a built in drip dispenser, works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just started using it, but so far I like it just fine. 1 oz should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have sinus problems that have been on me since the beginning of time. Doctors want to saturate me anti-bios. I&#x27;ve been vapor breathing Oregano oil for two weeks,and a lot of the drainage down my throat has diminished. Great stuff!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t no anything about Oregano. I take it for my Ulcerative Colitis at recommendation by the SCD Diet. This stuff is potent! I found some advice on the internet on how to consume. I take 5 drops each morning on an empty stomach. I hold water in the back of my throat, put in the drops and tank it with more water. I then immediately brush my teeth. There is HEAT, but after several minutes, it subsides. It does not work to mix with juice as the HEAT gets worse if you swish it in your whole mouth vs. just taking it down the throat. The smell is strong as well. I only assume that the odor and the heat make this a high quality product. Ship was secure and quick; being that the bottle is glass.</li>
    <li> I bought another brand of oil of oregano in the city.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it was combined with olive oil.  This one is a pure extract.  It&#x27;s working very well on my yeast infected toenails.  It&#x27;s just a matter of time before the nails fall off.</li>
    <li> do not drop this in your mouth raw and remember... oil does not disolive in water... if using this for home remidies best to put one drop along with another oil or food because it will burn your mouth!</li>
    <li> Came on time and really helps with my problem skin. I would purchase this again. Thanks again. Love your shop.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and is definitely helping the circulation in my husbands legs. I rub a couple of drops on his feet every night. Will keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> Oregano is a really useful essential oil and has a million great applications.  That is why I bought the larger size.  I like how there is a label on top of this brand&#x27;s bottles and a little explanation on the side unique to each oil.  Shipped great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if most people know this, but this product can cure and prevent fungal toenails.  You don&#x27;t need all those expensive anti-fungals---that don&#x27;t work anyway!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled. The delivery was fast and the product was well wrapped. And this oregano oil smells heavenly compared to the previous brand I have used, a huge difference, much better quality. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being dissatisfied with this oil, but there are some snooty ones in every bunch that can never be happy, just ignore them and enjoy the good in life, this oil is part of that good.</li>
    <li> This is pure oregano oil, so I can mix it up as I have need.  I use coconut oil (1 tsp to 1 drop of oregano oil, adjust accordingly), and it works great.  I use it on my skin when I have a break out, instead of harsh chemicals, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but works to get rid of breakouts quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product and the service, would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product is for external use only (aroma therapy)... That was NOT made clear in the description. It is of little use to me as,I purchased it for cold and flu treatment.</li>
    <li> Great service and quality.</li>
    <li> Very impressed by the Excellent Quality of this Oil. I use it as an antibacterial aid. Also works great  for removing small moles.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Very potent! You only need one drop of this magnificent oil.</li>
    <li> Nice oregano smell. Product as described.</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> Great product. All information about how to use and benefits you can find by Google it. I recommend it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very potent, don&#x27;t apply directly to skin unless you enjoy pain. Use carefully, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality. I recently switched to mostly plant therapy oils and needed it quickly so I ordered it through amazon.  The price is excellent!</li>
    <li> Have been using tea tree oil for 18 mo 2X a day.  Some , but little improvement.  The oregano oil has shown improvement  in 7 days.  Just be sure feet are dry, nails not built up with keratin slough cells.  Let dry for 15 min befor applying shoes</li>
    <li> excellent does as advertised</li>
    <li> Strong but really good!</li>
