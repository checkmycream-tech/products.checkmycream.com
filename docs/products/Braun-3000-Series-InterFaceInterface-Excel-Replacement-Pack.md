      <li>An excellent product all around.</li>
      <li>Fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>It has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had, and that includes a Norelco.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that the replacement parts are perfect - no problems at all.</li>

      <li>It fit perfectly and cuts well.</li>
      <li>$30 for the razor is a good deal, but $40 for replacement foils in a year isn&#x27;t.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s in good shape.</li>

      <li>and I will have better luck when I reorder</li>

      <li>Product arrived as promised, brand new in the package, at a great price.</li>

      <li>You have to buy both pieces together so replace them both to get a best performance and save ruining the new foil with an old cutter bar.</li>
      <li>No fuss - it fit and works.</li>
      <li>But it isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>Glad to know I didn&#x27;t have to get rid of the whole shaver and was able to just purchase the interface.</li>
      <li>as far as that goes it a good deal for the money.</li>
      <li>This replacement system cures that quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>love the size, and it gives a nice shave, but go ahead and spend a little more upfront to get a more reliable product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the original manufacturer replacement and restores the shaver to like-new performance.</li>
      <li>Its the original Braun spare part that I wanted ages ago but didn&#x27;t find from the dealer.</li>
      <li>The second time I ordered, it was the aftermarket parts which are close, but not quite as good.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My old Braun is a great old razor.</li>
      <li>but know someday I will be growing a beard when I can&#x27;t pick up my Braun for a quick touch up between blade shaves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s time for me to replace my cutter block and foil, according to their instructions, but I&#x27;m sure I can go for another 6 months without doing it, with no negative results.</li>
      <li>but I know my wife didn&#x27;t spend more than $30 for the unit new.</li>
      <li>It replaces the original equipment exactly.  </li>
      <li>As long as your battery is still strong, this is a good alternative to purchasing a new shaver.</li>
      <li>The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job, and even has its own rotating screen cover.</li>
      <li>Amazing how just the replacement blade costs about the same amount.</li>
      <li>(I think that&#x27;s the right number).</li>
      <li>Was the right replacement cutter/screen for my Braun 3612</li>
      <li>This cheap Braun is way better than an equivalent Remington, much better than my more expensive Norelco, and charges in 1 hour on worldwide voltage.  </li>
      <li>Excellent - I&#x27;m so glad I replaced my old broken parts with new ones from this vendor.</li>
      <li>Had to look far and wide to find these as they are very popular.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year and had to replace the foil after the first 6 months.  </li>
      <li>This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Although the price for Braun shaver replacement parts is not much less than buying a brand new shaver, I&#x27;m just glad Braun still sells them for my ten-year-old unit.  </li>
      <li>the replacement parts fit my 3612 shaver exactly; better than the aftermarket replacement parts I bought when Braun was not available.  </li>
      <li>As long as the rest of your Braun razor is mechanically sound, this is worth it to get a clean shave back - even at a price point close to the original purchase price.</li>
      <li>This makes it worth paying the high price of the foil and cutter bar.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment of $20 to rejuvenate your razor instead of buying a whole new one!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be replacing the second foil and will be looking for a new, better designed razor.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipper Will buy from again.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and as advertised.</li>
      <li>Very neat.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>the way, Braun has a great, simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver, and then I use my older model for the side trimmer.</li>
      <li>I always feel like it is a wast to buy a whole new razor, but I no longer buy replacement blades or screens.  </li>
      <li>Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  </li>
      <li>They had it at a decent price.  </li>
      <li>The third was a Flex Integral, which was fancier than I needed but worked just fine; the foil broke (from overuse) and I needed a working razor right away, so I ran out and bought a 3612, which I liked even better.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with Braun razors or replacement parts, in my experience.</li>
      <li>I suggest you avoid the replacement set and just buy a new 3612 razor ($29 at Target).</li>
      <li>Works like brand new now.</li>
      <li>You could find a new Braun 3000 series razor at $30.  </li>
      <li>My razor works like new again.</li>
      <li>Also, this is only the first replacement since I&#x27;ve had the shaver.</li>
      <li>Holes may wear in the old sheath making it pinch and grab.  </li>
      <li>the only problem is the screen falls out some time when cleaning, even being gentle with it.</li>
      <li>Having worked in product development for over fifteen years, 8 out of 9 responses on this forum alone reporting failures is completely unacceptable from a product reliability perspective.  </li>
      <li>, kinda surprised I could find one.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement, for as long as I&#x27;ve had mine</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d find a replacement head - my razor is 12 years old.  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will be using my shaver for at least another year with this replacement.</li>
      <li>The razor is good by itself, but the replacement pack is way too expensive.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it&#x27;s hard to find these in local drug stores.</li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference having a new blade, but these things last so long I didn&#x27;t really feel I was missing out.  </li>
      <li>The Braun replacement foil and cutter blade have ten year old razor working like it is new.  </li>
      <li>This replacement system is easy to install and returns the razor to its original cutting capabilities.  </li>
      <li>I guess that means you just throw the entire razor away and buy a new unit when the blades wear out.</li>
      <li>Better to have it be right at a higher price than waste money on useless cheaper alternatives.</li>
      <li>For less than a cost of a new shaver, this replacement pack makes an old shaver work like new.  </li>
      <li>(The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  </li>
      <li>These things are very difficult to find, especially at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor.</li>
      <li>Despite what Steve in Idaho says, I&#x27;m fairly confident I wasn&#x27;t pressing too hard, and I suspect the other 7 reviewers before me that have reported similar problems weren&#x27;t either.  </li>

    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a replacement head - my razor is 12 years old.  Works great.</li>
    <li> It was very easy to install. Fits perfectly. Been using it for over six months and it&#x27;s in good shape.</li>
    <li> This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year, the foil got a tear in it, so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn&#x27;t sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement, the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor.</li>
    <li> Works.  the only problem is the screen falls out some time when cleaning, even being gentle with it. as far as that goes it a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent - I&#x27;m so glad I replaced my old broken parts with new ones from this vendor. Product arrived as promised, brand new in the package, at a great price.</li>
    <li> These things are very difficult to find, especially at such a great price.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The Braun foil and cutter bar is great quality, the service was fast too! The problem I have is the cost. It was a gift but I know my wife didn&#x27;t spend more than $30 for the unit new. That being said, I&#x27;ve had the shaver for 3 or 4 years so why throw away something that still works! This makes it worth paying the high price of the foil and cutter bar. Also, this is only the first replacement since I&#x27;ve had the shaver. You have to buy both pieces together so replace them both to get a best performance and save ruining the new foil with an old cutter bar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 3612 for almost 2 years.  It has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had, and that includes a Norelco.  I get a damn good shave for the price, and it is a great travel razor.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, if you&#x27;re getting rips in your foil, then you&#x27;re pressing way too hard.  Take it a little easier.  It&#x27;s time for me to replace my cutter block and foil, according to their instructions, but I&#x27;m sure I can go for another 6 months without doing it, with no negative results. &lt;br /&gt;    Amazon&#x27;s price on the replacement foil and cutter block isn&#x27;t too bad, seeing as it&#x27;s cheaper than Walmart.  Sure, replacement cutter blocks and foils are all to expensive, just like replacement ink cartridges for printers, but what&#x27;s a guy supposed to do? &lt;br /&gt;     This cheap Braun is way better than an equivalent Remington, much better than my more expensive Norelco, and charges in 1 hour on worldwide voltage.  1 hour recharge is a good convenience.  Also runs on the cord which alot of electrics won&#x27;t do.  I give this razor top votes for price, features,close shave, and durability.</li>
    <li> The Braun replacement foil and cutter blade have ten year old razor working like it is new.  Being able to order this set online made this a very easy way to do the maintenance for the razor and kept me from having to spend three times as much to but a hew razor.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say? It&#x27;s the original manufacturer replacement and restores the shaver to like-new performance.</li>
    <li> The razor is good by itself, but the replacement pack is way too expensive.  You could find a new Braun 3000 series razor at $30.  Why bother to get the replacement pack?</li>
    <li> Had a hard time looking for replacement part for my electric shaver. All the store that I went did sell them anymore.  Received it as describe and working great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and as advertised. Thanks</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I am very satisfied.  Art</li>
    <li> The Braun replacement blades and foils are necessary for continued use of these electric razors. The good news is that the replacement parts are perfect - no problems at all. The bad news is that they are priced pretty much the same no matter which Braun razor one has. I have a $150 8500 series and a $35 3200 series, and the blade and foil replacements are about the same price for each. For the 3200 series it seems a shame to pay the same price for a blade and foil that one paid for the entire razor to begin with...</li>
    <li> The blurb says replace the foil every 18 months but I&#x27;ve had to replace it twice in less than a year due to tearing of the foil. I have two extra cutting blocks now. They should at least sell each of these parts seperately.</li>
    <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d be unable to replace this piece on my Braun shaver, but Amazon came through.  They had it at a decent price.  I&#x27;ll retrun in a few years for another.</li>
    <li> Although the price for Braun shaver replacement parts is not much less than buying a brand new shaver, I&#x27;m just glad Braun still sells them for my ten-year-old unit.  Do you know how hard it is to find older-model replacement foils and cutter blocks in the stores that sell Braun shavers?  My only other complaint with products like this is the amount of packaging that has to be separated for recycling.</li>
    <li> The picture of this item is false and does not show the true difference between the 3000 and 3600 foils that are not replaceable.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality, price and rapid response after ordering this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year and had to replace the foil after the first 6 months.  The second foil I bought failed recently and I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.  I won&#x27;t be replacing the second foil and will be looking for a new, better designed razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use the razor off and on, supplementing shaving with a standard blade.  Despite what Steve in Idaho says, I&#x27;m fairly confident I wasn&#x27;t pressing too hard, and I suspect the other 7 reviewers before me that have reported similar problems weren&#x27;t either.  Having worked in product development for over fifteen years, 8 out of 9 responses on this forum alone reporting failures is completely unacceptable from a product reliability perspective.  However, from Braun&#x27;s money making perspective, it makes great sense - if people keep buying replacement foils that is.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love the size, and it gives a nice shave, but go ahead and spend a little more upfront to get a more reliable product.  $30 for the razor is a good deal, but $40 for replacement foils in a year isn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they&#x27;ve got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer&#x27;s, not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I&#x27;d try a Norelco or Remington, but I think they&#x27;re all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Tried buying something less expensive from another store and received some after market junk that did not fit the shaver. This came in a package with the Braun label. No fuss - it fit and works. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My old Braun is a great old razor. Time marches on and technology makes obsolete many good products. This is one. Glad they still have these replacement screens and blades for it but know someday I will be growing a beard when I can&#x27;t pick up my Braun for a quick touch up between blade shaves.</li>
    <li> For less than a cost of a new shaver, this replacement pack makes an old shaver work like new.  As long as your battery is still strong, this is a good alternative to purchasing a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for over 25 years, and while this model isn&#x27;t as good as some of the older simpler models, it still works fine. It&#x27;s great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it&#x27;s hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Braun has a great, simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver, and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job, and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat.</li>
    <li> I always feel like it is a wast to buy a whole new razor, but I no longer buy replacement blades or screens.  I have never found the replacements to revitalize the razor the way I hope.  With the price of replacements being as expensive as they are, I just buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> As long as the rest of your Braun razor is mechanically sound, this is worth it to get a clean shave back - even at a price point close to the original purchase price.</li>
    <li> It replaces the original equipment exactly.  But it isn&#x27;t cheap.  Better to have it be right at a higher price than waste money on useless cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> My razor works like new again. Fast shipper Will buy from again. Had to look far and wide to find these as they are very popular. Now I know where to get them in the future.</li>
    <li> This replacement system is easy to install and returns the razor to its original cutting capabilities.  Holes may wear in the old sheath making it pinch and grab.  This replacement system cures that quickly and easily.  An excellent product all around.</li>
    <li> I only paid [money] for my Braun 3612 shaver. Amazing how just the replacement blade costs about the same amount. I guess that means you just throw the entire razor away and buy a new unit when the blades wear out. At [money] for the razor, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know what the other folks are complaining about. You have to periodically replace the cutting parts of a razor, yes, and according to Consumer Reports, this isn&#x27;t an exorbitant price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why the other fellow&#x27;s foil broke twice in a year. I know it&#x27;s a customer service nightmare when you get two defective items in a row, but if the foil broke even once within a year under normal use, then I have to assume it was just bad luck. I&#x27;ve had the cutting foil break on Braun razors, but only after I&#x27;d been using them for too long (I didn&#x27;t know until today that I could order parts online, so I&#x27;ve tended to put off a trip to the &amp;quot;nearest&amp;quot; parts store) or after I&#x27;d dropped the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had four Braun razors. The first lasted seven or eight years (with replaced foil, cutting block, AND battery; finally started overheating). The second was an inexpensive corded model, and I got tired of the cord. The third was a Flex Integral, which was fancier than I needed but worked just fine; the foil broke (from overuse) and I needed a working razor right away, so I ran out and bought a 3612, which I liked even better.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with Braun razors or replacement parts, in my experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three Braun razors and never had a foil tear on me until I bought this replacement set. It tore after about two weeks (Also, the plastic piece that retracts the Interface trimmer broke two weeks later). Since two other reviewers have had the same problem, I think it is possible that Braun got a bad batch of foils. I suggest you avoid the replacement set and just buy a new 3612 razor ($29 at Target).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun razor for years and it&#x27;s great to be able to replace the worn screen cover. Works like brand new now.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had my razor for a few years now and only recently got around to replacing the blade and foil.  It makes a huge difference having a new blade, but these things last so long I didn&#x27;t really feel I was missing out.  It&#x27;s well worth the investment of $20 to rejuvenate your razor instead of buying a whole new one!</li>
    <li> It works well. The price is too big for the replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to order only the net, you are out of luck.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a timely manner and seems to be a Braun product. Others I have bought elsewhere were copies and did not cut as well as the worn-out one I was replacing. This one works great.</li>
    <li> Was the right replacement cutter/screen for my Braun 3612 (I think that&#x27;s the right number). Received it on time, no problems. Only thing that was unexpected was the color--blue instead of black. No big deal.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my needs, and surprisingly came in the right color for my shaver. Past replacements where I purchased the shaver came in black. It fit perfectly and cuts well.</li>
    <li> I hated to give up the outdated braun, especially since all it needed was a new foil and cutter.  Glad to know I didn&#x27;t have to get rid of the whole shaver and was able to just purchase the interface. No need to put another thing in the landfill if not necessary.  Works like a charm and has unbelievable power again.</li>
    <li> foil broke after couple days  Just  bad  luck  on my part and I will have better luck when I reorder</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are the same as the originals. The Braun Razor is one of the best I have owned.</li>
    <li> Its the original Braun spare part that I wanted ages ago but didn&#x27;t find from the dealer. Its exactly what I wanted.I saved a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Factory replacement.  Works as advertised. Pricey, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware - make sure you have the correct model model/series number - there are similar items that are not the correct replacement.</li>
    <li> I have been using a BRAUN INTERFACE shaver for years. I bought this replacement before the one I have now breaks. I am sure I will be using my shaver for at least another year with this replacement.</li>
    <li> I have several of these (3612) razors. The only thing that wears out is the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Low cost solution for years of shaving.</li>
    <li> Fits just like the official Braun shaver head. I&#x27;ve had no problems</li>
    <li> Exact replacement, for as long as I&#x27;ve had mine, kinda surprised I could find one. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> the replacement parts fit my 3612 shaver exactly; better than the aftermarket replacement parts I bought when Braun was not available.  The second time I ordered, it was the aftermarket parts which are close, but not quite as good.  The head and blades seem to rub to tightly and the shaver runs slowly or not at all.</li>
