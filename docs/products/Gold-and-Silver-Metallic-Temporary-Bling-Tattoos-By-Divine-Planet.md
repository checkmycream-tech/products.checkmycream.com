      <li>They do what they are supposed to do, and are a little fun.  </li>
      <li>This brand is good because the tattoos last at least a few days, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.</li>

<li> im not happy at all</li>
<li> Is not a good product , stay just few hours and also very expensive.</li>

    <li> Amazing. Everyone needs to get these and they last for quite some time too.</li>
    <li> So easy to put on, loved them</li>
    <li> Stayed on longer than I thought.</li>
    <li> This brand is good because the tattoos last at least a few days, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.</li>

    <li> Great Item! Seller is 10 out of 10!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and fun for grannies to wear on a retreat weekend.  Mine lasted way longer than four days - finally had to get serious about removing it with olive oil.</li>
    <li> These things are cool, shiny and easy to apply. They last for Approx. a week depending on location and abrasion (like clothing, shoes etc.). To take off, We use &amp;#34;goof off&amp;#34; which is basically paint stripper applied to skin. It states to use oil, which with some elbow grease, could work, but surely not as effective.</li>
    <li> they do not stick on at all and did not even go off the sheet for me im not happy at all</li>
    <li> The granddaughters loved these.  They couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> good, the only drawback is that we would like to know if these tatoo produce some kind of allergy, as one person put it yesterday and in less than three hours he produced an allergy now had to go to the doctor for medication.</li>
    <li> These tattoos are so much fun! Easy to apply and stay on great!</li>
    <li> These are cute and fun.  They stay on for as long as you would expect for temporary tattoos.</li>
    <li> Only had one sheet of the tattoos, can&#x27;t place over any hair or it won&#x27;t stick. Good for a concert!</li>
    <li> Loved these glitter tattoos! I received many compliments. They stayed on for almost a week.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful!  The seller mistakenly sent me just 1 sheet when i had ordered 2 but when i told them they sent me 2 more! Great service. Tattoos only stay vivid and really shiny for a couple days but application and removal is very easy. Great designs.</li>
    <li> These were the flash I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last to long but still loved it! Very pretty especially for someone with tan skin :)</li>
    <li> I put some of these on for a camping festival. They wore off within the first day - I was kind of bummed.</li>
    <li> They were alright but I was expecting more</li>
    <li> The kids love these! Great designs!!</li>
    <li> Although I have not used these yet they look awesome.  They will make my Halloween costume sparkle.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do, and are a little fun.  What more can you expect?</li>
    <li> beautiful tattoos but what bothered me is that the gold tattoos don&#x27;t stay long, they stay only for around 2 days.</li>
    <li> Love love love all my metallic temporary tats - and I get multiple compliments on them daily. I work in the medical field and can&#x27;t really wear rings or bracelets, so this is my way of wearing jewelry at work.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on long</li>
    <li> Nice tattoos (especially the mermaid). Wish it was cheaper, given that they only last a few days</li>
    <li> They do not last long &amp; they look cheap. I do not like these ones.</li>
    <li> They are very beautiful. They go on easy like a regular temp tattoo. My only concern is they don&#x27;t last for a long time. 24-48 hours tops. But lots of complements from others I love them.</li>
    <li> For a first time purchase - I was exceptionally pleased!</li>
    <li> Super fun! I am definitely getting more designs next time.</li>
    <li> Crappy quality. I bought these for fashion week and they didn&#x27;t even stay on a day, should&#x27;ve just spent a little more and got the $10 ones at Sephora..</li>
    <li> POP POP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff flashes. Pretty cool temporary tattoos for those into that kind of thing.</li>
    <li> Very metallic &amp; shiny! Lasted about 3 days</li>
    <li> Great quality! I&#x27;ve used many flash tats and these are quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome foil tattoos!  Always get comments on them.  Easy to use.</li>
