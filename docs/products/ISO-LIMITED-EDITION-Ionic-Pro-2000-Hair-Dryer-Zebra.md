      <li>good value.</li>
      <li>Good product good brand.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s cute too!)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product &amp; for the price I got it at !!!;)</li>
      <li>My m.i.l used it and fell in love!</li>
      <li>I love this dryer!</li>
      <li>Great fit.</li>
      <li>Lasted 5 months, then stopped blowing warm air.</li>
      <li>thats always nice</li>
      <li>Like most ladies, I consider my hair to be very important and invest a lot of money in caring for it.  </li>
      <li>Love this blower.</li>
      <li>Would love to find the comb attachment.</li>
      <li>I got better results from a twenty dollar hair dryer from WalMart.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>There was a strong odor like a motor -</li>
      <li>Besides the cool look, that&#x27;s what made most of us select this one, the buttons are great because the cool air is not a third button, rather is a degree setting an once clicked, one doesn&#x27;t have to hold it in.</li>
      <li>The packaging is cheap and looks to be held together with glue.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, it is a powerful tool and its very well made.  </li>
      <li>She seems to really like it, but I have never used it myself and don&#x27;t know much more than it looks cute.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to buy this hairdryer.</li>
      <li>So far she love$ it!</li>
      <li>I also experienced the smell at first, but it seems to have stopped after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When this one came from the shop I got it from the first power setting didn&#x27;t work!</li>
      <li>The item is Heavy duty .. works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I do not feel this hair dryer was worth the price.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it, it smelled like it had already been used.  </li>
      <li>but I got through a Groupon and spent $43.00 on a hairdryer that lasted 5 months and then stopped blowing hot or even warm air.  </li>
      <li>hair definitely is looking much better now that I don&#x27;t fry it every</li>
      <li>I must say that I am a sucker for all things adorable, and I found the design on this hair dryer to be so cute.  </li>
      <li>Now have whole zebra ISO set.</li>
      <li>It dries my thick hair quickly and with the concentrator I am able to get it straight with just drying it.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one, which I thought was going to be a problem</li>
      <li>Quiet and ridiculously powerful.</li>
      <li>Imagine my shock when I received what was very clearly a used hairdryer.</li>
      <li>Love it a powerful blow, faster to dry my hair, the only thing that the dryer just a bit heavy.</li>
      <li>it was clear it had been operated.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and will never use this seller again.</li>
      <li>This is clearly a knockoff.</li>
      <li>I do not get any of the negative reviews and am so glad I ignored them.</li>
      <li>but my girls say it works and seems quietier than their old one.</li>
      <li>Another issue with the high setting is that if you are going to use it in your bathroom, open the door so that the air doesn&#x27;t get all foggy.  </li>
      <li>It is clearly not ionic--just a blow dryer that blows out lukewarm air really fast.</li>
      <li>but since you wont have to hold it that long because of its fast drying time its not a big deal.</li>
      <li>stopped blowing hot air after less then 10 uses.</li>
      <li>The cord is much longer and thicker than on other dryers I have owned</li>
      <li>I bought one from a living social deal.</li>
      <li>of this same exact product from ben&#x27;s outlet for $ 20.00 less each for a savings of $40 purchased for wife &amp; daughters should have waited big difference</li>
      <li>Only had this dryer for 5 months and the hot and warm settings stopped working, blows only cold air, it&#x27;s garbage!</li>
      <li>I got this one from Amazon for the same price as the living social deal.</li>
      <li>It is very loud, and I cannot see any difference in my hair due to the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature.  </li>

<li> It is very loud, and I cannot see any difference in my hair due to the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature.  </li>
<li> I have had several drug store brand dryers and they essentially do their job which is to dry your hair.  </li>
<li> The cord is long and the noise is low.</li>
<li> this actually blows air to dry your hair...</li>
<li> The pamphlet that came with it is so cheap and clearly fake.</li>
<li> I have very long hair</li>
<li> I did note that you probably don&#x27;t need to use the highest setting because my hair got too dry after use.  </li>
<li> I contacted the company and not response so the 1 year limited warranty is non existent!  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money when you can get a LEGIT Remington ceramic blow dryer for the same price.</li>
<li> Less time to dry my hair.</li>
<li> ISO dryer is also heavier than any other I have owned previously.  </li>
<li> I found this hair dryer to be just average.  </li>
<li> It stopped working in less than a month.  </li>
<li> It has a long, thick cord and a sleek design.  </li>
<li> I did think that it was a bit heavy</li>
<li> I bought this for my daughter a few months ago.  </li>
<li> We both use it and with our very thick hair find it does not take very long to dtry our hair.</li>
<li> The weight has not been a negative issue with me, but I did want to mention the fact for anyone who reads my review in case it would matter to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Blows cold only.</li>
<li> company does not stand behind product.  </li>
<li> The inside casing that holds the dryer was cracked from someone opening it, the seal was broken on the box and the box was crinkled with fingerprints all over it.</li>
<li> We&#x27;re afraid to use it again.</li>
<li> was soooo disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Piece of crap!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had one for three years and the rubber on the cord started ripping and exposing the wires so I wanted to replace it. When this one came from the shop I got it from the first power setting didn&#x27;t work! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> perfect for what I needed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter a few months ago.  She only used it about once per week.  All of a sudden, it started smoking and would turn itself off for no reason.  We&#x27;re afraid to use it again.</li>
    <li> Great fit. Great shipping</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! Less time to dry my hair. I have very long hair so I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product &amp; for the price I got it at !!!;)</li>
    <li> Lasted 5 months, then stopped blowing warm air. Blows cold only. Handle covering is flaking off. Piece of crap!</li>
    <li> I must say that I am a sucker for all things adorable, and I found the design on this hair dryer to be so cute.  That was my initial motivation to buy this product.  I also was on a kick of owning all things designer/high quality.  Like most ladies, I consider my hair to be very important and invest a lot of money in caring for it.  I have had several drug store brand dryers and they essentially do their job which is to dry your hair.  This dryer also does its job.  I did note that you probably don&#x27;t need to use the highest setting because my hair got too dry after use.  When I first opened it, it smelled like it had already been used.  Another issue with the high setting is that if you are going to use it in your bathroom, open the door so that the air doesn&#x27;t get all foggy.  On the bright side, it is a powerful tool and its very well made.  It has a long, thick cord and a sleek design.  I did think that it was a bit heavy but since you wont have to hold it that long because of its fast drying time its not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! It didn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one, which I thought was going to be a problem...turns out- this actually blows air to dry your hair...not burn it dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair definitely is looking much better now that I don&#x27;t fry it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s cute too!)</li>
    <li> It stopped working in less than a month.  Otherwise, it was the best hair dryer ever.  My daughter had a similar problems with the same dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it a powerful blow, faster to dry my hair, the only thing that the dryer just a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome. I do not get any of the negative reviews and am so glad I ignored them. It dries my thick hair quickly and with the concentrator I am able to get it straight with just drying it. The cord is long and the noise is low. My hair is looking great and I have to give the credit to the dryer and the argan oil I started using. Great combo.</li>
    <li> Only had this dryer for 5 months and the hot and warm settings stopped working, blows only cold air, it&#x27;s garbage!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  The item is Heavy duty .. works great.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. We both use it and with our very thick hair find it does not take very long to dtry our hair.</li>
    <li> stopped blowing hot air after less then 10 uses. company does not stand behind product.  btw i bought item from groupon and customer support is not up to par.</li>
    <li> This is clearly a knockoff. The packaging is cheap and looks to be held together with glue. The blow dryer literally looks like the design was stuck on w/ stickers. The zebra pattern on the dryer was peeling off. The pamphlet that came with it is so cheap and clearly fake. It is clearly not ionic--just a blow dryer that blows out lukewarm air really fast. It also does NOT have 4 speed/heat settings as stated in the product info. It takes about 5 minutes to heat up. Don&#x27;t waste your money when you can get a LEGIT Remington ceramic blow dryer for the same price.</li>
    <li> Love this blower. My hairdresser uses this brand so I decided to try buy.  Besides the cool look, that&#x27;s what made most of us select this one, the buttons are great because the cool air is not a third button, rather is a degree setting an once clicked, one doesn&#x27;t have to hold it in. Would love to find the comb attachment.</li>
    <li> good value. im bald but my girls say it works and seems quietier than their old one. thats always nice</li>
    <li> I bought one from a living social deal. My m.i.l used it and fell in love! I got this one from Amazon for the same price as the living social deal. It is the best blow dryer it have owned. Quiet and ridiculously powerful.</li>
    <li> She loves it because she fill grown up with her fancy Zebra Dryer. She seems to really like it, but I have never used it myself and don&#x27;t know much more than it looks cute.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase through Amazon but I got through a Groupon and spent $43.00 on a hairdryer that lasted 5 months and then stopped blowing hot or even warm air.  I contacted the company and not response so the 1 year limited warranty is non existent!  Don&#x27;t purchase this product!!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife for Christmas! So far she love$ it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy this hairdryer. Imagine my shock when I received what was very clearly a used hairdryer. The inside casing that holds the dryer was cracked from someone opening it, the seal was broken on the box and the box was crinkled with fingerprints all over it. There was a strong odor like a motor - it was clear it had been operated.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and will never use this seller again. It&#x27;s a shame, because I wanted to try this product. This is the third issue I have had with Amazon now in the last month and starting to get concerned that there are quality control issues. I have been a Prime member since 2012 and never have had the types of issues I am now seeing!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this a five star because it said in description that it was 2000 watts and it was only 1800 watts&lt;br /&gt;I was soooo disappointed. I work great! One of the best product out there.</li>
    <li> I found this hair dryer to be just average.  It is very loud, and I cannot see any difference in my hair due to the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature.  As a matter of fact, I have damp sections in my hair after using this dryer that I did not experience when using my simple Conair hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ISO dryer is also heavier than any other I have owned previously.  The weight has not been a negative issue with me, but I did want to mention the fact for anyone who reads my review in case it would matter to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this hair dryer is very cute!  The cord is much longer and thicker than on other dryers I have owned and I consider the cord a desirable feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review I read before buying this hair dryer mentioned a smell of burning plastic during use.  I also experienced the smell at first, but it seems to have stopped after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not feel this hair dryer was worth the price.  I got better results from a twenty dollar hair dryer from WalMart.  I also would rather have a diffuser than the two attachments included with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if, like me, you have to have a zebra print hair dryer, this one is cheaper than some.</li>
    <li> i bought two(2) of this same exact product from ben&#x27;s outlet for $ 20.00 less each for a savings of $40 purchased for wife &amp; daughters should have waited big difference</li>
    <li> Was happy to find zebra themed hair tools. Good product good brand. Now have whole zebra ISO set.Love it. Great blow dryer.</li>
