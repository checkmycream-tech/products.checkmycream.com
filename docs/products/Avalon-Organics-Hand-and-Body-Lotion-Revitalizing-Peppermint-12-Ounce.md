      <li>So smooth without making my hands feel slimy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this lotion and ordered it regularly from Amazon or scored it in stores for more than a decade.</li>
      <li>Gone was the delightful peppermint aroma, and in its place was a powdercake face make-up type of smell mixed with the scent of unbathed intimate body parts.  </li>
      <li>The aroma therapy alone is so soothing, but somehow the effects of the peppermint on my skin and muscles really makes me feel better.  </li>
      <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin quickly and leaves a bit of a greasy residue.</li>
      <li>and gets absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving any greasy residues.</li>
      <li>greasy, very aroma therapeutic!!</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>Bought it because a co-worker kept using it and the smell brought me right to the spa.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive and/or dry skin, rash, sunburns, blisters, etc.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Timely delivery - Grest lotion, works wonders ;-)</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this again :)</li>
      <li>Just as fine a product and a little bit better deal.  </li>

      <li>I really like the smell and the feeling of this lotion on my skin.</li>

      <li>If you like soft skin and peppermint smell, you should like this as well.</li>
      <li>Its not horrible but its not amazing.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a decent lotion.</li>
      <li>If you have less need for a long lasting, intense moisturizer, this would probably be fine.</li>
      <li>I would actually like it to have maybe a little more oil in it, but overall I would buy the product again.</li>
      <li>It also has a gentle cooling effect on the skin, which is why we prefer the peppermint scent to Avalon&#x27;s other lotion offerings.</li>
      <li>In all fairness, I live in a dry climate, am fairly active and rough on my skin (fairly large house and yard</li>

<li> I used to use Bath &amp; Body Work&#x27;s Twisted Peppermint, but that&#x27;s only available in the winter, which did not help me this summer when my hands and feet looked like overstuffed</li>
<li> so I ordered the Peppermint bottle, but it lacks any minty sensation I expected and there are just too many alcohol ingredients that give a dry and somewhat uncomfortable sensation, it seems to be opposite of what lotion is meant to do.</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t make me cold, per se, but it&#x27;s really refreshing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been lookng for a lotion with just that for a long time.</li>
<li> But the last two bottles I received from Amazon the other day smelled funky.  </li>
<li> I leave it in our powder room on a little shelf near the sink along with other aromatherapy products, etc.</li>
<li> An overall average product.</li>
<li> However this is not the particular choice as this peppermint leaves me pretty cold for a little while.</li>
<li> Washing my hands a lot at work due to my profession, my hands get really dry.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used others which were not very moisturizing at all.</li>
<li> and I use this after I put the body butter on an rough surfaces.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one, but for some reason, in the summer my hands and feet puff up.</li>
<li> I would say, if you are going to put it on any &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; areas you should be mindful that it DOES tingle a little bit.</li>
<li> I also let my friend at work use it when she had a bad sunburn, and she said it really helped cool the burning sensation and also helped to heal her skin so it would not peel so bad.  </li>
<li> Otherwise it is not a super thick lotion, hence the homemade body butter.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a prime customer and couldn&#x27;t get my usual Dr Bronners product on prime at the time I ordered so</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.</li>

    <li> Purchased for my MIL for Christmas present. Smells great and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I have found my brand of natural lotion. However this is not the particular choice as this peppermint leaves me pretty cold for a little while. If that is not a problem for you, then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another fragrance? but I&#x27;m sticking with Avalon from now on. Moisture is what I was looking for and this company has it.</li>
    <li> Ran across this at a local store for just under a dollar on Clearance!!  Decided to buy it and give it a try.  Wow...its great!!  Sometimes I get muscular tension headaches, stemming from the muscles tightening in my neck.  I&#x27;ve rubbed this lotion on my neck muscles and my face and forehead and it is amazing!!  The aroma therapy alone is so soothing, but somehow the effects of the peppermint on my skin and muscles really makes me feel better.  This is a wonderful lotion.  I also let my friend at work use it when she had a bad sunburn, and she said it really helped cool the burning sensation and also helped to heal her skin so it would not peel so bad.  The ingredients seem to be very good.  I am glad this is available on Amazon.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! Smells great, non- greasy, very aroma therapeutic!! My coworkers keep coming to my desk to use it so they got bottles as Xmas presents!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a prime customer and couldn&#x27;t get my usual Dr Bronners product on prime at the time I ordered so I thought I would give this a try in the meanwhile.  Just as fine a product and a little bit better deal.  Great for sensitive and/or dry skin, rash, sunburns, blisters, etc.  Organic, smooth &amp; great scent.  I would pick up either brand in the future... just based on which I can get via prime membership.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Bought it because a co-worker kept using it and the smell brought me right to the spa.</li>
    <li> I love the organic lotions and this one is no exception.  The scent is nice although not quite the \\&quot;pepperminty\\&quot; scent I had hoped for.  I leave it in our powder room on a little shelf near the sink along with other aromatherapy products, etc. for guests.</li>
    <li> Its not horrible but its not amazing. Just your standard run of the mill lotion. Nothing too moisturizing about it. An overall average product.</li>
    <li> I love peppermint and that&#x27;s what originally got me to buy this product. Unfortunately even a little bit of this stuff leaves my hands greasy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one, but for some reason, in the summer my hands and feet puff up. I&#x27;ve found that peppermint is quite soothing and seems to ease the puffiness. That could all be in my head, but whatever, peppermint is a good smell. I used to use Bath &amp; Body Work&#x27;s Twisted Peppermint, but that&#x27;s only available in the winter, which did not help me this summer when my hands and feet looked like overstuffed sausages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Avalon Organics a try. Overall it&#x27;s a decent lotion. I find it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin quickly and leaves a bit of a greasy residue. Is this the price to pay for using an organic lotion, versus one laden with chemicals that are probably very bad for me? I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I can&#x27;t be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking to switch to a more organic lifestyle. But if you&#x27;re okay with chemical laden lotions, there are probably more enjoyable ones out there! If you&#x27;re like me and puff up in the summer, try this lotion - and for an even better result, keep the lotion in the fridge.</li>
    <li> The peppermint in the lotion soothes my arthritic hands.  Nice!</li>
    <li> Too pepperminty and don&#x27;t like the texture of the lotion all that well. Won&#x27;t be ordering a refill after it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this peppermint scented lotion because i was using aveda but cant afford to use that on a daily basis. I found Aveda&#x27;s foot cream has a peppermint scent that really opened up my sinuses before bed and relaxed me. So i looked on Amazon and discovered this. I received it very quickly. No problems with the packaging at all. I find it to be the perfect consistency. Not too thick and not too thin. It is exactly what I hoped it would be. I have no doubt I will be ordering this again!!</li>
    <li> Washing my hands a lot at work due to my profession, my hands get really dry.  I love this stuff. I ordered a bunch of this and have one in every room.</li>
    <li> product was sealed and I was very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! It has a very refreshing peppermint smell that lasts for a while. It has a smooth texture and doesn&#x27;t feel caked on like other lotions. My skin always feels soft and refreshed after use.  I would definitely buy this again :)</li>

    <li> So smooth without making my hands feel slimy. Love the peppermint and it&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and feel of the Avalon Organics Peppermint lotion. It has a strong peppermint scent (the way we like it!) and gets absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving any greasy residues. It also has a gentle cooling effect on the skin, which is why we prefer the peppermint scent to Avalon&#x27;s other lotion offerings.</li>
    <li> O e this lotion.Smells wonderful. Very refreshing. Not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like but I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a couple years now and I absolutely love it. I make my own body butter with cocoa and shea butter and some other oils and I use this after I put the body butter on an rough surfaces. I would say, if you are going to put it on any &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; areas you should be mindful that it DOES tingle a little bit. Otherwise it is not a super thick lotion, hence the homemade body butter. I have used this for years and am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of peppermint scent. Refreshing and smooth. Does not leave a greasy feeling. Nice to use just before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles of the peppermint lotion for myself and as gifts. The tingly sensation is so wonderful!  I don&#x27;t mind it in the winter, either...it doesn&#x27;t make me cold, per se, but it&#x27;s really refreshing. It is nice to put it on the lay down for a minute, you can really feel it. I&#x27;ve tried the rosemary and find it to be a bit stickier (though the fragrance is lovely). The geranium smells great, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to what works. Buy the peppermint, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Wonderful fragrance &amp; of course organic!</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever. It quenches my skin and smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this lotion and ordered it regularly from Amazon or scored it in stores for more than a decade. But the last two bottles I received from Amazon the other day smelled funky.  Gone was the delightful peppermint aroma, and in its place was a powdercake face make-up type of smell mixed with the scent of unbathed intimate body parts.  Something must have gone wrong with this batch!  I think I have to throw it out.  Sad.  Miss my peppermint lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels amazing. All natural. Just what I wanted. Scent lasts too.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery - Grest lotion, works wonders ;-)</li>
    <li> Very good on the skin, very good on the nose.  Love the scent of peppermint.  If you like soft skin and peppermint smell, you should like this as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome!  It&#x27;s good for your aching muscles or your forehead and temples when you are stressed.  I use it every day and will order more.</li>
    <li> I am used to Suave, I wanted to give Avalon a try so I ordered the Peppermint bottle, but it lacks any minty sensation I expected and there are just too many alcohol ingredients that give a dry and somewhat uncomfortable sensation, it seems to be opposite of what lotion is meant to do. Another reviewer noted their ingredients has changed recently.</li>
