<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using whitestrips for a few years now, once every six months. Simply put they work and the mild sensitivity that accompanies use with these strips is not nearly enough of a deterrent to using them given how good they work. Plus the sensitivity goes away once you finish the prescribed course of treatment, going to give the Crest HD toothpaste a try now to see how it fairs given how expensive the whitestrips are.</li>
    <li> Works great but makes teeth extra sensitive.</li>
    <li> Noticed a small difference in color, not remotely what I was hoping for or expecting. I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me. My teeth got noticeably whiter. If you&#x27;re not sure if your teeth got whiter, just compare your rear teeth, which were not treated. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, so you might want to get a 2nd box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the main annoying thing is how to deal with having these strips on your teeth. You want to apply them to dry teeth and keep them dry. Getting them wet with saliva may displace the strips, so you have several options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep your head tilted back and swallow your saliva.&lt;br /&gt;2. Get a cup and spit your saliva into it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Open your mouth and put it next to a fan to dry out your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> Made my teeth sore. ..I think ill try a more natural rout</li>
    <li> These have worked very good for me, just be sure to dry your teeth somewhat before applying them.</li>
    <li> My teeth are sensitive and these made my teeth sting after only a couple of minutes of use so I had to take them off. Didn&#x27;t use them after that so I can&#x27;t really speak for effectiveness. But if you have sensitive teeth like me (I use Sensodyne, have sensitivity to candies and such) then I suggest you skip these.</li>
    <li> The product is great! But the package arrived bent and folded...try packing it better next time!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR NON SMOKERS, I HAD QUIT SMOKING AND USED THE STRIPS AND MY TEETH WERE WHITE IN  THREE DAYS. BUT AS SOON AS I STARTED SMOKING AGAIN ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER IT THEY STARTED YELLOWING AGAIN BUT THE STRIPS ARE AMAZING THE ONLY THING IS THAT I DONT RECCOMEND USING THEM EVERY DAY BECOUSE THE FORMULA IS VERY STRONG AND MAY CAUSE SENSITIVITY SO BEAWARE. OTHER THAN THAT GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> My teeth are a bit yellow from a combination of coffee, tea and just genes I suppose. I had already tried previous whitening products such as CloseUp White Now, Colgate Optic White toothpaste and Oral-B Pro Health, to virtually no effect. I heard from my dentist that Crest Whitestrips is the only product that has gotten consistently positive reviews from her other patients, so I decided to purchase them as a final effort. I bought this particular variant - Crest 3D White Strips w/ Advanced Seal in &#x27;Advanced Vivid&#x27; purely because it was the one with the most shelf space in the Crest aisle (it&#x27;s probably the best seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for only 7 days now (the pack I bought has 21 sets), and already I&#x27;ve seen some results. My teeth genuinely look a couple of shades lighter, not just brighter as I observed in the case of Closeup and Colgate whitening toothpastes. I also experienced little to no teeth sensitivity - with Optic White, my teeth were extremely sensitive and my lips became chapped after just one usage. I also liked how easy it is to apply the strips, and how they stay on no matter what I&#x27;m doing. In one instance I even wore them on a short grocery trip with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that there are so many different kinds of Crest whitening products that it could get quite confusing to choose. My own method was quite arbitrary because I didn&#x27;t have time to consult the internet or the different labels on their packaging. I mean, even this product has at least 6 different labels on the front panel, which all have different permutations across the range. Simplify please, so it would be less intimidating for regular consumers like me to purchase and re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would HIGHLY recommend - but make sure you get the right Crest product that suits your needs and commitment to regimen.</li>
    <li> I took the middle of the road as far as strength and I&#x27;m so glad!  Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My teeth are not that sensitive but I still think this strength was the strongest I&#x27;d want to use.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;d only remember to use it about 2/week.&lt;br /&gt;3. After using 1/3 of the box, I started getting so many comments on how white my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;4. The taste is awful and I watch the clock waiting to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;5. They really stick on firmly and I have to brush my teeth immediately after removing.</li>
    <li> the package came in good conditions. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> Much better than the other kinds because it sticks to your teeth. I like to put them on when I am getting in the shower. They are much better.</li>
    <li> The strips go on easily and stay on without a problem. These strips unlike many others which I have tried in the past are gentle enough on my teeth while at the same time giving them a great whitening treatment. My dentist even asked if I had my teeth whitened professionally. I would recomment these strips to everyone. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fit nicely. Great job</li>
    <li> easy to put and it stays on. :) ill update after 14th day. I cant wait to see my teeth white</li>
    <li> I like that they stick to my teeth better than the normal white strips but they do make my teeth sensitive the day I wear them. I&#x27;d rather have sensitive teeth for a day than not have a bright, beautiful smile though!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get celebrity white teeth but definitely made it less yellow. It definitely works but you should use them alternate days if your teeth are sensitive like mine.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening system is the best for the money! I have seen results in all my family who uses it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these crest white strips having read so many good reviews. Firstly I am 21, I do not drink, smoke, consume any caffeine or anything that overly stains the teeth. My teeth have a slight yellow tint and I just wanted them to be lightened at least 2 shades. I used the strips as instructed for the 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth became extremely sensitive! I never suffer from sensitive teeth but this was horrendous I could not even drink luke warm water. I had to go and purchase a whole array of sensitive toothpaste/mouthwash etc. SO not only did I have to pay a lot for shipping (to England) but I also had to fork out on special toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth did not lighten at all! And I literally mean not even by one shade. I was flabbergasted that I had spent all this money to then have horrible sensitivity to come out with teeth no whiter than in the beginning. I am so disappointed with these and would not recommend anyone to spend their money on them. You would probably have more luck spending £5 at your local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing any crest products in the future, what a let down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more intense Crest strips before, and they left my mouth numb, burning, and aching for the following days (but they sure whitened!).  These, however, are fantastic for sensitive teeth!  My now-husband and I shared the box for the week leading up to our wedding.  The change was not drastic, but it was noticeable to us.  Of course, we split the box, so neither of us got the full effect.  Next time I would go up on notch in intensity, but I believe that 30 minutes is a perfect amount of time to dedicate to this in a day.  Any more and the pain and sensitivity start to kick in.</li>
    <li> Crest has always worked for me but had trouble keeping the strips in place for the full time. These strips are great and stay on your teeth. In fact, your really have to pull to get these off. Love them!</li>
    <li> they were received very quickly.  they work great I am getting ready for my sisters wedding in a few weeks and these will really help</li>
    <li> My husband purchased and love the product much! It made his teeth more whitening and looks health. Good product and service!</li>
    <li> best home based whitening product in the market, just you need to decide which level best for you and go !</li>
    <li> It does whiten my teeth a bit. But, It hurts my teeth! Not just sensitive when biting something. A couple of hours after using it, my teeth hurts, a lot! It takes a day to go away! I only use it evry two or three days. It happens every time when I use it! It hurts! Hurts! I stop using it!</li>
    <li> Works great!..you will not be disapointed wih this product.</li>
    <li> This product really works! Strangers are always complimenting me on how white my teeth are!</li>
    <li> I bought the strips because of the good reviews it received. I have been a coffee drinker for over 40 years and I was shocked when I saw a close up picture of my teeth. I purchased it and used it twice a day as recommended for someone with my degree of \\&quot;stains.\\&quot; There was a noticeable difference in 3 or 4 days and even my husband commented on it. Now my teeth are not sparkling white and never were and never will be but they are so much better looking. I had no pain with this product. I did find it easy to use but had one problem with my lower teeth. I have somewhat crooked teeth on the bottom and the strip did not hold as well as with the upper teeth but this was due to my teeth and not the strips. As a result of my experience my husband is now using them (once a day) with noticeable success. One comment I purchased the strips from Amazon on Sept.14, &#x27;09 for $28.98 and I notice the price is now $30.25 but still less expensive than retail.</li>
    <li> I have used the white strips before the advanced white strips came out. They tasted disgusting and would not stick to my teeth. They really didn&#x27;t improve the color of my teeth either. When I heard they came out with new strips that were supposed o stay on better and not taste so bad I had to try them. I don&#x27;t smoke but I do drink coffee everyday, sometimes numerous times daily. After the first time I used the strips to my surprise, I definitely noticed an improvement. I have been using them now for over a week and my teeth are drastically whiter. They stick very well and the taste is not overwhelming. On the bad side they do make your teeth a bit sensitive so I cut down to every other day instead of once a day. I would highly recommend using them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about halfway through the 14 days, and I love these! I can see a very noticeable difference in the color of my teeth already. They stay on great, and are not annoying to have on like many other whitening products. I&#x27;ve used the aquafresh white trays before and those were awful, oozed out the whitening gel (which burned my lips) tasted awful, and were torture to keep in for 30 minutes. Sometimes when I wear these I have the slight urge to gnash my teeth, but other than that they are not bad to have on. My teeth were a little sensitive to cold drinks on about the 5th day, so I skipped one day and now they&#x27;re fine. All in all I am very satisfied with the white strips.</li>
    <li> The product worked as advertised -- one 30 minute application per day for two weeks and my teeth really are whiter.</li>
    <li> These are just amazing.  The new versions adhere to the teeth much better, making it easier to wear them for 30 minutes.  The results, even after just the first treatment is just amazing.</li>
    <li> The product works really good. I saw my teeth a lot whiter after one week. The only thing not good about it was my teeth started feeling really sensitive and uncomfortable after about one week use of the strips.</li>
    <li> I used this product three times. First time I used this strips it was okey. The second time was a disaster. I felt acute pain in my teeth soon after I removed the strips from my teeth. I didn&#x27;t know right away that the Crest strips were the culprit and was blaming the citrus flavor mouthwash that I used in the morning. I didn&#x27;t use the strips for a couple of days. By this time I didn&#x27;t feel good about using these strips in my teeth. Two days later I used the strips on my teeth again. This time soon after I removed the strips from my teeth I got the most severe pain in my teeth. I took four painkillers and still the pain didn&#x27;t subside. I couldn&#x27;t sleep properly due to the acute sensitivity in my teeth. Fortunately it was the Saturday night and I could sleep the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use these kinds of strips again. It was the worst feeling I felt in my teeth.</li>
    <li> These strips work pretty well at removing stains, but they are simply not long enough and don&#x27;t cover nearly enough teeth, at least not for a guy - they may be ok for women or anybody else with a really tiny mouth.  The bottom strips are much, much too short - they&#x27;re about half the length of the top ones, which are already on the short side.  Making them longer would undoubtably make them slightly more difficult to insert and remove, but the additional coverage and cleaning would be worth it, especially for men.  For those with smaller mouths, they could easily be trimmed to length with scissors.  As it is, the teeth you see through parted lips (like during conversation) directly from the front will normally be whitened fairly well, but those a little further back and slightly to the side, which are clearly visible from the front and profile during a wider grin or laugh, will still be covered in whatever stains you were trying to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with pain or increased sensitivity with these.  I did find them a little difficult to remove - they adhere well once you&#x27;ve got them on.  In my mind, that&#x27;s a fair trade-off for being able to forget about them and not having to worry about them moving around while you go do other things for 30 - 40 minutes before taking them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon, Crest - what fraction of a penny would it have cost you to make these strips a half-inch longer?</li>
    <li> After using the 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips, I saw an improvement in the color of my teeth after just four uses. This is a great product, and after my order runs out in five days, I will more than likely request a second box from Amazon. However, before you order this product, there are a few things that you need to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Though this product works, it is nothing special. This whitening device is simply an adhesive strip of peroxide that bonds firmly to your teeth, and you can get the same whitening result by rinsing your mouth daily with hydrogen peroxide from the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) If you have a peroxide sensetivity, stay away from this product. Some people experience a burning sensation on their gums during usage, so I recommend rinsing with regular household peroxide to test your sensetivity before you spend $20-$30 on these whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) As Crest promises, these whitestrips DO NOT slip off of your teeth while you are using them. In fact, when I used them for the first time, I panicked a little when my 30 minutes were up. The strips become extremely sticky and slimy during usage, so it is almost impossible to peel them off of the front side of your teeth. I recommend pulling them off from the back of your teeth first, and though you might feel a slightly painful tug on the front of your teeth, it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) If you are going to apply these whitestrips, you MUST use a mirror to do so! It is important to place the strips RIGHT AT YOUR GUM LINE, or else you will get funky results. If you have any creases in the strip, that crease will show up on your teeth. When I used them for the first time, I did so without a mirror, and I had a thin horizontal white stripe in the center of all of my teeth. Though these lines disappear, it was very unsightly for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) The immediate after math of using the whitestrips is not always pretty. First of all, the strips leave a thin gunky residue on your teeth, so it is important to brush afterwards. Also, the strips sometimes leave white spots or lines on the teeth. These spots are only temporary, but I do not recommmend using them right before you have to go somewhere important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product. If you apply the Crest 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips according to the instructions on the  included leaflet, you should see dramatically whiter teeth after you have used all of the packets in your box.r teeth, so it is important to brush afterwards.

    <li> I use an electric toothbrush and brush and floss my teeth daily. However, I love coffee and Diet Coke, and over the past few years my teeth have suffered the consequences. They were quite yellow, and no amount of brushing was making a difference in whitening. So I decided to try the Crest Strips, since they were far less expensive than a professional whitening by the dentist. I could tell a difference after two days of using the strips as directed and within a week my smile is significantly whiter. My only complaint is that I wish the strips were a bit bigger, especially on the top. That said, they have done a great job of removing stains from dark beverages. I have otherwise healthy teeth, and I suffered no pain or irritation from the strips. If you have similar stains, I recommend giving them a try!</li>
    <li> i guess i was expecting much more whitening when it came to these strips. They adhere very well and stay in place without slipping and sliding however the seller didn&#x27;t send the 3d white strips, they sent me the vivid with advanced seal strips. I did notice a difference in the color of my teeth but i was expecting dramatic results. Overall a good product, i will be using another box in six months to see if i can get them any whiter.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!</li>
    <li> Daughter likes it &amp; does not irritate gums as much as other products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve utilized similar products by Crest in the past with satisfactory results but not optimal.  As others have mentioned, the product is definitely a huge improvement and actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Does adhere to your teeth and STAYS put!&lt;br /&gt;+Once a day application&lt;br /&gt;+Little to no sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;+Results within 3-4 days obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to purchase these but the user reviews were reassuring. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I have a brighter smile and still for a fraction of the cost. Just for reference  I have had my teeth professional whitened in the past. While I did obtain my ideal results it cost a lot more and it took a few office visits.  I&#x27;m only a week into the product and I am extremely happy. I did have a bit of sensitivity but I skipped a day and have had no issues since, and I have extremely sensitive teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down a good product!</li>
    <li> I did start to notice, as crest claims, a noticeable difference in 3 days.  This had me pretty excited for what was to come in the next 11 days.  I even tried to accelerate the results by doing two treatments in one day, but that proved to be a mistake.  My teeth were throbbing for almost a full day afterward.  I am pretty happy with the results, but somewhat disappointed after thinking I would have dramatic results.</li>
    <li> New in box and fast shipping.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it was not the 3D which is the newer version.  It was just the advanced whitestrips.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3 days(one in a day) and my teeth hurt and were sensitive...so i stopped for 2 days and used it again, after 3 days still didn&#x27;t see result and my teeth felt uncomfortable again....so now i don&#x27;t know what to do with this product...am i suppossed to use it non-stop to see the result? But my teeth felt uncomfortable if using for more than 3 days...kind of disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> They worked, but I used half at one time and tried using the other half around 6 months later. It was incredibly painful the second time around and my teeth hurt for more than 12 hours, enough that I didn&#x27;t use the remaining ones. If you have sensitive teeth, DO NOT buy these whitestrips!</li>
    <li> These white strips are amazing. I&#x27;ve used every kind out there and this is by far the best. You can tell a difference after just one time. They stay put better than any other!</li>
    <li> Seems to work some but not as drastically as all the other reviews claim. I ended up purchasing a professional product (Venus Comfort Gel) from my dentist that works twice as good and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> These 3D Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal really work well! My teeth have never been brighter and I have received many compliments! Super affordable and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I now have noticeably whiter teeth thanks to these. I wish I had bought them sooner! Just knowing I have whiter teeth really increases my confidence. I also suggest buying the daily touch-ups after this (although I only use these once or twice a week and still have white teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as I was hoping, but I&#x27;ve never had any whitening before and have been drinking coffee for years. I am still really happy with this product, and will repeat this treatment in six months.</li>
    <li> They absolutely do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I whiten the sides that do not get covered by the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the perforated area on the strip, the part of the strip you throw out, use.  I just cut up and place them on the teeth towards the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also do this to whiten the back of your teeth.  Believe it or not, any stains on the back of the teeth can effect the level of whiteness you see on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also pay extra attention to my eye teeth by placing these cut up pieces on at times I am not whitening with the entire strip.</li>
    <li> I was a lot misleaded by the 28 count as mentioned in the description. I expected to find 28 pouches in the box,because the pouch price is listed as 1.13$. So I was really surprised to receive only 14 pouches.</li>
    <li> The product performed as the description said it would. I noticed a difference in about 3 days, and a big difference after the 14 days. My teeth were much whiter and even felt cleaner. The bottom strip is a little short so it really covers just the front teeth. The strips do leave a little pasty residue after they are pulled off. Rinsing helps get rid of that. I did leave mine on a little longer than needed. I don&#x27;t know if that made them any whiter but it didn&#x27;t seem to do any harm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Crest Whitening Strips over the years, but NEVER had this kind of result!  I saw a big difference in whitening after the first day!  I continued using it for 2 more days and took a break for a few days.  My teeth were seriously white and I&#x27;m not kidding when I say I didn&#x27;t want to over-whiten them!  I will continue to use them sporadically from now on, but I am very happy with how white they are now!  My family even noticed!  I&#x27;m sold on Crest 3-D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips!!</li>
    <li> I went through the Amazon warehouse option, to qualify for the shipping discounts.  Shipping costs are eating me alive, in the necessities I must find online, because on a native reservation many of these products are unavailable, which i think is a socio economic barrier easily tagged as corporate racism by those of us who experience this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 28 count, and received the 14 count.  Which is pretty substantial considering the price.  Amazon does not accept returns of health and beauty products, and had i been forced to return it, add in the gas, mileage and time to repackage and return the product, I probably would have been so upset I might have stopped using amazon.  however, amazon realized the mistake and comp&#x27;ed the items, but it may not be their policy since its difficult to contact them in the first place re: orders that are placed that are delivered, same manufacturer same product but different qty or description nuance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m really more concerned about the product itself and the variations Crest markets, which I find particularly deceptive, when their products have remarkable effectiveness.  In particular, if you look for a 3d white strip, and don&#x27;t also make sure the product identifiers are correct, you could end up with any number of variations like in the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot;, description.  The Advanced Vivid product, has a much smaller upper strip.  And it seems they are sizing down all their strips in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I want to say, that the strips aren&#x27;t long enough in the first place to cover back and front teeth.  Some ppl may like dingy back teeth but I don&#x27;t.  Personally I feel that the strips should be longer, for the price gouge at the counter or online purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd the strips aren&#x27;t sold in a month, they are sold like 28 counts or 14, and they are really only 1/2 that if you want to treat all your teeth.  The box is huge, compared to the strips, and that doesn&#x27;t say much for consumer waste packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the thick seal or the difficulty getting the product off, because I&#x27;d much rather that then when they slide or fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they went back to the container, that holds the strips, - actually one that was smaller, like for a purse or wallet, like a business card sized container, to hold the strips, they&#x27;d be much better of a convenience use for folks like me.packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the thick seal or the difficulty getting the product off, because I&#x27;d much rather that then when they slide or fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they went back to the container, that holds the strips, - actually one that was smaller, like for a purse or wallet, like a business card sized container, to hold the strips, they&#x27;d be much better of a convenience use for folks like me.</li>
    <li> Products works great if you can deal with the pain they cause.  It made my teethe ultra sensitive to the point where I had to take a pain pill to get through the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten these strips and by the 1st use of them I was able to see results. Minimum, but results nonetheless. I did feel, not pain, because it did not really hurt but you feel something after a while. You get used to it, I&#x27;m not sure how the pain is for the older audience though so give it a shot and you&#x27;ll certainly see results.</li>
    <li> These were greasy and Crest has a better product.</li>
    <li> I bought this probably about a month ago off Amazon. I got a really great deal because there was a 7 dollar coupon it let me use as well (thanks Amazon!). So my first suggestion would be to look at the price online first before going into the store to buy it. I looked at my local Walmart to compare the price and it was almost a 20 dollar difference! Anyways, to the product. I have used some of the old Crest Whitestrips before, not sure what kind, but it was about 3 years ago so one would assume that Crest would create a product of better quality. So, I began looking at the reviews on Amazon and many people were raving at the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips. The only problem I saw in people&#x27;s reviews was that they were not great for people with sensitive teeth, which would be me. However, this was such a great deal, I couldn&#x27;t turn it down. So, I began using them about a month ago (I know the kit says it&#x27;s a 14 day supply, I&#x27;ll get to that) and I can definitely see a difference. So, the package says there are 14 upper and 14 lower strips, which would equate to use over 14 days. But, as all the people in reviews said, they really do create a lot of sensitivity. I have very sensitive teeth, I use Sensodine for my teeth (At first used it for a month continuously, then now it&#x27;s about every other day). So, my regime was to use a days strip and then wait a few days (2-3, depending on how my teeth felt) until I used the next one. I found this worked quite well. So, if you have sensitive teeth but yet still want to use a whitestrip, I would suggest doing what I did. Also, they really, REALLY do stay on! Almost too well. I find myself ripping them off my teeth to get them off! However, I shouldn&#x27;t complain because this was a big improvement from the other whitestrips I used. So, overall, a great product that does make a difference. Don&#x27;t expect to have a completely new smile or you will be highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these strips with my most recent toothpaste purchase and figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I generally whiten using the dentist grade gel and trays, but experience a lot of sensitivity when I do and have to reduce my whitening time quite a bit. I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity while using the Crest product. My teeth lighten fairly well anyway, but I noticed a considerable difference in the brightness of my smile after just the first use. The gel seeps and the strips wrinkle, but I am very pleased with the results of this product overall.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and use, excellent results, with teeth noticeably brightened.</li>
    <li> These are the only strips I will use, because they work efficiently and stick well to the teeth while processing! Always get compliments on my pearl whites, even from dentists :)</li>
    <li> For reference, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever attempted to whiten my teeth.  I drink coffee and soda occasionally (1-2x a week or every other week.)  I am also Asian, so a lot of my meals include sauces that can stain teeth (i.e. soy and duck sauce).  My teeth also have a bit of worn out enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Effective (lightened my teeth about one shade)&lt;br /&gt;- After taste not that strong (the after taste wasn&#x27;t bad, but I experienced a phlegm like buildup when I swallowed the foam.  So after the first day, I decided to spit out my saliva every 5-min while using these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Instructions too vague (didn&#x27;t mention when you should eat/drink/brush teeth.  In my case, I waited 1-hr after/before eating to use this and brushed my teeth afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;- Lower strip too small (it would be nice if it covered more teeth; it covered 6 teeth for me but only the 4 middle teeth actually whitened).&lt;br /&gt;- Tooth sensitivity (I did experience sensitivity for the 1st week; it wasn&#x27;t so bad the 2nd week.  It felt like my teeth were weak, kind of like when you first have your braces removed or when you first use a retainer -- I couldn&#x27;t drink really cold or hot drinks / chew on hard food).</li>
    <li> The strips for the lower teeth are too long. I could not install them without them getting stuck on the sides of the mouth opening.</li>
    <li> I scoured the reviews of all the whitening products before settling on the Advanced White Strips and must admit I was initially thrilled:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 - tiny improvement&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 - teeth went from dingy white to a much brighter white&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 - dramatic improvement -- teeth were almost chalk white and I was stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a pause...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 - teeth didn&#x27;t get whiter and appeared slightly less bright&lt;br /&gt;day 5 - teeth definitely looked less white&lt;br /&gt;day 6 - less white&lt;br /&gt;day 7 - less white&lt;br /&gt;day 8 - teeth remained this medium white and NEVER went back to the dazzling white they were on day 3. I discontinued using the product on day 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this product stopped working after day 3 and I also can&#x27;t account for why it made my teeth look less white after day 5. I can&#x27;t recommend it because my teeth are not the color of: sugar, styrofoam, xerox paper, Easter bunnies or marshmellows. After using Advanced Seal Whitestrips they are the color of: sheer white curtains that haven&#x27;t been washed all year, seagulls that have been stomping and splashing around on a muddy shore and a squashed bar of Ivory soap that you might find in the restroom of a roadside diner...</li>
    <li> These white strips aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  They stay firmly on teeth and the bleaching agent doesn&#x27;t seep out and make me gag like the original version of white strips.  Give them a try.  They are worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have used all the Crest products leading up to these, and &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; has by far been my favorite one.  The &#x27;Classic&#x27; and &#x27;Pro&#x27; both worked as they were supposed to, but the way they were made, they would kind of unstick from your teeth with the saliva and hydrogen peroxide gel bubbling, so I would constantly be trying to re adhere them.  The gel would dissolve in the saliva also, so there was always a weird medicinal flavor--not so unpleasant that it deterred me from continuing, but bad enough that &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; felt like a huge step up.  &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; neither peeled off nor released any off-flavors in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Aquafresh trays, and they were HORRIBLE.  The trays are one-size-fits-all and I would like to know who has front teeth 1/4 inch wide.  The gel goes everywhere and stays on your teeth for no time.  For people that experience mild gum sensitivity from putting the Crest strips, the Aquafresh trays are a nightmare!  I received no results, was in pain the entire box, and had essentially threw away my money.  In afterthought, I should have thrown the stuff away after trying the first one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tooth sensitivity issues with the &#x27;Pro&#x27; but not with &#x27;Classic&#x27; or &#x27;Adavanced Seal&#x27;, meaning, for &#x27;Pro&#x27; some of my teeth felt sore, which is a weird feeling, but it only occurred if I did the recommended 2 a day--cutting down to 1 eliminated all the problems.  All of them whitened about the same--noticeable to people I knew, but not totally fake-looking either, just the right shade of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize, the whitening strips I&#x27;ve liked best have been the &#x27;Classic&#x27; and the &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Classic&#x27; is the mildest of the strips I&#x27;ve tried, so people with sensitive teeth or gums would probably do best with them.  They are the least expensive, but they also take 28 days (twice a day) to whiten.  They don&#x27;t stick as strongly as &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27;, but eventually do work just as well, for around half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; is just a more streamlined version of &#x27;Premium&#x27;--just as good in 1/4 the time, with much less effort to keep them on.  If you&#x27;ve got the money, I loved &#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; and will buy it again when my teeth need whitening again!ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Advanced Seal&#x27; is just a more streamlined version of &#x27;Premium&#x27;--just as good in 1/4 the time, with much less effort to keep them on.

    <li> Makes sure you use these at least 3-4 times before you judge the effectivness. My teeth are now whiter than they have ever been, just for over a couple dozen bucks!</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me. I started to see results after 3 days, like they said and at the end my teeth were whiter. I didn&#x27;t like the taste and I had problems with the lower strip, because it kept coming down after max 10 minutes. I am glad that I tried this product and probably I will use it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Its works OK. But it&#x27;s not as effective as I expected it to be.  I used the entire box, and barely noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> u can get same price if u have crest white&#x27;s $7 off coupon to purchase it in walmart or other stores.</li>
    <li> These are the best strips I have ever used. I have used the Crest Classic white strips and the Aquafresh whitening trays. These stay on the best and therfore produce the best whitening results.</li>
    <li> I used this product every single day according to the directions. I immediately noticed that it adhered to my teeth without sliding around.  The second feature that I liked was that it did not ooze out any of the whitening agent into my mouth. I have used other products in the past  where the gel leaks into your mouth and the taste is terrible!  This product produced great results and my teeth definitely looked whiter then they were before.  I would consider buying this again.</li>
    <li> product is good.  i think they adhere better than older strips, but the bottom strip is way too small.</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal&lt;br /&gt;Quite Impressive even when compared to Pro products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am making this comparison to Opalescence 35% professional gel that I used in dental trays about a year ago. That was I believe the highest concentration of hydrogen peroxide (the common bleaching agent used in pretty much all the whitening products) readily available through mail order. They also offer 15% and 20% I think. At the time I went overboard testing its effectiveness by taking photos of my teeth before and after each treatment under fixed white balance setting and comparing the results with the color picker tool in a drawing program. Yes it worked and it worked well. However filling the tray was a pain and remaining pretty much motionless for half hour at a time was more of a pain. Add to that the fact that your mouth is constantly producing saliva, which you do not want to swallow so it drools down your cheek. Sorry for the graphics but to be helpful with the review I feel its important that you understand the do it yourself alternatives. My teeth color is only very slightly off white due to tea, coffee and wine. I would have to repeat the treatment about every three months to keep a natural (not bright) white appearance. After I ran out of Opalescence, I did not re order due to the involved treatment procedures. Hence the White strips. The regular , not \\&quot;advanced\\&quot;, products are just as much of a pain due to the fact that they will not stay on. The advanced strips stick on like Velcro. I usually dry my teeth with a paper towel first to make sure the bond is good, and have had them stick for an hour with no problem. As soon as you stick the strips on you can see the foaming hydride start to do its work. Surprisingly I found the whitening achieved after 1 hour (30 min recommended) to be a close equivalent of the pro gel. There is no peroxide concentration spelled out anywhere on or in the box so I would guess that it is below the 15% offered in pro products, but the close proximity of the gel to the teeth without any saliva dilution makes up for some of that. Crest recommends that initially you should use them twice a day for best/fastest results, I would agree with that. I use the strips to maintain the color only now, so one application (out of the 14 sets in box) per month will last a year. Crest recommends that you use two entire kits of 14 per year. Here are additional things you should know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not one of the 14 foil packs containing the strips opened up correctly by pulling where the arrow shows. It rips above the seal. Don&#x27;t try to do it from the other side, just get scissors.&lt;br /&gt;2. The top strip is just 5/8 by 3 inches long. That is too short in the up and down direction for me. I have to start applying the strip at the top of the teeth by the gum and there is hardly any left to wrap around to the back of the teeth. Another 1/8\\&quot; please?&lt;br /&gt;3. After you apply the top and bottom strip, gently use the tips of your fingernails to push in the strips between the teeth. Quite often these areas are most discolored.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you have any tartar buildup, have it removed/scraped first. The contrast between it and tooth enamel will be exaggerated by the whitening process.&lt;br /&gt;5. When its time to remove the strips, it is a bit of an ordeal. They really stick very well, but do peel off easily if you start at a corner and youse your fingernails for a good grip. When the strip comes off, there will be remnants of the glue and gel stuck on your teeth. Don&#x27;t panic, but I wish the instructions would have mentioned this. It will dissolve completely after about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;6.

    <li> This product works well.  Firmly grips teeth.  Does not create undo sensitivity.  Tried the \\&quot;Premium\\&quot; and this works much better.</li>
    <li> This was my first teeth whitener and I really liked it. It lightened my teeth at least 3 shades I will continue to use this product every six months.</li>
    <li> Those whitening strips are awesome. You can see the results since the 4th day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 6 days and I can see my teeth much whiter than they were.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of buying them again!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, buy it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take time to write reviews but I have to say that Crest Whitestrips, Advanced Seal, renewed my willingness to try something claimed to be better. It really worked! What I liked most is that you only have to use it once a day vs. twice for others. I put it on before bed, read a book for half hour or so and took it off. Real convenient. My family noticed the difference in about 7 days and by 10 days&#x27; use I was delighted with the change. After that, I used up the rest of the box by using it every three or four days and teeth got even brighter. I never thought my 60 yr-old teeth could be returned to healthy white but they did. Its supposed to last more than a year but I&#x27;d be happy doing this much more often to maintain my new smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you can have bleaching of your gums so I was apprehensive at first. But I found no change in my gums, just whiter and whiter teeth. There wasn&#x27;t even any flavor to object to. So, easy and pleasant to use and it does the job. I&#x27;ve been telling others to try this product because it works.</li>
    <li> The strips adhered well to my teeth. The were a little hard to pull off and left a sticky residue. My teeth were whiter, but by drinking coffee, tea and diet soda, the white didn&#x27;t last too long. I guess if you give up dark drinks, this will work. I would try these again.</li>
    <li> These strips did what they promised they would. I have not tried any other kind, but these did not slip off. I noticed a difference after the first use. I would recommend them and plan on using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have too much sensitivity as some people described, they were very easy to take off and it was painless. Will definetly use them again.</li>
    <li> These strips are thick and hard to get in the cracks between your teeth.  The whitening effects don&#x27;t seem to be as effective as some of the other crest products.  They also leave a very thick gunk on teeth after you take them off.</li>
    <li> I used the strips for two weeks as directed, but I left them on for more than a half-hour per day. My teeth experienced minimal sensitivity, but it wasn&#x27;t bothersome. At the end of the treatment, I notice that the teeth covered by the strips are a few shades whiter than those in the back that weren&#x27;t touched. I recommend this product, but try to get it on sale! You can find online coupons that you can use at local stores. When I purchased Whitestrips Advanced Seal from Amazon, the set was $22, I&#x27;m not sure why the price has gone up since.</li>
    <li> They Stay on very good&lt;br /&gt;Used for 14 days in a row then only on weekends&lt;br /&gt;They did whiten little at a time, wish they would be longer for all the teeth instead of just the main front ones&lt;br /&gt;Rather expensive for 14 strips</li>
    <li> These are the best Crest strips I have used and I have tried them all.  But Rembrandt&#x27;s green box version is a little better because their strip is thicker and better at staying in place when you are using them.  The white you get is the same for both though, so either is excellent and buy them both and compare yourself.</li>
    <li> I have used these and they are great!! Be careful because if you have sensitve teeth then only use them for the time advised..but it was noticeable whitening.</li>
    <li> I received the package earlier than expected, which was nice.  However, after using just two of them my teeth became very sensitive.  I tried spacing them out, using one every three days or more but it was just too unbearable.  My teeth never seemed to whiten up either.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t using them daily, or maybe because they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Who knows.  I ended up returning them and will never put myself through that again.</li>
    <li> great for making my teeth white. must cheaper than going to the dentist</li>
    <li> My friends can tell a difference. They have been saying how white my teeth look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrip products for years now and have always been satisfied with them. They clean well, don&#x27;t taste bad and were easy to use. The only drawback I every encountered was their tendency on occasion to fall off before you were ready for them to go. Well it looks like Crest was listening. These new strips have the same cleaning properties but stay put until you&#x27;re ready to remove them. Perfect!</li>
    <li> For years I have always wanted to try whitening strips so I could improve the shade of my teeth. They aren&#x27;t overly stained but after many years of drinking coffee every morning, and at various times throughout the day, they could be a few shades lighter. So, when I got the chance to try out these new Crest Advances Seal whitestrips, I was excited to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you that once you put these on there are no worries of these strips coming off unless you physically take them off yourself. I found that sometimes I would have to use a little extra effort than normal to remove a strip but this did not happen all the time. And on occassion there was a slight sticky residue left on my teeth after removing the strips. Unlike some, I did not experience any problems with burning on my gums. But the instructions clearly state that if you do have sensitivity problems that you may feel some discomfort. After a few days of using the strips I could visibly notice the change in color of my teeth. They were looking whiter and they looked good. Also let me add that if you are going to use this product you are not supposed to keep drinking coffee or other items that can stain your teeth. Nor are you supposed to smoke. If you do these things the strips may not work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the price is a bit steep, but it is a lot cheaper than having your teeth professionally cleaned. And this only takes 30 minutes out of your day. Seems like a pretty good value in the long run. And as another reviewer mentioned enclosed is a $7 coupon of your next purchase which is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> These new strips actually do what they say! They adhere to the teeth, making it easy for the gel to do it&#x27;s work. They are also easy to handle, which is a bonus for anyone who&#x27;s ever tried whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was the flavor, not the best. But more than that. The gel clings to the teeth even after you remove the strips and leaves the taste in your mouth for a while. That&#x27;s the reason for only 4 stars. Otherwise, great product and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I drink my tea or coffee black,and enjoy a glass of wine from time to time and they do tend to discolor my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I found the strips to be an effective way to remove the stains and whiten my teeth.Is it as good as a cleaning at my dentist ? No,but it sure costs less.They are also a bit hard to get on with out wrinkling and can be hard to remove  as they do stick to your teeth, but nothing that can not be overcome.I feel they do help to keep my teeth white and as I work with the public that is very important.My husband just said to be sure to say they keep me quite for a half hour..As the do tend to be a bit slippery I keep my mouth closed for the 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Whitestrips for over a year now. Before using the Whitestrips, I used a dentist-made bleaching tray and Opalescence in syringes.  I feel that the Whitestrips are easier to use, and I didn&#x27;t have to leave them on as long as the bleaching trays. Both had similar whitening results.  If I don&#x27;t use the Whitestrips for a month or so, I notice that my teeth begin to lose the whiteness, so I try to use one about once every week or even two weeks to maintain.  Make sure, if you purchase them, to check the expiration date on the box.  If it is a date that has passed, don&#x27;t buy them. The strips will probably have lost some of their potency.  I would recommend this product if you want to try to whiten your teeth on your own.</li>
    <li> I am very excited about how well this worked!  My teeth were whiter within 3 days as promised.  I have 3 more days until I&#x27;m finished with the 14 day program. Great product for me.</li>
    <li> These worked really well and were easy to use. I only wish that the kit came with a whiteness gauge.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I have perfect, healthy gums and teeth.  I have used other bleaching methods with no problems.  When I put the 3D white strips in, they immediately started burning.  My fingers were burned, along with my lips and my gums.  The skin on my gums turned white after ONLY TEN SECONDS.  I took off the strip in less than one minute and my gum skin came with it! My teeth ached for hours even after I rinsed my mouth.  My lips are blistered.  PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this product!  It is dangerous!</li>
    <li> I have used a few whitening toothpastes and the generic version of the basic Crest strips.  None whitened my teeth and had foaming issues with the generic strips.  I bought on and impulse and they have a money back guarantee and I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on day 3 of using these strips and there is an amazing difference on the color of my teeth.  They stick to my teeth amazingly well and I haven&#x27;t experienced the foaming issue that I did with the Generic strips.  I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 5 days. I think they are a huge improvement on the whitestrips I had used before. I couldn&#x27;t stand the others I had tried because they always moved around on my teeth and I felt like I had to keep my mouth in the same open position the whole time to keep them in the right spot. I also hated using them twice a day. The Advanced Seal stay on so well that I basically have to rip them off at the end (that is not a complaint, lol). They haven&#x27;t made my teeth sensitive or \\&quot;hurty\\&quot;. Hoping to have a super fabulous smile by the end!</li>
    <li> one can do it in the shower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A box of Crest Whitestrips, Advanced Seal, 14-Count Boxes comes with 14 packets that includes 1 upper and 1 lower strip. The instructions are pretty straightforward, peel each from the liner and apply the gel side to the center teeth and leave on for 30 minutes. Use once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are easy to apply to the center upper and lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however feel like I have plastic in my mouth -- which is good because one might forget to take them out, otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saliva buildup is increased while wearing the strips causing one to swallow or spit prior to the 30 minutes. After the allotted time, the strips become mushy and therefore a bit harder to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it was hard to enunciate words clearly with the strips on my teeth -- just say no to the cell phone or major political speeches for 30 minutes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smile! After using the Whitestrips for 14 days, my center upper and lower teeth are noticeably whiter -- lots of compliments! --Katharena Eiermann, 2009</li>
    <li> These are an an excellent upgrade from the traditional line of tooth whitening products from crest. In my experience they stick to my teeth considerably better without coming off. After using them 6 days I have not had an incident of them coming off like the previous line of products. Though they have a great product and have finally listened to consumers, they still have some work to make this product really appealing to everyone. Specifically the design of the top strip is fine but the bottle one does not fit very well and is super small and covers over the top of your middle teeth instead of covering more teeth (width wise)</li>
    <li> short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;stays on SUPER SUPER good. very adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;whitens teeth (saw a difference after 2 uses)&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use but really, who cares how hard it is to use if you really want your teeth whitened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are great!</li>
    <li> Seller was very prompt in processing.  I did find the same product at a cheaper price after I had ordered.</li>
    <li> They do whiten teeth pretty well, but hurt really bad and I don&#x27;t even consider myself someone with sensitive teeth. I started off using one pouch 30mins a day like the package says, and by the 3rd day I had significant sensitivity and there were sharp pains in my teeth. So now I use one pouch a week or, even less, whenever I think my teeth are looking yellow. They come with a lot of pouches but still pretty pricy for me.</li>
    <li> WOW...wish i had bought years earlier! I can hardly believe how well -and fast- these worked!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in these Crest strips.  It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bought whiteners from the Crest line.  They were pioneers in bringing this to mass marketing, but their early strips were unappealing, the way they slipped off if you made the mistake of trying to talk while wearing them.  Supposedly they stay on better now.  No, they don&#x27;t.  They do not adhere any better now than they did five years ago.  I was really disappointed to see that they still make the bottom strip extremely small.  I have more than six bottom teeth, and more than six are visible.  Why do they make that strip so small?  I suppose the size doesn&#x27;t matter if it slips off.  It barely reaches to my gums to begin with, so if it slips, it certainly is not going to whiten the entire few teeth that it covers.  It will be a long time before I use Crest strips again!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Easy to use, just follow simple instructions.  As one gets older; coffee and tea consumers need this for healthier looking teeth.</li>
    <li> I received the item right on schedule and I feel the strips did what I expected.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying them in the store.  The proper product as advertised.  The only problem I have with these is they cause my teeth to be a little sensitive so I use a set every other day instead of everyday but that is just me so I can&#x27;t knock the product for that.  If you want whiter teeth or use these, buy them here!</li>
    <li> Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Will def  reorder.</li>
    <li> These work very well in for 1 wk with of use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different whitening systems - inexpensive to dentist-office expensive. For me, they all boil down to if you use them properly and consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These white strips did whiten my teeth noticeably after about a week. They stayed on my teeth for the 30 minutes (most shift around too much). I liked the once-a-day treatment. I prefer the strips to the trays with the gel solution, too. Also, I have experiences sensitivity in my gums with other strips but didn&#x27;t with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest flaw was how they peel off the backing. They&#x27;re very \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and are hard to handle without getting your fingers all over the whitener. To be fair though this is pretty much true for a lot of the strips out there in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - they work. That&#x27;s really what matters to me.</li>
    <li> Was very easy to do. The strips did not slide off. It whitened my teeth just like promised.</li>
    <li> These really work and I was able to notice a difference in just a few days.  I occasionally had some sensitivity after using a pair of strips, but it was never unbearable.</li>
    <li> YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY THESE WHITESTRIPS IF YOU REALLY WANT WHITER TEETH. Don&#x27;t whine about sensitivity, it says right on the box that it can happen. I had no issue with the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on these bleaching my clothes or fingers. They only became gooey when I removed them from my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been thinking about whitening my teeth for awhile -- I had the Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening kit, but that thing TORE MY GUMS UP. It did whiten my teeth slightly though, but not worth the $50 and the pain. I asked my dentist about getting professional whitening, but he said it&#x27;s basically the same thing as everything out on the market that has a tray (like the rembrandt kit), just wildly more expensive (I love his honesty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the old whitestrips from about 3 years ago -- they didn&#x27;t do too much for me. I got this new set of Crest Whitestrips in a fit of optimism. The shipping took a little longer than most stuff I get from Amazon, but nothing outrageous. The packaging was nothing to hoot at (mine came wrapped in the Classifieds section in a manila envelope, the box was a little crushed, but the innards were fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions, and DID NOT brush my teeth beforehand, and slapped those suckers onto my lower and upper teeth. I like these better than the old whitestrips, they aren&#x27;t gooey and slippery like the old ones. They&#x27;re more a tacky feel, like they get sticky only when they get wet, so you can readjust them without them sliding all over your mouth. I do have a fairly wide smile, and the upper strips cover just about all of it, and the lower ones cover about 6 of my teeth. These don&#x27;t taste as bleachy as the old ones, and they didn&#x27;t irritate my gums AT ALL either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them every other day to cut back on the risk of sensitivity (but I fell asleep with them on one day, which you&#x27;re NOT supposed to do - so i ended up leaving em on for like 2 hours instead of just 30 minutes, so I had some sensitivity after that session that faded eventually). I noticed a visible difference in the shade of my teeth within 3-4 treatments and I think i still have about 5 packets left. My teeth are pretty white now, but not unnaturally white (by unnatural, i mean like Ross in that episode of Friends where he dates the girl with the blacklight). My teeth aren&#x27;t paper-white, but let&#x27;s be honest -- that would be creepy. The walls at my job are a pale cream color, and my teeth are now whiter than the walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could make these better is if they paid my bills and told me they loved me once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and maybe included a whitening scale, so that you could compare your teeth when you start to when you finish.n that faded eventually).

    <li> I did start to see a difference after 3 days, what a difference these have made the brightness of my teeth after 14 days. Great product and easy to use with no after taste when you remove them.</li>
    <li> I was received different products and maker say \\&quot;Pay shipment cost if you want change the products\\&quot;</li>
    <li> OW OW OW. My teeth are a little sensitive normally. I tried one set of these in the afternoon. There was some whitening. Later that evening, my front teeth started tingling (just sitting there, not drinking or eating). By night they hurt a LOT!!! I had to get orajel. NOT WORTH IT! I will go back to other whitening products that DON&#x27;T hurt like this.</li>
    <li> Worked really well. It does take the whole 14 days though to see good results.</li>
    <li> These strips definitely get your teeth whiter - I noticed results in just a few days.  But beware...do not leave on too long or you WILL end up with very sensitive teeth.  I forgot I had them on for an hour and my teeth were hyper-sensitive for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to use, and see result&#x27;s quickly, but the gel doesn&#x27;t taste too good, but worth it for a quick and easy fix to get whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I Noticed results in 2 days personally. I only used the sample... However I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because whenever I use any products that whiten your teeth. Mine become extremely sensitive for the next 3 or 4 days. I tried for a week to do it every other day... Nights only. And it still worked well. You can even use this product once a week if you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using Enamel building tooth paste AND mouth wash to help with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Please do not use these! I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I used these strips on two consecutive days and on the second, 2 large craters were formed on my front tooth.  The strips do whiten- even after just 2 days- but really not worth it for tooth damage.  The enamel safe claim is highly spurious.  I have never had any problems or dental work done up to now but expect I will now need some to repair the damage.  Must be a safer way!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how effective they are because I couldn&#x27;t use them for more than 2 days, but they do stay on the teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;After the first treatment, my teeth hurt badly. The next treatment, it hurt so bad I wanted to scream. It hurt SO bad. I can&#x27;t use these, they are too strong.</li>
    <li> i only gave two stars for the design and the fact that they don&#x27;t dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they whiten I don&#x27;t know but what I do know is that they don&#x27;t dissolve in your mouth like the listerine whitening strips do. You also have to wait 30 minutes to take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have use the listerine strips before and they whitening my teeth perfectly. It was simple (first) brush my teeth at night or in the morning. Then put them on and forget about them. The only down fall about them. Is that they&#x27;re a little bit harder to take out of the packaging. but after the second time you&#x27;ll get the technic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the crest 3D white advanced. are easier to take out of the packaging. but again i don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to spare at night or in the morning and on this specific box the lower strips are way too SMALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i did the same process for both brands</li>
    <li> I saw a significant change in colour after about 7 treatments. Not perfectly white, but much better. Good price for the number of strips.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I am surprised at how well these work.  It may be because of the Advance Seal technology (which I love) but I saw better results from these than any other whitening strips I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot- even Crest Supreme).  They come at a great price on this site-definately worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through the package..for the most part I used the product on a nightly basis, I may have missed a night or two in the process, but these definitely work.  I&#x27;d say I say the most significant whitening take place in 5 - 7 days.  Now, I&#x27;m not talking my teeth went from brown to beaming white.  I had a little staining from wine and coffee...and I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m now 3 shades lighter or so.  For the minimal effort and the low cost of this product, I don&#x27;t think you can really beat the results.  It&#x27;s fairly similar to the whitening paste you&#x27;ll receive from the dentist, without the mouthpiece and much more inexpensive than that or laser whitening.  So, I&#x27;d say try them out if you want to get your teeth a few shades whiter and keep a few bucks in your pocket.</li>
    <li> Misled- It says a 28 count box so I assumed I could whiten 28 times but no it is 14 for the upper and 14 for the lower. I emailed the sender and Amazon but never got a reply.</li>
    <li> I love amazon for selling these at the price they do!  I&#x27;ve probably used about 5 or 6 boxes of these and my smile has never been so white.  I get tons of compliments and people always assume that I get them professionally whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at old photos, I don&#x27;t know how I survived!  Despite brushing with the most whitening toothpaste I could find, my teeth would absorb every stain and looked downright awful from all the stains I had from drinking iced coffee all the time. I didn&#x27;t have enough money to get my teeth professionally whitened, and the only white strips available were crest white strips classic which were annoying to use. When Crest White Strips Advanced Seal came out, I had to give them a try.  Luckily for me, the changes were drastic. They improved my self confidence, which led to other changes for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other white strips before and were annoyed with how they slide around and make your mouth full of saliva, this is your product.  The advanced seal holds them in place tight and it&#x27;s true that you can drink water while keeping these on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really sensitive teeth, this might cause you some issues. I&#x27;ve left them on for longer than the recommended 30 minutes before and it made my teeth ache.  One time I fell asleep with them on by accident... big mistake! My teeth were in pain for about 2 or 3 days.  I have also experienced intense, but very short spikes of pain on one tooth when using this product, especially if I leave them on for too long.  However, after using them every day I developed a tolerance to the sensitivity and pain, and I can now use these 7 days a week without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are totally worth the effort, especially at this cost! I transformed my smile from yellowish coffee grunge to fabulous illuminating white after about 3 straight months of using crest white strips with advanced seal.  Now, 6 months later I have been able to maintain my bright smile by using a strip once a week and brushing with a whitening toothpaste twice a day, in addition to flossing once a day. I&#x27;ll try to include a before &amp; after picture (jeez, I&#x27;m so embarrassed to show my before picture!!) so look in the product images for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, can&#x27;t go wrong with crest white strips that have advanced seal! They are powerful and give professional results.t smile by using a strip once a week and brushing with a whitening toothpaste twice a day, in addition to flossing once a day.

They are powerful and give professional results.</li>
    <li> These work very good -- well satisfied</li>
    <li> This has significantly whitened my teeth, I am very happy with the whitening aspect of this. The downside is that it makes my teeth very sensitive, I had to use it for half the time every other day because if not my teeth hurt so bad the whole day, if I did it at night Id still wake up with tooth sensitivity. The fact that I only used the strips half the time and I was still happy with the results says a lot though about how effective they are, so I would reccomend if you really want whiter teeth, but be prepared for tooth sensitivity by the 2nd or 3rd use.</li>
    <li> This order was not sent by Amazon, but from a company that sells through Amazon. The product works very well, however it looked like an elephant sat on it by the time I got it.  The Crest box had all 4 corners smashed and it was flattened.  I understand that the main thing should be that nothing&#x27;s broken and everything works, however the presentation was very poor.</li>
    <li> Worked very well, highly satisfied with my purchase!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would work better</li>
    <li> Most of the whitening products I have used in the past are paint on types and usually lead to excessive salivating while I try my best to keep from removing the whitener from my teeth. In the end, I don&#x27;t see any results and all I get is a nasty taste in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this strip I don&#x27;t get the strong taste of peroxide but its still a little bit there. The top strip covers a large portion of my teeth however I feel like in order to get good coverage of all of your teeth such as the sides and cracks between teeth, you have to produce a little bit of suction to pull the strip closer to your teeth. Otherwise, I would feel like the strip would only cover the front of the teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package recommends applying it once per day and recommends not using it directly after brushing your teeth. I don&#x27;t think that it is incredibly noticeable so I&#x27;ve often started my day brushing my teeth then preparing my lunch and other needs for the day and approximately 30 minutes later I apply the strip right before I head out the door. With my 20 minute commute on the bus I&#x27;ve found that nobody has ever commented on it and only noticed it when I asked if they could still see the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strip stays on very well and although I have never personally experienced strips sliding around there is little chance that these strips will move. Removal will be a bit more difficult but I think that its worth it knowing that the chemical will be directly applied to my teeth and not slowly lost in my saliva. To remove I often have to approach it from different angles because I don&#x27;t want it to affect my crown. Because crowns won&#x27;t change color I haven&#x27;t used it for more than 5 days in a row so that I can get somewhat brighter teeth without bringing too much attention to the difference in color from my crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see results after 3 or 4 days so that claim I believe is true. The only thing I would be disappointed in is that the bottom strip is very small and probably only cover the middle 6 teeth on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this product and I may go back to it again after trying the Crest 2 hour express whitestrips. I&#x27;ll update this later when I have a chance to compare the two products.ll and probably only cover the middle 6 teeth on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this product and I may go back to it again after trying the Crest 2 hour express whitestrips. I&#x27;ll update this later when I have a chance to compare the two products.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about buying this, but I decided to try it out after reading many reviews about it. I heard sensitivity may occur, and I already have sensitive teeth so I predicted extremely sensitive teeth. That was NOT the case for me. By the 3rd day I did notice some results, but by the 7th day I saw a noticeable result(and so did many other ppl). Around the 5th day was when sensitivity kicked in, it only last for about 2 days though. The strips were somewhat hard to remove during the first few days, but I got used to them and became really easy to remove. I strongly suggest this product, it will not disappoint, AND you WILL see a brighter smile. I feel more confident, and I smile so much now. Thank you Crest.</li>
    <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with sensitive teeth. I used a different crest whitening product where you applied once a day for 15-20 minutes or so, and I had no sensitivity problems at all. The first time I used the advanced vivid my teeth became very sensitive for a couple days. It definitely works (I saw results immediately after 1st use) but beware if you have sensitive teeth! Another thing, when you put the strips on your teeth, they stick VERY strongly but be careful not to get any spit on the sticky side, it makes the strip not stick well and it slides around.</li>
    <li> I have a ton left they worked so well.</li>
    <li> I have used the strips only three times and they are much whiter and the little coffee stains are GONE! I found that these offered the cheapest price per unit and with the $7 coupon they were positively cheap. I would definitely do this again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, it really dramaticaly whitens your teeth. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will buy this product again, it really worth the price!</li>
    <li> I used the whole box of strips exactly as directed and there was NO change in the color of my teeth. Mine have a yellowish tint but nothing so sever that these shouldn&#x27;t have worked.  I would not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> Most importantly, I saw a big difference by the time I finished all 14 days of this product. The strips were very easy to apply and stayed on my teeth for the full 30 minutes without moving or slipping at all. They were very comfortable and after two or three days, you become used to it that you don&#x27;t even feel them any more. The taste of the gel on the strips was not bad at all and the strips were very easy to take off. The residue left on the teeth was not bothersome at all and easy to wipe off. Also, my gums and teeth DID NOT become sensitive after using this product, which I was very happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that I wish the lower teeth strips were a bit longer; they only covered 4 of my lower teeth. However, I&#x27;ll probably be buying these again soon and switching around the upper teeth/lower teeth strips whiten the rest of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I used to use the original Crest Whitestrips but they slid off as soon as some saliva came into contact with them. It was almost impossible to keep it on and achieve the results. With these, the Advanced Seal Whitestrips, Crest has finally created a formula that allows a much stronger bond between the strip and the teeth it comes into contact with. Saliva is seemingly no longer an issue. For me, this is worth the extra money compared to the basic Whitestrips. Another bonus with these is that they only need thirty minutes a day.</li>
    <li> Yes, these adhere to your teeth better, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit smoking this year and decided to spring for a whitening kit.  I paid $40 for the&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Vivid kit and found that the strip for the lower teeth was only half as long as&lt;br /&gt;the bottom strips in the older packages.  Which leaves a tooth or two on each side&lt;br /&gt;of my smile not getting whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sprung for the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; kit as it advertises a \\&quot;New Improved Bottom Strip!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that you have to pay $10 extra for something that should have been included in&lt;br /&gt;all the kits in the first place, as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Professional kit also states that you will start seeing results in 3 days.  I am on day&lt;br /&gt;5 and have seen no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the older kits, messy, goopy strips and all, I always saw noticeable results&lt;br /&gt;after ONE USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in you, Crest!!</li>
    <li> These seem to work well.  My teeth are now pretty white.  They do make my teeth hurt but Sensodyne toothpaste helps with that.</li>
    <li> The bottom strip is way too small; it only covers your first 6 teeth. Unless you want some of your visible teeth whiter than others, i&#x27;d stick with the classic strips. I can&#x27;t understand why they would make the strips like this; i&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t have teeth much bigger than most people. These new strips do stick to the teeth much better than the classics, but sticking was never much of a problem with the classics anyway, as long as you didn&#x27;t do anything too active for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> The strips for the bottom row of the teeth are way too small. It would only cover like 5 teeth for me and i have really small teeth. Its also pretty difficult to get off once the 30 minutes are up</li>
    <li> I have two crowns in the front that are over 30 years old.  The surrounding natural teeth have become darker than the crowns so I thought this would lighten them up to match or come close.  Although it did lighten them somewhat, not enough to match.  I&#x27;d say these lighten maybe two shades.  That isn&#x27;t substantial for the cost of these.  It says you get the same results as a dentist&#x27;s whitening?  Not a chance.</li>
    <li> If u feel sensitivity during first use- quickly remove strips , and will do your second time after 2 days...and u will not have any sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Do your whitenning on durty teeth, for ex:after meal. After 30 min of whitenning go brudh your teeth with sensodine gentle whitenning tooth past. Treatment 14 days. But don&#x27;t drink red wine, try to avoid tomatoes. If u drink coffe like me. U should do once a week whitenning for 30 min, after main 14days treatment.&lt;br /&gt;In my case so far so perfect. I started whitenning my teeth during invisalign treatment, so when I removed my invisalign I had white smile!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these strips before and they certainly work.  I&#x27;ve just received my second box and can tell a noticeable change after only 3 days.  These are very adhesive and you certainly don&#x27;t need to worry about these sliding off of your teeth like many other strips.  My teeth have been a bit sensitive though.</li>
    <li> It gives me the pearly whites that make me successful.</li>
    <li> one of the best products for weitining i have ever used. very easy to apply and remove, i feel comfortable while using it. the results are shown within 2 days of usage. except for the teeth sensitivity, which is by the way expected with any weightning product, the best whitining i used :) love it love it love it :) :) :)</li>
    <li> It claims to have 28 counts. But actually, there are only 14 treatments because each time you need to use 2 counts! (up and down teeth). I think it a cheating because nowhere does anyone tell customers they can only use 14 times. I am very surprised when I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be honest with the product, Amazon and Crest.</li>
    <li> execelent product I&#x27;m happy with the results and with vendors, the time of receiving the product was within the deadline given by them, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes, they work! I had very yellow teeth,used to strips &amp; I definitely see the difference. Not white, but after just two treatments in 2 days, I am going to continue using the product, even though my bottom teeth are aching/sensitive.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get noticable results at all, I&#x27;m going back to my Crest Premium White Strips, they worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is a great, simple tooth whitener. It worked as promised within 3 uses. The only drawback was there was some sensitivity, but it went away within hours. My teeth are shades whiter and I would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Strips stick to teeth TOO much. Very difficult to remove. Its like a gooy glue so strips dont come off in one piece. Really have to brush gluey residue off teeth afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love these whitening strips..keeps my teeth very white..I only use about 3 a month..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The strips cover just the right number of teeth. I tried a suggestion I read online- drying my teeth with a paper towel before applying the strips- and it definitely made them stick better. With this method the strips held on firmly for 30 minutes and felt less noticible in my mouth, but they were still easy to remove. The strips didn&#x27;t give me any tooth sensitivity, even though other whitening products have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I saw quite a difference in the first 3-4 days- my yellow stains (from 10 years of drinking coffee...) were almost completely gone. My teeth weren&#x27;t super bright white like a movie star&#x27;s, just pearly- a nice normal healthy tooth color. Since the results were much less noticable after that, and I was happy with how my teeth looked, I decided to save the second half of the pack for a touch-up a few months from now.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good buy at Amazon&#x27;s price- these things are $45 at Duane Reade here in New York!</li>
    <li> Ordered the strips for me and my fiancee based on all the good reviews.  Since, we were both using the same 14day supply box, we only were able to use half the box.  The results from just half a box meet my expectations and my fiancees.  Her teeth look movie star white, so I really don&#x27;t think she needs the full 14 days, although I think I could use a couple more days to maybe get a shade or two lighter on a few hard to reach teeth.  The advance seal works very well for adhering to those problem teeth that may not be perfectly inline with the adjacent teeth.  Just push the strip onto any teeth not perfectly in line and the strip will stay sealed to contour over the adjacent teeth.  Amazon&#x27;s price was perfect and 2 day shipping got it to my door in 1 day.</li>
    <li> my husband and i used these as directed and they worked for both of us. even after 3-4 days we could see results. it is nice not worrying so much about my teeth! i recall reading that it should be used another time within a year to keep the teeth white - and i will definitely use it again when the time comes!</li>
    <li> Great product, teeth get noticealby whiter and cheapest to buy on here! Very happy!</li>
    <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter so these strips did their job. Don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll stay this way but I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about every OTC tooth whitener except for the light kind.  I much prefer them over the ProStrips.  They fit better and work better.  My teeth are not sensitive so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These go on SUPER tight. They are like glued tight to your teeth. They don&#x27;t move and they don&#x27;t make your mouth water. (Didn&#x27;t mine!) They stay in place very well. You can talk very well with them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wear them 30 minutes at a time, but then like, the VERY first time I used them, my teeth were WHITE like I&#x27;d been using the white strips twice a day for a week!&lt;br /&gt;To me they are just MUCH, much better and more effective.  In the first treatment they accomplished more than I did using any other product every day for a week.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good price, great product (definitely way easier to wear compared to the previous Whitestrips I had)... what else? :D</li>
    <li> This is the third whitening product I&#x27;ve tried (others had similar \\&quot;meh\\&quot; results, unfortunately). The seal as advertised, is GREAT! But, my teeth didn&#x27;t whiten that much. Maaaaaybe they are a little whiter. I don&#x27;t think anyone other than myself would notice though. When I talked to my dental hygienist she said that my teeth are already pretty white so it probably just doesn&#x27;t work as drastically. So overall, it&#x27;s very easy to use, seal is great, but minimal (if any) whitening for me.</li>
    <li> Really works, don&#x27;t give up on it. Take a few times to see results.</li>
    <li> i went through nearly half the box and the results don&#x27;t show at all, instead the stripes leave little white stains on my teeth and take almost a week to go away</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I smoke, drink red wine and drink tea. I use whitening tooth paste (not any one in particular) daily. I am a religious whitening strip user every 6 months. People used to always tell me that I had beautiful teeth but since I started using these, the compliments are unbelievable. I was even told that my teeth are movie star white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are very easy to put on. I start in the front so that I can push the strips into every nook and cranny of the teeth. I then work my way to the back, then fold the bottom under, making sure to again push the strips into every section. It sounds like alot but it only takes about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay on so great! I usually keep them on while I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning, so I end up leaving then on about 30-40 minutes. They can be a bit messy when taking them off but having a tissue handy will solve that. I like to rinse with mouthwash after removing them to get any excess gel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were only sensitive one time. I fell asleep with them on for about 4 hours. My teeth were sensitive for about 24 hours but were completely back to normal afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have used many different kinds/types of whitening and these have worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Once a day (as opposed to twice for most products) for 30 minutes (sometimes I extend this out a little bit, which is probably not recommended)&lt;br /&gt;-They stay on your teeth VERY well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Tooth Sensitivity, but this has come with every whitening product I have used.  Therefore, I usually do 30-60 minutes 1 day, take a day off, and repeat.  This cycle has worked the best for me sensitivity-wise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-These stay on your teeth like cement, which is not a con but you should be aware.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, a great product--they definitely work well!</li>
    <li> This product is as good as having it done at the clinic , the only reason i am giving it four stars is that i have to space out my usage as it is too harsh on my gum and teeth , it made my teeth hurt when i used two in a row within two days however when i used it once a week it was fine. Good job Crest:)</li>
    <li> It actually works in the time described.</li>
    <li> good to great it works fine, a little bit hard to remove, but you will have a white smile. I can recommend this product</li>
    <li> So, I use these while I do my work-out each day and they are kinda stick and gross to pull of and whatnot, but they did work very well! I was super impressed when I used them only once to try them out and saw results the next day. Definitely worth the buy :D</li>
    <li> made my teeth cry. Unbearable pain after 2nd use, on the 3rd time I had to take them off right away because my teeth started painfully pulsating. Noticed some difference in teeth color tho, but not worth all the pain. Gonna go back to activated charcoal and soda whitening</li>
    <li> Price is excellent comparing with other stores. Love the product and how my teeth look, easy to use. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, Works well, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The company supplying the 3d white strips was great. They came early and in perfect condition. Crest however has let me down more than once. Frequently the strips do not have the whitening agent on the strips. They peel off and are just plain wimpy plastic on both sides. Also this particular item has a smaller than normal bottom strip. I would recommend buying one of the other types that have the full bottom strip. And notify the company if you get strips without the whitening agent on them. Crest needs to be held responsible. I haven&#x27;t contacted them yet, but will, if they don&#x27;t contact me after seeing this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips about 5-6 years ago when they were pretty new and they worked fabulous! My teeth were so white they would glow in a black light and I loved it. Now that its been a while (about 5 years) since I&#x27;ve used them I realized my teeth weren&#x27;t very white anymore and I was no longer getting any compliments, so I knew it was time to do them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night was day 5 of using the new 3D ones and there was no change at all except for my gums hurting so much!  I was thinking omg maybe I&#x27;ve ruined my teeth cuz they were so white before and they can&#x27;t get white again. So I did some research and apparently the new 3D ones aren&#x27;t working for many people.  I actually had a few extra old ones left over, so today I put the old ones (from a couple years ago) on just to see if they would make a difference.  HOLY CRAP! They instantly turned my teeth whiter and they even cover most of my smile where as the new 3D ones only cover like 4 teeth.  So overall, these new 3d ones suck and do not work.. try and find the older ones!</li>
    <li> I used according to directions. It worked wonderful.Teeth are a lot brighter. I love to smile now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks You ,Crest 3D Advanced Whitestrips,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used some Crest whitestrips a few years ago and was pretty pleased with the results, so I decided to buy these when they were on sale to see how my teeth would turn out. Fortunately, they looked great after just a few days of use! My teeth ended up looking very, and naturally, white after using all the strips. I got many compliments on my precious, precious teeth. My only complaint is that the directions say not to use more than two boxes a year, but I feel like my teeth&#x27;s whiteness has already started to fade a tad after a month of not using the strips.</li>
    <li> It never showed up. I waited over two weeks after it was suppose to be delivered in 2 days. Just very dissapointed. I was giving it as a gift. So I had to buy the product elsewhere in a pinch</li>
    <li> Your teeth will get sensitive to cold but it works!</li>
    <li> I saw the result within three days, but I stopped using it,as it makes my teeth senstive and I was not comfortable to carry on using it.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; timley delivery ... Thanks</li>
    <li> Received delivery on time and the product was packaged properly. I am always satisfied with Amazon.com. They never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> It saddens me to know that they dont make the original whitestrips. I had fantastic results from the original strips, so much that people asked if i had then professionally whitened... AND people told me my hubby and I should do toothpaste commercials... After using both this product and the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; (b/c it is cheaper) I didn&#x27;t get as good results.  And it is not b/c they  have been whitened before, it is that the product is not as good.  I am not at a loss and am going to have to resort to professional whitening b/c no other product pleases me.</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t as colour changing as i expected but still good value</li>
    <li> It splips a lot and I don&#x27;t think results last for a long time. After using 5 strips treatments, results vanished pretty quickly (I use it 1 in 3-4 days on average).</li>
    <li> These strips are simply awesome! I was opting to go with the one week treatment but I figured the two week would be all right and my goodness the difference I see in my teeth is simply amazing! I&#x27;ve been smiling with my teeth more often now that they&#x27;re whiter and these strips will definitely do the job! I recommend brushing in the morning when you wake up and then put the strips on (get more bang out of them) and as always brush regularly after eating!</li>
    <li> came without a box. how could i know, it is legit ?!?!? sent it back right away</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using Target Up &amp; Up Brand whitening strips for two weeks.  The Target brand did a good job, but I wanted to see if the name-brand would make my teeth whiter.  Here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if these made my teeth any whiter.  To be fair, the two weeks with the Target brand doing a good job made the comparison of &amp;#34;before Crest&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after Crest&amp;#34; harder to evaluate.  I do, however, think that the Crest strips were *working*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Crest strips were thicker and easier to put into my mouth.  This gave them more rigidity so that wrapping them around my teeth was easier.  Especially the Target bottom strip was so flexible that it sometimes got folded over and didn&#x27;t give a good fit.  If it *did* go in straight, the fit was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Target brand strips were much thinner and easier to remove.  I thought the Target strips stayed in place very well, but if you are concerned about the strips sliding, get the Crest ones.  They stick so well that they take a little work to remove them.  Not a problem, they just stick more completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Target top strip was a little smaller and the bottom strip was a littler larger.  I found that I liked the size of the Crest top strip and the Target bottom strip better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I found the Target strips hard to get out of the package.  The Crest strips came out of the package very easily.  In all fairness, my wife used the Target strips from a second box and did not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this is more than just a review of the Crest White Strips, but I was looking for this kind of review when I bought my first set.  I wanted to know if it was worth the extra cost for the brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it *could* be worth the extra cost due to the ease if inserting and the firm grip, but the smaller bottom strip that Crest provides concerns me a little.  I thought the size was borderline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommendation is to use these strips occasionally to keep the whiteness &amp;#34;touched up&amp;#34;.  I would say that if the Crest strips are not too much more expensive, I will probably buy them.  I got a very good price from Amazon for the Crest Strips so cost wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue.commendation is to use these strips occasionally to keep the whiteness &amp;#34;touched up&amp;#34;.

    <li> Not as well as I thought. Only slightly improved whiteness and after 14 packs! I called Crest and was advised to get the one time formula for $65 but that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on a one shot wonder. Crest needs to come out with more information on the differences between each formula. I read what they have online but it&#x27;s still confusing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous tooth bleaching products over the years.  None of the tooth pastes work.  Crest white strips were the best I&#x27;ve found, a fact confirmed by consumer reports recently.  However, I hated them because, as other reviewers have noted, the strips did not stick to teeth sufficiently and moved around or came off during treatment.  Having to fool with them constantly basically made it impossible to do anything else while the treatment was in progress.  These Advanced Seal strips totally solve that problem.  They adhere much better with a thicker stickier peroxide gel.  The lower strip is also shaped in a way that helps it stay in place -- the outer upper edges of the lower strip are trimmed so that they do not wrap over the molers.  This was where the worst of the dislocation occurred with the old strips.  With this new design the strips stay put, and the gel stays put, and the gel gets to work on the tooth.  Whitening follows.  Great!  While the strips are slightly harder to remove, its no big deal and well worth the benefit of having them stay where the are supposed to be for each 1/2 hour session.</li>
    <li> These strips work pretty well at whitening your teeth.  They go on fairly easy, adhering and molding to your teeth, and are comfortable.  I saw increased whitening for the first week, but it didn&#x27;t remove all stains and after one week I saw no further whitening.  I would use these for a week and then use them less often to re-whiten.  After a week has expired, I would use the remaining strips to maintain the whiteness for awhile.  If you drink a lot of cola, tea, or coffee, like I do, your teeth will quickly be re-stained.  Therefore, using a week&#x27;s worth of strips and then storing the rest to re-whiten your teeth later is probably the best way to use these.  The amount of whitening hits a wall after about a week.  At least it did for me...  These are relatively cheap though and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Strips stuck well to teeth but were not big enough to cover my bottom teeth very well.  Kind of disappointed!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve finally figured out this product so it is easy to use. The added adhesive means it will stay on. The results are good, and I&#x27;m hoping will improve with multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I was always put off by the old non-adhesive type white strip. So much so I just quit using them. These are so easy to use that I&#x27;ve used the whole box as directed. My teeth are whiter than they have been in many years. I also love that the top and bottom strips come in the same individual package rather than messing around with two for each. Much smarter product than before.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure these strips work. I mean, I felt the tingle in my teeth and around my gums. The strips have a weird glue-like taste. Why did I \\&quot;taste\\&quot; them? How could I not? They were in my mouth, on my gums and I would instantly start salivating when they were applied. My teeth are a little sensitive but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. I could actually see the difference, especially in pictures. One of my little vampire teeth actually became lighter in color. It was more noticeable in pictures. I plan on using these suckers every year or whatever the suggested time use is.</li>
    <li> Product is ok, results not great but ok.  But the price on amazon is good.  I would have been upset if I had paid the $44 they cost in the store.  For $44 I would&#x27;ve expected dramatic results!</li>
    <li> THEY WORK GREAT HALF WAY DONE WITH THEM AND I SEE A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE BUT THEY DO MAKE MY TEETH SENSITIVE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used the original Crest whitestrips and never thought they were worth the hassle.  They would slide around my teeth and not do that good of a job of whitening.  THIS, however, is a completely redesigned product.  They stick to your teeth so well that it&#x27;s actually a bit tough to take them off.  And this is a GOOD thing.  I also noticed that my teeth were whiter right after the very first treatment and overall I think I got a very good whitening experience after the 14 days.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll make longer strips soon for bigger teeth (like mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred the Crest whitening systems over the other brands, because they simply worked better, faster.  But YUCK!  That gross, slimy oozy strip was not fun to use.  Keeping it on 30 minutes was a chore - it doesn&#x27;t sound like it would be, but I really had trouble with the thing and would inevitably end up tongueing the thing off my top teeth and it would just slide off the bottoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Crest&#x27;s better mousetrap.  When they say sticky though, they mean sticky!  Be very careful not to apply this to a loose tooth.  The top strip came off very slowly and with some pulling, but left no real noticeable residue and for the most part, I didn&#x27;t have any problems playing with it for the half hour.  The bottom strip was another matter.  It was ill-fitting and not as \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; for some reason.  It bubbled up and I was constantly smoothing it back down.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a design flaw or my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw  some whitening in two days, significant whitening that people commented on in five and by the end of the 14, I felt the product had generally done what it said it would and felt I had much whiter and brighter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity is always an issue for me with these, and I enthusiastically recommend Crest Sensitivity Maximum Strength Soothing Whitening Mint (has a pink stripe on the silver tube) to go along with the White Strips.  It works fast, tastes great and rinses really clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the regular Crest Whitestrips in the past, but never managed to get through a whole box because they annoyed me. They slipped around a lot and tasted terrible.&lt;br /&gt;These, however, are a whole different story! They stay put. Really, they don&#x27;t move. As one reviewer noted, there is a lot of glue (or whatever the sticky stuff is)! But I can almost forget I&#x27;m wearing them, because they don&#x27;t move. They are more difficult to remove. I grab them with a tissue, and that helps hold them while I pull them off. A quick brush or rinse gets rid of any leftover gook. And there is less gook, I find, then I had with the old Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;I am on the last strip today (wearing while I write this!), and my teeth have started to feel sensitive. I started using Sensodyne a few days ago, and hopefully the sensitivity will fade (as stated in the Whitestrips directions).&lt;br /&gt;As for whitening, they did do the job. My teeth aren&#x27;t blinding, but they have certainly improved, and that&#x27;s good enough for me. One problem is that they don&#x27;t whiten between teeth, which can leave the crevices looking even more stained. I found that I could fix that problem to some extent by pushing the strip into those spots with my finger nail, kind of conforming the strip to all parts of the teeth, instead of just the front.&lt;br /&gt;Since a nice coupon was included, I will definately buy another box of these, although I&#x27;ll probably wait a month before I do another round of whitening.</li>
    <li> I had tried to use the original whitestrips before. However, I could not make it through the recommended 14 days because it kept moving around and I could taste the whitening formula on the tongue and was just overall irritating to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw these new ones and though I should give it a try. Here are what I thought were pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The most important thing is that they are a LOT better fitting than the old ones. They barely shifted around and pretty much stayed where they were. They were slightly difficult to take off the first time but I figured out that you had to grab a corner that might be slightly off of your teeth and remove it from there.&lt;br /&gt;- It did whiten my teeth a bit, although there were some tough stains that it could not get out. However, the overall cover is definitely whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The individually wrapped strips were a bit difficult to open. If you tear at it too quickly, you would need scissors to actually open the package. I think it is due to the fact that the notch is a bit far from the actual opening of the package. I learned to pull slowly when opening the individually wrapped strips.&lt;br /&gt;- While they stayed on my teeth, it was still annoying to have them in my teeth. It is definitely not as bad as the original ones but it constantly reminded me that I had the strips on my teeth when I did have it in.&lt;br /&gt;- Towards the end of the 14 days, a lot of the formula was ending on my teeth after I remove the strip. It did not do so earlier but it resulted in me having to rinse my mouth to get some of the gunk out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a vast improvement to the old whitestrips and it did what it said it would. I still see places for improvement. Another thing I noticed is that if you have larger upper teeth, it will probably not cover a lot of the back of the teeth. For me, the bottom one fit around the teeth fine but the upper strip did not even reach halfway to the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip when using these: try not to get it too close to the gumline. It can feel irritating. You are suppose to put it close to the gumline but try not to have too much of the gum covered in the strip.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip when using these: try not to get it too close to the gumline.

    <li> As a person that consumes large amounts of coffee and tea, keeping my teeth white has been an ongoing struggle that has prompted me to buy just about every whitening product available.  Every time Crest comes out with a new Whitestrips product I give it a try.  Many have been disappointing, and all have proven to be a somewhat unpleasant chore to use.  Now I understand that doing something to make your teeth whiter is worth some time and effort, but using the Crest Whitestrips is usually a messy, uncomfortable process that I have always dreaded.  Still, I have always been able to get noticeable results so I continue to use them nonetheless.  Until recently I was getting the best results from using the Crest Whitestrips Pro Effects 10-day System.  However, those strips still tended to slide around on my teeth and required that I keep my mouth closed for the entire treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In February I was given the opportunity to try the new Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips kit.  It is certainly a big improvement over the other Whitestrips products.  The Advanced Seal kit only requires a 30 minute treatment once a day, whereas the rest of the Whitestrips product line requires two 30 minute treatments each day.  The entire kit lasts for 14 days, but it promises that you will see results within 3 days.  The kit contains 14 packets, each packet containing an upper and lower whitening strip.  Each strip is coated with a peroxide-infused gel, which is claimed to mold and adhere to teeth better that any previous Whitestrips product.  Crest also notes that this product will only work on natural teeth, and will NOT whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings, or dentures.  These Whitestrips should not be used by anyone under the age of 12, and should not be used on teeth with braces.  Crest even claims that you can drink water while whitening your teeth with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the 3-step method for using this product (taken directly from the Crest website):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Peel:&lt;br /&gt;- For best results, do not brush teeth immediately before applying strips.&lt;br /&gt;- Open foil pouch and remove.&lt;br /&gt;- Peel strips from backing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply:&lt;br /&gt;- Apply gel side of strip to teeth. It will instantly mold and adhere to teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- Align strips with gum line and press gently for good contact.&lt;br /&gt;- Fold the rest of strip behind teeth to keep in place.&lt;br /&gt;3. Reveal:&lt;br /&gt;- Wear strips for 30 minutes once a day, remove and discard.&lt;br /&gt;- Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal comes off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this kit for the full 14 days, here is what I have personally experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the claim by Crest that these strips hold much better to your teeth is true.  In fact, when trying to remove these strips some may feel that they hold TOO good.  I have found that removing them can be a somewhat difficult and messy task.  After being in your mouth for 30 minutes the strips are rather slimy and slippery, so I have learned to pull one end loose and then use a tissue to pull the strip off my teeth.  You really have to tug pretty hard in order to get these strips off from your teeth!  Second, the strips still leave some unpleasant residue on your teeth, so you will want to make sure to brush right after removing the strips.  Third, the strips are still a little bit of a pain to apply.  It&#x27;s hard to fold them over your teeth without getting creases in them.  But, the fact that they hold strong is a great thing.  They hold on tight for the full 30 minutes, and therefore don&#x27;t slide around on your teeth like the previous Whitestrips did.  I don&#x27;t experience the excessive amount of saliva generated by the previous Whitestrips products either.  Although some folks do experience a mild amount of increased sensitivity after repeated use of this product, I was able to complete the full 14 treatments (without skipping a day) without any discomfort whatsoever.  These Advanced Seal Whitestrips are a great improvement in design, and they are ultimately much easier to use.  I definitely notice that my teeth appear whiter within 2 to 3 treatments, and by the end of the 14-day treatment my teeth looked wonderfully bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the improved design and excellent results provided by the Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips product.  They&#x27;re not completely perfect, and they are still a bit of a chore to apply, use, and remove.  But when all is said and done these strips are definitely the best effort produced by Crest yet.  If you are looking for whiter, brighter teeth, and don&#x27;t mind a 30 (35 minutes including removal and brushing afterward) minute inconvenience for 14 days, I highly recommend the Advanced Seal Whitestrips system from Crest.  Shop around though, because they can be found much cheaper on the Internet than in local retail stores.  I have found them nearly twenty dollars cheaper on sites like Amazon than what they sell for in brick and mortar stores.  In these tough economic times it is always good to save a few bucks whenever possible.  After all, paying more for the same product is not going to get your teeth any whiter.  &#x3D;o), and they are ultimately much easier to use.

    <li> Crest white strips are the best way to keep your teeth white.  If you have reasonably white teeth to begin, then use them.  If you don&#x27;t go to your dentist.  This latest product stays on your teeth (you actually have to pry them off!).  You might have to break into your IRA to buy them, but try to find a coupon first.</li>
    <li> +Whitens like it says, I definitely saw improvement.&lt;br /&gt;+Fits good on the teeth&lt;br /&gt;+30 minutes once a day, easy&lt;br /&gt;-Causes temporary teeth sensitivity, but all of these types of products do that.</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticably whiter after I used these! Great product, and about $12 dollars cheaper than in stores!</li>
    <li> After 10 days of use, I see no shade difference at all.  I know this because I have a ceramic filling on the front of a front tooth - and the teeth around them look no different from the filling.  Very disappointing, as I would expect at least some positive results - at the cost of these so-called \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; strips.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> I really like the new advanced seal feature of these whitestrips. (Unlike other customers, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble pulling them off when I was done using them.) However, I&#x27;m not convinced that these whitestrips work as well as the classics. Granted, it has been a few years since I used the classics - possibly my teeth have somehow become more resistant to whitestrips than they once were. But I know that in the past, I have noticed a significant difference after using whitestrips, and after using this advanced seal box, I barely notice a difference at all.</li>
    <li> I used as directed and took a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photo. After I completed the 14 days, I did not see a difference.</li>
    <li> Works great!!! I use these every once in awhile to whiten teeth, it always seems to brighten my smile and makes me feel good!!</li>
    <li> These whitestrips did very well for the first three days. After the first three days through, they do not really get any whiter. The strips do fit fine although pulling them off is somewhat weird feeling. They are very comfortable. My only complaint would be is that the bottom strip only covers like 6 teeth.</li>
    <li> I used the classic Whitestrips in high school (5 years ago). One night I accidentally fell asleep with them on and had terrible sensitivity after that. I just recently tried the 3D white ones and love them. I still have some mild sensitivity but the results are lovely</li>
    <li> These strips do indeed work as claimed to noticeably bleach out stains from teeth. The taste is not unpleasant and having the strips plastered on the teeth for thirty minutes is tolerable. Sometimes they didn&#x27;t stay in place the full half hour and slid around. My tongue was not very happy about them being there and couldn&#x27;t sit still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a coffee and tea drinker and they certainly did make my teeth look cleaner and lighter, although my teeth are not very white naturally. This product is intended to restore your natural tooth color by removing stains and will not turn naturally ivory or yellow teeth a bright white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was noticeably increased sensitivity especially at some exposed roots. If you have sensitive teeth or exposed roots you may want to talk to your dentist about teeth whitening options before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideal user of this product is someone who has teeth that aren&#x27;t sensitive but who has stains from drinking coffee or tea or from tobacco or other products like betel nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two cautions: you are NOT supposed to brush your teeth before using the strips and you should wash your hands well after handling them. Read the instructions and precautions carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (with likely reason for inclusion in product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (solvent, allows dilution)&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (humectant--provides moisture, affects viscosity)&lt;br /&gt;Hydrogen Peroxide (whitener)&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer (controls consistency of solution)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Hydroxide (lye, used to control pH)&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Saccharin (artificial sweetener)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PVP and PEG-8 are listed as ingredients on some pages here on Amazon but not on the actual box of strips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PVP (emulsifier--keeps particles in solution)&lt;br /&gt;PEG-8 (humectant, solvent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free box of 10 pouches through Amazon Vine to review.</li>
    <li> The crest 3D white strips impressed me a lot. I was quite skeptical until I tried them and I am so glad I did! Within the first 3 days I noticed a change but not as much as by the 5th day. Instead of using them for only a half hour each day I wore them an hour. According to my dentist the ingredients on the strips are good for an hour to an hour and a half...not just a half hour:) I love these and am very glad I got them.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s a great deal at a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought these to whiten my teeth before my wedding, and I&#x27;ll admit I was a little bit skeptical. But sure enough, within two days I started seeing amazing results and am extremely pleased at the end of my two week process. Though it takes 30 mins a day, that is a small amount of time to put aside to have a beautiful smile. I will continue using these strips to keep my smile looking the best it can possibly look!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I ordered a &amp;#34;2 pack&amp;#34; and only received one box. That was disappointing.</li>
    <li> Stopped using after a few days as teeth / gums became very irritated. Wouldn&#x27;t use again</li>
    <li> What happened to the lower strip design? It only covers six of the bottom teeth, so what happens to the other two very visible teeth....they are a different shade. Not pretty! I have bought these previously and the strip was longer and not this funky shape that slips around. The product itself works and it does brighten your smile, but the person who allowed for this bottom strip design must have had only had six bottom teeth!</li>
    <li> These strips work just as well as the classic crest premium whitestrips I&#x27;ve used before. However, these stay on much better which is great. My teeth were much whiter in 3 days. Only thing I would like to see improved is the width of the strips to reach another tooth or 2 on each side. Otherwise great value.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, not on teeth for a prolonged period. seems to produce quick results even without using the entire product</li>
    <li> be aware of this product!  after only ONE use, my teeth didn&#x27;t get any whiter, the only thing I got is HURT!!!! It&#x27;s not even sensitive, it&#x27;s serious hurt!!!!! for hours and days!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER EVER touch it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these often from Amazon and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  Same quality, packaging, etc. as stores for a much much more reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! Saw results the very first time! And the shipping was super quick, for sure recommend.</li>
    <li> I do not like it because the product did not work. I do not blame it on the salesperson but the product did not work for me. The product came on time. I hate that the gel is sticky and it wasted my time. When it say 28 its really 14.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me. I took pictures to compare, and there&#x27;s a slight difference in coloration, if I really look. But there&#x27;s nothing noticeable. I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a movie star white smile - just noticeably brighter teeth. I drink coffee everyday, and I wanted to life some of that discoloration. It was a waste of $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, the strips stuck to my teeth much better than the old style. It was a bit hard to peel them off, actually. The bottom strip was too small, as some other people have commented.</li>
    <li> Works well in between dentist cleanings!</li>
    <li> My wife keeps telling me how white my teeth are. This product has worked better than the other two I tried before. Saw a big difference after 3 applications.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a real white result then this will work. It will only turn the color of your teeth 2 or maybe 3 shades lighter. If you&#x27;re looking for a bright smile or shiny white smile I&#x27;d save your money and go to a dentist for whitening.</li>
    <li> I used these every day for two weeks, sometimes for longer than the advised 30 minutes. I found them quite good, with a definite whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Visible whitening after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to understand, apply and use.&lt;br /&gt;-Unobtrusive (you can still talk or even have a sip of water around them).&lt;br /&gt;-No weird taste, just nice fresh mint.&lt;br /&gt;-Strips stayed firmly on teeth (no slippage) while wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Whitening seemed to slow down after the initial noticeable effects.&lt;br /&gt;-A little hard to remove (after the first couple of rounds, this was fine though).&lt;br /&gt;-My gums got a little sensitive towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;-Bottom strip could have been bigger, to cover teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;-A small mark to show the middle of the strip would have helped when lining it up to apply.&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging was excessive. A lot of cardboard could be spared with a smaller box design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two cons are just suggestions, really. You&#x27;ll get by without them. The biggest con for me was when the whitening seemed to reach its limit, but I still had several days to go, and not much was happening. That said, I&#x27;m very happy with my inexpensive, 14-day whitening treatment, and I&#x27;m attempting to maintain it somewhat by using the Crest toothpaste that complements these whitestrips.</li>
    <li> These work!!! Coffee stains are depleting day by day.</li>
    <li> Usually wear one when I watch tv at night. Only use it about 1x a week and it keeps my teeth looking fairly good - when I go for 2 nights in a row I really see a difference.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK. I REPEAT. ZERO AFFECT. I used these 30-35 minutes a day, 14 days in a row, exactly as directed, and my teeth are exactly the same as when they started.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!!!! WORST PRODUCT EVER!!! DO NOT BUY!!! Got a complimentary strip with a tube of toothpaste I bought. Using it wasn&#x27;t the painful part. Its two hours later when my jaw swelled and gums started bleeding that I started taking Tylenol maximum strength. I had to use Orajel severe pain just to stop crying from the pain. When I applied the strips I didn&#x27;t even put them on my gums! I PURPOSEFULLY PLACED THEM BELOW my gums just to be careful!!!  My teeth have been extremely sensitive. I cant eat or drink anything!!! I had less pain with braces!!!!  DO NOT BUY!! save yourself the pain and buy a Groupon to get it professionally done by your dentist!! Posted about pain online and SEVERAL of my friends and family had similar experiences, this isn&#x27;t just a one time thing, several people were severely in pain from this product!!!</li>
    <li> Saw a noticeable difference from the use of this product.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and does a wonderful job. crestwhitestrips gets better and better.</li>
    <li> These strips worked great!  In just three days, I noticed a big difference in my teeth. The coffee stains just melted away. I finished the 14 day regimen, and am very pleased with the results. It is just as effective as those expensive whitening treatments that the dentist does. If I need to do it again in 6 months, I will.</li>
    <li> Great product and saw results within a couple of days. These products hurts some peoples teeth after uses, but don&#x27;t worry! Incrementally reduce the amount of time you leave the strips on until they do not hurt your teeth anymore. Its a great product and I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The new Crest Advanced seal does what it says on the box.  It adheres better than the regular whitestrips.  If you have had trouble in the past with the regular whitestrips, make sure you dry the surface your teeth with a tissue or towel before trying to adhere.  If you had no problem in the past with the regulars, these may get a little stuck on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemically these are the same as other tooth whitening systems and if you are sensitive to Rembrant, GoSmile and others you will be sensitive to this product.  I would reccomend trying Supersmile toothpaste (skip the accelerator/activator tube) instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product does:&lt;br /&gt;* Convenient alternative to other products which require bathroom-sink time of 20mins+&lt;br /&gt;* Quick &amp; affordable alternative to mail-in custom mold type systems.&lt;br /&gt;* Discreet enough to be brought onto vacations and other trips&lt;br /&gt;* Maintenance/upkeep of whiter teeth between dentist visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product does *not* do:&lt;br /&gt;* Substitute for professional whitening at your dentist&#x27;s office&lt;br /&gt;* Will not effectively erase coffee/tea/wine/berry stains (other systems are better). Ineffective on nicotine stains.&lt;br /&gt;* If you do not have straight incisors then this product will not adhere as well to your teeth or work as well.&lt;br /&gt;* Depending on the size of your mouth &amp; teeth, these strips may be either too long or too short.  Obviously if it&#x27;s too long, then just cut it, but if too short then the front few will be whiter and the side tooth or two will look unslightly yellow compared to the front few....&lt;br /&gt;* This product *cannot* make your teeth whiter than they can naturally be.</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference.  I have used teeth whiteners before being that I am an avid coffee and tea drinker.  I have tried everything from teeth trays to brush-on whiting gel.  I can honestly say this is the best whitestrips available today.  As advertised, the advanced adhesive keeps the strips in place and you are even able to drink fluids while waiting the 30 minute processing time.  I definitely notice a difference just after 3 days.  I even had co-workers comment on how white my teeth looked.  They were easy to apply but removing them takes a little effort since the adhesive holds them in place so well.  You will have some residue after removing them but it can easily be removed if you rinse or brush your teeth afterward.  This is a 14-day supply but you can cut the time in half and use the strips twice a day for faster results as directed. Keep in mind that these strips are not for everyone.  My husband tried to use them but his teeth became extremely sensitive after just one use. I did not have any sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> These are just like the original white strips in terms of how they work. Except they say to use these once a day for 14 days instead of twice a day for 7 days; although it says that you can use them twice a day. They are much thicker than regular white strips and go on your teeth like how I would imagine duct tape would stick to teeth. Because the white strips are so thick they do not bend around your teeth well. That is my only gripe. But to me the best part of them is you aren&#x27;t left with a mouthful of the whitening goop when you are done as with regular white strips.</li>
    <li> I will openly admit that I have forgetten to use these with any consistency so I can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness of the whitening though I did notice a difference when I used it for three days in a row.  What I am throughly impressed with is how much better these are compared to similar products as far as being MUCH less of a mess.  You truly can use them anywhere and not have to brush all the gunk leftover off your teeth after you are done.  Major plus in my book!  The only problem I did have with the product is the size of the strip for the bottom teeth.  Maybe I just have a big smile but it definitely does not cover many of my bottom teeth or the teeth that are &#x27;exposed&#x27; when I smile.  I would purchase these again purely based on the ease of use and the lack of nasty residue most teeth whitening products leave behind.</li>
    <li> Package was brand new in box in plastic not tampered with. I have tried them before and absolutely love them. They do brighten your teeth but be aware of the sensitivity that follows.</li>
    <li> something was wrong with these?  did not whiten as they usually do???  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> I have healthy teeth but they&#x27;re not as white as I&#x27;d like them to be.  I use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash and decided to add the whitestrips.  They worked fine for the first 2 days.  There was some irritation which i expected; I mean I was putting chemicals in my mouth, it was probably going to irritate it.  I thought I could tolerate it, though, for the 2 weeks.  But by the third day I noticed my throat was hurting and I was coughing while I had them on my teeth, so I took them of after only 15 minutes.  The fourth day I took them off almost immediately after getting them on because I was having trouble breathing and it burned my throat to swallow even just my spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had a really, really, reallllly hard time getting them to stick to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate it, they will whiten your teeth though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people had trouble and went to the dentist who told them the trouble was because of using the whitestrips...my dentist&#x27;s office recommended them to me...</li>
    <li> This product works! I am happy with results and will reorder. Others I know who have used it also like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product has worked to my expectations, and I consider it to be a great value. There is an acceptable tradeoff between results/hassle and the money spent. I suppose I could have spent an hour in the dentist&#x27;s chair for this, but I found this to be more worth my time and money. That being said, knowing that my teeth CAN be whitened may incline me to visit a dentist&#x27;s chair in the future. As far as this product working as described, I give it a 5-star for value and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Arrived prompt and good product.</li>
    <li> Did not notice much of a difference after using these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real Crest product, and the product works pretty well though they do make my teeth sensitive to the cold. But that only lasts for the day after I use the product, and a small price to pay for a white smile!</li>
    <li> great product--use 3 times a year to keep my teeth looking whiter</li>
    <li> the chrest white strips worked great. better then any expatations that i had for them. would def use them again.</li>
    <li> Purchased these whitening strips just to give my teeth a boost. I followed the instructions to the letter and only left them on for 30 minutes.  I have sensitive teeth and the strips did cause extra sensitivity so I used them every other day, I had some sensitivity to hot and cold but overall I have to say that they do work, they just give your teeth an extra whiteness, its subtle but good.  I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> They do the job.  They whiten your teeth but only parts of them.  It seems to miss a lot of spots towards the top of the teeth and doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten the bottom teeth very well.  It starts by whitening only a portion at a time and at first you&#x27;re teeth will seem splotchy and some parts will be white and others will not, but by the end of the treatment, it evens out. Sticks veryyyyyyy well.</li>
    <li> Great price and good results,easy to use strips didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity in my gums or teeth just some tingleing. Hey they work if used as directed. One suggestion don&#x27;t over brush your teeth before or after using white strips.</li>
    <li> They work well. They are less expensive by far then the local grocery store or say a Walmart.  You see the results pretty quickly too.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee and red wine, and I used to smoke, so my teeth were fairly yellow to start. I&#x27;ve never used a whitening product before. I used this product as directed for 2 weeks and my teeth are much whiter! People who did not know I was using white strips have commented on how much brighter and whiter my teeth look. :) The strips are easy to apply and easy to remove; you can still talk while they are on your teeth, though you might sound a little muffled. I just wear mine while working out in the evening or while in the shower. They leave a sticky residue on the teeth that must be brushed off, but it&#x27;s really no big deal. For the first week, my gums were a little sensitive, but that went away on its own. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> These strips stick to my teeth great!  So much better than the original crest whitening strips.  I think that they are about the same effectiveness as the other crest white stips.  My teeth are already pretty white, so I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference.  I deffinately prefer these to the others that I&#x27;ve tried, although I&#x27;m still looking for that \\&quot;miricle\\&quot; product that can get my teeth as white as I think they could be.  These strips didn&#x27;t seem to make my teeth sensitive like other ones that I&#x27;ve used.  All in all, good product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Plus side no sensitivity due to it.</li>
    <li> I just wanted my teeth a little lighter and that is what happened. It is a subtle change but I can notice it.&lt;br /&gt;This product was easy to use and wear. The strips stayed on the time needed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works and the results last a while. Be sure to use whitening tooth paste as well. And complete the entire package.</li>
    <li> I truly do think this works.  My teeth are much whiter but my problem is that it burns my gums and I can&#x27;t keep doing it past day 5.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the % of the bleaching agent but figured I&#x27;d try them. They adhere to the teeth very well. Found out only 9%, as opposed to much higher % in the gel used for trays.  Wouldn&#x27;t  have purchased had I know this. Not enough return for the effort and time it takes to see minimal results</li>
    <li> My teeth were a nice shade of white to begin with, after two uses following the steps very closely my teeth began to yellow.  I don&#x27;t know if the product is old or what but I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these Crest Whitestrips.  I used to used the original ones when they came out several years ago.  They slid around on your teeth, tasted so bad I wanted to throw up, and were painful to my sensitive teeth.  I swore them off, but now that I working mornings instead of nights, I&#x27;ve been downing coffee like it&#x27;s going out of style, and so my teeth became a disgusting yellowy color.  I have been using these for a little over a week and notice a serious difference.  My teeth aren&#x27;t pearly movie star white or anything, but they aren&#x27;t yellow and dingy anymore.  They probably are about 3-4 shades whiter than they were originally, after only a week!  I just bought the 3D advanced toothpaste yesterday so hoping to have a respectable shade of white soon, and it looks like I won&#x27;t have to wait long.  These are far less painful for me (only had one or two sharp pangs, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to them).  They stay in place really really really!! well and I only talk a little funny when I have them in.  I only subtracted one star because they still taste a little funky and they are rather pricey.  Also, I wish the bottom strip was a little longer, but these are all minor qualms.</li>
    <li> Seem to work fine if you follow the directions</li>
    <li> These work great! You should see results after just a few uses!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products and was really disappointed in the results...messy gels, taste of product, etc.  But the Crest Advanced Seal strips are AWESOME, all around, and completely different from all the competition.  They adhere to your teeth wonderfully, there is no noticeable taste that I can discern; and there is no messy gelish gross stuff that your teeth are sloshing around in.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they are the best whitening product you can use short of an actual dentist!  I have no issue getting them on my teeth or removing them, and the great part about how well they adhere for me is because my teeth are not perfectly straight, but because they adhere so well, I can sort of detail them to my teeth, for an even whitening job.  And about the actual whitening ~ I thought the results was VERY noticeable!  Unlike the suggestion on the box, I preferred to brush my teeth just prior to putting them on...I&#x27;m not sure why they suggest you don&#x27;t, but it bugged me personally, and I don&#x27;t think it negatively effected my outcome because my teeth look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these whitening strips!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work but after a few times my teeth started to ache unbearably so I stopped.. maybe I&#x27;ll give it a try again one day but for now I think I&#x27;ll pass on the pain</li>
    <li> This product does whiten the teeth almost immediately but beware it weakens tooth enamel when used regulary.</li>
    <li> I tried a couple of other products that really had no affect on removing the stains on my teeth.  I have not made an effort to whiten my teeth in many years and knew this would be more difficult now.  I saw whitening after two days and I am very satisfied with this product.  I will purchase it again and use it to keep my teeth white on an ongoing basis.  Now I won&#x27;t be so hesitant to drink the coffees and teas I love.</li>
    <li> These strips don&#x27;t adhere as well as other Crest Whitestrips I&#x27;ve tried. They move around my top and bottom teeth very easily. I don&#x27;t think they whiten any better than the other strips either. I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly! I saw improvement in just the first use, by the third my teeth were whitened to a whole new color. Only colors teeth visible when you smile. Comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> good product it worked with me ..</li>
    <li> Whitens as it should. I don&#x27;t actually go through the entire set of days, I use one every few days or so. Otherwise, my teeth and gums get a little sensitive.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the result , i finished one box and really happy ,&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and i saw a change after the third time of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product !</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the fact that the strips did indeed whiten my teeth! It is a two week kit and I started seeing results after about four days. What I did not like was the strip for your bottom teeth is very limited in the space it covers. I would of liked more coverage for my bottom teeth. The stops stuck to my teeth easily and didn&#x27;t slip or begin falling off towards the end of 30 minutes. They stuck on and peel off like they are really stuck. I got a great deal on these strips through Amazon but I would never pay full retail for this brand in the store. My teeth still have the results after a week of the kit being gone but I would suggest while using the strips that one should stop drinking stain enabling liquids (coffee,soda, tea, etc.) those liquids make it difficult to see the results you want! If these are a great price, this product is worth getting.</li>
    <li> Very good product!  I had to get my too top front teeth vaneered because I had some cracks, and the dentist told me she had to go to her whitest match to make the crown the color of my teeth.  When I asked he if I could use Crest White Strips on the vaneers, she said &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;.  Then she asked, &amp;#34;Is that why your teeth are so white?&amp;#34;  Okay, yes.  Crest White Strips work for me, and so far I haven&#x27;t felt any of the sensitivity others have complained about here.  Now that I have the vaneers, I might get some, possibly.  But I doubt it.  I will definitely be using these again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works quickly and really does stay on your teeth. I bought this for a cruise and i could tell the difference in my smile after two weeks</li>
    <li> I expect some tooth sesitivity when I use teeth whiteners, but these strips cause too much pain, even when I use them every other day. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to finish the box. Whitens all right, but there has to be a better alternative.</li>
    <li> Yes they work and I appreciate having whiter teeth but I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth 6 hours of pain.</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully for me. My teeth are pretty good to begin with, first off, but nothing special. I do drink coffee, but I make sure to brush at least twice a day and floss every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I always brush and floss BEFORE using the product, which is against the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, but not harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying the strips, starting from the middle, I use my finger nail to push them deeper into the areas between my teeth, just to make sure it gets everywhere. I also leave the strips on my teeth for an hour, once again against advice, twice as long as directed. I experience noticeable sensitivity, of course, but as someone who bleaches their hair, as well, the concept of beauty-is-pain really never bothered me. I don&#x27;t recommend that others use them the way I do, I&#x27;m just explaining my personal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom one is pretty small, I agree with the other reviewers. They stick perfectly, however, and I see results right away (not surprising, since I leave them on much longer than directed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;d have to be a bit thick to imagine that you were going to get 28 top AND bottom strips from the package. Thick, or having no clue what marketing is about... anyway, I didn&#x27;t find that misleading in any way, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work very well for me, I recommend them and would use them again (as I have in the past.)</li>
    <li> i HAVE A WHITE SMILE NOW!</li>
    <li> Just an FYI - Amazon lists a cost \\&quot;per pouch\\&quot; on these whiteners.  The actual cost per pouch is twice as much as what is currently listed.  Amazon should correct their price description to say \\&quot;per strip\\&quot; or double the cost \\&quot;per pouch\\&quot; to be accurate.</li>
    <li> Works great and less expensive than buying it in store.</li>
    <li> Love these for pre-modeling, pre-fitness events, etc. etc.  I keep the small package wrapped up in my luggage for on-the-go and easy travel!  - Ramblen Fitness Travel Ambassador and Instagram blogger: inspire_health4life</li>
    <li> These are nicer than other whitening strips I&#x27;ve used because they really stick to your teeth. They don&#x27;t slip around and the whitening gel doesn&#x27;t squish out onto your gums and tongue. They stay put for the full 30 minutes and you can go about your business without really even noticing that they&#x27;re there. They whiten as well as typical whitening strips, as far as I can tell. Bottom line: the Advanced Seal Technology is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It removes the stain from my teeth and slightly whitens my teeth. The result is a natural coloured teeth on me instead of the very bright white teeth</li>
    <li> This really works well. I noticed the difference after the first use. it seems to lack an instruction pamphlet but it really is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend brushing your teeth well before using.The strips are very easy to attach to your teeth and stay in pace and are not at all uncomfortable during the 30 minutes. They are then a breeze to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days of using this, my teeth are much whiter so it gets my approval!</li>
    <li> Before using this product I wanted my dentist&#x27;s honest opinion of Crest Whitestrips.  He said:  \\&quot;The products used by dentists to white teeth that actually do something are identical to the solution used in Crest Whitestips.  What makes one work and another not work is how well the product keeps the solution in contact with the teeth.  The original Crest Whitestrips did not work well because they did not stick to the teeth well enough.  If the Advanced Seal actually stick to the teeth - buy the Crest Whitestrips and don&#x27;t spend the extra money paying a dentist to overcharge you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked about whether they work on bonded and capped teeth and he stated very simply that all whitening products work only on natural enamel.  My bonded front teeth would not get any whiter excepted for the parts where the enamel is exposed and then I might wind up with ugly bi-colored front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sensitivity - it is possible, with any whitener to experience temporary sensitivity.  He recommended that if I experienced this problem to use the whitestrips once every three days and to use a good fluoride rinse on the two days in between.  It will take longer to get results but you&#x27;ll get the same results with less discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does the effect last?  He said the whitening is mostly permanent - that the teeth will darken a little over time but will never go back to their original shade.  If you&#x27;re dissatisfied with the darkening over time, repeat the process.  It is not harmful to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience?  The strips stick and stick pretty well.  There are a couple of teeth that they start peeling off of before the 30 minutes is up but they&#x27;re towards the back and don&#x27;t show when I smile.  My bonded front teeth are slightly lighter where the enamel is revealed but not enough to be obvious.  The teeth that had no fillings, crowns or bonding are whitening.  I&#x27;ve taken my dentists advice and am not using the strips every day.  I skip a day or two between strips so I still have 4 days remaining.  So far, I&#x27;ve not experienced any sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my personal results and my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, if you are considering whitening your smile, try the Advanced Seal Crest Whitestrips.  Not only do they work well, but mine came with a NICE coupon for the next round and an even whiter smile.skip a day or two between strips so I still have 4 days remaining.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard about these dental strips that supposedly make your teeth whiter so I thought I&#x27;d try one out.  I got these Crest strips, which were the newest ones at the time, and have been using them for the past week.  I can say with the utmost assurance that they do work; my teeth have gone from fairly clean to several shades whiter than before.  Even my coworkers have noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very simple to use.  Just peel, apply, wait 30 minutes, and remove.  See results in just a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as they work I have to stop using them.  Something I noticed when I accidentally fell asleep with one of them on and it got stuck.  After I ripped it off I had the worst day-and-a-half long tooth ache almost to the point of tears.  I read the side of the box shortly thereafter to see a warning label saying, \\&quot;May cause tooth sensitivity; this is temporary and not harmful.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be harmful, but it was agonizing and it happened again the next two times I used it.  This is probably my fauly, but I had to stop using them because the pain was effecting my work performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I get any sort of kewl new dental product, I&#x27;ll be sure to read the warning and potential side effects label.</li>
    <li> At this point in the evolution of teeth whitening products, you would expect a few basic things.&lt;br /&gt;1) They whiten your teeth&lt;br /&gt;2) They are relatively simple to apply&lt;br /&gt;3) They do not take a lot of time/effort to use&lt;br /&gt;The Advanced Seal strips meet all these expectations.  My teeth showed signs of whitening within 4 or 5 days.  The two strips go on easily.  They only require 30 minutes - ONCE a day and they stay on VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these stips pass all my tests.  I think there are products out there that you need to use more often that might be cheaper, but for convenience, these are a good option.</li>
    <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product and ironically had a dentist&#x27;s appointment for a cavity filling on the same day.  After my filling I asked the dentist about this product and if she would let me know what shade I was currently showing...(YUCK might I add due to my coffee and smoking habits).  She showed me a chart (which she gave me so I could keep it as a reference) which in good light allows you to see your current shade.  Yellow!  Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off I went to start using these strips rather then spend the hundreds of dollars required for a full on bleaching treatment at a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am about 8 days into the strips and I am noticing a little shy of ONE shade lighter.  They are working.  I doubt that in the next 6 days there will be a miracle...but I think I will be over one shade lighter....  Ironically again, my cleaning appointment is set around the same time so I will get a professional opinion and post my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some thoughts/tips on the strips themselves:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are packaged in individual little packets which makes it easy to take one with you when you cant spend the time to use it at home...for example if you travel for work like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the packet, there are two strips on a little piece of plastic.  You peel the strips of and stick them in place on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful so you can get as close to your gums as possible without sticking them on your gums.  Sounds like a project, but it truly is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Press the strip onto your teeth, so the sticky part is touching the teeth. They start to work and must be left on for a total of 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;When the 30 minutes is up, you peel it off and voila..day one is over...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a quick brushing after you take them off to clean up your teeth and get rid of any residue...of which there is very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that once you put the strip on it does not get in your way....you can drink water, talk properly (without sounding slurred), and go about your routine.  30 minutes is a very short time as it is...so you can always put it on during the day when you have some slow time at work or after dinner when you are watching TV, etc...  There is a slight tingle that you will feel around the gums....that simply means they are working.  My teeth are NOT overly sensitive so my results may be different that yours....its one of those things.  I have had bleach treatments before which felt like there was a fire in my mouth...these are not as intensive...but as with anything that you use internally...speak to your medical professional before you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is not a miracle cure for stained teeth...you have to take care of them and brush 2-3 times daily and floss like the dentist&#x27;s recommend.  (yeah I wrote that part because I know she is watching and going to come after me :-))  But seriously....these will help you remove some stains and make your teeth look better.  But you must do your part to keep the stains off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated above, I have an appointment for cleaning in about 7 days and will post a professionals opinion of the whitening strips after I get the results.  What I see and what the dentist see&#x27;s may not be eye to eye....no pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More later......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps somewhat.

    <li> This being my first experience with a teeth whitening kit, I went into it with a completely open mind and hope for success. After about five days I did start to notice positive results, but by around day six I started experiencing a burning on my gums that was extremely uncomfortable. On top of that, my teeth started getting a lot more sensitive than I had expected. When wearing the strips, they put a funky taste in your mouth that lingers a while afterward, as well as a gooey film that took a while to subside. Because of that, I doubt I would try this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking to save money over a professional whitening job, Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal may be the way to go. Just be prepared to deal with the good and the bad, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I am often asked by patients and friends where to start in terms of selecting a bleaching product.  Since Crest produces some very good products, I generally steer them to Crest products.  However, there are a multitude of Crest bleaching products to select from, so where does one begin?  Here is my advice in selecting and using Crest Bleaching products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s begin with the Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal.  This product was introduced in February, 2009.  It contains a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel that is attached to a clear strip (like a band-aid) that wraps around the teeth.  The primary advantage to this system is that the strip adheres to the teeth better than all the previous whitestrip products. In fact, some users report that it can be somewhat difficult to remove.  However, having a strip that adheres to the teeth allows the user to do other things (remain active) while they bleach - work-out, shop, drive, talk, even drink fluids.  The previous versions instructed the user to bleach for 30 minutes while stationary so the strip would not be displaced.  In terms of bleaching effectiveness, Advanced Seal is equivalent to Crest Premium, Premium-Plus, and Pro Effects (as they all have a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brief review of the other Crest bleaching products is in order to understand the options available.  Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations.  This can be very confusing for the consumer!  Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well.  Here is a quick summary of the products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment). 2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment). 3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).&lt;br /&gt;4.  Crest Pro Effects (10% hydrogen peroxide, 10-day treatment).&lt;br /&gt;5. Crest Advanced Seal (10% hydrogen peroxide, 10-day treatment).&lt;br /&gt;6. Daily Whitening Multicare (6% hydrogen peroxide, 5-minutes/day, 6-week supply)&lt;br /&gt;7.  Daily Whitening with Tartar Protection (6% hydrogen peroxide, 5-minutes/day, has a chemical that discourages tartar from attaching to the teeth, 38 upper and lower strips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. For most products, the instructions will direct you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time. The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this can lead to sensitivity. Crest bleaching products will generally work for most people, especially younger people and those with yellow stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential Disadvantages to Consider&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Hydrogen Peroxide can \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip too far up on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc. The peroxide causes a revesible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods. If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth in the office for two sessions and then use White Strips to continue the bleaching process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching. Crest offers a product called \\&quot;Crest Whitestrips Supreme\\&quot; through dental offices that can be used at home.  It is a 14% hydrogen peroxide gel in a thinner strip.  It is used for 30 minutes once or twice a day for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDSold water, ice cream, etc. The peroxide causes a revesible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.

    <li> These did a reasonably good job of whitening my teeth. They aren&#x27;t movie star white, but I can tell the difference. I did experience a little sensitivity during the process, but nothing major. I plan to use these once or twice a year as maintenance since I drink a lot of tea.</li>
    <li> I like the way that they stick to your teeth better than the original ones that I bought years ago. It&#x27;s a really subtle change in whitening, but I would continue to use the product and liked that I only had to do it once a day.</li>
    <li> I used it for 20 days now and really have not seen any difference. Just to be clear about it, I dont have bad teeth and just wanted them to be writer</li>
    <li> I got a great price on these and had been wanting to whiten my teeth for awhile now.  So I got them in and started using them...wow what a difference after the 4th day. My husband commented on my teeth and so did my sister. Very satisfied with this product and will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used it before, and my teeth were white for a good amount of time. At first, I was afraid that it would cause discoloration to my gums and lips, but it did nothing.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money, or got my hopes up on this product.  Although I know many people with gorgous white teeth who swear by crest white strips, it did not work for me at all.  :(</li>
    <li> I had tried Crest White Strips years ago and they slid all over the place.  It was so annoying that I returned them.  The new Advanced Seal seems to work pretty well the bottom still slips a little but much improved.  I have very short bottom teeth so what I discovered if I trip the bottom of the strip for the bottom teeth slightly they grip allot better.  Overall I am quite satisfied with this product and I ordered some more.  It also helps that Amazon.com is about 1/2 price of my local Walgreens on the White Strips with free shipping.</li>
    <li> does its job as described. i experienced a little bit of sensitivity but it went away in a few days.</li>
    <li> These Crest 3D whitestrips work great. My only complaint would be the size of the lower stip. They have cut down on the size of the lower strip and because of that, the strip does not stay in place.</li>
    <li> I love using Whitestrips every few months to remove my stains that build up from coffee drinking and other foods that stain my teeth, but these make your teeth VERY sensitive. I can&#x27;t do it for days straight, I have to do it only once or twice a week to give my teeth a rest.</li>
    <li> Works well at a fraction of the in-store price</li>
    <li> I try to whiten my teeth every 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have really sensitive teeth. This stuff usually doesn&#x27;t get very painful on me.  A couple times I have skipped a day because of sensitivity but overall it works well and I notice a difference within days.</li>
    <li> I *think* they helped a little.  But they also hurt my teeth a lot if I use them too many days in a row.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive teeth- to the point where I have NEVER been able to whiten them. This is my fourth attempt with a tooth whitening product (strips!). Last year I made it to day 2 before calling it quits- as I would get sharp, shooting pains in my teeth after one use, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep. My mother in law loves me- I&#x27;ve been funding her white teeth (minus a strip or 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;ve been able to do a weeks worth of these already, and I&#x27;m fine! Here&#x27;s what I noticed. The first day, I left it on for 35 minutes. Big mistake. Felt fine, until about 4 hours later when my mouth started throbbing. Pain! It felt like someone was randomly crunching my tooth with a pair of pliers, and alternately hammering an ice pick into the root.Try sleeping with that! Orajel didn&#x27;t help, glopping on sensodyne didn&#x27;t either. I swalloed a couple advil and prayed for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I was fine- pain was gone, but I was once bitten twice shy. No way Jose, white teeth are NOT worth that! I grabbed my sensodyne and pushed the box of strips back into the corner. That night I religiously used my sensodyne and cast a hateful glare at the crest box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But by next morning, fully rested, the full box of strips beckoned to me, and I thought, how bad can it be? I&#x27;ll try one more, and do it for less time. So Day 3 I did strip 2- and I timed it to 28 minutes, to allow for the 2 minutes it took to get on and take off. Surprise!! No pain! Hurray! My teeth look a tiny tiny bit whiter, but not enough to really notice..I was dying to do strip 3, where everyone says they get their results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on Day 4, I did a 3rd one. Timed it again, but noticed some sensitivity. Not nearly as bad as day one,more like a hint of what could come-  I figured the pain would accumulate with multiple strips and took another day off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And guess what? It worked. No pain!!  Yes it will take me almost a month to do (I&#x27;m only half way after 2 weeks, but no pain other than day 1), but if you have a lot of sensitivity, it works! Do it every other day, or just take days off when needed. And TIME it!! That extra 5 minutes makes a HUGE difference! I also bought sensitive toothpaste and started using it, which may be helping as well. OH! And do NOT bruish your teeth before doing the strips...do them after dinner, and brush the excess gunk off instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have VERY noticeable results, and very minimal discomfort. Very pleased so far, especially since I&#x27;ve never been able to whiten before! I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and the pain is temporary, there are no lasting effects. So I plan to continue to through the second half as quickly as I can tolerate, and will definitely buy again.pain other than day 1), but if you have a lot of sensitivity, it works!

    <li> Worked quick (saw results in just a couple of uses). This was just what I needed a few weeks before my wedding. The results lasted moths after I stopped using them. If you have sensitive teeth, try adding sensodine toothpaste and doing the strips every other day. You will still have great results!</li>
    <li> .....on my 2nd order now - wonderful price and great product.  I used every day for 1 week and now using every 3-4 days; no sensitivity and teeth almost as white as v expensive 1 hr whitening treatment by specialist!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are much whiter. Good product</li>
    <li> Crest is like Apple. It just works.</li>
    <li> Be sure to buy Sensodyne toothpaste to help with the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> very simple and worked like a charm.  i didn&#x27;t notice any difference til the end when i took a really good look in the mirror.  would def recommend</li>
    <li> These work well..  However don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 20 minutes.  It becomes difficult to remove,  my teeth were sore after I took the lower one off.  My lower teeth don&#x27;t show when I smile so I use  both the upper and lower strip on my top teeth.  Lasts twice as long.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I finished the kit. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the instructions, and didn&#x27;t even drink water while wearing it just because I didn&#x27;t want to tarnish the whitening effects.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t see a visible difference. And I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments, either, so I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has (I&#x27;m not going to ask, because of course they&#x27;re going to try to make me feel good).&lt;br /&gt;My smile wasn&#x27;t bad before; it just wasn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does seem to work for some people that use it, so I give it a 3. I guess reviewing isn&#x27;t really based off of if it works for others, but if it works for yourself, but I still don&#x27;t want to be mean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buying it or not since i was reading many people having pain while using the product, but to my surprise for me there was no pain! After the 14 days, my teeth where shades whiter, but i know professional effects would of worked waaay better. Looking forward to trying the professional effects in six months. Thank you crest for this product!</li>
    <li> we are most pleased with purchase. the advanced seal is amazing, just remember to use fingernail to press into spaces between teeth, and to take them off! the seal is so good you can forget they are on, and then experience some sensitivity for a couple days. As always fast shipping from Amazon!</li>
    <li> used this product and it actually whitened my teeth. wow something that actually does what it says. it makes your gums a little sore right after application but it doesn&#x27;t last all day long. good product.</li>
    <li> The strips are easy to apply and they STAY ON. I sometimes forget I&#x27;m wearing them. The little pieces of &amp;#34;gum&amp;#34; that remain once I pull off the strips don&#x27;t bother me. They slide away quickly and it&#x27;s easy to brush them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using them, I had read a dentist&#x27;s recommendation (on Amazon) to use toothpaste for sensitive teeth in advance. I did this for two weeks before using the strips and I experienced no sensitivity whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did not whiten my teeth as much as I expected. There was some improvement, but there is still a bit of a yellow cast. I am blessed with good, hard enamel, so this might be simply because my teeth need more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much less expensive than going to a dentist that I would probably try these strips again.</li>
    <li> Worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Will use again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to whiten my teeth for my wedding.  I could already notice the difference in just a few days.  It worked great.  I had a little sensitivity in my teeth, but the product specifically warns about that.</li>
    <li> Did these seal? Yes, hard core to the teeth so that I had to really pull hard to get them off. However, they didn&#x27;t do the most important job: whiten the teeth. I used these about for about 5 days with absolutely no results. A couple of months later, I ended up buying the standard Crest white strips and there visible results immediately after one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Crest 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips for 4 days, and have already seen a difference in my teeth.  I&#x27;m over 60 and have never used a dental whitener before.  I drink coffee and tea everyday.  I was reluctant to have my dentist do it because of the cost.  I have followed the directions exactly, except for only very lightly brushing off (not scrubbing) my teeth if I feel they aren&#x27;t clean enough. I have a lot of saliva in my mouth, so I breathe through my teeth for a few seconds to dry them off before applying the strips.  They stick very well this way. I haven&#x27;t had any tooth or gum sensitivity, but my lips were a little irritated, so I&#x27;ve been putting on chapstick after the strips are in.  No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the strips my top and bottom teeth were noticeably more yellow than the teeth near them with crowns.  After 4 uses the teeth are much closer in tone.  I will continue with the strips until they are gone (there are enough for 14 applications)  or until I&#x27;m happy with the level of whiteness.  I think that $31 is a very reasonable price for this product, especially if they are effective.</li>
    <li> These strips are...well...amazing. I first started out with just vivid and that helped well, but these ones dramatically help. People are even telling me \\&quot;Wow, your teeth are white!\\&quot; i also use the full line of crest 3d white products, toothpaste, mouthwash, strips, etc. They seal on well so you dont have to worry about keeping teeth clenched the whole time. The bottom strip works, but it is much shorter and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as top. it has only been 4 days since i have had these and they already work. cant wait until the whole 14 days has past. Simply Amazing,</li>
    <li> These whitestrips work fine, especially for their price, but don&#x27;t expect dramatic differences. They cleaned up some tea stains on my teeth and whitened them a few shades overall, but I don&#x27;t have super white, Crest commercial teeth. They caused a bit of sensitivity, so I used them every other day instead of every day. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with them, however. Just don&#x27;t buy them with lofty expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous Crest and Rembrandt whitening products and I must say this one is now my favorite. You can talk, drink water, and salivate all you want during those 30 minutes of wait time-hooray! My only complaints are the upper and lower strips are packaged together and they REALLY stick to your teeth. So far no pasty white burning gums which is a big relief. Another bonus is the enclosed $7 off future purchase coupon which doesn&#x27;t expire until 2010. I plan on stocking up now in order to get the coupons, plus Amazon&#x27;s current special deal makes this a terrific bargain.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Crest whitestrips that would slip around on my teeth and made me feel like I wanted to swallow all the time (of course, trying not to only makes it worse; lol).  The first three times I used these I wanted to swallow (and let me tell you, they taste like hydrogen peroxide; not the most pleasant taste), but now I can put them on without having the urge to constantly swallow and spit like I did with the older versions.  They say to leave them on 30 minutes, but I&#x27;ve left them on for an hour because they are comfortable and I almost forget I&#x27;m wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the strip for the bottom teeth is smaller than the upper.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I smile more than just my six middle bottom teeth show.  So, what I&#x27;ve done is a few times put the larger top strip on the bottom and visa versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend these new Advanced Seal Whitestrips; they definitely seal well and make your teeth whiter!  :-D</li>
    <li> While these did stay on my teeth well, they were extremely painful.  For those with sensitive teeth, I do not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of different brands of whitestrips including the old Crest Whitestrips, but I always have two problems: they don&#x27;t stay on well, and they hurt my teeth.  Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal addresses the first issue (they really do stay on quite well for the recommended duration of time), but they send shooting pains up my canines and make my top teeth ache the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is better designed than other brands I&#x27;ve tried (no trays, etc.).  Each set of strips (top and bottom) come in their own small wrapper which is slightly difficult to open, but generally a clean and easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: they stay on for the recommended amount of time so if it weren&#x27;t for the shooting pains, I would probably forget they were on; no awkward mouth-foaming or other uncomfortable side effects I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands; relatively easy packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: extremely painful; strips didn&#x27;t cover entire set of teeth (only about 6 on both top and bottom); expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on their effectiveness in whitening because they were too painful for me to leave on for the full amount of time.  I will continue to use them, but for half the recommended amount of time, and every few days rather than every day, as suggested</li>
    <li> For what Crest Advanced White Strips costs, Crest could have added an inch in width, and at least a quarter inch in height to the lower strip. If you want to whiten your middle four, and part of two other teeth, this will work, but beyond that, forget about it. Who did Crest design these for, little kids?</li>
    <li> The new strips really stick tight while talking, drinking water, etc.  I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review for items because to be honest, I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t like to take the time.  These whitestrips, however, made me want to sit down and tell yall how awesome they are.  I bought these a week before going to the dentist to get two teeth caps.  As you may or may not know, when you get caps/veneers, they match the color to the rest of your teeth.  Caps and veneers don&#x27;t change colors so you want your teeth to be as white as possible when you get it done so that your teeth will be white.  In about 4 days time, these strips totally whitened my teeth.  The dentist even told me he used the brightest cap because my teeth were so white.  I definitely recommend these to anyone and I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing these again to keep my teeth this white.  I honestly can&#x27;t stop smiling. :)</li>
    <li> Love them! They really worked on me.</li>
    <li> apparently i have really sensitive teeth.  thanks to crest 3D white whitestripes i now have REALLY sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> After doing the 14-day treatment I did see an improvement in my top teeth. They are definitely whiter than they were two weeks ago. But my bottom teeth did not see much improvement. I think it&#x27;s because the bottom strip is too small and only covers close to three of my teeth barely touching my incisors. If only the bottom strip was longer! Also, expect some sensitivity after using, it&#x27;s not too bad but I didn&#x27;t like the feeling so I won&#x27;t be using these again.</li>
    <li> my teeth are so white it is re-donk</li>
    <li> This product is effective in whitening teeth.  And the fact that it only takes half an hour (the time to read your email?) is a great plus.</li>
    <li> I use Crest White strips about once a year to whiten my teeth.  This is apparently a new formula and it seemed to work a bit better than it has in the past.  My son and husband have had dentist whitening jobs and they really don&#x27;t look much better than this.  My friend who is a dentist says that the mall whitening stands that charge over $100.00 for sessions use these Crest strips with a UV light(which basically does nothing more!).</li>
    <li> These Whitestrips stay put! Very easy to apply and remove. Whitening effect is noticeable within three or four uses.  Wish the lower strip was a little longer, but I have reversed the application with no problem. No gum irritation at all! A real bonus because I have experienced this with other products. Very little residue after removal, too.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I never even received my order.  Apparently , someone over the age if 21 has to be home to sign for these?  Would have been nice to know.  I work all week from 9-5, FedEx would not have the order rerouted to my work without consent from the place the package came from!  There was no way to contact the company, FedEx gave me a name of the place and the only phone number we could find was out if service.  I was not driving an hour to pick up teeth whitening strips from the FedEx office!  What a waste of money for something I didn&#x27;t even receive!</li>
    <li> Definite signs of whiteness</li>
    <li> Have been using for over a year now to keep my teeth white! i did not follow the instructions exactly i just used them periodically when i wnated my teeth alittle whiter since after the first couple treatments my teeth were much whiter than before. I found they worked way better if you left them on longer i ussualy did 2 hours and i felt little to none senistivy when i do have cold sensitive teeth normally</li>
    <li> Love this, it really works but after using it often your teeth become more sensitive.</li>
    <li> These were very easy to apply! No mess, easy application, and remained on teeth for the full 30 minutes. Within a few days use, there was a noticeable whitening, however, since I discontinued use my teeth have returned to their original coloring. My only issue with these whitestrips was when applied too high, where they covered some gum, it caused some discomfort (a sort of burning) and whitening to the gums (which quickly faded).</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Actually works, I started to see results after 3-4 days.  Price was reasonable. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After having braces for two years I told myself that I would purchase Crest White Strips but never did until now. I&#x27;m not even halfway though the 14 strip treatment and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I regret waiting so long to use this product. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. I was worried that it would cause me pain since my teeth can be a little sensitive, but so far I have not had any problems. The strips don&#x27;t move at all which is great! I can&#x27;t wait to have a new smile after I use up this box. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> It made my teeth more sensitive to hot / cold, but my teeth are a lot brighter. If 14 isn&#x27;t enough, just buy more.</li>
    <li> I am well pleased. I used them daily for about a week, I think.  then maybe every few days until gone.  My teeth are just not looking not so white so I am ordering them again.  Very easy to use.  No pain!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Your teeth won&#x27;t be instantly perfect. the first time you will wonder if it is working &amp; maybe notice a couple white spots on your teeth. The second time you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working. And by the third time you will be please with your progress. Ive tried several other products and I think this is as good as it gets. I only use strips for a half hour at a time because I sometimes have sensitive gums. No problems with these at half hour intervals, though!</li>
    <li> This a great product. I&#x27;ve used it three times and already can see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have previously used the original version of Whitestrips, the ones you apply several times a day, so that is what I can compare these to. The big difference for me is that these only need to be applied once a day.  These do hold to the teeth a lot better, the old ones would slide around, need adjusting etc.  (the heartbreak of adjusting Whitestrips)!  These definitely take fewer days to see results----I would get so frustrated with the first ones, that I gave up before I finished the box.  I seem to forget these are on, probably because they just don&#x27;t slide around and wad up behind my teeth.  If your experience was anything like mine, I would think that if you tried these, you would probably change your mind about Whitestrips.</li>
    <li> Crest \\&quot;White Strips Advanced Seal\\&quot; come in boxes of 14 strips to be used over a period of 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means is this some miracle product that will make your teeth pearly white, but the effects are noticeable.  The change in whiteness was most noticeable during the first three days of use, but it seemed to slow down after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are pretty inexpensive and somewhat effective for the price.  Applying the strips is quite simple as it just requires a simple folding of the strip around the front teeth.  After using the product for the first time I found that there was a slight discomfort and increased sensitivity in my teeth where the whiting strip was placed.  However, after continuing the usage of the whitening strips I found that the pain eventually disappeared (around the 7th day of using the product) and the sensitivity was also gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give the product a 3/5 for effectiveness, 2/5 for comfortableness and a 5/5 for ease of application with an overall score of 3/5.</li>
    <li> They are working out fairly well....however, I ordered 2 packets of &amp;#34;Glamorous White&amp;#34; and received instead 2 packets of&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Vivid. Decided to avoid the hassle of returning and waiting again and put them to use.</li>
    <li> I love these little beauties! I keep them in my travel kits and cosmetics bags. I found this particular product to be much stronger than I needed, so I experienced tooth sensitivity after I used them. However, because they were so powerful, I was able to use them less frequently and for a shorter amount of time. I can pop these on before I shower and remove them once I&#x27;m done with my hair and makeup and my teeth will be noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Improved adhesive - these stay put. Very powerful - you WILL have whiter teeth very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Still bulky/awkward/foamy and gross. Very powerful - be careful not to give yourself tooth pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have regularly recommended this product to others.</li>
    <li> Finally, Crest figured it out to glue the strip to your teeth and stay there for half an hour.  It&#x27;s worth it compare to previous strip.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> These rock.&lt;br /&gt;Much whiter, much better. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It really worked. My teeth as white as haven&#x27;t been for 20 years. I did not feel any discomfort during usage of the product.</li>
    <li> I saw a big improvement by day 4.  However, being a rebel, I left them on longer than instructed and ended up with super sensitive teeth, to the point I had to stop using them.  I was also in the middle of dental work, so I decided to wait until my mouth had settled down.  Next time I&#x27;ll follow the directions.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I was leary of trying The Crest Whitestrips at first, but after trying them ,I noticed a difference in my teeth ,almost immediately.I have tried other whitening strips and these are my favorite,I will probably use them again, in the future. The only thing I would change, is the bottom strips need to be longer. They did&#x27;nt cover all my lower teeth.</li>
    <li> I have to search far and wide to find anyone else who, like me, hasn&#x27;t seen results.  Maybe there&#x27;s just something wrong with me but this product sure didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s the 2nd tooth whitening kit I&#x27;ve tried, the first was a different brand, and neither made any difference in my teeth, they still look yellowish.  I have never smoked, and only drink dark soda sometimes. I don&#x27;t know why my teeth are so yellow, but I figured these whitening kits were supposed to take care of that.  Is my age a factor, I&#x27;m 46?  Too many years of stains?  I wish I knew.</li>
    <li> I have used various versions of the Crest Whitestrips many times in the past and I have always been pleased with the whitening effect.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular version though because the bottom strip is shaped differently and it is smaller and doesn&#x27;t cover as many teeth. It covers 2 fewer of my bottom teeth than the other versions I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought the 14 day ones, OMG my teeth are so much whiter! I use to smoke, and I drink a lot of coffee, so it was nice to see how white my teeth could be. There was a little sensitivity on day seven so I didn&#x27;t use them for 2 days after that. Follow the instructions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem as strong as they should be.</li>
    <li> The bottom strip is WAY to short - doesn&#x27;t cover all of your bottom teeth. And it made my teeth crazy painful. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Love Crest White strips. I &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; my teeth one box about every six months or so. I only use a strip every other day, as they make my gums so sensitive to cold, but they still work great!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be. Shipped quickly in a sealed box. Works as expected/anticipated. No complaints overall. Good product.</li>
    <li> strip stick to your teeth; very hard to take off your teeth; some strips had no whitening on it! Not happy.</li>
    <li> I choose Crest White strips because of thier great reputation for proven quality results.&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT dissappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I had a very good experience with this product along with excellent results.  I had a very good transaction experience with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recomend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Would use Seller again. Excellent product as stated.</li>
    <li> More than once in the past, I&#x27;ve had to fidget with a whitening strip that folded over or wrinkled while I was trying to get it on my teeth, usually losing most of the gel in the process, sometimes rendering the strip unusable.  On top of that, I always found that once I got the strip on, I really had to focus on keeping it in place, since the slightest mouth or tongue movement would cause it to slide off(and you KNOW how your tongue wants to explore that alien object in your mouth).  I found this new formulation helpful with both of those drawbacks.  The strip was easier to position to begin with and considerably easier to keep in place.  I didn&#x27;t experience any particular difficulty getting the strips off, either.  Although the whitening is not as good as a dentist&#x27;s treatment, they do an acceptable job for a comparatively bargain price.  I&#x27;ll buy these again next time it&#x27;s time to spiff up my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully improved tooth whitening product; and it addresses many of the major flaws in the 1st generation products.  I&#x27;ve previously used the Listerine Whitening strips, and although they were effective, were rather painful (from the peroxide) and hard to apply.  These Advanced whitestrips solve many of those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Very little to no pain; they seem to have adjusted and optimized the peroxide in the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No foaming, so you don&#x27;t look like a rabid dog.  Again, probably from optimization of the peroxide.  You leave them in your mouth for about 30 minutes, and you can go about your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to remove from the backing and apply- this is the largest improvement I&#x27;d say.  The Listerine strips were hard to apply because they would stick to the slightest bit of moisture (e.g. your fingers) and get jumbled up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Neutral taste- does not leave an aftertaste or for that matter, other tastes during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works effectively- the box says you&#x27;ll see results in as little as 3 days.  That&#x27;s no joke!  My teeth were much whiter after just 3 days, and I will gladly continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After treatment is done, the strips are a bit hard to remove from your teeth, leaving a sticky residue that I had to brush off.  It&#x27;s a minor quibble, since the strips solve all the major issues that plague its competitors.  Furthermore, they tell you to use these prior to brushing your teeth, so subsequent brushing will remove any residual material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow half stars, so 4 it is.</li>
    <li> I got these strips for my 17 year old daughter who wants perfectly white teeth after 2+ years with braces.  She likes them very much.  They stay on well and don&#x27;t slide around or taste \\&quot;funky\\&quot; like other brands.  These actually worked very quickly.  After 5 days I noticed her smiling wider and happier.  Her teeth actually look whiter and I didn&#x27;t think they needed whitening at all so for me to notice they really worked!  I tried one just to test flavor, texture, stickiness and durability.  I liked the flavor, didn&#x27;t notice them on my teeth to much and I had no problem removing it from my teeth.  Overall I will continue to buy this brand of whitening seals over others on the market.  I like crest in general and was quite happy when they started making whiteners.</li>
    <li> Got two weeks until the big event? This is the product that *might* be for you. I am an avid coffee drinker (as in a 4-6 cup/day habit), so I have room for improvement in the white teeth department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: two very clear strips that are harder than a contact lens to find when you put the film with the strips on it down on the sink. Wear once to twice per day (I went with once) for 2 weeks for 30 minutes at a time. The fine print says you are not supposed to use them right after brushing, and they won&#x27;t work with caps or artificial teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Strips stuck and molded fairly well to my teeth&lt;br /&gt;2) I could and did shower with them regularly with no problems&lt;br /&gt;3) I looked like a rabid dog while wearing them, which I showed off obsessively to my children&#x27;s delights and my husband&#x27;s dismay (but I found it extremely funny)&lt;br /&gt;4) They really did whiten, although without an included whitening guide, it is difficult to tell how much (I sort of made my own, and they did apparently whiten really well despite uneven whitening)&lt;br /&gt;5) It came with a seven dollar coupon&lt;br /&gt;6) I did not find the hydrogen peroxide to leak much, so there was no nasty taste unless I went probing with my tongue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) My teeth or smile must be big, because they did not fully cover the fronts of my teeth (the upper strip made it to a half of each canine, which show when I smile) - it was an obvious color difference after a week, so that&#x27;s a pretty big negative!&lt;br /&gt;2) Whitening was uneven - especially where teeth are close together - this would be unacceptable if you are getting close-up pics (e.g. for a bride or new \\&quot;significant\\&quot; other) but okay at a distance&lt;br /&gt;3) I talked with a noticeable lisp while wearing them - and I forgot and answered the door once with them in full foaming mode&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t have super sensitive teeth - but man did these things change that - ouch! It caused me to cut back on my coffee, so maybe a good thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my dentist will do a basic whitening for just over one hundred dollars and a deep cleaning 2x per year is covered in my dental plan. This would be a better choice in my humble opinion for brides-to-be. If you have a wide smile and bigger than average teeth (you know who you are), this may not be the best choice b/c trust me - your canines will look even MORE yellow when the adjacent teeth are pearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: I would not purchase these as is since they were not wide enough to sufficiently cover and whiten my top teeth, which makes me feel like a freak. Thanks, Crest! Using 1.5 strips for the top would be an acceptable work-around for me. Based on the convenience and ease of use, I do think they are likely worth the price for most people needing light whitening./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my dentist will do a basic whitening for just over one hundred dollars and a deep cleaning 2x per year is covered in my dental plan.

    <li> This product is a fourteen-day whitening treatment, applied once a day with form-fitting strips that are removed 30 minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the manufacturer&#x27;s statement that it takes 3-4 days to notice a difference. At first I thought I was seeing a difference right away, but really the strips just leave temporary white dots on your teeth that, when viewed from a distance, leave you with the impression that this is the final result for that particular application, but again, those dots are temporary. Gradually, a difference is certainly visible, and by the end of the treatment, the result is very satisfactory in my opinion. But then, I don&#x27;t smoke. I do drink coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is simple, and yes, this product leaves your teeth gummy after the strips are removed. But this is a minor problem that is resolved with brushing, but if you don&#x27;t brush right away it comes off on its own within a couple of minutes. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is easy and covers the visible teeth. While the coverage is not the same as if you used a treatment involving a tray, the good part is you can compare your back teeth to your front ones and see the extent of the change. Some people may find the coverage of the bottom teeth inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience this treatment does not leave my teeth a super-ultra slap-you-in-the-face white, but it does leave my teeth a pretty white that is still natural-looking. I like that, and for the money, I think it&#x27;s a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time this is written, the box includes a generous coupon as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I had no issues with sensitivity. I did notice a slight tingling on my tongue and in my throat the first few times I used this, but nothing regarding sensitivity in my teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> I could tell the difference in color in my teeth within just a couple of days!  Much whiter!  The strips are really easy to use and adhere quite well to my teeth.  All-in-all, this product performs exactly as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ding I will have to give these is that they cause my front teeth to be super sensitive, especially to anything cold and the pain with cold food and drink lasted for the duration of the whitening.  I am hoping one day there will be a tooth whitener that doesn&#x27;t cause such sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This review is comparing these to their older style whitestrips, these not only adhere WAAAAYYYY better but don&#x27;t cause all that excess saliva that seems to kave had the effect (at least for me) of causing the adhesive to come loose well before the time was up! The old style would tend to slide around a bit unlesss i did not talk at all! Not a problem with these ones! WOW, am i happier!&lt;br /&gt;Also this new Advanced Seal kit only needs 1 30 minute treatment daily, where the older/other  Whitestrips products requires (2) 30 minute treatments daily. The entire treatment takes 14 days, but it promises that you&#x27;ll see results within 3 days. Which depending on how badly stained your enamel is will vary with each individual. All in all I like these ones the best so far! They deliver!</li>
    <li> Dang, reading these other reviews, I feel like a freak. I agree with everything the other reviewers have said regarding the stickiness: these strips do hold much better than the old ones, and are quite unobtrusive. I have somewhat prominent canines, but had no problem wrapping the strip around them and tucking it into the crevices between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, it didn&#x27;t do much to whiten my middle-aged choppers, which are rapidly declining into the yellowed ivory of an old piano key. Rats! I don&#x27;t smoke and I don&#x27;t drink much coffee. I even gave up soda drinking recently (for the sake of my dental health, not cosmetics). Maybe it&#x27;s that these strips work better to remove stains than to reverse the yellowing that comes from age? In every other respect, these were winners. But what can I say? They just didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll give it a try for one more box&#x27;s worth and see if my once-pearly teeth just need more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(EDITED TO ADD: Well, the first few strips of the second box finally produced noticeable whitening. What&#x27;s more, my daughter tried them, and her smile was visibly brighter after three days. I don&#x27;t feel like such a freak anymore :-)</li>
    <li> These work and are better then anything else out there.</li>
    <li> They stick very well--no sliding around. I JUST WISH Crest would get the idea that we all want the bottom strips to be as large as the top strips! I hate the little bottom strips. As far as whitening--it works,makes teeth on the sensitive side, so I only use every other day or every two days.would like to see a strip that holds just as well, but whitens a lot faster.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, no extra cleaning needed, and sits quite comfortable and made my teeth more white within days of use</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t work too well and definitely overpriced. I will not get again. My teeth and gums hurt after using it..</li>
    <li> I love Crest 3D.  Works like a charm to whiten teeth and keep them white.  The strips stay put on teeth until you are ready to take them off.  At my age, drinking coffee and wine, my teeth are beautiful, thanks to my naturally straight teeth and Crest 3D!  Much cheaper than whitening treatments at the Dentist office.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and followed the directions, and the results were not great.  I have seen better results with whitening tooth paste.  I am going to try a different product from a competitor to test out the results.</li>
    <li> Works well. Need to use at least 4 times before you start to see the results. Did not have to use the whole pack to have white teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product! It is the quickest way to make your teeth whiter. I recomend to use it every other day to avoid the buzzing pain</li>
    <li> I have about three more days to go and my teeth already look much improved, can not wait for end results. Also they are easy to put on and leave in your mouth for the period of time required. Can even do it twice a day if you want to speed progress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these as I&#x27;m 47 now as it was my birthday and it SOOO improves my teeth as a coffee drinker it&#x27;s a must</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this product one star, I am sure it works fabulously if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, however I do.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are only slightly sensitive, so I thought I&#x27;d be okay. I used the strips once, for half an hour last night and was woken up at 4am by shooting pain in my gums. I took aspirin and had to rub Sensodyne on my teeth and gums for the pain to stop. My friends have used this product and said it&#x27;s amazing. I know it works, my teeth are very slightly brighter than they were yesterday. But it was definitely not worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I am sorry for the one star. I just want to warn others before they are woken at 4am too :)</li>
    <li> This product definitely works! Results wise you get whiter teeth without a doubt, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have given it 5 stars in effective whitening you do have to use with caution.... Make sure (especially if you have darker teeth to begin with) that you evenly place them on your teeth or you will get a patchy result. Align them properly. Secondly they make your teeth really sensitive! Especially for someone like me who already has somewhat sensitive teeth!... After 3 days use I was in pain, the thought of a lemon actually made me cry a bit lol !&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using every 4 days if you have sensitive teeth so you don&#x27;t kill yourself! Also use sensodyne toothpaste!</li>
    <li> this worked really well for me and were cheaper than the ones that I saw at the store. I&#x27;d really like to get some more and use it again when I can afford it. I&#x27;m very busy but this is so simple it can just be done while driving in the car running errands or while I&#x27;m doing homework. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody looking for a easy way to whiten their teeth</li>
    <li> I tried it out for 5 minutes but my teeth didn&#x27;t react to it so well. I felt this shock on my bottom teeth and I took it off automatically. It felt like a sharp pain as if someone was trying to pull my tooth. I&#x27;ll just stick to the tooth paste since it does work wonders.</li>
    <li> Some background-I am 56 years old and had never whitened my teeth. But, then, I noticed that my teeth were getting somewhat brown. So, I wanted to whiten them a bit. HOWEVER, I was very concerned about sensitivity issues and in having an overly white smile. I knew I didn&#x27;t want to go the dentist/whitening tray route (One of my daughters does this and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the whole tray thing), so I researched what product to use. Consumer Report said that whitening strips were the way to go in over-the-counter products, and Crest was the product to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I googled and read articles about the various products and decided on the Crest 3D Advanced Seal Whitestrips.  However, before starting to use the whitestrips, I used Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste for about a week, hoping to avoid any sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, I started the strips. I used the strips the entire two weeks and was very happy with the results. I had no sensitivity problems. My teeth lost all of the brown and quite a bit of the natural yellowing. My teeth look white again without looking a phony white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips stayed on for the required half hour with no loosening and were easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to make teeth whitening an annual event.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SO CONVENIENT AND THEY REALLY WORK. I JUST PUT THEM ON IN THE MORNINGS BEFORE I TAKE A SHOWER AND LEAVE THEM ON FOR A HALF AN HOUR.</li>
    <li> I have used white strips a long time ago (&amp;#62;10 years) and they did a great job whitening my teeth.  So when I thought to try it again I was hoping for better results since I figured they would have improved the product.  Well I did the 14 day treatment and it did whiten it a bit but not as much as I was anticipating so I am a little disappointed. But I give it 3 stars because it did increase the whiteness somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is that these do stick to your teeth alot better than before and they do not slip off.  So you are able to talking regularly without sounds like you have something in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have said it does make your teeth pretty sensitive but if you avoid extreme temperature changes in your mouth (i.e ice water) it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> didnt really do much to my teeth</li>
    <li> The Crest Strips Advanced Vivid are working very well. They are easy to apply. You can really notice the difference after one week of applying them.</li>
    <li> I recently started dating a dental tech in Miami. He told me the worst thing you can do to your teeth is to bleach them. It destroys the pulp that is inside your enamel that helps protect your teeth. So the more often  you use these types of products the more you&#x27;ll need to because your teeth turn porous making stains easier to appear. This is also the reason your teeth get so sensitive and translucent (bluest-destroyed enamel) when using these products. I used baking soda with tooth paste now works great.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, they held to my teeth for the full 30 minute application. Although my teeth sometimes ached if I used them morning and night for more then 3 days at a time, it was easily sorted by stopping for one day and then resuming the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are definitely a bit whiter &amp; I&#x27;m sure next I time I do another course they will improve again. I would recommend this as a cheaper effective way to gently whiten your teeth, although no one else commented on my teeth being whiter - my partner could see the difference and so could I.</li>
    <li> works good so far can&#x27;t wait to finish it and see the results</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, makes my teeth very white. I&#x27;m I made this purchase. Great only thing it makes your teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> if you are trying this strips for the first time you can start with level 3 . it will give you a moderate average level of whitening.its great if you have a sensitive teeth or you don&#x27;t want to use or start whitening with the highest level .</li>
    <li> works awesomely! as advertised. although be warned, they make your teeth sensitive after usage ... do not leave on longer than the directions recommended, the sensitivity only worsens. after your treatment period is done, and a few days/weeks pass your teeth should go back to normal (i.e. no more sensitive than they were before treatment)</li>
    <li> I really wish I took before and after photos! Noticeable huge difference! I am also a smoker which is amazing. Compared my teeth to a couple of my best-friends that don&#x27;t smoke or have any special whitening system and my teeth are much whiter. The only negative thing I would say is that it made my teeth sensitive. But after using them for a while it went away. I guess that just means they are really strong! I really want to get my teeth bright white! I&#x27;m going to go for another round except a stronger one. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.  The strips really work, don&#x27;t take long to use and perform well.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> very effective. I just do three or four days and then a touch-up a few months&#x27; later.</li>
    <li> Actually something that works!</li>
    <li> The whitestrips were very easy to work with and I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity to them at all when I wore them for 30 min. I would highly recommend not wearing for longer because I did feel sensitivity when I had forgotten about the time and I exceeded the 30 min mark. I thought the grip was pretty strong on my teeth and was able to stay on for the whole 30 min. I did find that the sides weren&#x27;t as sticky but I assumed that to be from limited contact to the teeth as it stretched across. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth. There was some whiteness but I was expecting a greater difference. I would recommend this product if you are looking to whiten your teeth but don&#x27;t expect amazing results. If I were to try whitestrips again, I might try another kind to see if I could get a greater difference in whiteness. But it is a great product and it arrived very quickly and the packaging wasn&#x27;t damaging or anything so it wasn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> SO painful - my teeth were aching after the very first day, and I followed the instructions to the letter. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> when I got it in the mail the strips inside the box were defected. this was a waste of my money. l tried to return this order but yall wouldn&#x27;t allow it. I hate this item soo much. its the worst thing I ever ordered from amazon.</li>
    <li> It works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I love Crest White Strips, I&#x27;ve used them before and they definitely whiten my teeth. I ordered a package as a gift and they arrived completely crushed, I was extremely disappointed with the delivery and packaging of this product. I&#x27;ll have to purchase another box at a store because I just cannot wrap this.</li>
    <li> you have to use them everyday though, don&#x27;t take a day off they will work without the big price of a dentist</li>
    <li> I researched to find the best whitening product and Crest came up tops.  Let me tell you easy to use, and within three days BIG difference.</li>
    <li> Love these strips i use them all the time</li>
    <li> Worked well for upper teeth. Lower strip could have been a bit longer to cover 2 more teeth. Be careful not to leave on too long. as the strips are more difficult to remove. No problems with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I wanted to whiten up my teeth a bit and these did the trick!  The strips stuck on perfectly and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with them coming off.</li>
    <li> Great results.  I will use them again. Easy to use.  A good buy also.  I always use Crest products. I own P and G stock</li>
    <li> I do like this stuff. Stays on well, and it did make a difference in whitening my teeth. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These bad boys really do stick to your teeth, so don&#x27;t worry about any slipping. As far as the whitening goes, I would say it didn&#x27;t work any miracles but it did make my teeth a few shades whiter. I would probably not purchase again at the price.</li>
    <li> I had previously tried Crest&#x27;s original Whitestrips and although I was happy with the results, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the strips themselves.  They were tricky to position and, honestly, not the most comfortable things in the world.  I subsequently tried some brush-on versions, and while they were less invasive, they also didn&#x27;t whiten as satisfactorily.  But Whitestrips Advanced Seal finally gives you the best of both worlds--noticeable whitening in just a few days (you only need to apply one a day for two weeks) plus a more secure fit.  I&#x27;ll never be 100% comfortable with what feels like plastic wrap adhered to my teeth, but for the 30-minute investment the results are undeniable.  I had no issue with gum sensitivity although the strips occasionally seal too well and sometime require a little coaxing from the back of the teeth to release--a relatively small price to pay for a whiter smile!</li>
    <li> The box comes with 14 packets - each of which contains two strips. You put one on the upper teeth and the other on the lower. It is only necessary to leave them on for 30 minutes. I was impressed by how easy it was to do. The adhesive held the strips in place, but they came off fairly easily. On the occasion that a bit of adhesive did stick, I used the brush on my waterpik to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days, I did need to take a break as my gums are becoming very sensitive. I drink a lot of tea and my teeth are a shade or two whiter already. Maybe tea stains come off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the first strips I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve heard other people complain of things like foaming and after taste. These had almost no flavor at all and didn&#x27;t foam. They were very easy to use and I had no real issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these worked well. Only having to use them once a day and seeing results so soon was nice. Next time I do this though, I won&#x27;t do it until my gums become sensitive.</li>
    <li> Already a fan of Crest Whitestrips, I wasn&#x27;t expecting that there was anything that Crest could do to improve its product.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal work essentially the same as the original Whitestrips, but fit much better!  They stuck easily to my teeth, and actually stayed on - no more slipping around and readjusting the strips!  The best thing is that because the strips stick so well, I was able to talk and be understood clearly.  While it is possible to take a drink of water while wearing these strips, I didn&#x27;t feel particularly comfortable while doing so - besides, these strips only need to stay on for 30 minutes each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are easy to remove and left very little residue on my teeth afterwards.  I did not have any problems with tooth sensitivity, and was pleased with the results - whiter teeth!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips for years.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan and even prefer them to the one-hour Brite Smile professional treatment, which I&#x27;ve done twice before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best Whitestrips I&#x27;ve used.  The 30-minutes, once per day for 14 day schedule is superior to the twice per day schedule of other versions, in my opinion.  Importantly, the product does indeed seal over your teeth very nicely making it possible to have a conversation while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was also excellent, with nice whiteness and a uniform bright appearance.  I just saw my dentist last week and he said, \\&quot;Your teeth look beautiful\\&quot;, which is a direct quote.  While he also sells more expensive professional treatments, he said that he thinks that Crest makes an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is 5 stars all the way.  This item is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These really worked, my teeth are noticably whiter and feel cleaner.  They were easy to apply and really stuck to the teeth well too.  I liked that I only had to do it once a day.  My teeth were slightly sensitive to them, but not to where it made me stop using them and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> I do not smoke, but I like strong coffee. I may not have very strong enamel as I do have some cavities from when I was young so I may be kind of susceptible to having a less than winning smile.  My teeth have been kind of dingy-looking and I have really wanted to have a brighter smile as I am in a performing group want to look my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would try these strips because I have used trays and gel previously and these strips work much better. They stick VERY well to my teeth and what little talking I may need to do while on my homeward commute was not very affected by them. I think they whiten my teeth very well (in fact, better than anything else I have tried) and they do not make my teeth or gums sore. They stick so well that it is a little bit of a struggle to remove them. The taste was not objectionable to me. I did begin to see results in three days. I did try making sure my teeth were clean and moist and they did not stick as well. If you have a wider smile or bigger teeth, you might want to try alternating having the product more on one side than the one on one day and then reverse on alternate days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product works as advertised and even made my teeth feel cleaner and smoother!</li>
    <li> Excellent and easy to use!  My teeth are whiter and brighter and I love how easy it is to use.  You definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I have never used a teeth whitening product before trying these Crest Whitestrips, Advanced Seal.  Thus, I have nothing to compare them to except my original teeth coloring.  The strips were extremely easy to use.  You just peel them from the backing and stick them directly on your bottom and then top teeth.  They remain there for 30 minutes.  You are able to drink water while the strips are doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;While they are in your mouth, you do feel a gummy texture.  I have sensitive taste buds, and I did not enjoy the taste of the strips.  They made me feel like my breath stunk.  It was definitely endurable.  I also got acclimated to them with each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the most important question... Do they work?  I would say yes.  It&#x27;s hard to tell on your own teeth.  Others have noticed and commented on them.  They are a natural white, my teeth don&#x27;t look bleached out or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I have had a certain times while using the product is teeth sensitivity.  With use of the product, my teeth have been very sensitive to cold and wind.  The box states that it is normal, and it will go away.  I do agree with that; the feeling is short-lived.</li>
    <li> These strips are 100% worth the cost. I applied these strips to my teeth a few months ago, and the following week our acquaintances noticed a significant difference, this is despite our religious flossing habits, 3x a day brushing, and two doses of Listerine (one in AM and one in PM).  We follow strict dental hygiene, yet these strips are still necessary for teeth once in a while. I am celebrating a big event month week, and I plan to apply these strips once again before the big day!&lt;br /&gt;Just perks to this product: easy to use, satisfactory results a given, and safe! White teeth quicker and for a long time~! A+ product.</li>
    <li> These are the best white strips I have ever used.  The strips stick to your teeth and I have had zero tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have suffered with.  They are easy to use and the results are amazing.  After just a few uses, my teeth were noticeably whiter.  They continued to whiten as I used the rest of the box.  I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Never disappoints me. Love it!</li>
    <li> works just like it claims my teeth are super white now</li>
    <li> Love to have these on standby when I need to whiten fast!  They are perfect for in between whitening.  They don&#x27;t hurt. They stick.  They work!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for me. Didn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all which I was worried about</li>
    <li> This thing whitens like crazy, in a good way.  It does cause some tooth sensitivity, but this resolved a couple days after I stopped using the strips.  I feel like using toothpaste formulated for sensitive teeth helps alleviate some of the discomfort.  Lots of people have noticed my teeth and ask what I use.  I always recommend Crest white strips!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the most easy way to make the teeth whiter. I&#x27;ve used half of the pack (7 stripes) to get excellent result, however it lasts not so long. Consider the teeth sensitivity and gum burns may occure.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive minimalist light frame for simple poster prints from photos. The frame is light plastic and it has a typical piece of frame glass. The frames came individually packaged in a robust container. All in good shape. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love these white strips! I noticed brighter teeth after just one use. I&#x27;m a smoker and I drink coffee. I&#x27;ve had many compliments, I&#x27;ve had total strangers tell me how white my teeth are, just makes me smile even more!!</li>
    <li> It made my gums and teeth sensitive. I usually use Crest professional, but this one was so much cheaper. You get what you pay for! I got through 3 days before I had to stop. I&#x27;m going back to professional as soon as my teeth recover...</li>
    <li> Made my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> Product works. Always makes my teeth whiter. People comment all the time</li>
    <li> WAY BETTER THAN THE AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT IN SALONS. I drink coffee and occasionally smoke. This is the only product I use and my teeth are pearly white.</li>
    <li> I think this ish is overrated. I can make my own mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and get better results. Even brushing with strawberries does the trick.</li>
    <li> Wow my teeth are whiter on the first try. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a week will bring!</li>
    <li> The bottom strip was very small, it did not cover very many teeth.  I have never purchased white strips that had this small strip for the bottom, not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried these strips were going to be like the older ones that dissolved on your teeth but they are the newer types that really stick and don&#x27;t make a mess.  I would recommend only following the instructions for the first few days. Once I see a difference in color I only put them on every few months or so. I&#x27;ve made these boxes last YEARS that way. And as an ex smoker of 10 years and black coffee addict.. I can tell you that this product works and can be spread out over time with excellent results. Well worth the price. No need to spend thousands at a dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works by letting hydrogen peroxide (the bleaching agent) sitting on your teeth. I really advise against using it every day for 2 weeks. No one wants over sensitive teeth! Give it a shot. You wont be disappointed in the results. People are always asking my why my teeth are SO white.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used crest whitening strips before but i  never  used this product before. this one did nothing for my teeth at all</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips are effective at whitening teeth several shades lighter and lifting stains. I haven&#x27;t achieved professional level results but am pleased with the product. I bought this for my fiance and I to whiten our teeth before our wedding. It worked much better on me, his teeth are a whiter but they are splotchy. However, he is a heavy coffee drinker and I rarely drink any dark drink. I will probably buy one more kit to use before my wedding. If you use this product, be prepared for your teeth to be extremely sensitive and painful. I started brushing my teeth with Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste 2 weeks before using the Kit and my teeth still hurt. Overall, I would recommend this product. It is cost effective form of teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> Quality product with good track record.  Still smart to limit coffee and smoking.  Ask your dentist first.!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she was happy with the results.  She had a tiny bit of discomfort at first but then it went away after a couple of applications.</li>
    <li> These strips are dried out and do not work. Usually a few days after using crest whitest rips my teeth are amazingly white, but this batch is not like the others I&#x27;ve had.  There is no gel substance on the strips.</li>
    <li> cause sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Dont like the way it made my teeth sensitive. To painful</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, good results after a couple of weeks.  I like the ability to vary how long I left them on.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed after hearing so many good reviews of this product. Unfortunately for me, these did absolutely nothing to whiten my teeth and ended up being a waste of money. I&#x27;ve tried researching why this product didm&amp;#34;t work for me, but I can&#x27;t find a good answer.</li>
    <li> It came when it was time.  It did exactly what it was suposeed to do and I would so recommend this.  The box was a little damaged though.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 1 star because I used it everyday for 30 minutes for 14 days and there was only a slight difference in the color of my teeth. It also made my teeth extremely sensitive to the point where I could eat only chewy foods and room temperature drinks. This was definitely a waste of my money and I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips before with success but not this time!  Both bottom and top strips seemed dry upon pulling off and it didn&#x27;t seem as if any gel had even stuck to my teeth or perhaps had been on the strips at all!  A friend of mine, who I had given a previously ordered box to ( I was recommending these to her!) just called me and gave me the same feedback.  I bought these boxes through Amazon several months apart.  They didn&#x27;t seem to whiten my teeth at all!  I&#x27;m very disappointed so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the new &amp;#34;Advanced Seal Technology?&amp;#34; or did we get some bum boxes?</li>
    <li> Young college grad who has decent teeth already looking to improve on the color.  Yes, they do work but yes you must be patient for results and follow instructions.  Be careful to not get too much on your gums or it may agitate them! I liked this enough to upgrade to the professional kit this week.  Try it and see white!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this product a few times and it always works great for us. The only thing I have to point out is over the past year my teeth have grown a bit crooked. I had a hard time weaving it over the  teeth that were crooked and getting it to stick and stay. The one tooth that was really crooked did not whiten as well as others. This product is just fantastic but if you have crooked teeth you might fare better with a tray type whitening system.</li>
    <li> I can always find these cheaper on Amazon than in the store, comes quickly and the product works spectacularly! I use these packs yearly and always get results.</li>
    <li> Totally exceeded my expectations! Great product. Easy to use and works great. The strips stay in place. Dont slip at all. Noticed whiter teeth after the first use</li>
    <li> I have found these strips a little less effective than the older series of Crest whitening sets but I was totally disappointed when I only counted 15 instead of 25! How dare they give me less than what I paid for!!!</li>
    <li> my teeth are always complimented after a week of using the crest whitestrips. they are fairly easy to apply. there is some uncomfort when they scratch your lips or gums, and some of the gel has the tendency to ooze into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;the worst part is the sensitivity that ensues. it is quite intense when drinking/eating cold or hot things. the teeth even hurt when you aren&#x27;t eating anything. however, that dies down in about a week after the treatment is done.</li>
    <li> These work really well... but don&#x27;t leave them on longer then an hour or your teeth will be killing for like 2 days.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the product was authentic, used crest stripes in the past, and saw amazing results. Saw little, to no change with these. Will purchase from a local store and spend the extra, hoping for better results next time.</li>
    <li> Not too bad of a product for the price. Unknown to me when I bought the product, you get strips for both the top and the bottom teeth. Quite the plus. Initially I was worried about it causing too much pain, but it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem. About half way through the 14 strips I felt my gums start to hurt, but I pulled through well enough. It&#x27;s just an annoyance. Putting the strips on are easy and isn&#x27;t too much of a problem. Taking them off will take about a minute to get a grasp on it and to fully pull it off. At this point it will be very sticky and you may want to wash your hands afterwards just to get the chemicals off. (Makes me wonder why i&#x27;m putting this in my mouth...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MAY however see some white spots on the gums like I did near the end. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE. It should return to normal within 24-48 hours after application. If not then you do have a problem. Every now and again you may wish to stop treatment for a day or two. I did this two or three times just to give it a rest, or because I forgot. Not really an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more annoyed by the waste of time than the waste of money. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, the bottom strip barely covered anything, there was gooey gel on my teeth after removal of strips, and there wasn&#x27;t a change in the shade of my teeth...not even slightly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to keep these things on my teeth.  I put them on, go to watch TV, and within a couple of minutes the bottom one is bunched up between my teeth and bottom lip.  I actually dried off my teeth with a paper towel, tried a new strip, and the same thing happened.  Meanwhile, the top one has gone crooked and is already coming off the back of my top teeth.  This happened three times, with three different packets, before I gave up.  I have no idea if the whitener actually works since the darn strips won&#x27;t stay on for two minutes.</li>
    <li> Worked, but not quite as well as I was hoping for.  Only covered the top 6 teeth and the bottom 4 teeth, but I knew that before I purchased it.  I took a pic before my first treatment (top) and a pic after the last treatment (bottom).  I used the same camera and lighting to make it as accurate as possible.  I don&#x27;t know why some other people adjust the lighting and filter on their pics to make the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pics seem better than they actually are.  Makes no sense to me at all.  Sorry for the less than flattering &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34;, but I wanted to show as much teeth as I could.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and stayed on teeth well, but didn&#x27;t see very much whitening power. I think the original White Strips were better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with yellow teeth due to genetics/too much coffee &amp; red wine, but my teeth are so sensitive that I&#x27;ve never really been able to effectively make it through a cycle of whitening strips. In the past, I&#x27;ve used them and had to stop due to sensitivity and pain. These, however, seem to be MUCH better than some of the previous Crest versions I&#x27;ve tried (it&#x27;s been about a year/year and a half since I last tried), and I also utilize the following methods for cutting down on sensitivity that I thought I&#x27;d share:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t wrap the full strip around your teeth, top and bottom -- just stick them on the front of your teeth without wrapping around the back. Though they&#x27;re not the most comfortable in this position, I&#x27;ve found that it really cuts down on any post-whitening pain (and who cares if the backs of your teeth are white?).&lt;br /&gt;2. Try alternating days instead of attempting to whiten 14 straight days in a row. Obviously this takes twice as long, but it&#x27;s worth it if you really struggle with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;3. Only use the strips for 20-25 minutes instead of the full 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just the measures that I take; but I have noticed pretty dramatic whitening and I&#x27;m not even all the way through the cycle yet. I&#x27;m actually happy with my smile for the first time in years!</li>
    <li> great product. I used them for 10 days and my smile was a lot whiter. definitely recommend to anyone who has yellow or stained teeth.</li>
    <li> I used it for 14 days consistently...and I can&#x27;t exactly say that my teeth look remarkably whiter than they did. :( I did my research and this seemed to have gotten great reviews so I thought &amp;#34;why not give it a try?&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t exactly give it 1 star, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 either, so it gets 3. Would I buy it again though? Prob not.</li>
    <li> It works well, makes the teeth cleaner, shinier, and better-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitestrips stick well to the teeth and form this foamy, sticky substance (the reaction of the peroxide as it does its job) that you can see through the clear whitestrips once you apply them to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitestrips work well, but in certain areas, usually at the bottom parts of the front teeth, and not the upper parts of the teeth, towards the gum areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are still a bit yellow, especially at the top; the stains are still on there, but not as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this brand, since it deserves its money.</li>
    <li> Even though I heard about the reviews, I was pleasantly astonished at the results these strips gave me! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase b/c 1-they offered a rebate of $10 which they will not issue me b/c I used my $5 off CVS rewards at time of transaction. READ the fine print. I went thru completing the paper work, providing original receipt, cutting box for UPC. I called company and rep didn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;2-I think the generics would just as well as these overpriced strips.3- I prefer the CVS paint on whitening that comes in a bottle with brush. I thought I would try these. They are messy and don&#x27;t whiten as well. WASTE of money!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. In it&#x27;s defense, I have extremely sensitive gums, and It didn&#x27;t hurt one bit. It also didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth one bit. One night I fell asleep with the strips on; my teeth looked noticeably brighter the next day, but it didn&#x27;t last. It may be that I am a tea drinker. Maybe it will work for you, but I had no results at all.</li>
    <li> Works,no sensitivity with me.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well and I saw a significant improvement in the color of my teeth I&#x27;m so much more confident about my smile! I did experience a sharp pain on my first treatment and my gums became slightly sore but this soon faded as I continued the treatments. However two boxes may be necessary for a &#x27;brighter white&#x27;. All in all very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I used it only twice and my friends already saw a difference. from the second time you can see results :)</li>
    <li> This product really works but  not as hard as i was thinking. i will buy the professional effects for the next time.</li>
    <li> After 14 days of using this product as directed I had mediocre results. I would not buy this again, nor recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve had better results in the past with Rembrandt strips.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is the ease of application and the fact that you can still carry on a conversation while wearing these.</li>
    <li> Is it just me..or do the original crest white strips work better than this? I honestly barely saw a difference in my teeth, but I&#x27;ve had wonderful results with the original.. hmm</li>
    <li> Works like a dream.  Whitens my teeth in 30 minutes a day.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> does written my teeth.they get sensitive but beauty sometimes hurts.</li>
    <li> My teeth looked exactly the same after following directions to the T.</li>
    <li> I used these just like the directions told me to. I am not sure what happened but it left only lines of white in my teeth instead of whitening the whole tooth. That is much less attractive than yellowed teeth.</li>
    <li> I guess it just my issue, but it gave my gums a stinging/burning sensation. I stopped using it after the 2nd day. Plus, I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked; I thought it was supposed to be clear, but once you put it on it starts turning pasty...looks yucky.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Better than the one before. Does not move around on teeth. Sticks well. Get a lot of compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They really work.  I saw results with in a few days.</li>
    <li> If you are deciding between the Glamorous White Strips and the Professional White Stips, the extra $10 and the extra treatments with the Professional kit make a big difference.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t get teeth white.  worst of all, bottom strip is so small that it only covers around 4 teeth! what the heck?!!</li>
    <li> I have whitened my teeth with the original Crest Whitestrips numerous times and was always happy with the results.  So I wanted to whiten again. I saw that this was about $10 more than the original and I wondered if it was worth it.  It seemed to whiten the same as the original, which it claims to. The main benefit is that the strips don&#x27;t slip.  They adhere REALLY good to your teeth.  It is awesome technology.  I was very pleased with this part, as the sliding around of the original kind always annoyed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another commenter said that they were difficult to remove and she had to use a tissue to help pull them off.  For the most part, I could get a good grip with just my fingers and pull it off, but every now and then I had to use a paper towel.  No big deal whatsoever.  The non-slippage is completely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;-Whitened great!&lt;br /&gt;-Only use once a day compared to twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;-Adheres to your teeth VERY good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> only used a few. had effect. but also effected teeth. as expected.. research teeth whiting before use.</li>
    <li> The strips did an o.k. job on the whitening of my teeth. The problem I have with them, is that the lower strips are too, too small.  They barely cover half of my teeth.  If you have small teeth, I guess you can use them. But if you are a regular person, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I expected to have to use these for at least 3 days to a week in order to notice any results. I have never used any sort of strips before, and tried Luster One Hour Tooth Whitening with the fancy light contraption, which I promptly returned after realizing what a useless product it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these strips today. I used \\&quot;as directed\\&quot; and stayed in the bathroom getting myself ready, so was able to spit out any of the foamy peroxide that I didn&#x27;t want to swallow (though I haven&#x27;t read anything in the instructions that cautioned against swallowing it--I did swallow some, inevitably).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After peeling off the extremely sticky strips (also not what I expected--I thought they would sort of fall away after some minutes. I had no problems peeling them away, by the way), I was very surprised and delighted to notice a difference after the first application. Maybe that is due to staining that came off easily with the peroxide chemical, but it was still quite nice to see my teeth whiter than they have been in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the strips were fine--they fit the height of my upper and lowers, with enough room to fold a little around the edges of the teeth. I have read some reviews about them being too short and not whitening the back teeth, but an easy solution would be to use two strips for uppers and two for lowers, starting at the molars and going toward the front, letting the strips overlap at the very front of your teeth. That way your backs and fronts will get the same treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have no sensitivity, but I do know that using a peroxide chemical in your mouth when you have metal fillings *can* very well give you sensitivity. The one time I ever used a whitener (a tray, once, a few years ago), I noticed right away that the area around the metal fillings was much more sensitive and stayed that way for a while after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the strips until I see the desired whiteness... and I highly recommend them to others.recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> I got this product hoping it would whiten my teeth without any weird side effects, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not what I got. After one use the strips left my teeth extremely sensitive and it was horribly painful whenever the air or something cold touched them. The sensitivity eventually went away, but if that&#x27;s what happened after just one use I have no desire to find out what would happen after multiple trials.</li>
    <li> I started noticing results after the 2nd use. I will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product lying around too long. I finally decided to give it a whirl. OMG it is amazing. My teeth have never been and will never be TV Anchorman white but, this product is noticeably whitening them. I&#x27;m most of the way through and just have four strips to go and there is a very noticeable improvement. It&#x27;s not my imagination, this stuff works. I do my application at night before I brush but well after eating. It tells you not to brush before so I wait till I&#x27;m done applying it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and has no taste so it really is easy. It holds on tight and just takes a gentle pull to remove them. All I can say is give them a try, I think you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> Product worked as stated, shipped before expected, overall very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your teeth are dry before applying.  I did experience a bit of sensitivity, but after a couple of days my teeth were back to normal, just whiter!</li>
    <li> My wife and i have used these for years. They work very well and don&#x27;t strain the enamel on your teeth too much</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my yellow seventy year old smile.  I was really impressed with the results, my teeth were noticeably whiter after the first 3 or 4 treatments.  After the full 14 treatments I would say my teeth were at least four times brighter.  Very happy with this treatment.</li>
    <li> I recently got my braces off, and even though I constantly brushed while my braces were on my teeth weren&#x27;t nearly as white as I&#x27;d like. I noticed a difference after the third use (using one a day, everyday). My teeth were a nice white after then seventh use, so I decided not to finish them out.&lt;br /&gt;While using for the required 30 minutes on top and bottom I would notice a slight stinging between my teeth. As if you took a bite out of ice cream or have a cavity. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, ever, so it wasn&#x27;t too painful. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these for someone who does suffer from sensitive teeth, because you will definitely feel discomfort and won&#x27;t be able to finish the 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these strips! I&#x27;ve been using them for years and will continue to use them. I usually whiten my teeth at night after I&#x27;ve finished eating and drinking for the day. I always see a difference after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
    <li> Worked temporarily.. and then a week later.. I&#x27;m back to how I was before using the product. Pointless</li>
    <li> realllly sticks to your teeth, hard to pull off</li>
    <li> Not one bad thing to say, they do exactly what they promise. To be fair, I used them every other day instead of every day as the directions say, because I was afraid they would make my teeth too sensitive. Doing it that way my teeth never hurt. Very happy with the final results. The bottom strip could be a bit longer</li>
    <li> I experienced some sensitivity when using these strips, so for that reason alone I don’t think I will use them anymore. They do whiten teeth though so that was a plus, but it’s disappointing that I won’t be able to use them again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use them, so I don&#x27;t know how to do it. But I think it&#x27;s a bit too much of the packaging, which is a waste of space, in fact, can do a little more, the product is very small. More places are air, which is not necessary.</li>
    <li> I recently bought these because I was annoyed with the discoloration that my teeth have taken over the years. I was considering a visit to the dentist to have my teeth whitened but did research on the cost and decided to try a different alternative in the form of the whitening strips. After looking at reviews and watching YT videos about the product I made my decision to invest in the product. There are 7 treatments for your upper teeth and 7 treatments for your lower teeth for a total of 14 treatments. The pros are that the whitening strips grip your teeth so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them slipping off and you will see results right away. You may not need to do all of the treatments depending on how white you are trying to get your teeth. The cons are that there will be some sensitivity along your gum line after treatments and you are expected to wear the strips for 2 hours. My results were fantastic and are definitely a product that I will purchase in the future if I would like to whiten my teeth. The price paid was a fraction of what you would pay if you went to a dentists office to have a whitening procedure done.</li>
    <li> I try to use this once every few weeks, but I have to be very careful to remove it within the prescribed 30 minutes, or I will get a tooth sensitivity that makes eating/drinking kind of unpleasant for a day or two.  It definitely does the trick, though.  Just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand why teeth whitening products are so expensive in general. Anyway, this product worked well for me and I got satisfactory results. Contrary to some reviews I didn&#x27;t get any burning sensations in my mouth or gums. The strips were easy to apply, stuck well to teeth, and were fairly easy to remove without any real mess or residue.</li>
    <li> I actually saw results really fast and just wanted to show off my white smile!</li>
    <li> I used the 3d white white strips intensive professional effects heres a on online view that helped me choose&lt;br /&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g8jyqJ-kZhs</li>
    <li> These works pretty good.  My dentist actually recommended them after my initial whitening to keep my smile as white at possible.  Best price here on Amazon than Walmart.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that although I was expecting some sensitivity issues (I read a lot of reviews...) there has been none until now. I did start brushing with Sensodyne Rapid about two weeks before starting the white strips, and I continue to brush with it right after I remove the strips. I have also been using Sensodyne Protect &amp; Repair with Novamin. I just removed my 4th pair of strips and to be honest I don&#x27;t see a difference... My teeth are still as yellow as before. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee/wine, so I guess it&#x27;s just the quality of my enamel. I really was not expecting a drastic change, but after 4 treatments I thought there would be a little improvement.... I don&#x27;t know, should I still be hopeful? Now, about the infamous bottom strip: dear sirs at Crest, the bottom strip in the Advanced Vivid is ridiculously small! I mean, seriously, who wants to have six beautiful whitened teeth sitting right next to two or three yellow ones?? It shows! No one has such a small mouth. I had to use one packet of strips just to cut into pieces so I could cover the other teeth, which in my case are the darker ones. So, I&#x27;m already down one treatment. Other than that, the advanced seal works very well, the strips are easy to apply and remove and leave no taste in my mouth. No sensitivity in the gums either. Now my question is what white strips version should I try in case these do not work at all, and how long should I wait inbetween treatments? I would really like to get rid of some of this yellowing... Can you help me Crest? I will come back and update this review towards the end of the treatment. Keeping my fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: I left the strips on for one hour this time, although it is not recommended and Crest does say the product won&#x27;t whiten past the recommended time. Sure enough I still can&#x27;t see any real change in shade. The teeth look whiter right after I remove the strips, but after a few seconds the color is back to normal. I did experience a few twinges on my teeth about 8 to 10 hours after this treatment, nothing painful, just weird. I guess leaving the strips for longer than recommended does improve your chances of getting sensitivity. Still not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;Day 6: this time I went back to the recommended 30 minutes routine and the slight sensitivity didn&#x27;t come back. I have finally started to notice a difference in teeth shade, they are not much whiter (maybe one shade whiter) but they are definitely brighter! Also I went to the dentist and had them professionally cleaned, I hope that helps a little with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;Results! I can now say that my teeth are much whiter and I am so pleased! Still a few days to go so it can only get better. It took me about six days to really start seeing a difference but these actually really work, it&#x27;s worth the wait. I&#x27;m rating these strips 4 stars just because of the size of the bottom strip. Other than that they work great and gave me no pain or discomfort.ence a few twinges on my teeth about 8 to 10 hours after this treatment, nothing painful, just weird.

    <li> I wanted the strips that don&#x27;t slip around while they are on your teeth and these were perfect and I had a gorgeous smile again within 5 days!</li>
    <li> The first box did a pretty good job improving my smile!  I&#x27;m ordering another box to keep the whitening going.  Thx</li>
    <li> Super painful for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white is nice though.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my husband who had many years of coffee stains and made his teeth whiter again.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to whiten my teeth as well as the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Crest Whitestrips did.  Also, they are very hard to remove from backing.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re originally expensive a bit but even more expensive in walmart.. so i bought these because they were the cheapest i can find and honestly, WOW JUST WOW. made an extreme difference.</li>
    <li> OMG I WILL ONLY BUY THESE LOVE THEM USE THEM ALL THE TIME I LOVE WHITE TEETH DEF A GOOD BUY</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t completed the full 14 treatments yet, but so far I am very pleased with the results.  I did have some sensitivity after about six treatments, but after skipping a couple of days that issue seems to have resolved.  I would estimate at least three shades lighter at this time.  Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> These strips will make your teeth white after using them only for a few days. I find myself feeling more confident and smiling more. They are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw a vast improvement in only a few days&lt;br /&gt;I had a little sensitivity but didn&#x27;t last, good product</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I shelled out $300 for ZOOM! Whitening. Guess what? The results were no better than Whitestrips, if not worse (plus my teeth hurt bad from the Zoom!--more painful than when I broke my arm (like they were going to explode inside)). I was mad. Very mad. So after cooling off after throwing money down the drain I learned a valuable lesson: Whitestrips are truly the best, and this was before Advanced Seal came out. These new suckers are incredible and whiten my teeth so much more than the ZOOM! crap whitening systems (and it was the NEWEST ZOOM! machine at the time (late 2007)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, try these babies. Even if you love them you could be \\&quot;un-ethical\\&quot; and mail the UPC and receipt for a full refund, but I know nobody does that type of stuff this day and age ;^)</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have only used it for three days thus far and I already see a difference in the whitening of my teeth.  I would strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is only my second time whitening, so I&#x27;m not an expert. Previously I used the Crest Pro Effects strips. Although these are smaller as other reviewers have pointed out, they are plenty big enough for me (fyi I&#x27;m a male, 6&#x27;2\\&quot;, with proportionally sized teeth, IMHO). The strip for the top teeth is similar to the old one, whereas the one for the bottoms is now more contoured to fit and shorter in length. Also, these strips can be tough to get off, but this is a GOOD thing, as they won&#x27;t be sliding around your mouth dissolving your gumline for the half hour. I had experienced a little pain last time I whitened, so I simply switched my toothpaste to the Crest for sensitive teeth during the whitening period, and presto, pain taken care of. Anyway with these particular strips it&#x27;s only been two days and the results are already noticeable. And Amazon has the best price around! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestripes from crest numerous times and I&#x27;m really glad they added this 3D adhesion.  It&#x27;s definitely less messy when it comes to application and it also stays on your teeth very well.  Whitening wise is always outstanding (most bang for buck). The only downside is the lower stripes are so short, it barely covers the bottom teeth. It only covers the first 6 front teeth (lame).</li>
    <li> My 2-year old pointed at my teeth and said \\&quot;Yellow!\\&quot;, hence I decided to give these a try.  My teeth are noticeably whiter after two weeks...though my toddler still calls them yellow.  Hopefully the whiteness sticks around for awhile.</li>
    <li> It says on the box you should use white strips twice a year, but I&#x27;m already anxious for my next box. My teeth are so noticeably white, I get compliments all the time! I want them whiter, it&#x27;s obsessing how white they got. I recommend this to everyone! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am not a dental professional, nor am I a person who has ever tried to use whitening strips before...however, when I tried these strips, I was amazed at the change in my teeth.  There was a very noticeable improvement in color in just 7 days.  I&#x27;m going to finish the 10 day routine and see whether I need to do another round.  (I bought the 10 day pack of 20 strips.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy for the value offered at Amazon.  Great price for a very good product.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t  know  the reason for delay  . it is writen  that it is delivered  . but it  is not</li>
    <li> I was some what skeptical at first to try this teeth whitening strip, however after reading all the reviews and seen some before and after pictures, I was convinced to try it myself.. After trying one application I noticed my teeth got whiter.  I sent a picture of my pearly whites to all my friends and family. Most of all I want to thank Amazon for your quick delivery of my product. Now I&#x27;m smiling with confidence..........</li>
    <li> Perfect pricing, did what it was suppose to do. My teeth look flawlessssss! However I did use this product while already having pre-whitened teeth so results may vary</li>
    <li> This was my first time using any type of whitening strips. I was really surprised how well they stuck to my teeth. I noticed a big difference after using them just one time. I did not have any issues with sensitivity while using them and I would definitely re-purchase. Amazon has the best price on these that I have seen.</li>
    <li> My gums become sensitive immediately after I use it.</li>
    <li> This formulation of whitener works really well. It took off most of the coffee and tea stains that I have had for many years. It is a chore to put on the strips each day for 14 days, but I just watched TV in the evening while I whitened. It even lightened some porcelain fillings between my front teeth. I have to get another kit to finish the whitening process in a month or so.</li>
    <li> It really helped my teeth</li>
    <li> Just received these strips. It came fast which I truly appreciate!! These strips are good, but like everyone else has stated don&#x27;t expect dramatic results. I&#x27;m on the 5th day and see it is a little whiter. Don&#x27;t expect white teeth like the ones in commercials!!</li>
    <li> I definitely see an improvement in my teeth since I started using Crest white strips!</li>
    <li> I could no keep these strips on my teeth.  I don&#x27;t know if I have sensitive teeth, but they began to hurt before the allotted time was up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the hopes that i would received the &amp;#34;Advances Seal&amp;#34; product, but the &amp;#34;glamourous Shine&amp;#34; box was sent to me. I was disappointed but I still used them. I noticed my teach are a few shades whiter but they most likely would be whiter if I used the Advanced Seal box like I thought I was going to receive.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m trying the Glamorous White ones since I usually get the Professional Effects ones. I like it and it feels great because of the new LUXE grip, it definitely doesn&#x27;t taste weird like the old ones. I&#x27;m not seeing as quick results compared to the Professional Effects</li>
    <li> Made a lasting improvement to my teeth color (4 months so far). Easy enough to use. Left some small stains in the crevasses untouched though.</li>
    <li> Bought for 3 colleagues. Did not work. Only 1 box usage though</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t whiten much  , very disappointed and unimpressed. was looking for whiting strips that would make my teeth white, after two weeks they are still yellow.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My teeth get very sensitive after using it so I don&#x27;t use it every day (like you&#x27;re supposed to). I use it like 1 time a week, or every other 2-3 days if I remember, and I still can see a difference in my teeth! :)</li>
    <li> They actually work i leave them on for an hour every day and my teeth have gotten so much whiter!</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing Crest 3D Whitestrips, I had used the basic version of these. The simpler whitestrips were always effective -- with plenty of hydrogen peroxide (which actually whitens the teeth). A downside, which the 3D Whitestrips offer, is that the basic version&#x27;s strips would slip. If I was wearing them, I&#x27;d need to keep my mouth very still to prevent any movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest 3D Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Technology offer a no-slip, hassle-free grip. Before I purchased these, I thought, &amp;#34;Wonderful!&amp;#34; And they are (sort of)! I can talk, move my mouth, and even drink water. I don&#x27;t need to worry about them getting misaligned of overly burning my gums from the whitening material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, and this is what takes 2 stars away, they don&#x27;t provide enough coverage. The strips are both shorter in length and have less whitening material. This leads to a small section of teeth getting whitened and in a slower manner. Frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed in this no-slip technology because it only tends to coat the front portions of teeth -- not between the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they definitely will whiten your teeth, but I&#x27;ll be looking to downgrade to the slip-prone versions from here on out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some difference, but I didn&#x27;t take any before and after pictures so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to notice the gradual change. After two boxes, the results aren&#x27;t amazing and it left me with white spots on my teeth that won&#x27;t be going away for several weeks. Rinsing with a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water will leave you with better, cheaper results.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 boxes. One for my wife and one for me. Didn&#x27;t check the expiration date but neither box barely made a difference in the color of our teeth. It&#x27;s hard to believe P&amp;G would make such an ineffective product so we&#x27;re planning to get another box from a real store to compare.</li>
    <li> What an improvement over the old ones.  I had tried the old school Crest White strips, the kind that were like sticking jelly smeared on Saran Wrap in your mouth and was totally turned off by them.  These things are nothing like those.  I was skeptical at first due to the cost but decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee daily and a cigar or two every weekend.  So my teeth had some stains on them.  I got the 2 week pack and use them over 16 days.  Forgot two times due to hurrying in the morning.  I left them on for 1 hour instead of 30 mins just because it timed out better with my commute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are really easy to put on and they stick like Krazy Glue.  Seriously, once they are on they don&#x27;t move.  I did not drink anything hot while I had them on, but I was able to drink water easily.  The hardest part is trying to get them off, but with a little practice it becomes easy.  Using a floss stick pick would help removal as well.  After removal there is a tiny bit of a slimy feel on your teeth but it does not taste bad and you can rinse it out really fast or just let it dissolve which it does in a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely noticed my teeth were whiter after the 2 weeks.  How much, not sure, but there was a noticeable improvement.  I will do it again in 6 months as I am now a true convert.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I thought I was getting.  SmoothSellin state the packaging may change, which helps them conveniently provide you with a product which only has the ability to whiten up to \\&quot; level 3\\&quot; - absolutely useless.  I thought I was buying advanced vivid level with the power to whiten to \\&quot;level 4\\&quot;.  Furthermore, the product was creased and appeared to be slightly damaged - I don&#x27;t suppose this would help the whitening process.  Save your cash and grin up at the Sun, you will obtain a better bleaching effect rather than use this particular product. I will try the Crest professional strips next time, but will purchase them from a reputable dealer who accurately describes it&#x27;s goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this vendor - SmoothSellins \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; description tactics.  Amazon needs to get a grip on this type of misinformation...Overall, very disappointed with SmoothSellin and Amazon...shame.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. I used these along with the crest 3d toothpaste and mouthwash. So glad I did. I noticed a difference within a week, and am finally no longer embarrassed by my smile. Wish I had found this product sooner.</li>
    <li> Product works very well!By the time you get to the final application your teeth will definitly be whiter!Will be buying this again when needed!</li>
    <li> Around day 5 I started to get tooth pain. The instructions guarantee that the pain is no big deal, but I have a hard time believing that. Didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in the problem area either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the box says there is a money back guarantee, but you have to call for details. I called on a Saturday and got a recording that said the offices were closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called again during work hours on Monday. The entire system was automated - there seems to be no reason they have to close down the phone lines on the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I dialed through three menus, the instructions were quick. I could not write them all down, so I had to call back three times and I tried to type the information as they spoke. For anyone who needs it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;vvvvvvvvv&lt;br /&gt;Write UPC from box on receipt&lt;br /&gt;Circle purchase price&lt;br /&gt;Complete name and mailing address&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place items in stamped envelop, send to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3d White White Strips Advanced Vivid Guarantee Offer&lt;br /&gt;Department J&lt;br /&gt;PO BOX 900002&lt;br /&gt;El Paso, TX&lt;br /&gt;88590-0002&lt;br /&gt;^^^^^^^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even their web site says you have to call. I imagine they are just trying to make their money back guarantee difficult to work with so people will give up.</li>
    <li> and found it on Amazon so much cheaper.  No surprise.  Even with those $10 coupons the store offer still better priced here.  I feel it works great and it does make some of your teeth sensitive but then you can use every other day.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to use this product for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Looked on YouTube for reviews as well as how people used and felt about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have done only 1 treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any difference right away after I took the strips off from the 30min. treatment time.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice some white marks, these marks seem normal and will go away after 1 to 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;After those 2 days I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth did whiten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated 4 stars due to the following, the size of the bottom strip.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom strip is small and is just barely enough to cover your front lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t Crest just give/make both top and bottom strips in equal size?</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  The films that you put on your teeth for 1/2 an hour / day leave a residue and a slight after taste, you&#x27;ll want to rinse or brush your teeth after you take the film off.</li>
    <li> The first time I used them, the difference was significant!! The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
    <li> Adhere nicely to teeth and results are instant. Great product to produce your best smile.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s very bourgeois of me to be so excited about teeth whitening as to leave a glowing review, but I have no shame. Ok then. Glad that&#x27;s out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several whitening products over the years, and these are the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It used to be pretty annoying to leave strips in for any length of time, but these stay on the teeth really well. I was surprised at how much of an improvement it was.</li>
    <li> I thought I would waste my money with this product, but hearing from friends and people about how this product was amazing, made me want to go for it. After a couple of days using it, I see a huge difference in my teeth, they are so much more lighter, I would recommend using this product if you want to go for that celebrity look.</li>
    <li> 10 out of 10,after 4th treatment great difference in shade.my friend uses those few years now so we decided to try also.Be aware-!!! only order from crest.com and choose amazon pay option.</li>
    <li> Maybe 1 star.  Very little difference</li>
    <li> These seem to work even though i have very uneven teeth. Used the tricks mentioned in some comments.</li>
    <li> definitely brighten your teeth immediately. the only thing is sometimes I feel pain in my teeth right after using this product.</li>
    <li> These are always my go to strips for whitening. I use them about 1 time every 2-3 weeks and it maintains a bright white smile!</li>
    <li> Teeth still looked the same</li>
    <li> These are good. Ive been a whitener for 15 years. I get lots of compliments on my white smile every time i go out. I love how these adhere to my teeth and i know my saliva isnt ruining the white strips. I do have very sensitive teeth so i only do two strips within 3 days of each other, but thats good enough to last me a fee months before i want to whiten again. Great product.</li>
    <li> with the markup on these things, they are pretty cheap about the size of the lower strip. Seriously, they can&#x27;t add 1/4 inch to cover ALL the teeth that show?</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening system for teeth. Laser whitening damages enamel and the bleach that dentists give, that you apply in a tray and wear over night, can be painful. This however is painless, easy and doesn&#x27;t take time! Once every day when you are doing whatever you just take the strips out and stick one on your lower teeth and one on your upper. Half an hour later peel them off - this is easy to do despite other reviews! Well worth the money! P.s. I am a crest employee but so what?! (kidding)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used Whitestrips since they came on the market and the Advanced Vivid product shows what a long way they have come. The strip stays on your teeth and does not move around like the original Whitestrips. This product is so easy to use because you only need 30 minutes a day for them to work their magic. I usually use them when I am doing things around the house and I also enjoy that I can drink water while the strip is on. I can always tell a difference after only 2 days of use and the results only get better from there. I buy a box of these once a year to maintain a white smile. I have found that Advanced Vivid Whitestrips do not leave my sensitive teeth aching, but the Professional Effects Whitestrips do. I&#x27;m so glad Crest has made a product that is affordable and effective that I can use at home. Do not hesitate anymore about buying these - you will be pleased!</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING! EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these whitestrips in the store before, and they worked very well. But, these seemed like they were dried out... maybe they were past their expiration date. Don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but they aren&#x27;t having any affect.. or making a change. I could usually FEEL the product on my teeth, but when I peel THESE particular strips off... there is no residue at all. I think I got an old, dried out box, that&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for too long. Wasn&#x27;t pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a noticeable change at all. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Did not see a change at all.. Only made my teeth hurt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m undecided on how many stars. I&#x27;ve used it three times and experienced pain after the 2nd application and increased pain after the 3rd application that has continued off and on throughout the day. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth so it&#x27;s a little disappointing to have this new sensitivity. The strips do stick though. I&#x27;m not sure if I will give it a day break like some suggested, or keep trying it through the discomfort. I&#x27;m a Crest girl and never had a cavity. Just wanted to try something to brighten my smile a bit. Hopefully the end results are worth it.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips keep your teeth white even after you finish your first box. Be careful using it if you have sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Holy WOW this stuff is STRONG! I put strip on first day and after 2 minutes my teeth started to tingle like crazy. I took it off and for about a week i could not eat anything hot or cold. All my teeth became sensitive! I used a different brand 2 years ago and it was great. I get my teeth checked regularly and Their normal. So this product is super strong. I bought ut awhile ago for my wedding. And I am so glad i did this 3 weeks before! Oterwise my wedding day i would not be able to eat anything.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product experience I have ever had for teeth whitening! I don&#x27;t know what happened scientifically speaking, to explain why it hurt so much, but wow it huuurt!! After a few minutes of the strips on my teeth, I felt this odd stinging, which quickly went into indescribable stabbing sensations. My gums had dark burn spots around the edges of my teeth. This was a nightmare product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another product called &amp;#34;Natural White&amp;#34; and it worked amazingly well! Anyone with sensitive teeth should check them out. ..Good luck, friends. ~</li>
    <li> These strips really work. I was a little skeptical at first, but then I noticed a brighter, whiter smile within days of using these</li>
    <li> Easy and effective - what more can I say?</li>
    <li> If you want to pay the same as before but have them take away the space equivalent to two of your bottom teeth, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;This LUXE shape is simply horrible. The top one is fine, but the bottom one comes in a new format that covers TWO teeth fewer than used to be the case. You end up with this really lame bottom strip and people will see some white teeth, but also the yellow ones now... SO REGRETFUL I though these. Crest keeps getting worse!</li>
    <li> I saw visible results, but my teeth did not get too much whiter, and they quickly faded back after a month or two. Probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> good and stuff and thanks and yay and awesome and  fun and wow and neat and white and strippy k</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these after reading the reviews, but I was highly disappointed. My teeth did become overly sensitive using the strips daily so I would skip a few days here and there. I barely noticed any difference in the shade of my teeth. I would not pay $30-40 every 2 weeks for these strips with little to no difference in the color of my teeth. To me, it would be much more worth it to pay the extra $$ and have my teeth professionally whitened. They did stick on very well, but that is my only positive.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both got these. It did make our teeth a bit more sensitive, but we noticed a difference within 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> These hurt my teeth soooo badly!!! Had to skip multiple days in between and buy sensitive toothpaste. I feel like I did notice a color change though, not dramatic but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Crest whitening strips for 7 days and I do not see any change in my teeth. I would not purchase these again, especially from this seller. I actually think they are old (that&#x27;s the sellers fault) as I have used Crest whitening strips before with great results.</li>
    <li> My teeth color stayed the same.</li>
    <li> Takes the yellow stains away from daily coffee drinking.  They really refresh your smile.</li>
    <li> 3d white strips works very well,will order more it really really works. I use it with the 3d white luxe glamorous white toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m convinced! The first time I used them, the difference was significant. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;theaventblog-20</li>
    <li> The best look for your pearly whites, your enamel will be collateral, so you might as well kiss your &amp;#34;cavity free&amp;#34; title buh-bye. But when you are as vein as I am, you don&#x27;t care as long as they are appallingly white and your Dentist is on speed dial.</li>
    <li> Great product! I could see the effects after third day by comparing with the back teeth not covered by the strips. Following a two-week trial everyone noticed my much whiter teeth! And with no side effects whatsoever... I kept them on for half hour, sometimes a bit longer&lt;br /&gt;For sure will recommend to all of my friends</li>
    <li> I brought to my sister and she said its good</li>
    <li> OUCH! I&#x27;ve never ever had trouble with sensitive teeth. After using this product for 2 hours as suggested, my teeth are in the most excruciating pain! sharp, cold shooting pain up and down all my teeth. It&#x27;s left me wide awake and in incredible pain. It&#x27;s not worth it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for whitening your teeth, your teeth will be visibly white. BUT, once u discontinue using the strips your teeth revert back to yellow.</li>
    <li> I swear it lightens my teeth after one time use although it does hurt them if i leave them on more then 20 min.</li>
    <li> Expected to get the glamorous white package as pictured but got the advanced vivid one instead. I just finished all the 14 treatments and I don&#x27;t see a huge difference. I do not smoke or drink coffee. I just thought this was going to give me a brighter look, but my teeth still look pretty dull, especially when wearing red lipstick.</li>
    <li> I honestly cant say if this works for sure. I used it for about 3 days twice a day and had to stop. My bottom teeth were so sensitive really couldnt stand it. It hurt just to breath. Its a shame because i could tell a bit of a difference. If you have sensitive teeth i wouldnt recommend this, it may only make it worse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been some years since the last time I bought whitening strips. They are much better than they used to be. I&#x27;ve used this product three times and people have already commented on my whiter teeth. They are very sticky and adhere to your teeth quite well, Maybe too well since it leaves a gummy residue (comes off with toothbrush) when you take the strips off.</li>
    <li> My teeth were very sensitive to this product but I used it anyway. I did not see my teeth get any whiter. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Improved &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; keeps strips from sliding off before their time is up.  I&#x27;ll be repeating the process on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> The strips got my teeth white probably as white as they could have, it would&#x27;ve been nice to have just a little whiter but it got as good as it could</li>
    <li> the title says it all, works so so and after using them for a week straight my gums were sore</li>
    <li> It does not let you pick what level of white that you want. I am new to this and wanted glamorous white in shade or level 5 not 3. It does the job but I want to be able to pick my level. Everything arrives in level 3.</li>
    <li> These are not as good as  the more flexible crest strips. The stiffness creates a nice &amp;#34; tray&amp;#34; but the whitening agent is not as good as the  last  strips of the same name I bought. I guess they changed something.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, you always look better with white teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth hurt and get sensitive after using the stripes for only 5 minutes. I can&#x27;t imagine to use it for 30 minutes without loosing my teeth. I used the Advanced Vivid product before though which at least obtains good whitening results.</li>
    <li> It worked but not quite as well as I would have liked. One good thing about them: they adhere to the teeth better than other strips that I&#x27;ve tried. But, the whitening wasn&#x27;t quite as crisp.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying these because I didn&#x27;t know if they would really whiten my teeth or not but they did. The crest strips really do whiten your teeth!! The flexstrips are comfortable and they do not move. I will be ordering more and I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great product that works just like it was advertised for.  I would recommend this to anyone needing one.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.  Better than the classic since this one sticks on your teeth.</li>
    <li> When it says subtle it truly is so subtle I cant see any form of improvement after all 14 days (and i took pictures),  I do not recommend this product to anyone,a huge waist of 30$.  The stuff my sister purchases from the dollar store makes her teeth 100% whiter than mine after the second box of this stuff.  I used it perfectly to the instructions and am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw these in my local wharehouse store for MUCH cheaper then they are on here. I decided to give them a try. I was okay the first 10 mins. and then my tongue started burning like mad! I thought, \\&quot;okay I can handle this\\&quot;, until my throat started burning. I pulled them off and DID see a noticeable difference just after that short amount of time. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when the chemicals in these are basically burning off the stains on your teeth! I also had some teeth sensitivity, which I know happens. But this was a more intense sensitivity then I&#x27;ve had before with other whitening products. Too bad, so sad, because I think after a few applications I would have had some really pearly whites. Even my husband complained they made him feel weird too.</li>
    <li> I previously tried the intensive effects and I couldn&#x27;t go through half of the box because of how painful my teeth and gums became. With the advanced vivid I did not experience the same except for when I used two in one day. I don&#x27;t like how small the bottom strip is, it only covers four teeth on both sides. I ended up cutting the strips into thirds to make the best use of them because my teeth are not straight and I was applying the strip to a large part of my gums in some places, which was causing the burning on my gums. After I cut them and barely placed them on my gums I did not experience the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice my teeth are whiter but only by a shade or two (my teeth were not very stained). I will probably buy another box.</li>
    <li> The description says 28-count, but it is technically a 14-day treatment, as there is one for each the top and bottom, so that is a little bit misleading. Other than that, I really loved this product. I already have run through the treatment timeframe and my teeth are much much whiter than they were before. When I used to look at pictures of myself posted on facebook, I used to hate the way my teeth looked. However, I used this treatment before graduation, and all my grad pics turned out wonderful.</li>
    <li> For starters, my teeth have always been a little stained throughout my entire life, so when I first received this product I was very excited to use it to define my new smile.  The strips were extremely easy to place on my teeth and overall did a great job in whitening. Removal of the strips was no problem, you just have to brush right after because your teeth are sticky. Although the lower strip could have been a little bigger, to cover more of my bottom teeth, I have no regrets purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I had read multiple reviews for this product before purchasing and saw that there was a consistency with tooth sensitivity from other users.  I will say YES, it will make your teeth sensitive after use, but will occur a couple of hours after taking the strips off.  Fortunately there is a solution, there are toothpaste products out there that are directly made for  sensitive teeth, such as Sensodyne, where the sensitivity is eliminated!  So I highly suggest that if you buy the whitening strips, you need to pick up of toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that problem will be solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 14 days my teeth a remarkably whiter and I am extremely satisfied with my smile now.  The only thing I regret is that I did not take before and after pictures to show everyone the dramatic transformation.</li>
    <li> I bought one and I being using it but i honestly don&#x27;t see big differences. and it causes some pain if u don&#x27;t wash your teeth with water after using it</li>
    <li> I got it from local CVS store. Its a complete waste of money. Not going to buy again. It does not stay in place. So it does not work properly! What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Works very well , Thankyou</li>
    <li> it looks like not work for me. hope it works in the future...</li>
    <li> The best product!!! My teeth are pure white! Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t smoke but I am a coffee and tea drinker, and I drink about 2 cups of coffee and 2 cups of tea a day. I brush and floss my teeth almost every night but my teeth is still yellowish most of the time. I had gone to the dentist office to whiten my teeth before and it did work but it costs a lot more and stayed white only for a couple of months. The coffee and tea stains would again accumulate over time and my teeth would become yellow again. So, I decided to try cheaper and more convenient solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips Glamorous White, I found it easy to use but the strips did not cover all parts of my teeth. Parts of my teeth were still yellow, even though I used the product according to instructions. Overall, my teeth was whiter from a distance. I would say this product worked okay, but the indentations where my teeth meet didn&#x27;t get as white as the front of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you to also try [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This product]] while using the Whitestrips. Use the Whitestrips to manage your day-to-day whitening regimen, and use the trays offered by Shine Whitening to whitening the parts of your teeth that the strips do not cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to not overdo it with either of the products, because both use powerful peroxides that can be painful to the gums and make your teeth sensitive. I personally only whiten now a few days a week at most.</li>
    <li> I noticed a slight change in color but once you stop it doesn&#x27;t really stay white. Towards end of week, I felt a slight tingle in some of my teeth but manageable to deal with. I&#x27;m going to try the professional next since stronger strength and see if that works better. It&#x27;s a good temporary fix.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because in the review people said it would work really well and it did the only problem that I experienced with this whitening product is that my teeth were very sensitive. I had to go buy a tooth paste for sensitive teeth. I had never experienced this problem with any other whitening product so I felt really bad I couldn&#x27;t even speak since my teeth were so sensitive. I also had trouble removing the strips they stay on your teeth like magnets. But over all it did whiten my teeth but after a couple of days they are still super sensitive !</li>
    <li> Great product but it makes my teeth sensitive, but it might just be me. I probably will not use it again but for one time use it did what it promised it would</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this find because of the price. I have used the Professional Effects whitening strips in the past &amp; loved them -- great results that you can see almost instantly, but retails for appx. $50/box. After using these for the entire 2 weeks, I see little to no improvements. Waste of money &amp; very frustrating. Would have much rather applied that $28 to a $50 purchase that will produce results. Also - there is no expiration date visible, so be wary that these may be expired. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  The price was right, and the merchant shipped right on schedule.  The product worked better than I expected.  I am a red wine and whiskey drinker in addition to occasional cigars.  I went at least 6 to 8 shades whiter.  Easy to use too.  The strips adhered well with almost no irritation. I would (and will when it&#x27;s time for an annual reapplication) buy this again.</li>
    <li> After using the full box I don&#x27;t think my teeth are all that whiter than when I started.  I was expecting a more noticeable difference.  My husbands teeth are very yellow so I got him the Professional Effects and am hoping that it does a better job.  I will say that I think the Crest WhiteStrips stay on very well and are comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it should and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It does a good job. My teeth are white and it does not hurt my gums.</li>
    <li> I lived in Europe for years where these weren&#x27;t available. Makes me appreciate them more than ever!</li>
    <li> The best cheap shipping to saudi arabia thanks</li>
    <li> These work very well, have brightened our smiles when used properly.  A lot of people say they do not work, however I would argue they are not following the directions.  One of our family members was a heavy smoker and when she used them, you could see day and night difference in the before and after pictures.  I would recommend these to someone who was a smoker or a bad brusher.  They will improve most smiles.  However, they cannot undo permanent damage to teeth from incorrect brushing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t why but every time after I used it, my teeth feel awfully bad. I can&#x27;t chew anything for several hours and my gun feels bad too. I don&#x27;t know if I can keep using this</li>
    <li> This whitens as well as the others, I suppose, but the piece that you put on your bottom row of teeth is much smaller than usual.  You cannot whiten all your front teeth with it.  Unless you don&#x27;t mind not whitening your bicuspids, I would buy something else.</li>
    <li> Good product. I saw results after a few days, but maintaining use can be pricey so be ready for the investment</li>
    <li> The item is as expected avid works well. Easy to use and does provide results in less than thirty minutes.</li>
    <li> They clean my teeth, as far as whitening I see no visible difference.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them very much yet, about 3 times and they do seem to make a difference but not sure yet.  I have another product that I have used for years and is much cheaper, not sure these are any better.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m convinced! The first time I used them, the difference was significant. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a lower cost option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as it is the only whitener I&#x27;ve used that Truly Whitens!!! And FAST! I have bought many online for a great price, just to find they&#x27;re expired! NOT these, they are NEW and work great! THanks a bunch!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these about three month ago expecting decent results and was disappointed. The strips barely whiten your teeth and a side effect of them is unbearable pain. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, but after using these strips, my teeth hurt so bad I can&#x27;t even eat even after one use. Another side effect is that they have caused my gum line to recede significantly. I&#x27;m very upset that I spent about 40 dollars on something with barely noticeable results and which has caused damage to my teeth. Please DO NOT buy this product!! It is not worth it at all!</li>
    <li> Work well just like before. I have reordered them for the third time.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am on my 3rd day of treatment and I have noticed dramatic effects (Night and Day). I was a huge skeptic before starting my treatment, i didn&#x27;t know which brand to choose, and whether it would actually work. Let me put it this way, Crest is the way to go. There are 2-hour treatments, but those probably cause agonizing tooth pain. Granted, these strips cause pain, but that is complimentary with any tooth whitener. The results will vary by user, but coming from a guy who usually doesn&#x27;t experience tooth sensitivity, this product causes a great amount of pain(As does any other product), but for a short time, and the more you use it, the more bearable it gets. NO FEAR, it does not cause any long-term tooth sensitivity, just for a couple hours after you use it. I like to put them an hour before bed time, although it makes it harder to fall asleep, by the time i wake up, it is long, long gone. Again, if your teeth are originally sensitive, be prepared! Other than the tooth sensitivity and very little gum discomfort (which are a testament to teeth whiteners in general, not this product specifically) this product is great, and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to family and friends. I cant wait until the 14th day when my choppers are egg white and my confidence is boosted tenfold.&lt;br /&gt;one more comment, i have 2 small brown stains on my two front teeth. Now I am not a coffee, or Soda drinker so i have no clue where these stains originated. They haven&#x27;t really dissolved yet, but i am hoping at the end of the treatment, they will be gone. This shouldn&#x27;t scare away people who have coffee stains, because i believe the product is tailored to coffee stains. My stains have some other biological reason behind them, and my Dentist should be able to fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General rule of thumb is:&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth stay away from the intense treatments (2-hour) The stronger the product, the more pain caused!!</li>
    <li> I saw a difference with the first use. It does not make my teeth hurt. They stay on good. They were actually a little tough to pull off. Convenient and worth the money.</li>
    <li> These seemed like they were doing their job, gradually whitening, but after the 6th or 7th strip, they made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t finish the pack.  I don&#x27;t have naturally sensitive teeth, but the strips felt so painful I had to immediately remove the strip every time I tried to use one.</li>
    <li> The strips stay on and do not slip. I had no sensitivity and my teeth are very sensitive.  However,this is the second set of these strips I have purchased. I can only see I slight difference in whitening. So to say I am disappointed is an understatement. Being there is no whitening measuring scale included ( another complaint) I can only guess. I would say maybe up barely one shade. What I have paid into these strips would go a long way in having my teeth professionally whitened. I was a smoker and drink coffee. So at 62 my teeth have issues but they are NOT that bad. Take your chances. If your teeth just need a little boast I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well, I can see a clear difference after 5 treatment. I just wish the top and button strips are the same length.</li>
    <li> I use these once a week and they work great!</li>
    <li> They work really well at removing stains. Has not bleached my gums.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.  My teeth have  never been more white.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;&amp;#34;t whiten like other product &#x27;from Crest I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Very effective. The sticky back really helps to hold on teeth.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly. my teeth white within 3 days!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely great for whitening! Probably the best!</li>
    <li> The strips worked great 😁</li>
    <li> Whitens well. Is made from heavier material and the substance holding onto the teeth doesn&#x27;t fall off teeth when talking.</li>
    <li> My teeth were already white, but I wanted them to be whiter and shinier. Used up all 14 strips in a month, and my teeth were visibly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides; Your teeth will hurt during and shortly after application and although I have straight teeth, the bottom strip kept moving around which was kinda annoying. Oh and I must say it tastes terrible as expected but it is bearable if you want brighter teeth.</li>
    <li> These do whiten your teeth really well. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again, but still gave them 5 stars. The reason I wouldn&#x27;t order them again is because they stick to my teeth &amp;#34;too well&amp;#34;. I hate they way they feel when I&#x27;m pulling them off. I will order the 3D White strips again, just not the Luxe type.</li>
    <li> This product was just as stated in the description. Saw a difference in my teeth which was what i was going for! Very satisfied. The shipping was very quick. Recommend this.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth looked whiter with the first try and I was very pleased. After about a week, my teeth were significantly improved and I received a lot of compliments. I was very satisfied with how white my teeth had become. So I continued using the strips but stopped before using the last one to see how my teeth would turn out after a little break. Within the next day, I noticed my teeth didn&#x27;t look as white but thought it was just my imagination. On the second day, they looked even less white so I used the last strip and they were whiter again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, my teeth went back to their original colors and now it looks like I never used them at all. I don&#x27;t understand how this happened. I don&#x27;t drink soda or coffee and I brush my teeth consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this as a \\&quot;3\\&quot; because I was satisfied with how white my teeth were when they worked but am severely disappointed that the effects only lasted a few days.</li>
    <li> Worked out great! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> A box of Crest Whitestrips, Advanced Seal, 14-Count Boxes comes with 14 packets that includes 1 upper and 1 lower strip. The instructions are pretty straightforward, peel each from the liner and apply the gel side to the center teeth and leave on for 30 minutes. Use once daily.&lt;br /&gt;You can see results in as little as 3 days. You can eat and drink with them in. You can also wear them while taking a shower and getting ready for the day! What a great quick way to whiten your teeth with out having to go to a dentist and spend hundreds.</li>
    <li> So, I am used to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; white strips that have a sort of peroxide coating on them, they slide a little on your teeth, and they&#x27;re fairly large.  This \\&quot;new\\&quot; kind pretty much super-glues themselves to your teeth (not a fan of that AT ALL) and the bottom strip is smaller than the old kind... so far they whiten just as well (maybe better?) and it&#x27;s nice that they don&#x27;t budge when you&#x27;re wearing them.  I don&#x27;t like how stuck they get to my teeth though, but that&#x27;s what keeps them from budging...  I like the old kind better, but these work fine, too.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I&#x27;m starting to see results already</li>
    <li> This works and I get whiter teeth after just 10 days of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for everyone.</li>
    <li> My tight whitened perfectly after using these strips. I used 12 out of the 14 and I was quite satisfied. I saw changes after the 3 treatments. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter in Australia where product is not available.  Seems to be working - notice the difference after 5 days.  Not sure it is worth postage costs to fly a basically empty box around the world!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only on strip 6/14 and my teeth are already whiter. My teeth were yellow from drinking coffee/tea every morning for the past nine years and smoking socially. I noticed my teeth were yellow when  trying out a fabulous wine colored lipstick, and thought, ew. I&#x27;ve tried to use Crest white strips in the past, but had trouble with sensitivity, and returned them. With these, I can use the strips two days in a row, skip a day, etc. Skipping a day keeps the sensitivity down. I&#x27;m excited to see how my teeth will look once I&#x27;m done with the package. ALSO- the price on amazon is GREAT! Like half off the in-store price.</li>
    <li> these are great for my sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> These really make a huge difference. You will have people complementing you on your teeth on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> great product for a great price</li>
    <li> These strips along with the 3D toothpaste work great!  I only wish they worked on bonded teeth, as mine have become stained due to my coffee habit in the morning.  They don&#x27;t come off and they don&#x27;t leave a nasty taste in my mouth.  I will continue using these, with the Crest 3D toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, I definitely can tell the difference :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried teeth whitening many times in the past, always through dentist. I used to have a better job than I do now, so, I honestly don&#x27;t have the 400$ to pay a dentist every time I want my teeth a little brighter -- which is something that is kind of important to me. Hopefully this review will help people that know a lot about teeth whitening, but also those who know nothing. One major thing to know about teeth whitening all of them are enamel safe nowadays. That said, that doesn&#x27;t mean it teeth whitening is always pain free. If you have sensitive teeth, it will be sensitive regardless of if you go to the dentist or use a retail solution like Crest. The sensitivity is completely temporary and will go away once you stop whitening. If this is something you are very worried about, I would recommend you whiten every other day instead of every day, and it will dramatically decrease sensitivity, so this is not something you should be concerned about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Crest because, well, everybody knows Crest and they should be a reliable company that has a reliable product. My dentist recommended that I try a strip-based whitener,  [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Technology, 14 Treatments]], and a tray based whitener, [[ASIN:B00LNIW1EQ Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit]], so I can see which type of system works better for me. My dentist explained to me some of the positives/negatives of both types of whitening systems, and also explained how the tray system is actually closer to what I originally used years ago when I paid 400$ through my dentist. Even though the crest whitestrips were easy to use, I felt that they really didn&#x27;t have the same level of quality and effect that I got form the tray style system. With trays, you get something that is custom fit to your mouth, which is a little better for whitening then a one-size-fits-all strip system. One interesting note, I found that my teeth were just as sensitive (not really too sensitive at all just a little) whether I used the tray style or the strip style. So it was just a matter of what system whitened more, and in this case it was the tray-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I&#x27;ll go for the tray type of whitening kit because its more similar to what dentists use and I had more luck with the speed in which my teeth whitened. I have heard some people with problems using the tray type because if you overload the tray with too much gel you can get it on your gums and it may temporarily hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t think you can load the trays properly, then maybe the strip kind is for you. They come prepackaged so in that sense it might be easier. For the strips, you should really try hard to use your finger-nails or some type of depression tool (a toothpick would work) to get the whitening gel into the indents of your teeth. I used the strips for a few times and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t whitening all of my teeth, just the surface that touches the strips. Also if you decide to use the strips you have to really worry about getting the solution on your gums. This can be just as painful as having sensitive teeth. If you can get over these two obstacles, than the strip style solution is not bad. I just like the tray-style because it avoids these two problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want better/faster results and feel like you can follow a simple video guide or a few written instructions, then I would suggest getting a teeth whitening kit that uses trays. If you have perfectly straight teeth and your gums are not sensitive, then the strips might work out just fine. Like my dentist said, try both and see which option works best for you.sensitive at all just a little) whether I used the tray style or the strip style.

    <li> Some of the best strips I have tried</li>
    <li> Crest white strips are a break thru in  technology for whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Really work , read instruction !</li>
    <li> i was expecting the original whitestrips that i have used for years, but i am happy with the ones i received.  the strips arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> These seemed to work good not great if you wanted really bright white teeth. I did notice a difference after the first week and a little more the next. My teeth are whiter but not a major difference. If I used another box I would get the results I wanted. Overall there not bad, worth it depending how much brighter you need your teeth to look. The grip is good, better then others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved it, best whitening product of used by far, definitely recommend buying it. I&#x27;ll probably buy another box in 6 months :)</li>
    <li> I experienced very mild whitening with these strips with no sensitivity at all.  If you&#x27;re looking for a more noticeable change, I would recommend stepping up to Level 4 on the scale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of crest white strips for sure-- it&#x27;s on your terms and you can adjust depending on how sensitive your teeth are. If you buy a super strength one first-- be aware that your teeth might go crazy with sensitivity- this doesn&#x27;t mean white strips aren&#x27;t for you-- it means-- you bought a higher strength because you wanted super white teeth fast without regard to your health. So if it&#x27;s your first time-- you&#x27;ll still see amazing results if you opt for the lower strength strips. Also! --- I love the Advanced seal-- don&#x27;t have to worry about the taste-- just make sure when applying you go just under the gum line so you don&#x27;t risk gum irritation.</li>
    <li> Really painfull does not last long&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the time and money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitestrips for years, ever since the original product was released.  Crest continues to refine the product, as it becomes more powerful, requires less time, and with better adhesion. I&#x27;m at a point now where I just use them for a few days every couple of months for upkeep. Their effect is noticeable, both to me and to friends who comment on how my teeth look whiter.  Without regular maintenance, my teeth would be fairly yellow and dull-looking.  No, Crest does not give me the blinding, \\&quot;Hollywood-type\\&quot; white, but that&#x27;s not what I want, anyway.  Instead, they look bright, natural, and definitely more white than yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with sensitive teeth do need to be careful - the first time I used them, I had pain in my teeth after about a week of daily use. I also had some major soreness that lasted for a full day when I dozed off recently one night with the strips in place and woke up three hours later.  Completely my fault, but a good reminder to not exceed thirty minutes.  I also have some gum recession, and I need to be very careful to not place the strips on my exposed root. But once they&#x27;re in place, they don&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest has so many variations of Whitestrips now (too many, in my opinion), and it can be difficult to discern the difference between them.  I switch between this version and [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitening Strips, 20-Count]].  If there is a truly a difference between the two, it&#x27;s not enough for me to discern.  I just choose one or the other based on availability and sales price.  I highly recommend either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy enough with Crest that I would not even consider trying another brand.</li>
    <li> The product doenst work. I cant believe they are still in business. I got about half a shade after using the box. not too mention that the strips dont even cover all teeth.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone! i must say that this product is not good maybe because im asian. I bought 2 box to whiten my teeth but still looks yellow. Maybe asians are blessed with yellow teeth? i dont know. I tried this product but it didnt work for me. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I thought this product will help whiten my teeth but no.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 3 years and still continue. It is one of man greatest and moderate expensive invention that I am willing to purchase. Although my teeth are sensitive, I don&#x27;t mind the tingling sensation because in 3 days, my teeth are a shade lighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> These things are like super glue.  THEY GOT STUCK TO MY TEETH.  Like I&#x27;ve had other white strips before and it was annoying how they slid around but these were awful.  Like there was no whitening stuff on them. Just glue.  It hurt my teeth to take them off.  Soooo, unless you like supergluing things in your mouth, go for something else.</li>
    <li> gets white but only lasts during the usage.</li>
    <li> As a smoker and tea drinker my teeth had become very nasty. I used two tubes of 3D white toothpaste and two bottles of 3D white mouthwash, none of them worked. I bought this and after a week of using this the tint on my teeth is all gone. One problem with these strips is that they bridge over the gaps between teeth. I found out that by pushing some saliva into the gaps using the tongue the effective material on strips will solve and work on the out if reach parts. However it doesn&#x27;t work on the synthetic fillings. It didn&#x27;t give me sensitive gums or teeth (only once I felt sensitive teeth and it was after I accidentally left the strips for 40 minutes- don&#x27;t go over 30 minutes). I think I made a good choice buying the sealing one, it&#x27;s very easy to use. Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Grabs on to the surface of your teeth and will not slip.  Lightened my teeth without any damage.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get it in my country, so I&#x27;m happy to find here. It&#x27;s cheap and it works great!</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive teeth you can still use these on a modified plan. I know I am on the exrteme end of sensitive. It burned my mouth the first try. I decided to wait a day and try again for a shorter time. It was not so bad leaving on 15 min. After just those 2 short times I see a difference in whiteness. Now it is 4 uses spaced apart and I have a noticable difference. They are even getting the lower front bottom teeth white at the base and I have never been able to achieve that. Really an improved item over the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true they stay on much better than the original ones. They also are once a day which is nice. But if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth you can use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions do say some people may have sensitivity. The lady on the video above that says no sensitivity must not have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I got these and tried them for the amount of time suggested.  My teeth are noticeably whiter.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for silver amalgam cavities of course, or any other artificial enhancements on your teeth.  The strips stick pretty decently.  I had no peeling troubles.  Whitening your own teeth is easy, if a bit awkward.  Still, it&#x27;s way cheaper than the dentist by a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I liked them, the effects aren&#x27;t permanent.  Any strong colored foods that stained your teeth before will again.  Also, I had quite a bit of sensitivity to them, so I ended up using them less.  Your mileage may vary there, though, as everyone&#x27;s mouth is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly worth trying these before heading to the dentist.  If they work, you save quite a bit of money.</li>
    <li> I got halfway through the box and found myself reluctant to continue. It&#x27;s not the product - these do work as stated. My teeth became noticeably whiter in a few days. The issue was consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have to stay on for a minimum of 30 minutes over the course of 14 days. They do stay on really well, which I found surprising. The adhesive in these is very effective. The application is easy to do. It&#x27;s just that you have to keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not an issue - it taste like hydrogen peroxide. It&#x27;s simply the hassle of having to find 30 minutes in the day to apply these, and then reapply them every day for two solid weeks. It&#x27;s almost like taking a medication. You have to complete the routine or else the effectiveness is not optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions, you can double up and do two applications in one day. I have not tried that. My teeth are semi sensitive after completing seven days of the routine. I just wish I could get results in less time.</li>
    <li> I get my teeth cleaned regularly at my dentist&#x27;s office, but they have NEVER looked as white as they do now that I&#x27;ve been using the Whitestrips Advanced Seal.  I tried the original whitestrips a few years ago with marginal success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a $10 coupon showed up in the Sunday coupons during the same week that CVS was offering $10 extra care bucks rewards for buying the new Advanced Seal strips, I decided to give them a shot.  I am glad that I did.  I have only used half of the box and I am thrilled with the results, and am no longer embarrassed to smile and show my lower teeth. In fact, I&#x27;m giving my husband the rest of the box to use on his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was that after the first use I did experience slight pain or sensitivity on one of my canines.  I took a day off before using them again.  When I did, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the previous pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they keep their seal so well, that sometimes I do have to really peel the strips off of my teeth at the end of the 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Really worked! Still getting compliments after ran out 3 weeks ago</li>
    <li> My teeth were whiter when I was done. The strips stayed on even if I drank water. They were a little hard to take off but I found wiping them with a Kleenex helped.</li>
    <li> I have bought this a few times. My wife and I both use and love them. They work great. The only issue I have with them is that they hurt my teeth for about a day after I use them. I have super sensitive teeth though.</li>
    <li> This product shipped quickly, as described. I have been using it for a few days now, and I already see results. I have used the older version of the whitestrips before, and I did not like that they did not stick to my teeth very well and the gel would ooze out (kind of messy). These strips are only applied once per day (much more convenient than the old 2x per day), and they adhere very well to my teeth. No mess, just results. These will be my go-to when I need a touch up.</li>
    <li> Love the whitening strips and the price.  Much cheaper than the dentists office and they seem to work just as well.</li>
    <li> Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Good price. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Could of whitened better, but it was good never less.</li>
    <li> I used these for three days and my teeth are visibly whiter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth (I do) be careful not to leave it on for too long. Also keep it away from your gums (just a little bellow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I dont like is that the strip bend and goes behind my teeth. I dont need the back of my teeth to be whitened and it just creates sensitivity for no reason.</li>
    <li> It does what it promises. Bit sensitivy on teeth, maybe couple the treatment with a special toothpaste for sensitivity and don t leave the strips more then the recommended 30 min.</li>
    <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Product worked great for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased one Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth Whitening Strips for my partner and one for myself. We want our smiles to look good in our upcoming wedding photo shoots. I noticed my teeth color changed after the 3rd day! I have not finished the entire strips because I noticed a slightly sensitivity after using it 5 or 6 times. This can be totally caused by other reasons but I am just being careful so I use it every 2 or 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Advanced Vivid Whitening Strips include 14 sets - 1 upper and 1 lower strip in each set. They cover most of the teeth that will show when you smile (incisors and canines), not more. They are long enough to slightly fold to the back sides of teeth but not cover much of the back teeth either. I miss the old whitening strips I used (more than 5 years ago) that are much larger coverage. But based on my partner&#x27;s experience, the old strips did not stay on his teeth, but this one does. They are pretty strongly glued to my teeth, which personally I don&#x27;t like that feeling, but I have no problems of taking them off either.</li>
    <li> Noticed brighter teeth after 3-4 days. These actually work as advertised and without a lot of fuss. I recommend them over more expensive alternatives.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly as marketed and half the price that I find in the stores. It arrived as scheduled and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It has never failed me. I always get great compliments on how white my teeth are. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter used these for her pageant. My daughter is 15. They did an awesmome job and she didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity. I will buy them again</li>
    <li> I got the item really quickly in the mail and after 4 uses my teeth look whiter. Overall I expected to see more change in the color of my teeth but I would still recommend this product since I noticed improvements and it was cheaper to buy it online than in the store.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for this product to work but within 2-3 uses I saw results! I&#x27;m not a person that normally likes this type of stuff but honestly I am glad I bought it! It works! And it&#x27;s cheap! AND - It&#x27;s better to find these products on Amazon because they offer it at better prices than most drugstores around me (compare at $50.99!!!!)! Def. recommend this product to any and everybody that wants to whiten their teeth! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- From a more than satisfied customer! :)</li>
    <li> From a strictly personal point of view, I feel that these whitestrips didn&#x27;t do anything for my teeth. I saw no noticeable whitening even though I continued them religiously as directed. On one hand my teeth didn&#x27;t need as much whitening as others might need, I just really wanted that pearly white boost that others would notice. My teeth also became incredibly sensitive while using the product. I&#x27;d use it in the morning, then go to work hours later only to randomly feel my tooth nerves backlashing out of nowhere let alone eating cold or extra sweet foods. Buying this product was a gift to myself, and or $30-40 I was expecting much better results than achieved. Plus now that I used the whole product it&#x27;s not like I can return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Crest white strips do the job in the comfort of your own home and wallet. I noticed a difference in just one use and stopped after 7 days because teeth can only get so white, and to conserve another weeks worth down the line when needed again.</li>
    <li> THESE STRIPS HAVE SAVED ME ALOT OF DENTAL VISITS..  THEY WORK GREAT AND YOU CANT EVEN TELL YOU HAVE THEM ON.. USE REGULAR AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE ALSO. YES--I WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I used the entire box on my upper teeth (my bottom were too sensitive) and there was no change at all.  Might work for someone else but not in the least for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my teeth looking clean and white, and have more confidence to smile!  Recommended for everyone! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product.. made my teeth sensitive after a while, but that just means it working! I recommend this product for whiter teeth! Did not use the whole box.</li>
    <li> The last two boxes of this product that I have purchased have had a terrible percentage of the strips that are dried up and don&#x27;t adhere to your teeth.  I would say the first box, 50% of the strips were dry, and the second box I purchased after I received a credit from P &amp; G AGAIN 70% were dry...NOT buying these again...unfortunately because when they do stick, they work...but this ratio doesn&#x27;t work for mwe.</li>
    <li> noticed a difference by the first use and by the 3rd time, my teeth were at least two shades whiter. the only problem I had with the crest white strips were my bottom teeth hurting after the 2nd day because I have very sensitive teeth. I waited a few days before putting on my 3rd strip. Also, there might be some white spots,but those should disappear after a few days.</li>
    <li> I had to redo my review, I whitened my teeth but during the process I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the shade of my teeth. After about a couple of days or so after I was finished with the packets I noticed that my teeth were actually whiter so I came back to update this review. The price is better than you would find in stores and I&#x27;m happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> As others said, the effects are visible after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to mention that your teeth do become a little sensitive while using the product. For example, today I went for a hike and I noticed a soft pain due to the cold air (the outside temperature was about 40F when we started and went up the mountain where it was snow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you apply the two strips, I recommend starting with the bottom one. Otherwise, it will be harder to put the bottom one because there will be a lot of saliva in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Although I used this product for the  first time but I am very satisfied with it. I saw result on  the second day. Only one problem,after third time my teeth became very sensitive. At that time I stopped using strips for 2 days and my sensitivity went back to norma. I am very glad that I bought whitening strips. They work much better than previuos whitenning in a dentist office.</li>
    <li> I have always had very stained yellow teeth. it&#x27;s a genetic thing- (not a coffee drinker or smoker!). I was skeptical about trying strips because I figured they wouldn&#x27;t work or they would hurt but, in the end I was sick of being self conscious of my smile. I tried those white toothpastes and rinses with no effect. These strips say you can do one strip - worn for 30 minutes- once a day for 2 weeks, or twice a day for 1 week. I did it over the 2 weeks stretch just because I was worried about some of the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about tooth sensitivity after using the strips. After my first use, I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. i was SO excited! I did notice a little sensitivity to hot/cold/sugary things for a few hours after using the strips, so I just used them at night before bed and by breakfast, there was no pain/sensitivity. In the end, my teeth are noticeably whiter and have had many comments on how nice they look! I highly recommend these strips.</li>
    <li> Did a good job at whitening, but I still can&#x27;t get over the price.</li>
    <li> If you are going to buy a whitening treatment go with the professional crest and spend the extra twenty bucks (the professional one is like $50) That one works way better. This one did show some results but not worth it. Also made my teeth senative</li>
    <li> I used it as indicated and I could not see noticeable difference to my teeth</li>
    <li> work first time. love them</li>
    <li> Effective, yet it can damage your enamel and make you sensitive to temperature extremes.</li>
    <li> its good good good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its good good good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its good good good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its good good good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its great and nice dfsfd fsddf</li>
    <li> when i used for the three or four times, my teech started to hurt and became allergic to cold food every time i used..honestly i didn&#x27;t continue to use any more..</li>
    <li> Ehh I dunno about these..I used advanced vivid white like, 6 months ago...and now these, because they say to whiten them every 6 months but I feel like thsee made my teeth more yellow...at first and now they are slightly whiter...I think 6 months from now, I&#x27;ll go back to the advanced vivid white strips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dumb I shouldn&#x27;t have used a different system the second time but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big deal. Anyways they work to the slightest effect , everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Does work would recommend</li>
    <li> What I got matched the box shown in the picture, and seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> These white strips worked very well for me. My teeth weren&#x27;t that bad before, but they certainly looked a lot whiter afterward. Let&#x27;s just say that the difference was noticable as I have had a lot of comments on how white my teeth are now and I never used to get any comments before. I would definitely give these a try. I also had no comfort issues with burning or anything like that.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! They work and did what expected! White teeth all around after using it. I did need to buy another after 6 months though</li>
    <li> These strips did NOT work for me. I used them as directed, had no sensitivity, stayed away from coffee and other drinks/foods that would discolor my teeth, but to no avail. Disappointed because this is the very first teeth whitening product I tried due to all the high ratings and reviews. Maybe I got a defective batch like other reviewers that saw no difference. Or maybe I&#x27;m just not meant to have white teeth... Time to try other products before I completely rage quit.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that these are the best strips i have used,they really do whiten the teeth very well and i highly recommend these strips to whoever wants pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of people telling me how white my teeth are and its due to using the glamorous crest mouth rinse and these strips.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for quite some time. I received the product just today and I&#x27;m excited to try it now. Thanks.</li>
    <li> By the time you&#x27;ve used all the strips you have a noticeably brighter whiter smile and its definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> my theeth aslways had a tinge of yellow in them with stains from tea and coffee i bought these last week in a hope to have a whiter smile it has only been three days and these have worked amazing my theeth look brighter and whiter and more healthier. I cant wait to finish the whole box an achive a more whiter result. i would definately recommend these to anyone looking to have whiter theeth, and of course have patience because they will whiten theeth!</li>
    <li> This was a re-order, already loved it.</li>
    <li> I gave these a try on my top set so I could compare with the bottom. I couldn&#x27;t see any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the strips to fit my teeth exactly and avoided sensitivity because they didn&#x27;t touch my gums, but they really didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this white advanced vivid teeth whitening strips to try them out because i heard lots of good things about them and i had been also seeing a lot of advertising. So I decided to give them a try. It comes with instructions on how to put them on. These type of whitening strips you have to leave them on for 30 minutes. After 2 days I noticed that my teeth were starting to look more white I was excited. I continue to put them on until i ran out and my teeth look real white. Even my family would tell me that you teeth look great. The only bad thing i do not like is the strip that goes in the bottom it is small, but there are other whitening strips that have a bigger strip. I definitely recommend to them to use. I bought another box recently with 20 strips.</li>
    <li> Love Crest 3D strips and mouthwash .</li>
    <li> Best whitening strips I have yet to use. Love that they grip good, it&#x27;s so aggravating when strips slip and slide around your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crest white strips for almost 10 years. I like how they make my teeth whiter, but not super bright to where it&#x27;s unnatural. I get compliments all the time on my teeth being white, but people assume I just have great white teeth. I&#x27;ve never had anyone ask me if I have my teeth whitened. That&#x27;s what I love about these, is they make you look great, but very natural like.</li>
    <li> Received package and it had but cut open all the way through the box. Then it appears to have been retaped. Makes you a little nervous using something that was open all the way through the box.</li>
    <li> These whitened my teeth by about one shade.  They didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected, especially for the price.  Also, the effects are very short-lived.  I already have mostly white teeth but I was going for the &amp;#34;pearly white&amp;#34; shade.  I didn&#x27;t get it.  I would not recommend these and I plan on buying something else to try.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know as I haven&#x27;t used them yet! When I try them I will let you know! I think this is idiotic to explain!</li>
    <li> Used it for two weeks straight, 30-minutes a day, and saw absolutely no difference. Maybe I got a bad batch? I&#x27;m going to try contacting Crest on their satisfaction guarantee and maybe try the professional effects instead.</li>
    <li> this product works but i had teeth sensitivity when i had the strips on. it never happened to me with other whitestrips but ....</li>
    <li> i felt like they didnt whiten my teeth noticeably -_- in was pretty upset by the reults...i had tried em before from heb and they worked idk why these didnt</li>
    <li> They started putting less and less of those strips, which makes the product itself expensive...other than that, i like the whitestrips. Teeth are whiter after a few days.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product !!! A bit of a chore to remove but work good. Nice bright smile !!!!</li>
    <li> After 10 days of using this product there are some noticeable results. It&#x27;s a very legit product. Only 30 minutes a day AND you can eat and drink. My teeth did get real sensitive a couple times through out the process but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Honestly I read the reviews before buying the product &amp; was excited to try them out! They were such a fail. I would not waste the money on them again. Really disappointed with the poor results.</li>
    <li> I think they worked ok.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. very happy.</li>
    <li> Big waste of money.  If you want to whiten your teeth, pay a dentist to get it done correctly.  These strips don&#x27;t accomplish anything.</li>
    <li> Great for whitening teeth quickly!</li>
    <li> Very good results and easy to put on and use.</li>
    <li> Did not expect this to work but after wearing braces and having them removed I didn&#x27;t like that my teeth were straight but yellowing. Then dentist tried to sell me $200 whitening kit. I have severe allergies to certain chemicals and foods so there was NO WAY I was paying that much especially knowing that whitening can be uncomfortable and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after reading comments I got super nervous about how painful most said it was and I braced myself when product arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the only part of my body  that&#x27;s NOT sensitive turns out to be my teeth. For 13 days there was not an ounce of pain or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 14th day I used strips after brushing my teeth that night (usually brush after) but that night my gums did burn but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered them again because they worked SO WELL!!!! Whitened my teeth several shades better than I expected. Still am shocked at how white my teeth are. Scares me a little in a good way.</li>
    <li> Really worked to whiten my teeth!</li>
    <li> Strongly Recommended. I use it twice a week and after 3 times of use I can tell my teeth is getting whiter. Most important, the whitening effect lasts very long.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Does a nice job.</li>
    <li> They worked ok for me. I hate having to wear them for so long every day because they make talking a pain. they didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth substantially but I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I use these twice a year and they work well for me, keeps my teeth white and shinning. these are a bit longer than before, I suppose they are new and improved and they stick to your teeth more, it takes some work getting them off, which is better than they were before, where they would slip off when you talk</li>
    <li> If u want white teeth these are the best. Don&#x27;t bother with others these work great.</li>
    <li> I always had an issue with thinking my teeth were yellow so I decided to give these a go from a review of a friend who I physically saw the results on, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my own results :)</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good buy. My teeth stays white since I first used these strips in 2007. I only used 3 packs in total over the years. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> these are okay. I&#x27;ve used them before with the same moderate results. But I buy this level of whitening because my sensitive teeth can handle it.</li>
    <li> Did not whiten as expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have never used a whitening product, besides toothpaste, and this has worked extremely well. For a person in a similar position, I would also recommend a sensitive toothpaste (Sensodyne, Colgate, etc..) and possibly a mouthwash for sensitive teeth. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and will use it again!!</li>
    <li> Hurt my teeth SO much I had to return after 2 sessions</li>
    <li> now i have a million dollar smile. my teethe were always an off yellow color. eww i know right. but now theyre shining like little diamonds and i cant stop smiling no need for hundred dollar dentist whitenings. use these in the comfort of your own home</li>
    <li> I have been using  Crest Whitestrips for the last three years......and can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many compliments I get from people, strangers as well as people that have known me all my life. I can even remember walking into to my mother&#x27;s dentist office and him saying \\&quot;you&#x27;ve got some pretty teeth\\&quot;......they work period!  I love the advance seal....they really stay put and any small issue one may experience taking the strips off, to me is well worth it!  ....I&#x27;ve even had a women in the line at the grocery store STARE and then finally ask me \\&quot;are those your real teeth?\\&quot;......then she said \\&quot;they are so white\\&quot;.....I just looked at her and smiled then said two words......\\&quot;Crest Whitestrips!\\&quot;....Nothing left to say :-)</li>
    <li> Great, though I admit, I do not have sensitive teeth but putting them on does make them hurt a bit. I never tried 3 in a row, only tired 3, with each one at a random time, though I do notice small sections done. Seems at least  better than all those toothapstes which claim to whiten teeth but do nothing.</li>
    <li> Totally works, I saw a huge difference after one try. Don&#x27;t cheat and put sessions more than 24 hours apart, my gums ended up burning and turning white until I took the strips off. I&#x27;ve tried all different brands of whitening strips and these so far are the best. The plastic outer lining makes them not dissolve on your teeth, and they are flavorless so no gross mint spit flavor. Also they stay glued to your teeth for the 30 minutes easily which I&#x27;ve never experienced before with other products. Worth the money if you have a special event on the horizon and you need a bright white smile!</li>
    <li> The strips were dry and not usable.  Had to throw them away.  I would imagine the product was too old.  We have used this type of whitening strip before and this pack was not active.</li>
    <li> I used these strips almost exactly as suggested (I had to skip two days out of the 14 that you are supposed to do consecutively so it took 16 days to get through the pack) and to my amazement, my teeth were substantially whiter when I finished.  They are reasonably easy to apply and remove and have no apparent taste to them.  I was also happy that I didn&#x27;t end up with the refrigerator white that I see sometimes when people have professional tooth bleaching done.  It has been two months since I used the strips and my teeth still look pretty good.  I suspect that this will be a product that I employ perhaps twice a year to keep my teeth looking like I want them to.</li>
    <li> i found the results to be far less than professional. am already looking to try another product. may try another crest 3-d product but definitely not this one.</li>
    <li> I use whitening strips at least 2x a year.  Usually when I am almost through the package people ask how I keep my teeth so white.</li>
    <li> it was effective but my sensitive teeth and gum can only take it for 20 minutes, not the full 30.</li>
    <li> I would recommend buying this product&lt;br /&gt;It works great!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal. Love crest white strips too.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get these on Amazon for much cheaper than in stores!  I use them about once a week for whitening maintenance on my teeth because I drink a decent amount of coffee.  They do a great job at keeping my teeth white with minimal sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These work FAST but the best thing about them is how they adhere to your teeth, they don&#x27;t slide around, they DO stick in place and they don&#x27;t foam up.  You can even talk &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34; with them.  The strips peel off easily and you will see results the first time. I&#x27;ve spend a lot of money at the dentist for whitening or on kits but these work the best with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Only whitened a little bit and then as soon as it was completed they turned back to the old color:(. My pharmacist said that is what happens with these.. Just kind of a quick fix for a special occasion</li>
    <li> By continuing use of this for 3 days to 5 days, I see my teeth become so much whiter!&lt;br /&gt;I bought some more for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;And now if I need some touch-up I just use the strip for 3 days in a row and my teeth are back to shinning white! Love it!</li>
    <li> These work great, but do NOT use them too much. I actually cried they made my teeth hurt so bad.</li>
    <li> I dont see my teeth getting whiter, its not really what I expected. I used as directed and they look the same. I wanted pearly white but that doesnt seem to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/15 my teeth are getting whiter, so the product does work.</li>
    <li> After two times I could actually tell my teeth were whiter! Great price and a great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the size of the strips.  One for the bottom is oddly shaped.  Work fine tho</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of soda and coffee and my teeth were always somewhat white but not enough. After I read all these reviews,  I bought a box and I&#x27;m now on day 11 and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed!  So much better than the original white strips.  One tip:  use these as soon as you wake up without brushing your teeth before.  No pain at all and my teeth are usually very sensitive.  My enamel is also pretty weak and these didn&#x27;t wear it down at all.  Definitely recommend! So worth the price</li>
    <li> These little strips are certainly worth the money. They are fairly easy to apply (bit of a learning curve at first), but once they are on they will not come off. As others have mentioned, removing them can be a bit of a challenge, as getting a good grip on the strip that&#x27;s coated in gel and saliva is not easy. I did notice an overall improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, and will look to Crest in the future for my teeth whitening needs.</li>
    <li> These whiten your teeth, as advertised, and even don&#x27;t slip. The issue I have with them is, why would crest think someone only wants to whiten 4-5 teeth on their bottom row? The bottom strip is TINY. This just seems stupid. It was big enough to cover 4 1/2 teeth if I lined it up just right. I&#x27;ve used other crest white strips that had better bottom row coverage. If you are interested in whitening your teeth, I highly recommend you do not buy this particular product.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Whitening strips in the past and was confused about which one to order because there are so many to choose from, so I searched the comments and ordered the Advanced Vivid 3DWhite. I applied them as directed for the 14 days and barely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. The tea stains are still there although less then they were when I started using the strips. I will not use the strips again and am extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Tried it every evening before bed and I did notice an improvement with my teeth! I would definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> I love crest whites trips. Best whitening product at a great price. I get many compliments on my white teeth.</li>
    <li> I like these the best, they are strong enough where you can use them every other day for a week and then use the other half of the strips  a few wks later.  They are not too strong for sensitive teeth, I sometimes leave them on for 40 instead of 30 to get more time usage out of them.</li>
    <li> My teeth become more sensitive :(&lt;br /&gt;It did give me a good result</li>
    <li> Yeah, you&#x27;re dentist will love you. He or she will be sending you bills for a long time after using these evil things. Just brush your teeth like a normal person. Or move to england.</li>
    <li> noticeable white after 2 weeks of use. didn&#x27;t have any tooth pain or sensitivity</li>
    <li> these work great, but leaving them on more than 30 minutes could cause tooth sensitivity as it did with me...I skipped a day of whitening and used them again...also when peeling them off it feels like your teeth are going to break apart...I put warm water in my mouth and held for a few seconds which seemed to loosen the strips for easier removal</li>
    <li> Takes awhile before you really see a gradual white difference.  It looks natural not like a  painted on white on teeth.</li>
    <li> I recommend anyone trying this product because it works great! The downside is sensitive teeth, but I read you can take Ibuprofen and switch to a toothpaste for sensitive teeth when using this product.</li>
    <li> I use these once or twice a year and fortunately that is all the whitening boost my teeth seem to need. I don&#x27;t love the 30 minutes hanging out with them on my teeth, but I often put them on for my drive to work and brush my teeth once I get there.  I know there are many formulas and options now, but these have always worked well for me.</li>
    <li> As always, these work wonders on my smile.</li>
    <li> These work so very well!  I love the ease in which they are to use and that the results are so noticeable after use.  Highly recommend!  Oh, and the price is fantastic compared to local stores.</li>
    <li> Does what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> What a great price for such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> does what it says , can see results in about 3-4 days. only prob i had with it was that the bottom strip is not as long as the top so it only covers the front teeth . tip for ya after removing strips brush use a toothbrush with just water to remove the excess jell.</li>
    <li> This product works great and I got the desired results before I finished the box. I have over half the box left. This product is very easy to use and I recommend this product if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money to whiten professionally. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see teeth are getting white. Also, my teeth hurts after using it. My workmate feels hurt too.</li>
    <li> As expected, P&amp;G products work.  There is so much packaging/marketing in this, that it&#x27;s tough to give a credible rating.  Yes, they work:  Caution: name might change in 30 days, to &amp;#34;Super Advanced Seal&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Amazing White-strips Breakthrough&amp;#34;  You&#x27;re never sure just what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
    <li> It hurts the first couple times that I used it. I think it works. not amazing as advertised but works.</li>
    <li> Too strong. On day 3 my teeth were killing me with sensitivity. I&#x27;d settle for a gentler, less potent product.</li>
    <li> Very effective. After a month my teeth were noticeably whiter. The strips were easy to apply in the morning on the way to work and at night before bed. I would rinse out my mouth though because they did leave a filmy substance afterwards.I&#x27;ll be buying these again shortly.</li>
    <li> I used to use the classic version and loved it. It made my teeth so white! These strips were just okay. Maybe I didn&#x27;t get strong enough white power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of tooth whiteners and didn&#x27;t have the greatest luck. They either didn&#x27;t work or gave me very sensitive teeth and bleached gums.  I gave these a try and they are wonderful! in 3 days I could already see a difference. They went on pretty easy and stayed in place. Sometimes I could taste the cleaner but it wasn&#x27;t anything too terrible. I would put them on and take a bath or something taking up the 30 mins and peel them off. Never had any trouble with them slipping and they would remove easily. In 2 weeks I had a nice smile and now feel confident to wear lip color and smile for pictures. I can&#x27;t afford expensive dental bleachings so these are perfect.</li>
    <li> These are great! Keep in my mind my smile was never that yellow I just wanted bright white teeth. People tell me all the time that my teeth are so white. I&#x27;ve used white strips maybe 3X in my life just to keep my smile bright. Will probably buy again in a year. I have also tried Rembrandt white strips--they don&#x27;t work as well as Crest. I recommend them to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Always love these strips. Make my teeth really white.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I have my million dollar smile now for a few dollars. Recomend it to all.</li>
    <li> The strips help keep your teeth whiter. I can&#x27;t use them on consecutive days because they make my teeth too sensitive. If you use them every couple of days, you&#x27;d be good to go.</li>
    <li> I had it before and it actually works you actually see results in a week&lt;br /&gt;I had it before and it actually works you actually see results in a week</li>
    <li> My dentist is impressed with these whitening products by Crest.  Twice a year, when I go for my check-ups, he always comments about the color of my teeth.  I have been using some form of these strips for at least 10 years, and will continue with Crest whitening strips.</li>
    <li> The only complaint that I have is that the strips aren&#x27;t quite what I&#x27;m used to. They don&#x27;t seem to stay on my teeth like the strips I normally buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came without a box, which is OK, but I have to wonder if they are some kind of factory reject of some kind......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t want to buy from this vendor again due to this problem.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never looked this good. I did leave it on a few minutes longer than intended but I did not feel anything and my teeth came out perfect. If you have an important date coming up, or just want your teeth to shine, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> really awesome super duper good deal nice product perfect recommended and so much more and on and on and on!</li>
    <li> Whitening strips have come a long way over the past couple of years, and this product proves it.  The strips are easy to apply and stay on VERY securely - unlike strips that I have tried in past years.  It whitens as advertised, and I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  I plan to use it again for my yearly whitening next year.  I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I was a little apprehensive about it at first but it does work. I received a lot of compliments because of this stuff. Use it.</li>
    <li> A change has been made to Crest White strips.  They used to be wonderful.  Now they are so thin..  It is like a loose piece of plastic wrap sliding all over your teeth.  They just crumple up and barely stay on maybe 2 - 4 teeth in the front. The rest of the strip just twists up and sticks to itself.  A crumpled blob of plastic is not going to whiten your teeth.  Your lips can&#x27;t even touch them because this causes them to slide off.  I even e-mailed Crest asking if possibly I had received a defective batch and they never replied.  Looking for another brand of tooth whitening product that stays in place</li>
    <li> These strips work and are far less expensive that dental methods or some of the other varieties offered by Crest.</li>
    <li> some of the strips for lower teeth were not sticky which will not work as whitening tape, so i claimed about this to the seller, and their response was they have been selling over 500 packs and never had such complain so they denied my complain and they did not accept to replace it. What am i suppose to do with non-sticky strips? lol I told them again to consider about the claim i report since i have been honest about what happened and simply wanted a properly working strip and they never let me replace it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product it doesn&#x27;t work at all! Complete waste of money, it made literally no difference to my teeth even after completing the whole package, I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> very good product, noticed a difference within  a week.</li>
    <li> great product - great price - fast shipping...thanks</li>
    <li> It really works but they don&#x27;t tell you about the pain that comes with it, it you do decide to use it don&#x27;t brush your teeth after, people say it&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> These work great because they stick like mad to your teeth!</li>
    <li> I have used these before and I was very happy with them so I ordered some more.  They were shipped in a timely manner and I was able to use them when I needed them.</li>
    <li> I give it two stars for results (I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are much whiter and no one has commented on theme).&lt;br /&gt;However, I did feel it tingling so it felt like it was at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I give it three stars for ease of use. Super easy to use and works well. I also purchased the Crest whitening toothpaste and mouthwash to promote the whitening.</li>
    <li> These work quite well to whiten the teeth, however...if you are just starting out, I highly recommend leaving them on in short increments before leaving them on for the full 30 minutes. I&#x27;d start with 5, see how it feels...then move up to 10, then 20....etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not do this and the first time I left them on for the full 30 minutes and the zingers were AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely sharp pains all throughout my gums and teeth...and my teeth felt very sensitive for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that my teeth have grown accustomed to it after using the product for a while, but now I don&#x27;t really leave it on for 30. I usually go to 20 minutes and that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love the help Crest 3D strips gives me to keep my smile &amp;#34;presentable&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and feel I can smile with confidence with these strips!</li>
    <li> Loce this item works very well and me teeth come out perfectly white. I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> does not do what it claims</li>
    <li> Eh... it worked but not that well at all. It did indeed make my teeth sensitive. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Effective!! Did not give me sensitive teeth at all either.</li>
    <li> I got it around the expected date, and I tried them. About the third time I put them on my teeth they started hurting. I stopped using them and again I was like &amp;#34;well let me give it a try again&amp;#34;, and when I did again they started hurting so I just stopped using them. I believe they work but the only problem is that it will get your teeth sensative .</li>
    <li> Works great and am noticing a change already after second use</li>
    <li> It really works! but you&#x27;d better use it every other day!</li>
    <li> Great product, it attaches perfectly to your teeth!</li>
    <li> these work a bit, but after 1 use i can&#x27;t really use this anymore because these leave my teeth feeling really sensitive for about 1-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Very good service. White strips arrived in tact and shipped earlier than expected. Thanks, would use again. I like paying less for the strips and the price in drugstores is outrageous!</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Classic Crest Whitestrips my senior year of high school in 2003 when the product first became popular and I found out I had won \\&quot;Best Smile\\&quot; for my senior class. This meant having my photo taken for a special page in the year book. We couldn&#x27;t afford to have it done professionally so, my parents decided to buy the pack for me to give it a try. I couldn&#x27;t believe the result and how much it worked. Everyone noticed, I received compliments everywhere I went by so many people over how perfectly white my teeth were. The original pack was a 30 minute a day, 14 day treatment. In that one year, I used just one box of the crest whitestrips. Nearly ten years later, I&#x27;m 28 years old and my teeth are STILL as perfectly white as they were when I first tried it. I get asked all the time if I get them professionally whitened and no one believes me when I say I used the whitestrips ten years ago. The only downside is that I am a little sensitive to ice now. It&#x27;s not enough to where it&#x27;s unbearable but it is a little annoying. I&#x27;ve been to the dentist several times since using the strips and I&#x27;ve been told that my teeth have not been harmed by the product, just some people can have different reactions to them. I haven&#x27;t used the newest Crest whitening products but, I can imagine they work just as well if all they&#x27;ve done is improve the formula and adhesive strips. I would recommend this to anyone! I&#x27;ve been telling people for years to use this stuff, it honestly works.</li>
    <li> very good product, quickly delivery</li>
    <li> It did a fairly good job of whitening my teeth. Used it for the full term and will use it again when I notice the effects wearing off.</li>
    <li> Great price, Great product, I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I have to think it is working excellently as I am always complimented on how white my smile looks</li>
    <li> good price and stay on teeth well ,these are great for whitening</li>
    <li> Good product but I started getting pain in teeth after using these Whitestrips - I do not exceed the time recommended, maybe my teeth and gums are very sensitive.</li>
    <li> these did not work for me. crest white strips must have changed their formula because they used to be amazing.  will never buy these again.</li>
    <li> The arrival was earlier than expected, and the product works great. The only complaint is the bottom strip doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as expected. Other than expected it&#x27;s a great product. I noticed results the second day.</li>
    <li> Best price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> These worked.  I only used for 5 days and I think my teeth looked whiter.  I only used on my front 4-6 teeth because I was concerned about sensitivity.  I just cut the strips to the size I wanted. This worked well for me.  I used them for an event, and have not used the remainder yet.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks!</li>
    <li> I used these for the 14 days as directed and you can definately see results. It&#x27;s alot cheaper than a trip to the dentist for an expensive whitening treatment. I WILL continue to use these.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product before I read other peoples reviews on it, but once I did I was going to return it right away. However I decided to be ignorant and try it for myself. Ok not only did it hurt my teeth extremely bad after ONE use, but it is so sticky that it almost pulled off my &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tooth that should never move or lift ever. In fact I used to use Venus white pro that was recommended to me from my dentist and that stuff was amazing and safe. I&#x27;m going back to that and throwing out the other 13 strips before it destroys my teeth completely. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 3 and worked for a year, as long as you keep taking care of your teeth. This is not an excuse to not brushing your teeth! Its been a few years since I bought these and I still have a few left. Preferably use when I&#x27;m going to an event soon. I also use/recommend waterpik, to keep  teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> So far they seem to be working. I&#x27;ve only used them for three days and already I am seeing a change. If they keep working this good I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These definitely work, I took pictures everyday to be sure.  It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t even realize how stained my teeth were until I started seeing the whitening results.  Only thing is, don&#x27;t leave them on too long because they can make your teeth hurt.  Well that was my experience anyways.</li>
    <li> The very best in Whitening Strips ever! The only ones that didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt&lt;br /&gt;and sure made my teeth look bright, white and shiny. I sure will buy this product&lt;br /&gt;again from this seller, arrived fast and was in perfect shape at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> I use these once to twice a year. They are super effective, it will leave your teeth a little sensitive. I will sometimes skip a day if my teeth hurt. I suggest using a sensitive toothpaste for the month your bleaching. The discomfort goes away a few days after you complete the bleaching cycle, completely worth it and an economical, DIY self-improvement project!</li>
    <li> Love these things. They actually work, extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this stuff. And it made my teeth a little bit whiter, but I expected better result. Anyway in a half a year i am planning to buy new level.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet as I am just making sure I have a supply on hand.  However, I have had great results in the past using this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my son. He said they were easy and didn&#x27;t taste bad. His teeth are whiter. Packaging was sealed and fully intact</li>
    <li> This was less expensive than buying in the local department stores.  I didn&#x27;t see a HUGE change in the color of my teeth, but if you do it every few weeks, it helps.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this every night for a half hour for the past week and my smile is glowing! Its not splotchy at all and didnt hurt my teeth or gums! yay</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t really too much to critique, these work well, are moderately priced, and certainly helped me keep my teeth obsessively white.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I received the strips.  Great response time. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great!! the only problem i have is this product will not work on cap teeth aww!!! Very good on natural teeth.I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get my teeth completely white but I can see the difference :)</li>
    <li> Definitely whitened my teeth good but made them very sensitive. Had to take a few days off from the treatment.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple and easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;Once apply, I can do my housework and watch tv at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Once the timer is up, just remove the strip and rinse my mouth, that&#x27;s all1&lt;br /&gt;Another good product from crest :)</li>
    <li> worked for me, I still get complements many months after use</li>
    <li> I feel like this product was a huge waste of money. I would see slight results after taking off the strips and then as the day went on my teeth went back to their normal color. I wouldn&#x27;t say on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best)my teeth started off at a 5 and never went above a 5.5-6 after following all the instructions and finishing off the box.  I have started using hydrogen peroxide regularly and I see better results using that alone on a daily basis (and it&#x27;s much cheaper) I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who really want to see a difference. I feel this product might be better for touch-ups or those who already have fairly white teeth.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does not seem to make my teeth sensitive and it does whiten. It beats going to the dentist for whitening.</li>
    <li> I used 4 or 5 strips now... I didn&#x27;t see the results right after I tear of the strips, but after some while, my family has told me that my teeth looked whiter. Its super easy to use and portable. Like it.</li>
    <li> Love these! Can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> These must have been expired or something because they did not work at all.  When I buy them at CVS I get noticeably whiter teeth so I don&#x27;t think I will order this product on Amazon anymore.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will, I will be sharing it to maintain the white.  Don&#x27;t want to go back to the yellowing phase.&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS INTENDED!</li>
    <li> I bought these as an experiment because I&#x27;ve been thinking about having professional whitening done.  Before purchasing I was worried about tooth sensitivity and that it wouldn&#x27;t work well enough to be worth either the cost or the pain.  But for me I only experienced mild sensitivity on the first two days of use.  After that I had no pain.  And on the first day I noticed a difference and now my teeth are a tolerable tooth color (whitish maybe, not perfect but pretty darn good), at this point I think I will use one kit about once every six months.  I am not a heavy coffee drinker but I do drink a lot of tea and occasionally smoke cigars.  I pretty much never drink soda though so depending on your diet you might have different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of research and from my reading I am under the impression that these strips don&#x27;t harm your teeth or make them more susceptible to stains after use, as some rumors might have you believe.  I you are worried about damage to your teeth try a fluoride rinse after each use, it certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a change int eh whiteness of my teeth. But FYI, not everyone around you will be attenuated to it! It&#x27;s good for personal confidence and enjoyment when you look in the mirror, but don&#x27;t expect a ton of comments on your teeth! If you want compliments, buy a nice suit or piece of jewelry.</li>
    <li> I tried these, but had to return them after a few days. They didn&#x27;t fit on my bottom teeth, and a visible white line was starting to show on my bottom canines. I decided to quit the treatment, seeing as I&#x27;d end up looking so silly at the end of it. On top of this, I&#x27;d get very, very sensitive teeth, like someone was running a high voltage through them nonstop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all, but I understand it works for many people.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty well. It wont do miracles but it definitely whitened a few shades. If you want the results to last you need to make sure you keep brushing twice a day or they will go back to their original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as their use goes, they were easy enough to apply and did not bother me at all while using. Once you take them off you will have a little residue to remove but it really wasn&#x27;t an inconvenience.</li>
    <li> These products are too expensive</li>
    <li> The performance is the same no matter where you buy them but they are much cheaper on Amazon than in your local pharmacy and yes these work unlike age defying creams that I talked about in previous reviews.</li>
    <li> I only use these once or twice a week. I don&#x27;t drink red wine, and only a couple cups of coffee a day, and even some of that as iced coffee with a straw. So that seems to be enough. I notice lots of older people have yellowed teeth and mine look much better than theirs. I use them last thing at night after last snack and teeth brushing. I use my fingernail to push them in between the teeth good once they&#x27;re on. That way the whitening effect gets the whole tooth not just on the surface on the front. I watch TV or finish up on the computer for 30 minutes and remove them. I rub my teeth with tissue to get off the excess residue and then rinse. Voila! I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 rating because you do have to do it regularly; it&#x27;s not 3 shades instantly.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time on my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s not like the original formula which was fantastic. This one is hard to get off your teeth easily and some people need to do it a second time to get the best results. But over all very good product. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product,and will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> they do work.ready to buy again</li>
    <li> These work really well! Today was my fifth day using them and my teeth are already several shades whiter - I can once again smile with confidence! I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain except for when I left the strips on a few minutes too long - I generally have pretty sensitive teeth so I was worried that the strips would bother me but nothing so far! I would definitely recommend these and I will be purchasing them again in the future.</li>
    <li> The adhesive on the product is extremely poor.  I needed to buy a second box to get the recommended 14 days.  Not at all pleased.  Len Eddinger, tacoma, Washington, (253)564-4808</li>
    <li> I use the normal 3D white tooth paste and my teeth are decently white on a regular basis, but a week or so ago I noticed my teeth looking a little dingy, probably from drinking dark sodas more than I should. So I bought the 3D Glamorous white tooth paste. I could see results after a couple days. Then I thought I should get something that would whiten a bit deeper and stay white for a while rather on a daily basis. I have only used these a couple times, but I totally see a difference! I would recommend this to anyone with white teeth, but need a little pick-me-up. I also tend to get some sensitivity when I whiten and so far so good. If you don&#x27;t experience sensitive teeth than I say go for the Luxe strips. Plus these where $20 cheaper than at my local retailer.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth so I only leave it on for about 15 minutes and surprisingly, I don&#x27;t get that tingly sensitivity or ache. I use it every other day and so far, very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> Great use them 2 x per day!</li>
    <li> I like these strips but my only complaint is the bottom strip barely cover my four front teeth. If the bottom strip was a little bit longer I&#x27;d be completely satisfied. I do see a difference after just 2-3 use. My gums get sensitive easy so I skip a day between uses. I still recommend even though I think Crest the bottom strip is too small.</li>
    <li> They never work as well as they claim, but it&#x27;s cheaper than those tray ones that cost an arm and a leg and don&#x27;t really work much better. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. Just buy these.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying , I don&#x27;t take the time to write a review unless the product is absolutely HORRIBLE or absolutely AMAZING. and this product is AMAZING!!!! I have used these before about 2 years ago,  the first box I used then kept my teeth whitecfor a full year I recently just bought this item because it was starting to fade.It takes about a year to noticeably see fading which is so great !! I am still going through this box I used them once a day for an hour each time for this first week. Then every other day after that. After the first 3 days my teeth were noticeably WHITE!!!! I love this product and will be buying another box in about a year !!:)</li>
    <li> This is something I never would have thought of on my own. I have to say that this product has improved a lot in the years we have been using it. It&#x27;s not as messy on the teeth. It does appear to whiten teeth better than you can get with ordinary daily care. When you use it it feels like a combination of Scotch tape and Saran Wrap on your front teeth (back teeth are not treated).  Leave the strips on top and bottom for thirty minutes. Do it once or twice a day until, mercifully, you run out and your teeth are a little brighter. It doesn&#x27;t taste terrible.You can rinse the gunk off your teeth when you are done with each use. This stuff is much less expensive from Amazon than in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how it goes here: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t you want your teeth to look good for the wedding?\\&quot; Or, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t you care how you look?\\&quot; i just cave in and order this stuff again. I do it maybe twice a year. I don&#x27;t think this is a product that a man would even be aware of on his own.</li>
    <li> okay these white strips work great... people either have really big teeth or they never used white strips before. these strips are only for your smile obviously (the part people see).. they stick well. Its taste like light hydro. peroxide in your mouth. My teeth are sensitive but it doesn&#x27;t make them any more sensitive than normal. I love these because it really does make your teeth look better. Im not doing this to impress anyone but to make my smile stand out more because lately didn&#x27;t feel I was brushing my teeth enough, so I got these. I recommend them for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***for faster whitening.... I use one strip for 30 min. wait an hour and a half. and do it again. so basically twice a day for 7 days. Not bad!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:) the strips can be bigger though, hopefully crest wont be so stingy with the product later down the road.&lt;br /&gt;just buy it !</li>
    <li> I was definitely a little skeptical about trying these after reading some bad reviews but  I decided to give them a shot. This is the first time I have ever tried any type of whitening product and I&#x27;m so happy this is the product I chose to use! I&#x27;ve only used three applications so far and my teeth are at least 1-2 shades whiter already! My teeth are a little sensitive after use but nothing that&#x27;s horribly painful. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my teeth look like after I finish the box!!</li>
    <li> My teeth seem to clean up very well with this product. I love it! about two weeks before prom, I was half way through (7 strips) and My teeth looked noticeably cleaner. Its not extremely white, but it has a natural clean look. I wear them more then the recomoended time of 30 min sometimes, to get the most out of the strips.</li>
    <li> It is amazing whitening strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they didnt ship it carefully cus the cartoon was damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish next time recieve it in a good look</li>
    <li> I bought these and actually used level 4-I believe, but either way they work pretty well.  However, my teeth are sensitive and hurt afterwards :(  I notice if I leave them on for 30 minutes, I&#x27;m usually fine.  But, if I leave the strips on for 45 minutes--forget it---they become very sensitive.  I used them for about a week, and my boyfriend said he noticed a difference.  I did too.  I work in television, so it&#x27;s important for me to have pearly whites.  My teeth were getting very yellow, and I do think these strips help get em a few shades whiter.  However, be prepared for your teeth to ache afterwards.  Don&#x27;t keep the strips on too long!</li>
    <li> I started using these strips on recommendation of my dentist after a cleaning.  They are easy to put on and stay in place very well compared to the early versions of the crest white strips which slid around easy.  You only have to do it once a day too!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because my teeth are a little short of perfect! After using all 14 treatments, I have to say that other people have noticed that my teeth have gotten whiter so thats definitely a plus. Although my teeth weren&#x27;t perfect, they weren&#x27;t the worst either so don&#x27;t expect to see miraculous results although you definitely will notice whiter teeth after 3-4 days. I see a lot of people complain about the pain that comes with it, I didn&#x27;t experience any pain but it is a little uncomfortable during the half hour you wear the strips, at least you know it&#x27;s working lol. I will be ordering these again in the future! Satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> the price is such a huge difference I will never shop in drugstores again for this merchandise. I&#x27;ve saved dollars</li>
    <li> I had not used this type of product for several years and am delighted that they stay on easily.  I saw results in just a few days.  Will keep using it occasionally if stains return to my teeth.</li>
    <li> The box did not contain the amount of product presented.</li>
    <li> I really like the improved design which grips your teeth.  You get noticeable results in the first uses, but it seems to me the results don&#x27;t last as long as the dentists&#x27; treatments.  Additionally, you have to consider that the strip only covers a fraction of your tooth surface, so it&#x27;s more of a maintenance product that a full on cosmetic improvement.</li>
    <li> love it. works as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
    <li> I love Crest brand and all of their whitening systems. This one is no different. It delivers results quickly and very noticeable. My advice: use as directed and you&#x27;ll see the results!!</li>
    <li> They make my teeth super sensitive. Breathing through my mouth hurts me now. I&#x27;ve used a different kind before and they where better. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I would buy and use these again, however, they made my teeth super sensitive. They increased the whitening of the teeth 10 fold, which was a huge plus it just hurt to drink or eat anything. I would suggest using them before you go to bed.</li>
    <li> These stick to teeth easily, and I had visible results in a couple of days, the before and after pictures made me very happy.  I had not tried a product like this in years because the last time I did my teeth were miserably sensitive but not with this product.  I noticed no added sensitivity for cold or hot products.  I was very pleased and will purchase again to maintain the whiter smile.  I smoked for a long time, quit 9 years ago, and I drink coffee and diet sodas daily and it still brightened up my teeth.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, the difference appears after about using the half of the pack, the only problem with it is the whiteness doesn&#x27;t last for long .. for me 5 months maximum and I need to repeat the process again.</li>
    <li> you can see results and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth numb at all. however, there was only a small change in the color of my teeth and i was a bit disappointed because i was expecting a bigger change. would buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest strips at least 5 times, about every 18 months or so.  The old ones used to really slide around on your teeth and probably cost some effectiveness.  Although I did get noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These, with Advanced Seal, really stay in place.  They don&#x27;t seem to foam up as much and are harder to take off after the 30 minutes.  They&#x27;re also smaller than the old strips and the bottom and top both come in one pack versus having the upper and lower in separate packs.  The older ones used to cover more of the inside of my teeth, while these only slightly fold under my top teeth.  No real impact as only my dentist sees the inside of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are more effective than the basic strips, and 14 days probably makes a difference as well.  I&#x27;d gone longer in between this time, so my teeth were probably dingier and are pretty white now.  I have veneers on two teeth due to a skateboarding incident when I was a kid, and my teeth are now slightly whiter than those.  The veneers were set to my teeth whiteness when I got them maybe 6 years ago so these strips got them to slightly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth seem to have gotten more sensitive over time, so I did notice sensitivity during those days I was using these.  But as soon as I finished, it was gone the next day.</li>
    <li> White strips are a good concept but I did not see all that much of a difference, not worth the weird feeling you get in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Using the whitestrips every day, I saw a slight difference in the color of my teeth. My teeth were not that discolored to begin with, and I wanted a slight boost so it did the job. However, I thought that the  3D white would do a better job than the original, and I&#x27;ve found that it hasn&#x27;t really made much of a difference (I&#x27;ve also tried the original). These are great if you want to see a slight difference in your teeth in a short amount of time, but don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle product.</li>
    <li> It took about 2 weeks for it to arrive, and the packaging was totally crushed but the strips where fine. For me, shipping was very expensive. Theese things doesn&#x27;t really matter though because i&#x27;ve seen a result after using about tree strips, and this package comes with 14 sets.</li>
    <li> My teeth jut naturally have a yellowish tint, and after years of different whitening toothpastes failing to whiten my teeth, I decided to turn to the whitestrips. I have heard great things about them, and after using them I completely understand why! I LOVED these whitestrips and they actually did work. It is a little bit of a chore to make sure that you put them on everyday but as long as you remember and keep them on for the entire 30 minutes, you will see results. My teeth now are super white that people actually notice the difference and sometimes comment on it. Based on the success that I&#x27;ve had with these, not only would I buy them again, buy I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as it used to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and have drunk coffee for 15 years.  Teeth are fairly yellow -- not horrible, but certainly not bright white.  Never tried whitening before.  Product is easy to use and didn&#x27;t cause any real discomfort.  The result I would describe is that my teeth are a paler shade of yellow.  The very front teeth seemed to get the whitest, the incisors the least.  Certainly better than nothing, but not anything that someone would notice unless you pointed it out ot them.  Perhaps they will get slightly whiter the next time I try.</li>
    <li> I have only been using these whitestrips for a week and I already see a HUGE difference! I took a picture every day since I have been using them and the difference between today and last week is phenomenal. Almost all of my close friends and family have noticed the difference. I would highly recommend using these whitestrips.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders but I ran out great price</li>
    <li> Product got to me on time. But I only used one strip bc I wasnt warned that it would hurt. Apparently u have to start using a special toothpaste about a month before so ur teeth arent so sensitive. I haven&#x27;t been able to use the rest.</li>
    <li> I use these once a year and find the color stays true until the next year.  They are not hard on my teeth (or gums), are easy to put on and take off, and brighten my smile.</li>
    <li> Really works! Got rid of stains and I have a brighter smile no doubt.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth hurt...yikes. The old formula did not do this.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic and it is so much better than the older ones, it stays where you put it.</li>
    <li> I have to preface this review with the fact that I use these sporadically, so I don&#x27;t use them every day/follow the instructions correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve used the Professional Effects before and they worked wonders with the same sporadic use. These did NOT live up to my expectations and I barely saw a difference in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the extra money for the Professional Effects.</li>
    <li> The strips makes your breath smell terrible</li>
    <li> I thought nothing could help my teeth, they were so stained with years of drinking tea and red wine. I looked old and tired and I hated to have my picture taken. I hated to smile.  So naturally the first thing I would notice about people was how bright and white their teeth were.  One day I noticed how white my brothers teeth are and he told me that he uses Crest 3D White strips.  I never thought that all those &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; quick fixes would really work but I gave them a try and after the first few days I noticed a big difference and was so surprised and extremely happy.  I really thought that there was nothing that I could do about my stained teeth other than spending $$$ at the dentist.  I would and I do highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Qtipsview</li>
    <li> I liked this product because the instructions are very easy to comprehend and follow. The strips are very well packed. I just didn&#x27;t like the aftertaste. Also didn&#x27;t like the fact that you have to do multiple sesions for whitening. If you live a fast paced life and don&#x27;t have enough time to spend at least 30 minutes whitening your teeth, this is not your product, specially if you have to deal with customers at work.  Other than that,  it does it&#x27;s job great.</li>
    <li> Noticed my teeth were a shade lighter after only two uses! For someone who has struggled with teeth discoloration for years, this is a miracle. Definitely leave my teeth sensitive, but goes away after a few hours, and is completely worth it. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I just have received this product and tried it immediately.  After a few minutes the pain came.  OMG my poor teeth are aching so bad, the nerve pain is awful.  Not a good product, seems it&#x27;s way too harsh for my teeth.  I&#x27;m very sad.</li>
    <li> They came quickly and work great!</li>
    <li> These arrived pretty beat up but the contents seemed okay.  Then when I tried to peel off the strips, the plastic came off with them.  Had to use a tweezer to get them off.  They seem to work okay, but I think they are quite old.  Will order from another supplier next time.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest products for many years but I haven&#x27;t used whitening strips in several.  The last time I whitened my teeth was about 3 or 4 years ago when they still sold the original Crest strips.  These new strips are a HUGE improvement compared to the old ones.  The whitening power scale is very helpful, these level 3 strips had good power but didn&#x27;t give me any sensitivity whatsoever.  The Advanced Seal Technology is amazing... the strips no longer slip and slide around on your teeth, seep whitening liquid into your mouth, OR make you drool like crazy.  I could go about my normal day with these on for just 30 minutes for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend these strips and also suggest buying them here on Amazon as I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better price in any store (Safeway, Rite-Aid, Fred Meyer etc...).</li>
    <li> Much cheaper alternative to my $85.00 Dental cleaning alternative....for lightly normal wear and tear stains...(No nicotine or excessive cofee....).....A perfect Gift!</li>
    <li> Crest 3D Whitestrips works.</li>
    <li> This is my second box, after have stunning results on my first box I decided to go on with another while I was away in college. The second box did not work as well as the first but I guess it helped prevent stains. Keep in mind, these do work, but they will cost you and will cause tooth sensitivity when used daily. I will not use another box for awhile. Remember, don&#x27;t expect celebrity style teeth, but expect to have a very nice smile afterwards!</li>
    <li> Um, all I can say is that they work, and after you&#x27;ve accomplished the shade you want, then you just use once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth were whiter on the second day. These strips are easy to use and work very well. This new set of strips sticks to your teeth nicely - they are much easier to use than the original Crest Whitestrips. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> At 57 years old, my teeth were starting to appear yellow and dull, I tried whitening toothpastes for a bit with not much success so I thought I would give these a try. I settled on this particular treatment(3) just to level set myself in case of any sensitivity to the product. Well, I must say after three days I did start to notice a small amount of change and after the two weeks my teeth look great. They are not 100% white, but are many shades closer to white than the yellow that they were. I am going to give my mouth a few weeks and then try out level 4 to see how much whiter my teeth get. Crest, thanks for a product that actually does what it states.</li>
    <li> Works well, not sure if it lasts as long as it says though.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have (semi)sensitive teeth, and my hygenist recommended this as an alternative to professional whitening. I did not notice any increased sensitivity until days 10-11. The increase in sensitivity was mild and completely bearable, and resolved immediately after I discontinued use (after the 14th day). My teeth are much whiter &amp; brighter now. Even my grandmother noticed when we went to visit her on a trip home for my wedding shower! I will use this product again (right before my wedding) and recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I use these often. I get compliments daily on how white my teeth are. They are easy to apply. I apply on my way out the door when I arrive at work I take them off.</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal are great!  They brightened my teeth very fast.  The best on the market.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is a good alternative to having your teeth Professionally whitened. Everyone compliments your teeth and are surprised to learn you did it at home without spending a wad of money.</li>
    <li> So far 3 of the 5 packets that I opened had no adhesive.  I have ordered before and liked this product.  I wonder if shipping out of date strips.  Very disappointing.  I would like to return including the bad ones but have no idea of recourse since I opened.</li>
    <li> Many people seemed to have problems with the sensitivity this product causes, however this is not my problem. The product definitely whitened my teeth, but the problem was it whitened them unevenly, and i do not mean one tooth was whiter than the other, i mean there was a visible divide in my tooth between the whitened portion and the dingier portion. I had high hopes for this product due to the fact it costed fifty dollars in a drug store, and was needless to say disappointed. I definitely will not be buying this product again any time soon. My suggestion for those interested in buying this, save your money and try a quicker, more natural option like lemon juice and baking soda. Even though the whitening strips didn&#x27;t do a good job i have tried the 3d white tooth pastes and they work (or at least evenly whiten my teeth), but i think i would be a smart decision to try other methods of teeth bleeching before wasting your time and money on this product.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well to spruce up your teeth, but they hurt! I had to stop using them for a few days because my teeth ached so badly... plus they&#x27;re fairly expensive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  This product was okay.</li>
    <li> I received the product before the promised date and the package was in good shape. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I used these strips every day and leave them on for more than half hour each time, and it seemed to do the trip.  My teeth are whiten by 80%.  I would use this product again,</li>
    <li> After using this product, my teeth felt really sensitive.  My teeth did appear whiter but not &amp;#34;amazingly white&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m probably never buying this again, it irritates my teeth too much.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as others I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Great and Crest 3D strips work and worth money.</li>
    <li> Product came right on time and exactly as described.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> Really do works, it might make your teeth sensative the first time u used them but its worth it. I haven&#x27;t seen these at the stores no more so now i have to order them online, what i also used all the time its the vivid toothpaste. That keeps them up to date on not getting yellowish. Give it a try :-)</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, but I actually saw some results after the 14 days of treatment. my teeth were not affected, so I totally recommend this product to anyone. try out this option first and then, depending on your teeth sensibility you can go for some stronger (4 or 5 on the whitening scale).</li>
    <li> I have never had extremely yellow teeth, and when they did yellow, I have used drugstore products like these to brighten them up.&lt;br /&gt;Use religiously, but careful - don&#x27;t go over the time suggested, else your teeth will hurt, you&#x27;ll skip a day, and the pilgrimage to whitest whites will lengthen and exhaust. Boo.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter uses these strips and the whitening of her teeth is very noticeable. I&#x27;ve tried to buy her less expensive brands, but she refuses to use anything but Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Strips.</li>
    <li> Noticed some brightening but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I would buy this again. I did not notice a big difference.</li>
    <li> I feel like it could have worked a little better. My teeth aren&#x27;t that yellowed, so I anticipated that the product would make them a glowing white, but it didn&#x27;t do too much for me. I bought it at a reduced price. So glad I didn&#x27;t pay regular price for it! Not worth it!</li>
    <li> they do just as they claim. whiten my teeth after using the 4-5 times.</li>
    <li> Great results after 14 days, some light gum and teeth ache first two days, after that it was just fine but it depends on each person&#x27;s pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product after using 2 boxes over the span of 8 months (2 30 days sessions) my teeth ended up more yellow than when I started.  I felt like it was a waste of money.  I now get my teeth whitened at dentist for a very similar price!</li>
    <li> This is the best. I maintain once a week, after the first box.  I love these strips. My teeth are so white now. I am a tea drinker and thought nothing would take it off.  I was wrong... :)  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are great! My teeth are almost too white. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to go any whiter. I&#x27;m honestly not sure that&#x27;s possible, though. I&#x27;ve had numerous people compliment me and buy these based on my recommendation. I drink a lot of coffee and you&#x27;d never be able to tell. I&#x27;m pretty sure I smile more because of it. I use them once a year and that&#x27;s plenty. Amazon also typically has a much better price than CVS or Target.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure these strips would work as great as the advanced vivid ones I use to use but I was wrong. Didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity while using these vs. the advanced vivid. It was definitely a plus with the grip, therefore I was able to clean or just simply go about my day without having to worry if the strip would go loose. I also liked the fact that you can drink water while using these. As for my teeth, it&#x27;s the whitest they&#x27;ve ever been. Definitely will be buying again :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what I expected, which was the professional strength treatment I have come to expect from Crest. Info I read before ordering said &amp;#34;packaging may differ&amp;#34; and the note that came on the shipping invoice said it was the &amp;#34;same product, which now reads luxe glamorous white&amp;#34; but the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; label also said whitens better than whitening toothpaste - I thought I was purchasing the stronger whitening strips that I&#x27;ve previously purchased. Lesson learned. I will examine labeling more carefully and will not order from outlets where labeling can change. I don&#x27;t think these worked as well as the type I usually purchase. Also, the actual product box was severely compacted, it looked like it had been put through a flattener.</li>
    <li> Wow. Can&#x27;t wait to try more! Instantly brighter even fit a coffee drinker!</li>
    <li> I would like whiter teeth, but I am always uncertain about all the products out there.  I trust crest.  I have used their whitening products before and have been pleased.  I feel this is a good enough product.  It doesn&#x27;t make wild claims, although the name seems to imply it.</li>
    <li> works just a little bit, will just make your teeth shiny and not brighter, so i your teeth are yellow; they will be shinny....... but still yellow</li>
    <li> I was contemplating getting work done on my teeth to whiten my smile. My teeth are stained and yellowish due to my heavy tea, coffee, and dark soda consumption .  I have decided to get the whitening strips a try first. So far, I am happy with the results. I have only used them for five days now. I have noticed a difference in my teeth. I am excited to see how my teeth are after I complete the full required 14 days.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase these because the product had some good reviews.  I used to drink coffee and tea a lot so I had some staining but I have stopped drinking them for the past 3 months, so I figured my teeth would get white from this product.  I did experience a little sensitivity but I just stopped using the strips for a day or so and it went away.  After using almost all the strips (I have 2 left) I realized my teeth didn&#x27;t get any whiter.  I think I would try level 5 if I ever buy these again!</li>
    <li> Made my teeth whiter and brighter, but not unnaturally so. Satisfied overall. In the past, when I used Crest strips, I could taste more of the chemical taste. So, I am wondering is these were not as potent.</li>
    <li> promptly as described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time to go to a dentist and pay hundreds to whiten my teeth. My teeth are also super sensitive and these worked great! My teeth were a little sensitive the next day, but not nearly as bad as when I had previously used Rembrandt products.</li>
    <li> I used these to get the little stains off my teeth after I had braces. I saw results immediately. I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I was truly amazed because this product worked as well as my much more expensive teeth whitening from the dentist! And it was only a 30 minute process for each application. The strips went on easily and stuck very well. I will be using this product from now on to whiten my teeth!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive but very gentle and great white teeth very HAPPY WITH A HAPPY WHITE SMILE</li>
    <li> These work well, definitely made a difference. Take before and after pictures with something else that is white to compare with, the change can be hard to detect from day to day but OTHER people noticed, and my dentist even commented on how white my teeth were! I do not smoke but am an avid coffee drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a less positive note, these do not work any better than any other whitening strips I have used. They all seem to work about the same. Past experience: lasts about two years.</li>
    <li> They never let me down, these white strips are always going to be the best ones in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone always notices the difference right away. Love them.</li>
    <li> I saw results after the first few days</li>
    <li> I am a coffee lover and over the years I am lucky to have kept my teeth pearly white. But then, recently I started noticing that my teeth are turning yellow. I have a sensitive teeth but I tried this product. I get awfully sensitive after removing the strip but not for a long time though. So what I do is two apply a thin layer of Vaseline on areas that I felt sensitive before putting on the strips and I do not get that sensitive much; there is still a ltlle sensitivity but not so bad. I recommend this product because it really whitens the teeth in just 2 applications. actually I just used half of it because my teeth are back to being white again.</li>
    <li> This thing works wonders but I have to use it every other day because it makes my teeth really sensitive. So sensitive that its hard to breathe or eat sometimes. Other than sensitivity problems this really brightens your teeth. Huge difference. Literally yellow to white.</li>
    <li> this always works for me.  i re-do between 9-15 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for those who have bonding:&lt;br /&gt;i have bonding in my front 2 teeth.  my past dentist  said there is no way to whiten them.  even suggested if i want white teeth i have to do veneers.  if only i wasn&#x27;t broke, i would&#x27;ve done it.  i&#x27;m so glad i didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;i just found another dentist who was willing to just redo my bonding as needed (last time was 3 years ago)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then on a regular basis, because i drink coffee, i just use this whitening strips for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I want these to work so bad but they make my teeth hurt so bad for like 2-3 days after each use. I&#x27;ve gotten through like 6 sets in 2 months. I don&#x27;t know how someone could do these for 14 days straight. That would be pure torture.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use another whitening product after this one.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended. Within 3 days, I got to see the effects. However. It may cause your teeth to be sensitive as it happened to me</li>
    <li> These are really good strips. Better than others I&#x27;ve used as they stay on the teeth for as long as you want.</li>
    <li> I used this a few years back, but I never wrote a review so here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did its job well, and I would give it a 5/5 except that it peels off a little on the back side of the teeth even if you kept your tongue still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note that isn&#x27;t too much of a big deal, but it made my teeth a bit sensitive.</li>
    <li> It works well for me!</li>
    <li> These Crest Whitestrips are a real knockout! I&#x27;m getting results that compare with my dentist-made whitening trays, at least in the short run. And at this price, I can definitely afford to use them every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, my teeth have no caps, crowns, antibiotic staining, or other major concerns that would require the skills of a good cosmetic dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the ease of use, cost, results.</li>
    <li> This works super well! The reason why I gave it four stars is because on the bottom part of the teeth, there is still yellow because the strip gets loose due to the amount of spit on the bottom. However, I smile with only my top teeth showing so it is okay!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see all the great results that other people do.  I have pretty white teeth naturally, but I wanted a little extra boost.. I don&#x27;t seem to see any difference.</li>
    <li> no results, dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> Little change, but even little change is something!</li>
    <li> SO PAINFUL!!!!! My poor teeth were in so much pain, I had to discontinue halfway through, even after applying every other day. Four stars because they do whiten very well.</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> These are great! They stick better and whiten best!</li>
    <li> really works just have to repeat more often than stated</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. I can tell the difference. Extremely easy to use and not uncomfortable. My dentist said he could tell the difference too.</li>
    <li> You can wear these longer than the 30 minutes and get the results of the two hour ones! I wear them for 3 hours, and have bright white teeth. I can now save the rest of them for when they start to get dingy again. They stick well, and are able to be worn while you do almost anything. I am a huge coffee and tea drinker so my teeth get dingy around the edges very quickly, but one wear out of these for a few hours and I&#x27;m back to shinning white smile. They didn&#x27;t aggitate my gums at all like some of the two hour wears do.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect these to work. I recently started getting bothered by how yellow my teeth were looking when I was wearing lipstick or in photos. I thought after the week of using these (meaning all 14 strips, using them twice a day) that there would only be minimal change. However, I actually was able to notice a slight difference after the first strip was used. After the third strip, I was amazed. When I put lipstick on, my teeth did not appear yellow at all. I am only on strip four at the moment, but I am already very impressed and I am excited to see where my teeth will be at at the end of the 14 strips. Definitely planning on buying these once a year to keep this up. I thought I would have to do these often, but was thrilled when I heard the white lasts permanently, and that it can be used annually. for $35, I am definitely going to continue buying these. Buy them!</li>
    <li> Not the top of the line, but these are MUCH better than the Classic. They grip onto your teeth so you have to really pull to get them off. The gel works just as well as the Classic but because it stays on better, it has more time to work. With the Classic I always felt like the gel would foam up and slide off my teeth, and I&#x27;d have to spit it out. The Advanced Seal keeps it all on the teeth where it should be. These are definitely worth the price difference over the Classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t use the entire box, I&#x27;ll use maybe 4 strips and space them out every 2 or 3 days because my teeth will get sensitive. 4 strips is about all I need to boost the whiteness back to where it should be. I drink coffee or tea daily, and wine on weekends, so my teeth stain over a matter of months. I only need a few strips to bring them back to white and I save the rest for the next round of whitening.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid teeth whitening strips. They are easy to put on, they don&#x27;t taste weird, and they do a nice job making your smile a little whiter. I think I would need to buy another boy if I wanted my teeth to be more white. Overall, great product, great seller.</li>
    <li> This product was fine. I would purchase it again. I may even buy the next level up. It does what is says it will. Effects last for about a year. If you drink alot of coffee like me, than the effects last like 6 months if that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t drink tea or coffee or smoke. I brush and floss ever day and yet, I have yellow teeth. I think this may be why these strips didn&#x27;t work very much for me. I think the yellowness is genetic more than &#x27;stains.&#x27; Either way, it&#x27;s annoying to spend money on something that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> These strips adhere really well to the teeth without slipping off.  It&#x27;s easy to talk and even drink while keeping these strips on.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> These made my teeth really sore the first 3 uses however seemed to get better with time!</li>
    <li> After only three days of using this, there was a huge difference. I drink at least 2 cups of coffee per day (hello caffeine addict) and it was definitely taking a toll on my teeth. I will try to update after the full 14 days again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more whitening effect. My teeth look only a tiny bit whiter. It did not hurt to use it though. However I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have found that swishing hydrogen peroxide in my mouth for 30 seconds does about the same job...and it saves scads of money.</li>
    <li> The first two times will probably hurt but stick to it and it will work amazing results, I get complements on my &#x27;&#x27;super white&#x27;&#x27; teeth all the time now</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all, and i got super white.  It&#x27;s the best one&#x27;s out there.  I wouldn&#x27;t go any stronger, it&#x27;ll hurt your gums.</li>
    <li> i saw the difference after 2 weeks. i&#x27;m happy. i will continue to use the, b/c i drink coffee everyday!!</li>
    <li> My teeth did whiten after 2 weeks of use, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening out there</li>
    <li> They are just great for whitening your teeth!!!</li>
    <li> I chose the 3d strips based on past experience.  In the past I was very happy with the results.  This time however, they did not whiten my teeth very much.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a result of shelf life or not. With so many whitening products it may be time to try another.  Too bad, I had used Crest whitening strips for several years, once a year.</li>
    <li> they worked a little.. for better results go to a dentist for whitening treatment. :)</li>
    <li> I used to swear by Crest Whitestrips Premium, with those strips you literally saw results in 3 days, and dramatically white results after the end of 14 days, which, for me, lasted almost two years before I decided to use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros for the Advanced Vivid is that they adhere to your teeth better than the old strips and there is less sensitivity, at least for me.  However, there is hardly any difference, if at all, in coloration.  These strips are not worth $30, I have not tried any of the other Crest 3d white, but my advice is to search out another brand, or if you can find them online, purchase an old box of the Crest Whitestrips Premium.</li>
    <li> I was wishing for a more noticeable difference, but still happy with the purchase.  Teeth became sensitive and sore the day after using.</li>
    <li> On sale, these strips are a great value. Stay on your teeth well, without sliding around. Based on their color chart, I was almost 4 shades lighter by the end. I have used these in the past and know that I don&#x27;t get sensitive teeth or gums while using them, but I know others complain about this.</li>
    <li> I use these strips twice a year and they work really well at keeping my teeth looking very white!</li>
    <li> It did a very nice job and we did not even use the whole package. After the first application,there was a big difference.</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  I&#x27;m seeing good results in just 1 week.</li>
    <li> My teeth is in very good shape but this product hurts my teeth just after one use.  I tried contacting the seller to return it they told me for sanitary reasons they won&#x27;t allow it.  This box comes individually wraped I don&#x27;t see why I can&#x27;t return the rest, they can probably return it back to Crest.  It&#x27;s an expensive product and they don&#x27;t allow rooms for customer reviews to improve their product?  Unless you don&#x27;t mind loosing your money and have painful teeth for two days, than buy it.</li>
    <li> I decided to use the 4 pack of the 2 hour whitening strips to make my teeth whiter. After my first use, while my teeth did in fact become a lot brighter, and pearlier, the strips left my teeth with incredible discomfort and teeth sensitivity. I am not happy with this product at all. I want to keep my teeth as healthy as possible, and so my best advice would be to not use this product or any teeth whitening product at all. Keep your body natural and limit what you put into it to make your teeth darker and yellowy. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. It is extremely painful. And by the way, my teeth are not normally sensitive at all. I hardly ever experience pain in my teeth from drinking too hot or cold foods. This product left my teeth in incredible pain. And I had only used it once, for the directed time of two hours.</li>
