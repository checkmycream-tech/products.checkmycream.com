<li> I was going to give it to a friend for her birthday but thought I would try something out of the basket first and decided to keep it because I felt it was average, not great.</li>
<li> Average products included, nothing special and terribly misleading since the box was not velvet or anything other than red and cardboard.</li>
<li> If you want something that really pampers, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
<li> and you could hardly smell anything, but some people like that.  </li>
<li> The boxing of the package was rotten and it was broken and leaking when it arrived.  </li>
<li> It doesmt have any smell, poor quality,, what a waste of money..., the brand itself is bad...</li>

    <li> Great products. Makes a perfect gift. Excellent packaging. Arrived on time.</li>

I think a lot of these are sent as gifts and of course the recipients are not going to tell you it was substandard, at least most wont. I think it&#x27;s way overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> bought for my Aunt who had just lost her husband.  She loved it.  Delivery was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. She loves it. It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s a Great Gift. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this gift set. It arrived quickly and in excellent shape. The recipients have been extremely pleased with the product.</li>

    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift exchange and felt like I got a great price. The bottles are decent size, not the little travel size.&lt;br /&gt;But since this was a gift for someone else I can&#x27;t tell you the quality of the products!</li>
    <li> Great scent, great seller, excellent</li>

    <li> Sent to Arizona for a 83rd birthday. She was thrilled!  She said it was beautiful and the scent was fabulous. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> It was ok. The fragrance was very light and you could hardly smell anything, but some people like that.  The bubble bath made bubbles. I would say that the basket was comparable to something you would get from Walmart for $11.99 at Christmas time.  I was going to give it to a friend for her birthday but thought I would try something out of the basket first and decided to keep it because I felt it was average, not great. It did look pretty though.</li>
    <li> Smelled awesome. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow - somehow I expected something nicer.  This I could have picked up anywhere.  It&#x27;s solidly OK, but I&#x27;m not over-the-moon at all.</li>
    <li> This was a gift I ordered in the uk and had it delivered to my American friend. Great service and the delivery worked out loads cheaper and you are no longer able to post liquid items so it worked out brilliantly. My friend loved the gift it arrived within 2 days and she said she loved the items and the smell was amazing and made her skin feel nice</li>
    <li> Very nice gift package.  Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great gift box.  Love it!</li>
