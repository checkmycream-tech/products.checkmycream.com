### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is great lotion!</li>
      <li>Auto shipment works perfect.</li>
      <li>Smells great too!</li>
      <li>Best lotion around!</li>
      <li>Take my word for it, this is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>so i was very happy to get it on amazon...</li>
      <li>this is the best after sun lotion!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t promise it&#x27;s ideal for everyone, but this lotion has impressed every person who has tried it from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is very very good.  </li>
      <li>, so I&#x27;m very glad that I found it here!</li>
      <li>Great for burns.</li>
      <li>It is a great lotion.  </li>
      <li>My sister-in-law gave me a bottle of this lotion, and I loved it.</li>
      <li>I am from Arizona and have had my fair share of sunburns.  </li>
      <li>So, while I recommend the Banana Boat Aloe After Sun as a good product I cannot recommend purchasing from Amazon.</li>
      <li>&quot; (really freckles growing together) in the summer, but found it&#x27;s just the best moisturizer for my skin year-round.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>and I kept reapplying and used most of the bottle.</li>
      <li>i was no longer able to find it in my drug store</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased the four pack</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>This lotion is great for treating a modest case of sunburn - however I use it as a moisturizer on face, neck and arms every morning.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for fair skinned people.</li>
      <li>After Sun Lotion is among the very best few.</li>
      <li>If they&#x27;re not the same stuff, then it may be something about how \\&quot;After Sun\\&quot; lotions are made which creates a great hand &amp; body lotion.</li>
      <li>It is nice and thick and works great during the summers if I ever get burned.</li>
      <li>, if you can find it, the \\&quot;Western Family\\&quot; brand of \\&quot;After Sun Lotion\\&quot; seemed equally good.</li>
      <li>After using a full bottle of this, we were on the search to replace it.  </li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s sunburn is different, but I can tell you I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
      <li>I had to take off a star because they use too much plastic in the pump top and bottle.</li>
      <li>I started using this last year working out back, this lotion is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>It has a light coconut scent mingled with a hint of cocoa butter and the hand pump works very well, ALMOST all the way to the bottom of the bottle!</li>
      <li>Works great year round.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny I would use this over anything.</li>
      <li>My family went to the lake this week and because everyone loved this lotion so much, they used up my entire bottle -</li>
      <li>The availability and price is well worth the shipping.</li>
      <li>It is non-greasy, and my skin soaks it right up.</li>
      <li>This aloe-based lotion does not leave your skin feeling oily or greasy and yet it moisturizes just right.  </li>
      <li>It is terrific after sunning but is also perfect all year round.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that is sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>did exactly as she said.</li>
      <li>Our whole family uses it--teenagers through Grandma!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and now have my whole family using it!  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and has helped with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It is thick, non-greasy, soaks in quickly, and keeps the skin feeling good for hours.</li>
      <li>so when I found out that I could auto-subscribe and just have new bottles delivered to my doorway all my dreams came true.</li>
      <li>so thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>If you use this on a suburn it really prevents you from peeling.</li>
      <li>this stuff on your burn, use the whole</li>
      <li>I kept reapplying every hour or so and the sunburns healed very well without peeling.</li>
      <li>It keeps my tan golden and my skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and we use it year round..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now only using this (no more cortisone or anti-biotics) before I go to bed to keep my finger tips from drying up, cracking and bleeding, and it works better than the drugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for Sunburns, Great for Dry Skin!</li>
      <li>Not oily, soaks in quickly and last</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and doing the auto-subscribe.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to any one who wants soft silky skin.</li>
      <li>I assume it didn&#x27;t hurt simply because it was healing better (and wasn&#x27;t dry).    </li>
      <li>my skin feels soft and looks tan!</li>
      <li>Now I send her several bottles a couple of times a year as a way to say thanks for introducing me to it!</li>
      <li>and it really helps keep my skin moist and soft even after long days in the water and sun.  </li>
      <li>You may have to order it online for all year round use since most local stores only carry here in the Midwest during the summer sun-tan months.</li>
      <li>&quot; everything - the green gels, lotions, and even taking an aloe vera plant and rubbing its goo right on me.  </li>
      <li>I am half Irish, so I have really fair skin and freckles, needless to say...</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t usually burn even though I have light skin, but after a long day outside, my skin gets a little red and dry.</li>
<li> It has a pleasant faint scent and although it&#x27;s thick it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
<li> I have dry skin, and have tried hundreds of crèmes and lotions.</li>
<li> I was also able to stop a burn from being painful and reduce it to a tan.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t found a source for it in a few years now, and didn&#x27;t think to compare labels back when I had both at once.</li>
<li> The last few times I got burnt I used this lotion</li>
<li> In one the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; was crushed and leaking and in the other the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; was a bottle that had previously been opened.  </li>
<li> Hard to find locally in fall/winter.</li>
<li> I burn and put this on and little pain but not nearly like usual, and it stopped me from peeling, even when I started to peel, it stopped it.</li>
<li> The burn peeled a little but became a tan on day 3.</li>
<li> I use this a few times throughout the day to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
<li> and I try to keep a year round tan.  </li>
<li> I use it year round because I&#x27;ve never found anything that moisturizes as well as this product.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve had a few.</li>
<li> but nobody carries this year round</li>
<li> I had a pretty bad sunburn.</li>
<li> and there was VERY little pain.</li>
<li> I usually get this at RiteAid</li>
<li> past Summer (2012)</li>
<li> I usually go through at least 1 bottle a month</li>
<li> I burn..and hardly tan.</li>
<li> I use it everyday whether I am sun tanning or not- great moisturizer.</li>
<li> And, although it seems less expensive to buy the 4 pack from Amazon, the company that fulfills the order for them sends a pre-pack of 3 plus &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; and calls it a pack of 4.  </li>
<li> I ordered and returned all the bottles because in two packs of 4 there was something wrong with the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I am of Irish/American Indian descent and sometimes I burn before I achieve my base tan, until that happens</li>
<li> - it keeps my tan (which I wanted to get), but moisturizes so well that I don&#x27;t have to worry about all of the ugly peeling!!!  </li>

    <li> This is great lotion! I use it after I am out in the sun. It keeps my tan golden and my skin soft &amp; supple. I am of Irish/American Indian descent and sometimes I burn before I achieve my base tan, until that happens I use this a few times throughout the day to keep my skin moisturized. If you use this on a suburn it really prevents you from peeling. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I started using this to keep my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; (really freckles growing together) in the summer, but found it&#x27;s just the best moisturizer for my skin year-round.  I love this stuff and now I have enough for a couple of years.  I had to take off a star because they use too much plastic in the pump top and bottle.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s sunburn is different, but I can tell you I&#x27;m fair skinned and I&#x27;ve had a few. They hurt. The last few times I got burnt I used this lotion and there was VERY little pain. I kept reapplying every hour or so and the sunburns healed very well without peeling. It seemed to properly nourish the skin and keep it moist, even when I forgot to reapply. I assume it didn&#x27;t hurt simply because it was healing better (and wasn&#x27;t dry).    Just got burnt again and am getting this shipped overnight because I can&#x27;t do without. It&#x27;s a big bottle and should last a while. It&#x27;s worth every penny I would use this over anything.</li>
    <li> this is the best after sun lotion!  i was no longer able to find it in my drug store so i was very happy to get it on amazon...i have used this for myself and my kids for years...it is soothing, takes the sting of sunburn away and prevents peeling!</li>
    <li> I am from Arizona and have had my fair share of sunburns.  I have tried \\&quot;Aloe\\&quot; everything - the green gels, lotions, and even taking an aloe vera plant and rubbing its goo right on me.  NOTHING works as well as this lotion!!!  When I sunburn, I tend to blister and this lotion makes it so I don&#x27;t even peel - it keeps my tan (which I wanted to get), but moisturizes so well that I don&#x27;t have to worry about all of the ugly peeling!!!  My family went to the lake this week and because everyone loved this lotion so much, they used up my entire bottle - well, I guess that means its time to stock up!!  :)  Take my word for it, this is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is sometimes hard to find in stores. The availability and price is well worth the shipping.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion so I buy in bulk. Great for burns. I mix my essential oils in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and now have my whole family using it!  Cannot find it anywhere in Canada anymore, so I&#x27;m very glad that I found it here! It is non-greasy, and my skin soaks it right up. It smells nice and we use it year round..not just for after sun. Best lotion around!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for treating a modest case of sunburn - however I use it as a moisturizer on face, neck and arms every morning.</li>
    <li> This is very very good.  It is very easy to use and has helped with dry skin.  I am glad I purchased the four pack</li>
    <li> I like and use the Banana Boat Aloe After Sun on a regular basis - as a moisturizer.  And, although it seems less expensive to buy the 4 pack from Amazon, the company that fulfills the order for them sends a pre-pack of 3 plus &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; and calls it a pack of 4.  I ordered and returned all the bottles because in two packs of 4 there was something wrong with the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34;.  In one the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; was crushed and leaking and in the other the &amp;#34;one extra&amp;#34; was a bottle that had previously been opened.  So, while I recommend the Banana Boat Aloe After Sun as a good product I cannot recommend purchasing from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Banana Boat every day to lotion my body after showers for over 10 years. It is nice and thick and works great during the summers if I ever get burned. I usually go through at least 1 bottle a month so when I found out that I could auto-subscribe and just have new bottles delivered to my doorway all my dreams came true. I highly recommend this product and doing the auto-subscribe.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, and have tried hundreds of crèmes and lotions. Banana Boat Aloe After Sun Lotion is among the very best few. It is thick, non-greasy, soaks in quickly, and keeps the skin feeling good for hours. Every summer, I&#x27;ve been stocking up, to last me through the winter months (when I don&#x27;t see it sold retail in my snowy climate). This 4 pack from Amazon not only solves the seasonal problem, but the price is lower than my wife can get it wholesale at her pharmacy. If you use hand or body lotion, definitely give this a try. I can&#x27;t promise it&#x27;s ideal for everyone, but this lotion has impressed every person who has tried it from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you can find it, the \\&quot;Western Family\\&quot; brand of \\&quot;After Sun Lotion\\&quot; seemed equally good. It may be the same product, but sold at a lower price under the Western Family store brand. I haven&#x27;t found a source for it in a few years now, and didn&#x27;t think to compare labels back when I had both at once. If they&#x27;re not the same stuff, then it may be something about how \\&quot;After Sun\\&quot; lotions are made which creates a great hand &amp; body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years.  I use it year round because I&#x27;ve never found anything that moisturizes as well as this product.  It has a pleasant faint scent and although it&#x27;s thick it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  I keep a bottle in every room and one on my desk at the office!  I wish they sold it in a tube I could carry in my purse!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday whether I am sun tanning or not- great moisturizer. I recommend it to any one who wants soft silky skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. Works great year round. Hard to find locally in fall/winter. Auto shipment works perfect.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law gave me a bottle of this lotion, and I loved it. Not greasy, no overpowering scent. Now I send her several bottles a couple of times a year as a way to say thanks for introducing me to it!</li>
    <li> After using a full bottle of this, we were on the search to replace it.  It is a great lotion.  We have now stocked up.</li>
    <li> I go to the beach often and I try to keep a year round tan.  I&#x27;ve used the after sun lotion for a while now and it really helps keep my skin moist and soft even after long days in the water and sun.  Not oily, soaks in quickly and last so I don&#x27;t have to keep replying,</li>
    <li> This aloe-based lotion does not leave your skin feeling oily or greasy and yet it moisturizes just right.  It is terrific after sunning but is also perfect all year round. It has a light coconut scent mingled with a hint of cocoa butter and the hand pump works very well, ALMOST all the way to the bottom of the bottle! You may have to order it online for all year round use since most local stores only carry here in the Midwest during the summer sun-tan months. Our whole family uses it--teenagers through Grandma!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell enough people about this stuff. A friend turned me on to this product about 10 years ago. I had a pretty bad sunburn. She gave me a bottle and said, \\&quot;Slather this stuff on your burn, use the whole bottle!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did exactly as she said. The sunburned skin soaked this stuff up and I kept reapplying and used most of the bottle. I bought another bottle and did the same thing about 4 hours later and then the next day. (I used two bottles in 2 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: The burn peeled a little but became a tan on day 3. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past Summer (2012) I was also able to stop a burn from being painful and reduce it to a tan. But I also discovered something else, I have been using Cortisones and Anti-Biotic creams for a persistent exzema on my finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While treating my burn, the exzema practically cleared up overnight. I&#x27;m now only using this (no more cortisone or anti-biotics) before I go to bed to keep my finger tips from drying up, cracking and bleeding, and it works better than the drugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for Sunburns, Great for Dry Skin!</li>
    <li> I am half Irish, so I have really fair skin and freckles, needless to say...I burn..and hardly tan. I started using this last year working out back, this lotion is AWESOME. I burn and put this on and little pain but not nearly like usual, and it stopped me from peeling, even when I started to peel, it stopped it. I put it on before I go outside and after I&#x27;m done. Highly recommend for fair skinned people. I usually get this at RiteAid but nobody carries this year round so thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually burn even though I have light skin, but after a long day outside, my skin gets a little red and dry. I apply lotion after I get inside, after a shower and before bed and by the next day, the redness is gone and my skin feels soft and looks tan! No sunburn irritation!</li>
    <li> Use every day as body lotion, after sun bathing, after shower, on vacation.  My husband and I both use it regularly.</li>
