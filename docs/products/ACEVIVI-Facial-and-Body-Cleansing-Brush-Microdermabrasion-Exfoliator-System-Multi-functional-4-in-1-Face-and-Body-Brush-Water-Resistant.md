<li> I have been fighting adult acne the past 6 months and everyone was telling me to get one of these</li>
<li> When you exfoliate your skin you&#x27;re getting all that dead skin off of your face and when you do that it actually opens up the collagen</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>

    <li> I bought the ACEVIVI Portable Multi-functional Facial Pore Cleaner 4-in-1 for my wife because she mentioned that she wanted one when she saw a similar product advertised on TV.  This was considerably cheaper than the one at the store.  My wife is completely happy with it. She uses it daily and can&#x27;t believe how well it helps her skin. But it isn&#x27;t just for use on your face you can also use it to remove calluses on your feet and hands.  My wife couldn&#x27;t be happy with her results her skin looks better and youthful. My wife loves it so much she had to buy one for her sister and her mother. This is definitely worth the money.</li>

    <li> This thing works like a charm. Its done wonders for my skin. I have been fighting adult acne the past 6 months and everyone was telling me to get one of these but I neber could bring myself to drop the nearly 200 bucks I&#x27;d need to spend on a name brand at my local Ulta or whatever so when I saw this one at this price I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and im so glad I did.
