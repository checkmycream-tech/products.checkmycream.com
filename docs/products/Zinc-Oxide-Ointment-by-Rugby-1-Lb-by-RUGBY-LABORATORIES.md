      <li>) rashes better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used it for years for so many skin irritations.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also a better price than any tubes I can find,either on line or in a store</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and service great.</li>
      <li>Was so pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find a jar of it instead of a metal tube.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This protects my skin from sunburn and I apply it to most any skin irritation or flare-ups.</li>
      <li>so very glad that Amazon carries it at such a great price.</li>
      <li>This is great for any kind of skin problem such as rash or prevention of bedsores.</li>
      <li>It will heal just about any rash overnight and is unscented so is great for caregivers with allergies or babies with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really do the trick for me for what I was ailing from skin wise</li>
      <li>Did not have much luck soothing a rash with it but seems like if you specifically needed Zinc Oxide this would be a good product to use.</li>
      <li>Zinc Oxide works for many different things and is very effective on many skin issues.</li>
      <li>Product was fine, but two of the jars were cracked when they arrived.</li>
      <li>Good old zinc oxide!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to have a consistent source at such a fair price.</li>
      <li>Awesome and perf for kids who are super sensitive, it&#x27;s pure and doesn&#x27;t have exta junk.</li>
      <li>I got two of these huge 16 ounce cans for all of $20.</li>
      <li>Have tried this product before, loved it, and will be buying more of this item in the future.</li>
      <li>size cut the cost significantly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more.</li>
      <li>I like being able to get it in a large quantity.</li>
      <li>Applying it in the morning before dressing in your good work or school clothes will only lead to annoyance and frustration.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to find a nice big container of pure zinc oxide without perfumes!</li>
      <li>It takes about a day to be absorbed, but Zinc is actually GOOD for you, as opposed to the aluminum products that are traditionally used in deodorants/antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>Good for noses when skiing, wound protection, the list is long.  </li>
      <li>This was nice and thick, and a great big tub - it was challenging to use at beach since the cream remained sticky and sand got stuck everywhere.  </li>
      <li>The ordering was easy, delivery very timely.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would calm the inflammation on my skin</li>
      <li>worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good-size container that will last my family through the warm summer months.</li>
      <li>The price is certainly right.  </li>
      <li>I also did some research and found that many of the most popular brands of diaper cream (incl triple paste) can have some pretty questionable stuff in them.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery reasonably priced</li>
      <li>This is an old remedy solution from way back to use on skin scrapes and whatever, since zinc oxide is a good antibiotic.</li>
      <li>Desitin or store brands at the same percentage (40) is a much better purchase.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than creams marketed as diaper rash treatments, too!</li>
      <li>Sure enough!</li>
      <li>When I read my invoice the postage (standard shipping) was more than doubled for what the ointment cost.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for because I use this Zinc as an underarm deodorant (Zinc prevents the formation of bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked well, almost as well as the 40% stuff only you had to use it slightly more often (about every 3-4 days after showering instead of around 7 days).  </li>
      <li>Love the product, needs packaged differently for shipment to avoid the lids breaking.</li>
      <li>The big jar will last a good while.</li>
      <li>My teen girls love it as much as I do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Far superior to other brands I have purchased previously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You can use zinc to cure all kinds of skin irritations though I can&#x27;t imagine needing a tub this large except on the changing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We save money buying this large size instead of the tubes.  </li>
      <li>I bought a large canister this time because I run out of it fast.  </li>
      <li>stuff glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry right away</li>
      <li>It is very thick and adhesive and so makes a great wetness barrier used as a diaper cream.</li>
      <li>we really just couldn&#x27;t shake the diaper rash, but our pediatrician sent us to a pediatric dermatologist who said we needed just zinc oxide.  </li>
      <li>Really stays in place.</li>
      <li>Works very well on skin problems.  </li>
      <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t spread well when applied so sparingly, but it doesn&#x27;t really need to.</li>
      <li>This really helps my skin recover on my legs.</li>
      <li>But, as a last resort, I suggested that he try our old favorite zinc oxide.  </li>
      <li>Better than lotions, powders, or other remedies.  </li>
      <li>I am using the leftovers as diaper cream - I think this tub will last a nice long time.</li>
      <li>Our local pharmacy stopped providing special ordering on this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and smooth, easily applied to skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best price anywhere for zinc oxide. Easiest to use in the tub, no having to squeeze a tube to get it out.</li>
    <li> great fer burns...as fe what it is intended</li>
    <li> I was looking for a diaper rash cream without fragrance and other additives that can cause allergic reactions. This is the best I&#x27;ve found. No fruit/nut/plant oils or other fragrances to irritate baby&#x27;s skin. Much cheaper than creams marketed as diaper rash treatments, too!</li>
    <li> Diabetics have so many rashes and skin break downs, guess what this stuff fixes it all! I plan on being a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> The zinc oxide is only 20 percent in this, so it&#x27;s not very effective for diaper rash.  Desitin or store brands at the same percentage (40) is a much better purchase.</li>
    <li> This is billed as \\&quot;zinc oxide ointment\\&quot;:  actually it is 20% zinc oxide.  It works well to treat or prevent diaper rash, but I prefer a higher concentration of this active ingredient--at least 40%.  The ingredients were not specified before buying.</li>
    <li> Awesome and perf for kids who are super sensitive, it&#x27;s pure and doesn&#x27;t have exta junk. We had to switch from triple paste to this. Quick delivery reasonably priced</li>
    <li> ...I have used tubed version of similar products and they are costly, this product not only reasonable priced it works even better since it does not contain those fancy ingredients that may not be necessary to address the issue of skin deterioration due to incontinence, e.g. scents &amp; oils...</li>
    <li> really great, just what i wanted!</li>
    <li> Just to brighten your day I bought a lot of this product to be used at a pig sanctuary - the ironwood pig sanctuary - this is the product they recommend for price and quality. I didn&#x27;t realize that pigs get sunburned - so do a good deed and buy more and send to them. kcr</li>
    <li> From diaper ointment to homemade deodorant; this product has been great. Really stays in place. Thick and creamy. Will buy again if I run out.</li>
    <li> nice quality ,I am happy.</li>
    <li> Good old zinc oxide!  We&#x27;ve used it for years for so many skin irritations.  My husband had been to the Dr. with a skin irritation in a spot under his beard.  The expensive prescription anti-fungal cream didn&#x27;t help and the expensive prescription anti-biotic cream didn&#x27;t help.  But, as a last resort, I suggested that he try our old favorite zinc oxide.  Wow!  Within a day after he started using it, the burning and stinging under his beard had stopped.  He applied zinc oxide with a Q Tip for a week and all skin irritation is gone!  We use it on chapped skin, too.  We save money buying this large size instead of the tubes.  It has no odor.</li>
    <li> This is as advertised and it was delivered on schedule. Plus the price is unbeatable.zink</li>
    <li> Instead of buying those little 1 ounce tubes at the local pharmacy, or supermarket for around $5 a tube I got two of these huge 16 ounce cans for all of $20.</li>
    <li> Ask the rescued pot belly pigs, it was a gift I had Amazon send to them!  I will give you four stars for letting me donate to Ironwood Pig Sanctuary so easily!</li>
    <li> Was so pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a cheaper alternative to Calmoseptine Ointment, seeing as how it&#x27;s a giant tub of the active ingredient in Calmoseptine. I was disappointed to find they were nowhere near the same consistency or texture, and this product is nowhere near as soothing. However, that&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a good product, it just didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped it to do. This is a very thick product and feels a little bit greasier than Calmoseptine. Did not have much luck soothing a rash with it but seems like if you specifically needed Zinc Oxide this would be a good product to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product was recommend by physician as skin barrier while wearing disposable briefs.  Keeps from getting skin rash from urine trapped in dippers during the day and while asleep.</li>
    <li> The stuff you find in tubes from chain stores is usually thin and runny. The Rugby product is thick, and will stay on the skin where you put it. Far superior to other brands I have purchased previously.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find a nice big container of pure zinc oxide without perfumes!</li>
    <li> Used to prevent infections occurring with skin rashes. I have used it for years and it has always worked well.</li>
    <li> I am recovering from surgery and a variety of complications. This really helps my skin recover on my legs.</li>
    <li> Good product for healing wounds or insect bites and preventing nose burn in the sun. The formulation is thick and creamy, it adheres well. No offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Best diaper rash ointment ever. Good defense to a not so diligent day care. Diaper proof, Hard to wipe off.</li>
    <li> Did my research and what not but the wife wanted the butt paste name .. women.  The pediatrician said that all we need  is zinc oxide for rash prevention for the newborn.  I came to amazon, ordered and never went back to butt paste brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry right away so it is easier to apply, plus, it&#x27;s 1 lb. worth.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 one pound jar of zinc oxide. The label was not helpful as to the percentage of the zinc oxide. When I read my invoice the postage (standard shipping) was more than doubled for what the ointment cost. I will not order again.  SD Wilson, NY</li>
    <li> works like a charm for denture adjustments in my dental office.</li>
    <li> I buy Zinc Oxide for my disabled sister who uses it for rashes. After going through 2 tubes at the drugstore in 2 months, I knew a cheaper option was needed. This 1 # container is perfect and she has no complaints.</li>
    <li> excellent product cant do without it excellent delivery</li>
    <li> This is a great product with many uses.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do the trick for me for what I was ailing from skin wise but maybe I&#x27;ll figure out another use for it. I thought it would calm the inflammation on my skin but apparently a different medicine is called for in my case. If I meet anyone with a bunch of babies, I&#x27;ll recommend this right away and hand them the jar to save them a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a rash and within 24 hours it was gone!  It&#x27;s a good-size container that will last my family through the warm summer months.</li>
    <li> My wife was very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I bought a large canister this time because I run out of it fast.  This protects my skin from sunburn and I apply it to most any skin irritation or flare-ups. It is a vital part of my medicine cabinet supplies.</li>
    <li> Love the product, needs packaged differently for shipment to avoid the lids breaking.</li>
    <li> Simple ingredients and very similar to the hospital grade zinc oxide</li>
    <li> I love to mix this 1 lb tub of 20% zinc oxide with a 30g (1 oz) tube of 20% ichthammol ointment for the best diaper cream ever. Seriously, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> If you have any problems with chafing, especially in the summer when a person is inclined to perspire more than usual, this is the product to use.  Better than lotions, powders, or other remedies.  It helps with mild skin rashes,  dry skin, chapped skin from cold weather, dryness from winter house-heat, etc.  If you use it on your dish-pan hands at night before you go to bed, it helps heal them and make them feel softer.  The price is certainly right.  The ordering was easy, delivery very timely.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  Also, this size is a good family size.</li>
    <li> This product is satisfactory and was delivered promptly.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great price for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Our local pharmacy stopped providing special ordering on this product. We use a considerable amount for our son&#x27;s stoma care. It&#x27;s good to have a consistent source at such a fair price.</li>
    <li> Zinc Oxide works for many different things and is very effective on many skin issues.</li>
    <li> Serves it purpose and the size is longer lasting.  My first time use and I like it and less costly.</li>
    <li> I like to keep this around when I get a little chafed/dry during the winter. It works great when the cold dry air causes you to itch down there :)</li>
    <li> Works for the intended purpose</li>
    <li> Have tried this product before, loved it, and will be buying more of this item in the future. Love it.</li>
    <li> This 20% Zinc Oxide ointment has no added perfume to it, nor does it use any fish oil.  So it&#x27;s odorless.  Exactly what I was looking for because I use this Zinc as an underarm deodorant (Zinc prevents the formation of bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 40% ZnO at the pharmacies and you can&#x27;t find one that doesn&#x27;t have fish oil in it, plus they are expensive.  I found a 20% ZnO at CVS which was odorless and tried it for a few months to test it&#x27;s effectiveness.  It worked well, almost as well as the 40% stuff only you had to use it slightly more often (about every 3-4 days after showering instead of around 7 days).  So I went searching for a quantity discount and came to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bow hunters have been using ZnO on their underarms for years.  This is the basically same stuff you buy but at a fraction of the cost.  It takes about a day to be absorbed, but Zinc is actually GOOD for you, as opposed to the aluminum products that are traditionally used in deodorants/antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> So good for skin protection. Good for noses when skiing, wound protection, the list is long.  The big jar will last a good while.</li>
    <li> Product was fine, but two of the jars were cracked when they arrived.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for a sun screen for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  This was nice and thick, and a great big tub - it was challenging to use at beach since the cream remained sticky and sand got stuck everywhere.  Next time I would apply a lot less and let it dry for at least 3o mins before heading to the beach.  I am using the leftovers as diaper cream - I think this tub will last a nice long time.</li>
    <li> After hand surgery about 25 years ago, the therapists spread Zinc Oxide Ointment over the wound, and by the following day noticeable healing had taken place.  Since then, we have used it for every open wound, scratch and abrasion.  Following skin cancer treatment, the skin was bright red, open and oozing.  Daily applications of Zinc Oxide Ointment reduced healing time dramatically, leaving the new skin clear, soft and supple.  Buying in the 1 lb. size cut the cost significantly.  This product does not spoil, and can be used over extended time periods without loss of effectiveness, hence no waste.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it in my medicine cabinet and cosmetic bag.  It even makes an excellent overnight cream (just place a towel on your pillow).</li>
    <li> This is great for any kind of skin problem such as rash or prevention of bedsores.</li>
    <li> Great buy, and works fantastic as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> As advertised - a 1 pound jar of Zinc Oxide.  It&#x27;s thick and smooth, easily applied to skin.</li>
    <li> works great for rashes and cracked feet.</li>
    <li> ZnO is ZnO.  But, when it comes in a tube, like desitin, it&#x27;s easier to get at.  Here, you have to unscrew the bottle each time you want to use it.  That&#x27;s inconvenient when you consider when you need it. On the other hand, this stuff is much cheaper per weight than desitin.</li>
    <li> This is a 40% zinc formulation which is very difficult to find in stores. It is very thick and adhesive and so makes a great wetness barrier used as a diaper cream. It will heal just about any rash overnight and is unscented so is great for caregivers with allergies or babies with sensitive skin. You can use zinc to cure all kinds of skin irritations though I can&#x27;t imagine needing a tub this large except on the changing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our tub did arrive cracked because of the poor packing but that should reflect on Amazon, not the product! It was wedged into a box no taller than the jar and apparently just got crushed.</li>
    <li> I searched on line and this was the best buy for the amount of product that I could find and with Amazons backing it was the best buy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
    <li> I started using this with my son at around 9-10 months. He goes to daycare, and was eating more solid foods, which every so often would cause a rash (blueberries were crazy!); anyway, the teachers recommended triple paste (and not giving him blueberries for a little while :)), but a tube of that stuff was ridiculously overpriced. I also did some research and found that many of the most popular brands of diaper cream (incl triple paste) can have some pretty questionable stuff in them. I looked for natural remedies and zinc oxide kept coming up. Figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try this out and I have been thrilled ever since with this. I still only use it at his daycare (he&#x27;s there every day from 8-5), but one tub lasted several months, and has helped prevent/soothe any major food (or just sitting around too long w/dirty diaper) rashes better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> we really just couldn&#x27;t shake the diaper rash, but our pediatrician sent us to a pediatric dermatologist who said we needed just zinc oxide.  When i couldn&#x27;t find that at a drug store, I looked on Amazon and thought i&#x27;d take a chance on this.  Sooooo thick, it&#x27;s still visibly on him after the whole night of sleeping.  Good stuff.  I&#x27;ll certainly be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great product but the price has gone through the roof.  Time to buy a dif. product.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for eczema, acne, and rashes</li>
    <li> Great product.  The doctor prescribes this for our son.  I like being able to get it in a large quantity.</li>
    <li> Excellent old product which works great in healing cuts  or rashes. Started using it when my children were small for their dipers rash</li>
    <li> I have and do use Zinc Oxide quite a lot, but this compound is very strange, imo.  I don&#x27;t like it, tossing it.  I was glad to find a jar of it instead of a metal tube.  Do not know this pharmaceutical lab either, will research, but would not buy this product again ever.</li>
    <li> Description clearly says 20% practice ingredients.  Works very well on skin problems.  Great for the price.  Does the work of &amp;#34;butt cream&amp;#34; at a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> Years ago, I learned from a nutritionist friend that zinc oxide ointment, applied regularly to armpits or feet, would stop odors in those areas. I bought some and gave it a try. Sure enough! I only had to apply it once a week initially, then over time, once a month did the trick. My teen girls love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Since it&#x27;s thick, pastey and white, you&#x27;ll want to apply it after a shower *at night* then wear a white t shirt to bed. Applying it in the morning before dressing in your good work or school clothes will only lead to annoyance and frustration. Same goes for feet: apply at night, *after a shower* and put socks on over the application. No need to apply a lot. I probably use about 1/2 pea size for both arm pits. No, it doesn&#x27;t spread well when applied so sparingly, but it doesn&#x27;t really need to. It&#x27;ll migrate on the skin overnight due to warmth and moisture. Keep in mind that it does not provide any anti-wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend on the pricey (and horribly scented) Lavalin deodorant which is also zinc oxide based - this does the same thing!</li>
    <li> For years I have had various rashes or fungus on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;A dematologist didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best ointment.</li>
    <li> Zinc Oxide ointment has healed superficial wounds on a lot of my animals at the Winslow Farm Animal Sanctuary.  I would give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no fault of the seller but I was thinking this zinc was clear but it&#x27;s white so....... Just giving heads up if your looking for clear zinc you wouldn&#x27;t want this product</li>
    <li> This is the very best product on the market for sensitive baby butts!  It contains the highest % of zinc, is gentle, lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I&#x27;ve used it with all 3 of my babies and they ask for it when their little bottoms are sore.  Great product and so very glad that Amazon carries it at such a great price.</li>
    <li> We use this on our pink and white pigs in our Animal Rescue, and it is safe, plentiful and doesn&#x27;t harm their skin.  Shipping was fast and service great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dog and rescued kitty cat, which are always having skin issues. This is an old remedy solution from way back to use on skin scrapes and whatever, since zinc oxide is a good antibiotic. Even for the human person as a sparing use sun screen, just not covering large areas to become toxic.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot cheaper than Desiton and gets the job done just as well&lt;br /&gt;It is also a better price than any tubes I can find,either on line or in a store</li>
