      <li>The biggest reason I love them is the smell.</li>
      <li>these are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>everything off wipes work better than these</li>
      <li>I have tried many make-up removal cloths</li>
      <li>I LOVE these wipes.  </li>
      <li>But if you can find them for the right price then they are a good buy.</li>
      <li>They smell pretty good but don&#x27;t expect it to remove waterproof mascara like they promise.</li>
      <li>might be a good solution for someone with very oily skin or in humid conditions but not on dehydrated skin.</li>
      <li>Very good product, leaves your face feeling very moisturizedifferent and clears make up off really well.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry in purse</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s been working out just fine.</li>
      <li>And it does a much better job of getting mascara off and your face dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and have found these wipes to cooperate great with my skin type.</li>
      <li>so I blame this purchase on my being cheap</li>
      <li>If a cheap foundation couldn&#x27;t break me out, and sleeping with my makeup</li>
      <li>I was looking for a wipe that made my face feel fresh and clean and oil free without leaving strong scents or any residue.  </li>
      <li>Fresh scent thoroughly removes all traces!  </li>
      <li>Feels clean with no oily residue, but can get away without lotion afterwards.</li>
      <li>They clean and condition my face</li>
      <li>Easy, simple, and refreshing as well!</li>
      <li>I love the fact they are ready to use</li>
      <li>Mild scent, nice soft towelettes.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I would just put out the extra $2 or so and stick with neutrogena because it takes a light swipe and all the makeup is gone.</li>
      <li>Life is so much easier using these wipes to clean my face as opposed to a cleanser and wash cloth!</li>
      <li>I think that sensitive baby wipes (Pampers) do just as good a job, you get more of them and they cost less.  </li>
      <li>I decided to give these a try since I constantly use the Olay Regenerist for my face and I absolute love it!</li>
      <li>The only good thing about them is that they are soft but they do not remove my makeup and they leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These clothes are really flimsy and don&#x27;t seem to get my very oily skin clean, they also leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I wear regular eyeliner on the bottom, liquid eyeliner on top, and waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>Olay does not fail.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you would expect.  </li>
      <li>I received my first package as a trial</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with their performance and will order them in the future.</li>
      <li>Definitely buying more once I run out.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh smell and did an average job of removing makeup at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Originally, I was concerned that this might affect my face as it&#x27;s pretty sensitive.</li>
      <li>and I thought to give these new Olay fresh effects a try.</li>
      <li>leaves my face feeling fresh and newly washed.</li>
      <li>They also have a nice texture, a little bit bumpy which seems to help them get the makeup off.  </li>
      <li>Gently removes makeup, including eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>Removes all the makeup and does it gently.</li>
      <li>These wipes don&#x27;t remove eyeliner very well either.</li>
      <li>You really have to struggle to get the eyeliner and mascara off.</li>
      <li>The scent is a bit much as well.</li>
      <li>Much easier than washing your face at night when staying with friends or relatives.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, there is something to be said about washing my face with a face wipe versus a baby bottom wipe :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other cleansing cloths that worked better and didn&#x27;t hurt, so I recommend trying something else.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena left my face clean, these leave my face feeling slimy.</li>
      <li>My face is clean and not red after using them.</li>
      <li>I much rather take off my make-up with a clothe than washing my face and getting water dripping down my arms onto the sleeves of my nightgown or top.</li>
      <li>Soft on my skin, removes makeup/mascara and doesn&#x27;t cause my super sensitive and acne-prone skin to break out.</li>
      <li>As a mom with two rambunctious boys-I am always looking for ways to streamline life&#x27;s more mundane tasks and yet still take care of myself.</li>
      <li>but I think that the manufacturer should remove whatever the chemical that causes the stinging of the eyes and make the size much larger to cover the facial area more.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t particularly like this because it made my eye sting after using it</li>
      <li>Even as a teenager in high school, my face never did break out like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen some negative reviews for these, but honestly...</li>
      <li>I think they may be a different material that is softer and the pack stays closed better than some I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wipes are great for removing makeup the smell really good and leaves a clean and fresh sensation on my skin</li>
    <li> These are complete garbage. I&#x27;m on my second pack because it was a deal at Target. I use regular mascara and it took using the entire cloth to even get any off. I don&#x27;t even wear a lot of make up- nothing heavy this couldn&#x27;t even take that off. Now I use them only for make up mistakes and for cleaning my brushes. Tried Neutrogena make up remover wipes (another deal @ Target) best thing ever! And they don&#x27;t burn your eyes like these. Even Ponds wipes are great.</li>
    <li> I received my first package as a trial and I have been addicted to these ever since. I much rather take off my make-up with a clothe than washing my face and getting water dripping down my arms onto the sleeves of my nightgown or top. And it does a much better job of getting mascara off and your face dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I normally love olay products but I&#x27;m not sure about this one. I love the scent. But after using it I accidentally for it too close to my eye and My eye started burning and my have felt a little dry after use. But it sis take off my makeup with ease.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would expect.  Mild scent, nice soft towelettes.  Olay does not fail.</li>
    <li> A lot of wipes irritate my eyes and I have found these generally do not.  They do a good job in removing my makeup and do not leave a residue on my face.  I receive these now via the subscription program and the cost is typically below what I paid at local retail stores.</li>
    <li> Yikes!  Eyes are burning!  Very disappointing for an Olay product.  I&#x27;ll finish the pack but will be extremely careful around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used several other brands of facial wipes and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve ever had a reaction to.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Very lightly scented, don&#x27;t burn your eyes.  Perfect!  Love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cleansing wipes for years, mostly Neutrogena. When subscribe &amp; save quit offering Neutrogena, I switched to these. What a mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clothes are really flimsy and don&#x27;t seem to get my very oily skin clean, they also leave a residue. I tend to use a cleansing cloth on my face the minute I walk in the door from work, and then wash my face before bed. I feel like I need to wash my face immediately after using these. Neutrogena left my face clean, these leave my face feeling slimy. These also sting my eyes any time I try to remove eye make-up. I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with the fragrance - the clothes have an overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be canceling this order.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re supposed to be for makeup removal but they made my eyes sting a lot! I&#x27;ve used other cleansing cloths that worked better and didn&#x27;t hurt, so I recommend trying something else.</li>
    <li> These made my eyes sting, so I can&#x27;t use them to take off eye makeup. The scent is a bit much as well. I recently bought Pond&#x27;s from amazon and prefer those.</li>
    <li> Gently removes makeup, including eye makeup.  Fresh scent thoroughly removes all traces!  Prompt delivery!  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Excellent price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and have found these wipes to cooperate great with my skin type. I would recommend them to anyone for daily use.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels like chemicals</li>
    <li> Great to have on hand for face and hands. Easy to carry in purse</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with their performance and will order them in the future. They are also good for an emergency hand wipe</li>
    <li> These wipes are handy to have around though they dont get all the makeup off.</li>
    <li> Maybe me but these irritated my skin. If your looking for a great product try the Olay 4 in 1 Facial Clothes, they are great.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes water and turn red when using to remove eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;Left my skin feeling terribly dry and very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Needed two wipes to do what one Neutrogena or Balea cloths can do in one.&lt;br /&gt;Towelettes are too thin and leave fibers and strings on your eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This might be a good solution for someone with very oily skin or in humid conditions but not on dehydrated skin.</li>
    <li> These smell wonderful and work like a charm.  I wear regular eyeliner on the bottom, liquid eyeliner on top, and waterproof mascara. These remove all of that with little effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some negative reviews for these, but honestly...you get what you get when using a wipe instead of washing your face.  I&#x27;ve tried the Simple and the Burt&#x27;s Bees brands of wipes and these are my favorite.  They don&#x27;t do a great job at getting waterproof mascara off.  I keep a pack of these on my bedside table for when I remember just before falling asleep that I forgot to wash my face.  It&#x27;s not quite as good as the full routine, but getting your makeup off and letting your skin breathe is better than nothing!  These include some moisturizers, and feel nice and cooling, not sticky.</li>
    <li> Originally, I was concerned that this might affect my face as it&#x27;s pretty sensitive. but it&#x27;s been working out just fine. I at least make sure I get my makeup off before I go to bed this way. I took off one star b/c the cloths could be softer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many make-up removal cloths but I didn&#x27;t particularly like this because it made my eye sting after using it and it wasn&#x27;t as large as the previous ones I have tried.  It did get the make-up off my face but I think that the manufacturer should remove whatever the chemical that causes the stinging of the eyes and make the size much larger to cover the facial area more.</li>
    <li> It came on time.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> If your&#x27;re like me and wear a lot of eye make up then these wipes are not for you. You really have to struggle to get the eyeliner and mascara off. Be prepared for your eyes to sting (even more if you wear contacts). You are better off using baby oil and a cotton ball. It does an ok job at removing foundation. However, you must wash your face shortly after or you might get some acne. I&#x27;ve experienced more acne than ever after using these wipes. For an eye make up remover that works well I suggest using the oil-free eye make up remover from Neutrogena</li>
    <li> Very good product, leaves your face feeling very moisturizedifferent and clears make up off really well.</li>
    <li> Life is so much easier using these wipes to clean my face as opposed to a cleanser and wash cloth! I love the fact they are ready to use and I don&#x27;t have to wet them to use them. Easy, simple, and refreshing as well!</li>
    <li> Gr8 product. My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of makeup removing wipes and these are my favorite! They are a bit thin, but that&#x27;s no problem to take off my makeup. The biggest reason I love them is the smell. They smell fresh and wonderful. So many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have a horrible smell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these wipes.  I was looking for a wipe that made my face feel fresh and clean and oil free without leaving strong scents or any residue.  I&#x27;ve purchases these wipes over and over again.  They&#x27;re perfect to use when you want to get rid of that oil feel off your face.</li>
    <li> These wipes don&#x27;t wipe out anything. The only good thing about them is that they are soft but they do not remove my makeup and they leave my skin feeling oily. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it smell nice it also way small plus I berly got them and there dry</li>
    <li> Removes all the makeup and does it gently. No irritation and no greasy after effect. I would definitely recommend these towelettes.</li>
    <li> This product stings my eyes when I try to remove eye makeup</li>
    <li> These wipes were okay but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them if you are trying to remove stubborn eye makeup the olay everything off wipes work better than these</li>
    <li> I used these once and just threw away the rest. It leaves your face feeling so sticky and gross. They smell like.......well there are not words to describe how bad they smell. I sat next to my husband after using them and he looked at me and had to ask what that smell was. My face just felt gross with a sticky film on it. I had to immediately wash my face afterwards, it just felt wrong. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Much easier than washing your face at night when staying with friends or relatives. Feels clean with no oily residue, but can get away without lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> I like these for removing make-up at the end of the day.  As a mom with two rambunctious boys-I am always looking for ways to streamline life&#x27;s more mundane tasks and yet still take care of myself. The fragrance is fresh but not overwhelming or irritating so I like that because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the ratio of cost vs. value.  I think that sensitive baby wipes (Pampers) do just as good a job, you get more of them and they cost less.  On the other hand, there is something to be said about washing my face with a face wipe versus a baby bottom wipe :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to buy for now.  When I am feeling a little more frugal I will go back to baby wipes.</li>
    <li> It took off all my make-up, even mascara and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice fresh smell and did an average job of removing makeup at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from amazon, but these wipes were so terrible I had to warn everyone with sensitive skin. I wish I could get olay to discontinue this product, for a skincare company, this is by far the worse product I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but I never break out. My face is now covered in small itchy painful zits all around my mouth, cheeks, and neck. Even as a teenager in high school, my face never did break out like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning people, something is in these wipes that just isn&#x27;t safe for your skin. If a cheap foundation couldn&#x27;t break me out, and sleeping with my makeup still on couldn&#x27;t break me out, but these wipes can then that truly tells you how bad these are!!</li>
    <li> I use a variety of wipes and put these on par with a supermarket brand that sells for $1 a pack. They irritated my skin and were not very effective and I threw them away after using several. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday the moment I get home from work to remove my makeup and the entire day from my face.  They clean and condition my face and I do not have to make a mess in the sink.  I also like to see what I removed from my face.</li>
    <li> The complexion of my skin is... Complicated. I don&#x27;t get acne, but I have severely sensitive skin... Just looking at it and my face turns red. I use this to wipe my makeup off and, although it stings the eyes a bit (hence the 4 stars), it does the job well!</li>
    <li> only need one wipe to get all my make up off, even my mascara. leaves my face feeling fresh and newly washed. no oil what so ever!</li>
    <li> Soft on my skin, removes makeup/mascara and doesn&#x27;t cause my super sensitive and acne-prone skin to break out. I use olay moisturizer too, so this was a natural pick for me. I just splash some water on my face, no soap even, after removing makeup on days I&#x27;m feeling lazy, and my skin is no worse the next day!</li>
    <li> Love these&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin refreshedand feeling great&lt;br /&gt;Quick reviver</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I can use one to take off all my makeup- including mascara- whereas when I use the neutrogena ones I always need several.&lt;br /&gt;I rinse my face after using these but I&#x27;m not sure if you need to or not.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t burn, irritate my skin or sting the way sometimes neutrogena or especially the store brand ones do. I&#x27;d stopped using makeup remover wipes because they started to seem ineffective, frustrating or owie in some way. They are great. My face is clean and not red after using them. I think they may be a different material that is softer and the pack stays closed better than some I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;try it!</li>
    <li> These face wipes are nice.  They smell delicious. They also have a nice texture, a little bit bumpy which seems to help them get the makeup off.  I have not used them with waterproof mascara yet, but they worked great for getting off eyeliner and reguar mascara.  The wipe did sting my eyes a little bit but I probably just wasn&#x27;t careful enough about keeping it out of my eye.  I was a little dissapointed that only 20 wipes were included in the pack because most similar products have 25 or 30 wipes.  But if you can find them for the right price then they are a good buy.</li>
    <li> maybe i just have sensitive eyes, but i will not purchase in the future. It removes make-up however it stings my eyes.</li>
    <li> I decided to give these a try since I constantly use the Olay Regenerist for my face and I absolute love it! I previously used neutrogena wipes in the pink grapefruit scent and those work wonders and I thought to give these new Olay fresh effects a try. Worst mistake ever. It removed my foundation no problem, but with eyeliner and regular mascara, I have to scrub into it in order to remove it, something I hate doing because it irritates my eyes. Honestly, I would just put out the extra $2 or so and stick with neutrogena because it takes a light swipe and all the makeup is gone. Will be switching back to neutrogena.</li>
    <li> My usual complaint with make-up removal cloths is that they are too oily, or they don&#x27;t actually remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these, my complaint is that they are ROUGH. So rought I was surprised no one mentioned this in their reviews. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin but I instantly thought it felt like sand paper. This concerns me because I&#x27;ll be using it on the area underneath my eyes and that&#x27;s already a delicate area. I continued using in order to remove the makeup (and it did a fine job, although it didn&#x27;t do much for my mascara), but I had to go very slowly and even the gentlest stroke was rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for the cheapest makeup remover with good reviews so I blame this purchase on my being cheap and i&#x27;ll continue to use it because I don&#x27;t waste money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(just to clarify, this is not Nick Kramvis, it&#x27;s his fiance. He doesn&#x27;t wear makeup :) )&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a faulty set? I just find it very hard to believe that I read like 10 reviews and no one mentioned the roughness... is it just me??</li>
    <li> They smell pretty good but don&#x27;t expect it to remove waterproof mascara like they promise. These wipes don&#x27;t remove eyeliner very well either.</li>
    <li> Heck of a price on amazon for a great makeup removing wipe!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> nice feel but dont scrub too well but still a good product</li>
    <li> I love these wipes so much that I ordered another pack a few weeks later. They stay moist all the way until you&#x27;re done with the pack. It takes off a lot of make up and it smells really nice. I haven&#x27;t broken out from this, so that&#x27;s is a major plus. Definitely buying more once I run out.</li>
    <li> These are so refreshing and work great. Had no problem removing mascara or foundation.</li>
