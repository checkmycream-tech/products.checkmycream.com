      <li>Best stuff I have ever seen for teeth.</li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>great product..thank you</li>
      <li>I think it is a great product.</li>
      <li>This stuff really is great.</li>
      <li>Now I just use it once a day at bedtime to keep my teeth in good health.</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how good this works.</li>
      <li>This kills millions of good bacteria that support your gums strength and its ability to fight off disease or out side intruders   </li>
      <li>:) I will buy it again!</li>
      <li>Amazing product</li>
      <li>I used the Periactl after the cleanng paste and the result is amazing.</li>
      <li>Believe me, ive tried many.</li>
      <li>I have two kids and making sure they brush their teeth</li>
      <li>It seems okay but does not get out the tartar like it promised to.</li>
      <li>This product just works, and I am buying more today.</li>
      <li>find that this product works better if I don&#x27;t overwork it in my mouth, and I don&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes in the morning after using it.</li>
      <li>Gel is not too strong and we all use it every day.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was having a problem with the fit and bleeding.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot! :)</li>
      <li>and I have seen improvement with my gums and even the denist could not believe how clean my teeth was,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying not to have it looked at, but I&#x27;ve known far too many people that were at that point prior to trying this, and it put them having to seek treatment off by as much or more than 6 months!</li>
      <li>This product was sent to me as a sample (the seller didn&#x27;t ship another product on time) and is nothing short of amazing.</li>
      <li>right away i knew that its all a joke they had no idea what i was talking about</li>
      <li>, I just need to floss more, and Crest gum protection works a little better for me.</li>
      <li>Your teeth feel and look so clean and my gums are pink and healthy.</li>
      <li>I was seeing good reviews from many of the customers who tried it, but as far as im concerned they could just very well be paid off to go on the internet and post fake reviews in order to gain more credibility.  </li>
      <li>This product was first purchased after I had a bridge installed over 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>If you have a problem with bleeding gums after flossing a certain tooth this has worked miracles.</li>
      <li>I do NOT use a mouthwash (it will undo the effects) but place a pea-sized drop on my tongue and gently swish it over my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>anyhow i noticed a significant decrease in problems and gums looked healthier by the second day..</li>
      <li>I, along with many others I&#x27;ve shared this with, have had toothache infections gone within a few days or less, and have kept many from having to go to an emergency room.</li>
      <li>I use periactil twice a day with my kids - they got used to a new routine with no problems.</li>
      <li>and it actually helped to make breathing result in coughing less often which allowed me to fall asleep and actually get better.</li>
      <li>This product really works well, but the tube doesn&#x27;t last long enough--I ran out shortly after I received it!  </li>
      <li>After using this product for about two weeks and half the tube, I have not seen much improvement to my periodontal condition.</li>

<li> Mouthwash is not good to use for a number of reasons.</li>
<li> but most recently I had a persistent cough from a nasty, nasty cold.</li>
<li> It completely eliminates that awful taste in your mouth in the morning and bleeding gums - no morning breath!</li>

    <li> This product really works. Unfotunately I have early stage gum disease and very often, this leads to embarrassingly bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that actually stops the bad breath that ive tried. Believe me, ive tried many.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me as a sample (the seller didn&#x27;t ship another product on time) and is nothing short of amazing. It completely eliminates that awful taste in your mouth in the morning and bleeding gums - no morning breath! I am in my 50s and use it twice a day after brushing my teeth. I do NOT use a mouthwash (it will undo the effects) but place a pea-sized drop on my tongue and gently swish it over my teeth and gums. Mouthwash is not good to use for a number of reasons. Just like antibiotics work against your body&#x27;s ability to fight germs by killing all beneficial bacteria, mouthwash also kills beneficial bacteria in the mouth that keep harmful bacteria in check.&lt;br /&gt;I find that this product works better if I don&#x27;t overwork it in my mouth, and I don&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes in the morning after using it. At night, I use it immediately prior to going to sleep and don&#x27;t eat or drink after use. It is fantastic. I do not write bogus reviews as suggested by another reviewer: This product just works, and I am buying more today.</li>
    <li> This product really works well, but the tube doesn&#x27;t last long enough--I ran out shortly after I received it!  You will either have to re-order it almost as soon as you receive it or find something to replace it with!  I found a new toothpaste called Livionex (about $20.00 a tube though so it is expensive) but I thought I would try it..  Haven&#x27;t received it yet --meanwhile I am using Earthpaste but I am a little disappointed in it....doesn&#x27;t leave enough of a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after using.</li>
    <li> I was seeing good reviews from many of the customers who tried it, but as far as im concerned they could just very well be paid off to go on the internet and post fake reviews in order to gain more credibility.  This kills millions of good bacteria that support your gums strength and its ability to fight off disease or out side intruders   yes it may kill bad bacteria but the damage is far worse when using this than at the time before you ordered it    I personally sent them an E-mail telling them to give me a little info on how it all works    12 days later i got a respond from them saying this \\&quot;you need to use it as the directions state\\&quot;    right away i knew that its all a joke they had no idea what i was talking about</li>
    <li> I used the Periactl after the cleanng paste and the result is amazing. Your teeth feel and look so clean and my gums are pink and healthy.</li>
    <li> We had read the xylitol helped flight plaque and gum pain. We tried it and it help my wife with her gum pain. I noticed in my next check up my plaque was way down (per my hygienist) and my pockets were not as deep. I also had a tooth extracted and it help the healing and minimized the pain. We will keep using it along with tooth paste that includes xylitol. I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> It seems okay but does not get out the tartar like it promised to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months and I have seen improvement with my gums and even the denist could not believe how clean my teeth was, just try it I bet it will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Great Product! :) I will buy it again! Amazing product I&#x27;ll recommend this to my friends! Thanks a lot! :)</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever seen for teeth. Had gum problems, after six months twice a day. My gum problems are all but gone. Now I just use it once a day at bedtime to keep my teeth in good health.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about two weeks and half the tube, I have not seen much improvement to my periodontal condition.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I have two kids and making sure they brush their teeth well is hard. I use periactil twice a day with my kids - they got used to a new routine with no problems. Gel is not too strong and we all use it every day. My kids&#x27; teeth sparkle after they put it on.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I think it works but I think it works to slow i am almost half way done with bottom and I feel it helped a little but not the way I would like it to. But I think I will buy again, I just need to floss more, and Crest gum protection works a little better for me.</li>
    <li> I, along with many others I&#x27;ve shared this with, have had toothache infections gone within a few days or less, and have kept many from having to go to an emergency room. I&#x27;m not saying not to have it looked at, but I&#x27;ve known far too many people that were at that point prior to trying this, and it put them having to seek treatment off by as much or more than 6 months!</li>
    <li> not was i expected. did not work</li>
    <li> This product was first purchased after I had a bridge installed over 5 years ago. I was having a problem with the fit and bleeding. The Periactil actually shrinks the tissue and stops the flow of the red menace. If you have a problem with bleeding gums after flossing a certain tooth this has worked miracles. Floss as usual and let it bleed, and then with your finger press against the gums and force out as much blood as possible. Then apply the Periactil. Do this for several days and the bleeding will stop. I still can&#x27;t believe how good this works. I now use it as part of a regular gum/tooth maintenance. During the past 4 years I only needed cleanings by my hygienist.</li>
    <li> My mother uses this since she has over the last year had all her teeth pulled....and is now adjusting to dentures.  She almost ran out and was in a panic.  She says it makes a drastic difference in healing the sores in her mouth!</li>
    <li> This product has made a big difference in my gum health!  They are no longer swollen and red and my breath is fresher!</li>
    <li> i have always brushed my teeth but had problems with bleeding gums..probably from acid reflux..anyhow i noticed a significant decrease in problems and gums looked healthier by the second day..great product..thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff really is great. I&#x27;ve used it for a few different things but most recently I had a persistent cough from a nasty, nasty cold. The rest of my symptoms abated but the cough just wouldn&#x27;t go and it made it hard to fall asleep at night. I put a little periactil on the back of my tongue and it actually helped to make breathing result in coughing less often which allowed me to fall asleep and actually get better. I only wish the tube were larger and the price lower.</li>
