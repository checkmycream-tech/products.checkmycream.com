      <li>I love the smell of this cologne.  </li>

      <li>Bought for my dad for Christmas since its his favorite ---- shipping was fast and my dad is enjoying it - couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>Fragrance is too strong.</li>
      <li>I buy two bottles at a time to get the free shipping.</li>
      <li>it all comes together for a plethora of free hugs, keep them coming</li>
      <li>I have used Aramis for years and still enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The bottles aren&#x27;t cheap, but one bottle lasts about 3 months</li>
      <li>The light musk smell appears to be irresistible to women in their 20&#x27;s - 40&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I think it must have been an old bottle, it did not smell good.</li>
      <li>It made him positively ravishable! : )</li>
      <li>Much more satisfying than going to the high price stores.</li>
      <li>This review is for what I will term \\&quot;the original Aramis Aftershave.\\</li>
      <li>just right!</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and my favorite.</li>
      <li>A true classic men&#x27;s fragrance, not too overwhelming to the senses, but always leaves me feeling clean and refreshed for the day ahead.</li>
      <li>I have been using Aramis for nearly 30 years; it is cool, clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>my hubby loves this very much!</li>
      <li>aramis has been my long time favorite for many years&lt;</li>
      <li>Aramis is Bold and Powerful..</li>
      <li>Aramis is a lovely old fragrance.  </li>
      <li>again many thanks much appreciated</li>
      <li>The topnotes are a greeness subdued by the underlying smokiness - a rare find in today&#x27;s field.</li>
      <li>Once the leader, now an anomaly, and I do mean in a very good way, of mens&#x27; fragrances.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong for him and always smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Aramis is not a heavy aftershave smell and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>My husband has always wore this cologne,and hey I married him for some reason</li>
      <li>I have worn this product for 40 years and the scent never fails to inspire</li>
      <li>/&gt;i first used it in the early 70&#x27;s and continue to enjoy the product today</li>
      <li>Unlike almost anything out there nowadays, Aramis aspires to be neither clean nor sweet, and yet it does not have even a whiff of anything reminiscent of animalistic baseness.</li>
      <li>and I still consistently get positive feedback.  </li>
      <li>Aramis is an American-made, unique, classy fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The color is very manly and my man enjoys it very much</li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>much cheaper than the mall.</li>
      <li>A very woodsy, herbal smell.  </li>
      <li>I really like and so does my wife,  not over powering</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite citrus, but a distant cousin - and the scent nearly lasts all day without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>People purchase specific brands, with higher prices for the guarantee that the product will remain consistent with needs and expectations.</li>
      <li>The box came all crushed but the bottle was fine.</li>
      <li>time, however, the manufacturer may have reformulated it because suddenly it was far, far too strong.  </li>
      <li>Smell is more mellow and not strong as before.</li>
      <li>I have difficulty finding Aramis after shave in the area where I live.  </li>
      <li>I understand that it is an old classic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this same product since 1970 when I first went into sales, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going that far.</li>
      <li>have not been around Aramis in a few years now, but if it is being made in its original formulation, I heartily recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I received the product sooner than expected and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Buying the 4 ounce size glass bottle directly from Amazon is actually cheaper per ounce than buying the 8 oz.</li>
      <li>This not the same old Aramis.  </li>
      <li>I hope I get the old smell back for my next purchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As always, a great aftershave.</li>
    <li> spouse loves the odor.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty finding Aramis after shave in the area where I live.  I&#x27;m able to get Aramis cream after shave but prefer the liquid.  I received the product sooner than expected and the price was very reasonable.  I will purchase again, not only the after shave but also the cologne.</li>
    <li> Well..... It looks like Aramis. It smells like Aramis. And it even taste like....... Wait I&#x27;m not going that far. Great deal on my favorite cologne. Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for over 50 years, when it was only available from select stores, hard to find,and expensive. The local stores,specifically &amp;#34;ALTA&amp;#34;, have now stopped carrying the brand.  I found on Amazon and ordered. To our sadness, the aroma appeared weak and not as flagrant as usual and with a very short smell life. People purchase specific brands, with higher prices for the guarantee that the product will remain consistent with needs and expectations. It appears that this brand is going in the direction of numerous products that are being modified for corporate bottom line.</li>
    <li> My Dad loved this gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Very good price on this product that I have used for years.  About 1/2 the cost of the Big Dept. stores.</li>
    <li> Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Fragrance is too strong. It does sooth my skin after a shave.</li>
    <li> A good value for aftershave. It arrived in a timely manner&lt;br /&gt;and was in one piece.</li>
    <li> aramis has been my long time favorite for many years&lt;br /&gt;i first used it in the early 70&#x27;s and continue to enjoy the product today</li>
    <li> My dad loves this after shave so I got him this as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day. The box came all crushed but the bottle was fine.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this product.  Now if we can only find the cologne in this size, it would be wonderful</li>
    <li> Fragrances are highly individual, and often have a different scent on one person than on another.  Aramis is the same.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 20+ years and I still consistently get positive feedback.  The light musk smell appears to be irresistible to women in their 20&#x27;s - 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m not fond of the glass bottle though, it leaks and is unusable for travel.  I once got this in a plastic bottle which travels well and I prefer it.</li>
    <li> outstanding product, great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aramis for nearly 30 years; it is cool, clean and refreshing. A true classic men&#x27;s fragrance, not too overwhelming to the senses, but always leaves me feeling clean and refreshed for the day ahead. Not readily available in Men&#x27;s department stores any longer, so Amazon is the best place to find it at the best price!</li>
    <li> Aramis is a lovely old fragrance.  Hub asked for it and it still has that wonderfully simple fragrance.  Thank you</li>
    <li> my hubby loves this very much!</li>
    <li> It is absolutely ridiculous to ask for a review on a product that has been around for 50 years. I wouldn&#x27;t order it if I didn&#x27;t like it would I? Do you want me to say it smelled like skunk juice or sewer water.  It is delightful for me, now ask your question when you wish a review on a new product or one that isn&#x27;t selling well.  That I can understand.</li>
    <li> I tried Aramis in the plastic bottle but it wasn&#x27;t the same. A few years back, when Old Spice started using plastic instead of glass bottles, they ruined the smell, and so I switched to Aramis. Now I only buy it in the glass bottle. To me it&#x27;s the best fragrence and the best to keep my skin smooth after a close shave. Buying the 4 ounce size glass bottle directly from Amazon is actually cheaper per ounce than buying the 8 oz. size from other vendors. I buy two bottles at a time to get the free shipping. I don&#x27;t use cologne as it  is too overpowering for me. But Aramis after shave has great aroma that is subltle, not over powering.</li>
    <li> Great price on this item! Exactly same as product in local beauty store, but half the cost here. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this same product since 1970 when I first went into sales, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  BTW, women love it to:-)</li>
    <li> Aramis is an American-made, unique, classy fragrance.  I bought the after shave because the cologne can be a little too persistent.  It also has a very slight hint of menthol to take the sting out of your shaved face.</li>
    <li> I used it years ago. but was not able to puchase it here island of Hawai&amp;#34;i..  I entered &amp;#34;Arimis&amp;#34; on the internet, Lo and behold there it was, I ordered it. GREAT AROMA.</li>
    <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Once the leader, now an anomaly, and I do mean in a very good way, of mens&#x27; fragrances. Unlike almost anything out there nowadays, Aramis aspires to be neither clean nor sweet, and yet it does not have even a whiff of anything reminiscent of animalistic baseness. The topnotes are a greeness subdued by the underlying smokiness - a rare find in today&#x27;s field. Upon the path to drydown comes a woodiness that, if one checks carefully, can be sensed as possibly the inspiration for the famed \\&quot;pencil shavings\\&quot; notes in Gucci pour Homme. Everything in this juice is understated by today&#x27;s standards, yet it remains one of the rarest scents all time.. This is not your everyday scent..  Aramis is Bold and Powerful.. I have worn this product for 40 years and the scent never fails to inspire</li>
    <li> Was not satisfied with this cologne.  I think it must have been an old bottle, it did not smell good.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this since I met him 40 years ago. It is his signature scent and I can&#x27;t imagine him wearing anything else.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  I understand that it is an old classic but I had never experienced the scent before.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, timely delivery.Much more satisfying than going to the high price stores. Highy recommend this for anyone wanting a good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not same as I can buy one from the dept store. The fragrance does not stay more than an hr.</li>
    <li> Gift for husband and he is very happy.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and intact</li>
    <li> This has been one of my all time favorites...once I noticed this I immediately loved it...again many thanks much appreciated</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the product was as advertised. What else can I ask for. Thanks,</li>
    <li> Excelente Recomendado</li>
    <li> smelled &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used Aramis for years and still enjoy the fragrance.  Not too sweet, not too sharp, not overwhelming . . . . just right!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s cologne of choice. We are both fond of the scent. It&#x27;s not quite citrus, but a distant cousin - and the scent nearly lasts all day without being overwhelming. The bottles aren&#x27;t cheap, but one bottle lasts about 3 months</li>
    <li> This not the same old Aramis.  Scent does not last.</li>
    <li> Good item for my husband</li>
    <li> it takes some getting used to, my boss used to wear this, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve heard about over the years is try it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He likes it</li>
    <li> the only scent my husband will wear. much cheaper than the mall.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and my favorite.</li>
    <li> Recommend this product for the man in your life.  The color is very manly and my man enjoys it very much</li>
    <li> Can someone tell me if this is spray or splash please????????????</li>
    <li> I used it for many years and don&#x27;t feel the need to change to another brand. Amazon has much better price then brick stores.&lt;br /&gt;I got hooked on Aramis back then and I don&#x27;t know if there better Aftershave products (may be I should experiment)</li>
    <li> get this for your guy, it smells so good</li>
    <li> Love it. Been wearing Aramis for many, many years. Still a great scent for men. Please keep producing it.</li>
    <li> My husband was completely satisfied with the purchase of Aramis. He used to wear it, but it has become prohibitively expensive. The price on Amazon.com was affordable, and will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like and so does my wife,  not over powering</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Products ordered/received were as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Received expected product on time.</li>
    <li> hopefully, the manufacturer will continue to produce without changing or modifying it!  I have been using it for longer than I can remember.  I am always complemented by the lady at the front desk when I check into a hotel.</li>
    <li> the aroma, the clothes, the green eyes... it all comes together for a plethora of free hugs, keep them coming</li>
    <li> This review is for what I will term \\&quot;the original Aramis Aftershave.\\&quot;  I first noticed Aramis in the late 1970s or so.  I fell in love with it, and I bought it for my husband.  I loved for him to wear it.  It made him positively ravishable! : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, however, the manufacturer may have reformulated it because suddenly it was far, far too strong.  It also became so popular that I could smell it on a lot of men, which made it rather seem rather pedestrian whence my husband wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been around Aramis in a few years now, but if it is being made in its original formulation, I heartily recommend it.  It is very appealing, very inviting, and very sexy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only this aftershave for 3 years from now. I feels like the smell has been changed bit and I feel less freshness(menthol feeling).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why? It all looks same. Same case, same bottle, same cap. But 5% different feeling and smells. Smell is more mellow and not strong as before. I hope I get the old smell back for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> The fragrance wasnt the same as I feel it used to be.</li>
    <li> My husband smells so good with Aramis. It is not too strong for him and always smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Aramis is not a heavy aftershave smell and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> My husband has always wore this cologne,and hey I married him for some reason must be because he smells great,after 35 yrs I can&#x27;t think of any other reason.</li>
    <li> I worn Aramis for years, great pricing and service.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
    <li> I am glad that Aramis is available again on Amazon.  This is my favorite after shave.  A very woodsy, herbal smell.  Exquisite!</li>
    <li> I love this product, have used it for many years and buy it for gifts</li>
    <li> My husband hyas loved this after shave for years. It seems like it is the only one that he loves to wear....</li>
    <li> Aramis is Aramis. No change in over 30 years I&#x27;ve been using it. Ladies still love it!</li>
