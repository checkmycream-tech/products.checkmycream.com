### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I cannot say that I am anything but happy with the both of them!</li>
      <li>Product was wonderfully scented and excellent lather.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this wash is how well is lathers up when used with any sort of scrubbing apparatus (loofah, \\&quot;detailer\\&quot;, sponge, etc.).</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, period.  </li>
      <li>the best body wash in the business</li>
      <li>my order came on time and this stuff smells awesome.  </li>
      <li>smells great.</li>
      <li>It smells great, gets rave reviews from the ladies, and one bottle lasts you longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
      <li>The scent is great and I like the fact that you can use it as both a body wash and a shampoo.</li>
      <li>Your rag if you need it throughout the day will smell great as well.</li>
      <li>It smells really good.</li>
      <li>It smells good and...</li>
      <li>This is a really good product.</li>
      <li>The thing that I love about this is that you dont have to use one of those mesh sponges to get a great lather.</li>
      <li>It lathers incredibly well, more so then most soap bars I&#x27;ve used even.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this from a popular mall store for years.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Like most things that work well though, this has a lot of sulfates etc.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m glad I got the gift now.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I was really glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>to find this on Amazon as I am about out and will definately be getting more.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and texture.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use packaging</li>
      <li>Really good scent which is masculine and gives me a feeling of being very clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>At first I kind of groaned, because It was a gift from the family that gives me the cologne gift packs each year.</li>
      <li>This is a nice higher end product to grow into once you get out of the body spray phase.</li>
      <li>Fortunately there are often sales on this where you can buy 2 and get one free.</li>
      <li>You can use a washcloth and the later is great.</li>
      <li>When I use as shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling impossibly light and clean.</li>
      <li>You get so clean using it.</li>
      <li>My husband loves it:) We will buy again for certain.</li>
      <li>Lathers well, rinses off quickly.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly &amp; as described.</li>
      <li>I used to use Axe, which is also really good, however this soap goes a long way longer then Axe.</li>
      <li>Packs easily for travel and very durable container.</li>
      <li>Great lather, great smell, but it is highly irritating to the eyes, so be careful.</li>
      <li>This is the only body wash that gets me clean and smelling clean for hours.</li>
      <li>Does an excellent job without that soap residue that so many other soaps leave behind.</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves the way I smell after I shower with this.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic and the lather is terrific.</li>
      <li>I used to actually only use this on special occasions.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is available in several other fragrances but this one is my favorite by far.</li>
      <li>As the other reviewers have noted, this is a great smelling body wash (as are their white and blue elixers).</li>
      <li>This shampoo/body wash is part of a line of products that includes an after shave lotion, cologne, and shaving cream which I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sold myself, and I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more of this, and trying other scents in the future.</li>
      <li>The other fragrances are stronger more synthetic aromas that I don&#x27;t find all that different from what you can get from Axe.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves you smelling fresh all day.</li>
      <li>It may seem like an odd way to describe a shampoo fragrance but it is a simple natural smell that I find more &#x27;mature&#x27; than the other fragrances available.</li>
      <li>I know that sounds funny, but when you are in college you have to consider that this stuff is exponentially more expensive</li>
      <li>It only takes a small amount (pea size) to clean your whole body.</li>
      <li>Although it isn&#x27;t a very large bottle, it will last a very long time because it lathers up so well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and texture.  Does an excellent job without that soap residue that so many other soaps leave behind.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a Christmas gift.  I use it as a shaving product and find it works well for that and leaves a pleasing aroma in the shaved area.  My wife likes that.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find this on Amazon as I am about out and will definately be getting more.</li>
    <li> I use this alternating with C.O Bigelow&#x27;s \\&quot;Lemon &amp; Pomegranate\\&quot; body wash and I cannot say that I am anything but happy with the both of them! Guys, this is something that you shouldn&#x27;t pass up at all if given the chance to try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.     Just another quality product from C.O. Bigelow...!</li>
    <li> the best body wash in the business</li>
    <li> Lathers well, rinses off quickly.  I like that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and that there&#x27;s no moisturizing residue left.  After using, clean.&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that the point?</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves the way I smell after I shower with this. Even though you can use it on hair and body I only use it for my body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, period.  Great lather, great smell, but it is highly irritating to the eyes, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I received this Christmas. At first I kind of groaned, because It was a gift from the family that gives me the cologne gift packs each year. However, I&#x27;m glad I got the gift now. It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent, but still turns heads every so often. It lathers incredibly well, more so then most soap bars I&#x27;ve used even. When I use as shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling impossibly light and clean. I&#x27;m sold myself, and I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more of this, and trying other scents in the future.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. You get so clean using it. Like most things that work well though, this has a lot of sulfates etc. in it so if you have allergies or if you are on a \\&quot; healthy\\&quot; kick, this one does not meet the requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower a few times a day and a little of this stuff goes until eternity! The smell is fantastic and the lather is terrific. The thing that I love about this is that you dont have to use one of those mesh sponges to get a great lather. You can use a washcloth and the later is great. Your rag if you need it throughout the day will smell great as well. Overall, this is one of my favorites. It also does not leave your skin dry like AXE or other \\&quot;mens\\&quot; products. But it!</li>
    <li> Product was wonderfully scented and excellent lather. Easy to use packaging made squeezing simple. Reminds me of sex lubricants. I only wish it would wash away the darkness in my soul...</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. The scent is great and I like the fact that you can use it as both a body wash and a shampoo. Really good scent which is masculine and gives me a feeling of being very clean and refreshed. I plan on continuing to use this product from now on. Packs easily for travel and very durable container. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> As the other reviewers have noted, this is a great smelling body wash (as are their white and blue elixers). The best thing about this wash is how well is lathers up when used with any sort of scrubbing apparatus (loofah, \\&quot;detailer\\&quot;, sponge, etc.). Although it isn&#x27;t a very large bottle, it will last a very long time because it lathers up so well. It won&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves you smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Once you&#x27;ve outgrown the axe/dove/old spice body washes give this a try. It smells good and... frankly that&#x27;s all you need to know. It smells really good.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this from a popular mall store for years. I live in Florida where your underarms tend to sweat and smell unpleasant. This is the only body wash that gets me clean and smelling clean for hours. I used to use Axe, which is also really good, however this soap goes a long way longer then Axe. It only takes a small amount (pea size) to clean your whole body. I&#x27;ve been searching for an inexpensive alternative to this but haven&#x27;t found anything yet. Fortunately there are often sales on this where you can buy 2 and get one free.</li>
    <li> my order came on time and this stuff smells awesome.  My wife loves the way it smells on me after a shower</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; as described. smells great. My husband loves it:) We will buy again for certain. packaging was slightly different then what we used to purchase at B&amp;BW.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells great, gets rave reviews from the ladies, and one bottle lasts you longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift years ago and have been hooked since. I used to actually only use this on special occasions. I know that sounds funny, but when you are in college you have to consider that this stuff is exponentially more expensive that a bottle of generic Suave shampoo. I used to buy it at Bath &amp; Body works but they don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore. I was really glad to find it on Amazon. This shampoo/body wash is part of a line of products that includes an after shave lotion, cologne, and shaving cream which I highly recommend (Seriously, you haven&#x27;t shaved until you&#x27;ve used shaving cream from a tube). The cologne is one of the only ones I have found that does not give me a raging headache when I wear it. This shampoo is available in several other fragrances but this one is my favorite by far. It may seem like an odd way to describe a shampoo fragrance but it is a simple natural smell that I find more &#x27;mature&#x27; than the other fragrances available. The other fragrances are stronger more synthetic aromas that I don&#x27;t find all that different from what you can get from Axe. This is a nice higher end product to grow into once you get out of the body spray phase.</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product. If you examine the ingredients there are quite a few things you wouldn&#x27;t want to bath yourself in. Consider a less chemical alternative.</li>
