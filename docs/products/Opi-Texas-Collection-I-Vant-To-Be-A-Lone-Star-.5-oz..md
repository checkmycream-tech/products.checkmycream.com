      <li>It came very quickly  and in great condition.  </li>
      <li>the color is amazing and basically just as pictured.</li>

      <li>Its a nice color</li>
      <li>Nice color for the business woman.</li>

      <li>It went on beautifully (two coats)  and is still looking exceptionally good 4 days later.  </li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>After much deliberation and a lot of wine, I decided to go ahead and buy I Vant to Ne A-Lone Star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived.</li>

      <li>I just want to start my post by stating that I love OPI products.</li>
      <li>i love O.P.I</li>
      <li>Should have read more reviews before purchasing.</li>
      <li>Love this color and OPI.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I love this Color.</li>
      <li>Oh well, still an ok color</li>
      <li>Love the name.  </li>
      <li>...you do have to love silver or gray for this one to work for you.</li>
      <li>Love the color.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more of a light blue with a hint of gray undertone, this would be perfect.</li>
      <li>They consistently produce a quality nail product in a variety of gorgeous colors.  </li>
      <li>This is a great color for the beach, or even for New Years Eve.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t chip so easily  </li>
      <li>That written, it&#x27;s also just as easy to chip - but</li>
      <li>I like OPI because it doesn&#x27;t stain my nails and it&#x27;s easy to remove, unlike the cheap stuff.  </li>
      <li>on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I enjoy the names that OPI puts on their products.</li>
      <li>People complaining about the color should just read the description; it says it is a light blue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>far as low-key colors go, it&#x27;s good for work, play and about anything else.</li>
      <li>It is shiny light blue, so it is good for many fun occasions</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique.</li>
      <li>Great, the product was just as described, was the same color as the image shown, and it also came fast.</li>
      <li>Super versatile</li>
      <li>To Be A-Lone Star is a very pretty color</li>
      <li>Was looking for a light aqua blue-gray color and this is definitely exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whenever I wear it, people ask what kind of blue polish I am wearing.</li>
      <li>I purchased this color hoping I would finally find the right kind of \\&quot;gray.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have no trouble with bright colors on my toes but prefer my nails quiet and calm.</li>
      <li>The first time I got a colorful design, because it felt sky blue-ish..</li>
      <li>Very pretty kinda blue but love it.  </li>
      <li>The picture was definitely misleading, since the nails look much more gray than mine did.</li>
      <li>Read the description, and stop whining because you bought a product without reading about it first.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture on the nails</li>
      <li>love the pearly blue color, it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a nail polish.</li>
      <li>I found this color to be more of a light blue than grey.  </li>
      <li>I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos.</li>
      <li>Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay</li>
      <li>Application was great but the color seemed a little blue to me.</li>
      <li>Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat.</li>
      <li>I have a few different OPI colors and have been happy with each one.</li>
      <li>Not really what I was looking for, but not a terrible color.</li>
      <li>eggshell light blue color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would describe this color as an eggshell, light BLUE.  </li>
      <li>Putting some color on the edge and following up with the right top coat it seems to last longer.</li>
      <li>(I do the whole thing with a good base and top coat, but it still chips.)</li>
      <li>I liked the little bit of blue in it because it went well with the blues and turquoise that I tend to wear in the summer.</li>
      <li>Also, shipping arrived as few days earlier than was scheduled to arrive, so that was a nice surprise.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a pretty grayish nail polish and this is definitely it.</li>
      <li>this shade offers a neutral color .. not exactly dark .. but a shade thst is very wearable for all occasions.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture and lasts longer than other nail polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always more blue, purple, or green than grey, but I think the French Quarter color is pretty on with the gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>WOW, what a pretty pale blue.  </li>
      <li>Saw this on Pinterest and liked the color but just like every other review on here-the color is a pale blue ish not a true grey that I was hoping for.</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gray, you might try \\&quot;French Quarter for Your Thoughts\\&quot; by OPI, which is a flat medium gray color.  </li>
<li> It IS NOT grey just because the picture looks grey.</li>
<li> This color is lees blue than grey...</li>
<li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s very hard to find the right color gray.  </li>
<li> i am a kinda girl than never really purchased alot of nail polish , But my big sister got me mini O.P.I for christmas</li>
<li> However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes.</li>
<li> But the next week got a black whit and silver design, because I had noticed that it matched all my grey stuff.</li>
<li> The only gray I ever see is when the lighting is dark, and there is a \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; effect which gives it a bit of a gray shine.</li>
<li> Maybe with a slight undertone of blue, if even that.</li>
<li> but it kind of makes my skin look a little sick.</li>
<li> Color has an instant shimmer and looks like a mix between a pale, pale blue and silver.</li>
<li> Looking at some of the other reviews though, I don&#x27;t think so...</li>
<li> I expected this color to be a little nicer than it was.</li>
<li> Definitely must apply at least two coats.</li>
<li> only complaint is that it took about 3 weeks to arrive and when it did i had forgotten that i had ordered it.</li>
<li> I like how it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t look totally atrocious when I accidentally bump into something when my nails are still wet.</li>
<li> Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired.</li>
<li> a little flashier.&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, the application of it was a little streaky.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this was too blue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wore this last spring and summer and got a lot of compliments, even from strangers.  It is a bluish-gray, though it looks just gray in the photo.  I liked the little bit of blue in it because it went well with the blues and turquoise that I tend to wear in the summer.</li>
    <li> Should have read more reviews before purchasing. Saw this on Pinterest and liked the color but just like every other review on here-the color is a pale blue ish not a true grey that I was hoping for. Oh well, still an ok color</li>
    <li> After much deliberation and a lot of wine, I decided to go ahead and buy I Vant to Ne A-Lone Star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived. I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as low-key colors go, it&#x27;s good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat. I think this is why the nails look shorter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this color hoping I would finally find the right kind of \\&quot;gray.\\&quot; All the grays I&#x27;ve always purchased end up being either too blue or too white and streaky. Unfortunately, this was too blue. The picture was definitely misleading, since the nails look much more gray than mine did. Maybe with a slight undertone of blue, if even that. But, the color I received was definitely blue. Maybe, it was just my bottle? Looking at some of the other reviews though, I don&#x27;t think so... Also, the application of it was a little streaky. I definitely needed to apply three coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I wear it, people ask what kind of blue polish I am wearing. The only gray I ever see is when the lighting is dark, and there is a \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; effect which gives it a bit of a gray shine. If you&#x27;re looking for more of a light blue with a hint of gray undertone, this would be perfect. It has a nice pearly shine to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am still on the hunt for my perfect gray.</li>
    <li> This color is lees blue than grey... This has been my color for a month, through 2 trips to the nail shop. The first time I got a colorful design, because it felt sky blue-ish.. But the next week got a black whit and silver design, because I had noticed that it matched all my grey stuff. I love this Color. Super versatile</li>
    <li> LOOOOVE this color from the OPI Texas collection. Color has an instant shimmer and looks like a mix between a pale, pale blue and silver. Definitely must apply at least two coats.</li>
    <li> The. Odor works for me. It&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s unique. It is a great co,or for toes or fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Now...you do have to love silver or gray for this one to work for you.</li>
    <li> Great, the product was just as described, was the same color as the image shown, and it also came fast.</li>
    <li> I expected this color to be a little nicer than it was. Application was great but the color seemed a little blue to me. My mom even actually thought my nail polish was blue. Its a nice color but it kind of makes my skin look a little sick.</li>
    <li> I Vant To Be A-Lone Star is a very pretty color and I&#x27;m happy I bought it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a pretty grayish nail polish and this is definitely it. It looks exactly like it does in the picture on the nails and I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very pretty kinda blue but love it.  Can&#x27;t wait for winter  , I think this will be my go to color.</li>
    <li> Love this color and OPI. Product came in a timely manner. I enjoy the names that OPI puts on their products. Putting some color on the edge and following up with the right top coat it seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> I just want to start my post by stating that I love OPI products. They consistently produce a quality nail product in a variety of gorgeous colors.  I would describe this color as an eggshell, light BLUE.  It&#x27;s definitely not a gray color.  If you&#x27;re looking for a gray, you might try \\&quot;French Quarter for Your Thoughts\\&quot; by OPI, which is a flat medium gray color.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s very hard to find the right color gray.  It&#x27;s always more blue, purple, or green than grey, but I think the French Quarter color is pretty on with the gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love:&lt;br /&gt;1. The quality of OPI products&lt;br /&gt;2. Beautiful, eggshell light blue color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish:&lt;br /&gt;1. It didn&#x27;t chip so easily  (I do the whole thing with a good base and top coat, but it still chips.)</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shadeof nail polish ... I like OPI polish .. this shade offers a neutral color .. not exactly dark .. but a shade thst is very wearable for all occasions.</li>
    <li> People complaining about the color should just read the description; it says it is a light blue.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pearly blue color, it is exactly what I was looking for. Also, shipping arrived as few days earlier than was scheduled to arrive, so that was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. It IS NOT grey just because the picture looks grey.

    <li> I like OPI because it doesn&#x27;t stain my nails and it&#x27;s easy to remove, unlike the cheap stuff.  That written, it&#x27;s also just as easy to chip - but what nail polish isn&#x27;t?  I like how it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t look totally atrocious when I accidentally bump into something when my nails are still wet. Love the color.  Love the name.  I have a few different OPI colors and have been happy with each one.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for the beach, or even for New Years Eve. It is shiny light blue, so it is good for many fun occasions</li>
    <li> the color is amazing and basically just as pictured. only complaint is that it took about 3 weeks to arrive and when it did i had forgotten that i had ordered it. great color though</li>
    <li> AGAIN OPI has a another great color to add to it&#x27;s line of nail polish. The color is true to the picture and lasts longer than other nail polish. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> i am a kinda girl than never really purchased alot of nail polish , But my big sister got me mini O.P.I for christmas and i fell in love . i cought this color on my own and just used it for the 1&#x27;st time , works GREAT ! i love O.P.I</li>
    <li> Nice color for the business woman. I have no trouble with bright colors on my toes but prefer my nails quiet and calm. This fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a light aqua blue-gray color and this is definitely exactly what I was looking for. It has a pearly finish that is very elegant.  It went on beautifully (two coats)  and is still looking exceptionally good 4 days later.  This is a winner. First time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a nail polish.</li>
    <li> bought this on a whim and i love it. It is a pastel baby blue silvery shimmery color. You can never go wrong with OPI</li>
    <li> It came very quickly  and in great condition.  Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again! WOW, what a pretty pale blue.  Though it gets a bit grungy on your hands from daily use.  Have yet to do a pedicure with it, but I am sure it would fair much better on them then on the hands.  A great nail polish for any nail polish enthusiast!</li>
