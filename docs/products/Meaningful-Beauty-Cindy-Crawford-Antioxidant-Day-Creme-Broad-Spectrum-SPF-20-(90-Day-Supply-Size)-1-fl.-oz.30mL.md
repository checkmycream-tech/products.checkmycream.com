<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received the package with the cap broken  hoping I will be able to use the product  haven&#x27;t needed to open it yet</li>
    <li> Have used for years and love it!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I wanted to try this so bad. My friend gave me a couple of products from her supply to try before I committed to buying it myself. Some history on my skin: I have worked in the beauty industry for about 15 years now. I have sold tons of top shelf products. I know how to care for my skin. I&#x27;m now in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but no matter what name brand or OTC product I tried, I suffered from acne, annoying redness and uneven pigmentation (wrinkles aren&#x27;t so much of a problem for me, thank the lord). I&#x27;ve tried acne treatments, dry skin treatments, anti aging, high potency serums, the list goes on and on... little relief from any of my symptoms. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist too for antibiotics and not even those had continued to work. (I refused hormonal treatments.)&lt;br /&gt;So, again, why I wanted to try a TV offer, I don&#x27;t know... But literally within a few days of using this in conjunction with the night cream, MY SKIN STARTED CLEARING UP. THE REDNESS WENT AWAY. My acne started healing and the texture of my skin softened and I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE MY EYES. It felt like a miracle. I kept wondering why they don&#x27;t name this Miraculous Beauty. So as a things go, I used it for a few weeks and I started to get weird that my supply was diminishing. For some dumb reason, I switched back to my old brand of product to save my miracle in a jar product and, no kidding, about a week later I started breaking out again. As an experiment, I switched back to Meaningful Beauty, with the conviction that if my skin cleared up again Cindy would have a customer for life. And then, just like the first time, about 3 days in, my skin went back to looking and feeling better. 5 days, pimples were almost gone, pores looked smaller, redness down.&lt;br /&gt;So in all honestly, the only products in my routine I changed were my day, night and eye creams from this line. I still use a few Kiehl&#x27;s products (wash and a serum) but I swear I&#x27;ll never use anything else as long as this works.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on this stuff- the day lotion spreads well, and kind of feels oily at first but if you let it settle a bit before make up application the skin will absorb it a bit. I have had no issue wearing this under liquid or powder mineral make up. If it feels too shiny after a bare face application, wait about 10 minutes and use a blotter paper.  It does have a weird-ish smell to it but most SPF lotions do. This one is pretty tolerable, also- NO ONE is trying to smell your face, so who cares?A few notes on this stuff- the day lotion spreads well, and kind of feels oily at first but if you let it settle a bit before make up application the skin will absorb it a bit.

    <li> Very nice product. Makes my skin feel quite soft.</li>
    <li> Good product with excellent service from the distributor.</li>
    <li> Absorbs very easy, not oily</li>
    <li> Another great product from Ms. Crawford.  This is a great moisturizer for use of all day.  It does not feel oily or caking like some products after applying.  Just dab a small dime size and that does the trick for all over the face.  I swear by this product</li>
    <li> I just love this lotion. It makes my skin feel so soft and it goes on light, not thick and greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and still absolutely loving it. This is definitely my skin&#x27;s favorite so far!</li>
    <li> This was OK.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it improved my skin.  Very average.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype on TV!</li>
    <li> Gives skin a nice glow without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using meaningful beauty for 6 years. Great for my skin type (oily) and climate where I live (southern humidity).</li>
    <li> The packaging on this product does not match picture online which makes me think it&#x27;s a fake. I have used it a few days and really just seems and smells like sunscreen. One days it makes my fave unusually red.</li>
    <li> Talk about comfort!!!  Looks great and fits well.</li>
    <li> Meaningful Beauty Antioxidant Cream &amp; Eye Lift&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for roughly 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Love these products.</li>
    <li> Love it - I am 65 with the facial skin of a 50 year old. It works like no other poroduct has. I saw results in days. My skin is sensitive but this lotion does not cause problems - keeps my skin young looking.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product very much. She has very sensitive skin and cannot use many products she has tried in the past. She has no problems with this product</li>
    <li> great products - it makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> Love this as a daily use and sunscreen.  Not a miracle cream, but good for my sensitive skin and the SPF is perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and it seems to make it worse.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great! The Meaningful Beauty products work well for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my over 50 skin!</li>
    <li> Glow Serum gives you a healthy Glow with or without make-up. I&#x27;ll take it to my Grave. lol</li>
    <li> This feels weirdly greasy on my face. I use it as a night cream because of this, works fine to moisturize overnight, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any other real benefits.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the consistency, very thick and greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product and the seller is good getting this to me fast, I would buy again!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin looks and feels great after applying. I seem to need less foundation. I also think the price is reasonable. I would like less fragrance but the scent goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> so soft on my skin. scent is great</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to every women. Not only does it give me a youthful look it protects me from the sun.</li>
    <li> Works good for under foundation not too oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MB products as a member for quite some years, but got tired of paying the hefty postage so I get the items I want, when I want them, from Amazon. (I LOVE MY AMAZON!!!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to substitute other products for MB SPF Facial Lotion, but the jury is out. I guess if you wanna spend lots more, you could get a better moisturizer with SPF...</li>
    <li> I need to wear a day cream with some sun protection year round.  This is the lightest formula I have found which offers some protection and a moisturizer both.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Day Crème. It&#x27;s very thick and I feel like it really helps my dry skin on my face. The product arrived very fast. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Amazing.... I love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered twice. I love the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great moisturizing, anti-aging  formula with 30spf. I have actually seen results: skin looks fresher, less tired, less fine line wrinkles. Others have noticed, too. Great base for makeup, unlike some other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This stuff is full of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way Cindy uses these products.</li>
    <li> D5 LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER. MY SISTER USED THIS AND DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER!!!</li>
    <li> My wife love this product .</li>

    <li> I love the Meaningful Beauty products. I get compliments on my skin all the time, usually people tell me I have a glow. The antioxidant day moisturizer nourishes my skin. Its not like other products where my skin gets dry. I am a satisfied customer.</li>

    <li> Love it, came early that what I expected cool!!!</li>
    <li> Great way to start your day! I can tell a difference and Amazon offers great pricing ... even better than the pricing for Meaningful Beauty Club members.</li>
    <li> This the product wasn&#x27;t very good.it seems like an off brandI&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years.I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m oRder from this company again</li>
    <li> MY OPINION IS IT&#x27;S OVER-RATED.  MAYBE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 30&#x27;S AND 40&#x27;S IT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE IT SHOULD SAY THAT, HOWEVER BEING IN MY 70&#x27;S THERE&#x27;S A FAT CHANCE OF ANY ASSISTANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOANNE MULARZ</li>
    <li> I just started using this product,, so far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this, the serum, the eye lift cream and the night cream. After 1 day&#x27;s use, my face was red and I had welts all over my face!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get rid of the almost scarlike reddish brown marks on my upper cheeks that are still there.  I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  My skin can&#x27;t tolerate retin-A types of products, but this line isn&#x27;t supposed to have that, as I understand it. That&#x27;s why I thought I could use it.  I was WRONG.</li>
    <li> small amount for the cost.  Had to reapply frequently.  Disappointed in product</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Great value</li>
    <li> First, this product stings and feels sticky. Also this whole company is a scam and tries to screw you into getting on a monthly delivery and will not take no for an answer. I tried this on a great deal and wish I never had. Be warned.  Meaningful beauty &#x3D; scam.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this cream.</li>
