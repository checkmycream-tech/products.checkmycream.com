    <li> Worth the wait for the price!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> came way before due date and are so pretty</li>
    <li> I love these!! I have so many comments on the great nail art I can do with the dotting tools and brushes...they make using your imagination easy!!</li>
    <li> I received my package about a little more than a week after ordering (way earlier than the estimated delivery date), and i love them. They work flawlessly and the product is really good quality. They handles are sturdy and once you separate the bristles on the brushes, the&#x27;re quite soft. I would definitely order from this seller again. I can&#x27;t wait to start doing my nails at home!</li>
    <li> Just love these tools for my polymer clay projects, and pearl ex pigment powder application</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.  A few of the bristles came off during use but for what I paid for these it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> The dotters are wonderful!  The brushes are okay, but not thin enough to paint letters. Overall the set is good!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how these would work, but they&#x27;re actually really good quality for the price. I can&#x27;t see any difference between these and the ones I got from a nail supplier website--I think these might even be better? I like the variety of sizes. The dotting tools will be helpful too, for nail art and for cleaning up the cuticle during gel application. :)</li>
    <li> Took three weeks to deliver, but worth the wait</li>
    <li> Very good product and cheap, the brushes work excellent and the dots too. The shipping take a lite bit more time but its ok</li>
    <li> Love the price for so many tools.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and they are pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to hold in your hands and very handy.</li>
    <li> When I got this, they accidentally shipped me two sets of the dotting tools. I let them know, and they immediately shipped me the brushes (I think they even expedited the shipping because they arrived faster than the first time), so they have excellent customer support. The brushes come straight from the factory with some coating that makes them super stiff, so you need to wash them before you use them the first time. The bristles are good quality, so I really liked them. The tools are a good length that makes them easy to handle. They&#x27;re not too short. They look shorter in the picture.</li>
    <li> Great for sculpting.I&#x27;d purchase them again and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with their price and performance. Like it .</li>
    <li> fantastic brushes and dotting tools. makes life easier when doing acrylic nails. the dotting pens are fun, different sizes makes great increasing and decreasing dot designs</li>
    <li> I had to give it 2 stars because I expected 5 dotting tools, which I received, but one of them only had one tip. I figured maybe it broke since it was shipped from over seas but there was nothing nada in the bag ... very bummed about it as the color of these tools is beautiful.</li>
    <li> really like it ....there very helpfully  an it  helps if ur just being to do nails so it helps alote</li>
    <li> They work great, only had to cut some little ones sticking out the brushes</li>
    <li> The dotting tools work perfectly.  I wish the brushes were smaller, but they work just fine.  I really only needed the dotting tools, so it was a bonus, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Good set . . I was just expecting a bit more for doing nail art. The sizes of bristles are great to do Gel Polish application. Not really small enough to do artwork on the nails.</li>
    <li> These are a great value! I love the variety, color and price! I just do gel and shellac at home, and these work perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Compact and portable for my miniature artwork.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad brushes... They are synthetic and work well for gel or structure gel.  They can be cleaned best with alcohol or a little pure acetone. Great dotting tools also.  They are standard size with a smaller end on the other side.</li>
    <li> I received these way before the anticipated delivery date. I do my own nails and these tools are perfect! I have used every nail product brand but these are great! The price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> The items are fun and definitely worth the price...a nice selection of size of dotting tools and brushes,  thank you</li>
    <li> Great product but all the ball point are the same size lol</li>
    <li> I use this set by myself，and it is good for make the gel nail art！this price is pretty good and this set is useful！</li>
    <li> Dotting tools are a great size. Brushes are not so great. Takes forever for product to dissolve off of brushes.</li>
    <li> I rated the product five stars because it&#x27;s a great product, for an awesome price. The dotted pens are GREAT.</li>
    <li> I did not like these brushes much. Yea it looks like you get a good deal when its nail tools and 7 brushes...however theses brushes are hard to clean. The acrylic dries fast and lumps on the brush thats not bad the bad is that its really hard to clean it.</li>
    <li> They arrived earlier than the estimated arrival (by 2 weeks). They have some weight to them, not flimsy or cheap. The brushes work good for the gel and also powder, no shedding, and the brushes don&#x27;t lose shape. Absolutely love this product, am so glad I bought.</li>
    <li> I used the brushes for the first time and the metal separated from the purple plastic handle. Haven&#x27;t used the dotters yet. Not the best quality, but they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive so I did not expect too much. Have crazy glue available to reattach to the handles. I gave it three stars because you get what you pay for. It will meet my needs I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tools! The dotting tools are amazing and the brushes are pretty great too. They&#x27;re great quality for the price. Shipping took about 3-4 weeks which is long, but I think it was worth it. I would definitely recommend buying them!</li>
    <li> These were ok.  Brush bristles were pretty flimsy so not good for exact lines.</li>
    <li> pretty good quality for the money.  havent used them yet.  but anxious to get started and see what creations i can do</li>
    <li> 2 of the dot detailers were loose in the packet, so not impressed with quality.</li>
    <li> great for the price, fast delivery and good quality. cant wait to try all kinds of new designs. only wish other colors were available.</li>
    <li> These work really well applying nail polish. I also use the brushes for eye makeup and they do a great job especially with lining the eyes. Plan on purchasing more so that I can have a set for nails and a set for makeup and lip gloss</li>
    <li> i bought these for me they are alright .I like the different sizes but the end has come off a couple of the brushes but I just glued them back together.</li>
    <li> It took about 3 weeks for delivery which is totally fine the product came and looks great have not had a chance to use yet size 2 to size 14 brushes which have very nice bristles comparable to my $20 nail brush! The dotting tools match perfectly!</li>
    <li> These are exactly like the picture. They are very beautiful and easy to use. I absolutely love them, and would buy them again!</li>
    <li> perfect buy great brushes n tools</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are good quality and cheap. The pack comes with everything you need to apply acrylic and design your nails.</li>
    <li> these brushes apply gel so well and stay intact 100 percent! I have used them many times on myself and clients. i love them, thankyou for fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the selection of tools in this set.  I&#x27;ve used most of the brushes so far and have no complaints.  They don&#x27;t shed bristles and perform just as they should.  I get good, fine, detailed work and they perform exactly as I want them to.  I would have expected to pay several times more for the quality of these tools.  I&#x27;m buying a second set as a gift.  They come with a plastic shield that won&#x27;t go back on...that&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than what I thought.  I still haven&#x27;t used all of them to say much. They are nice looking and feel solid. The only thing is that, wow it took a very long time to receive it (month).</li>
    <li> I hate the fact, the item described above says brushes+two-way dotting pens. It has been four months with the back and forth, and my issue is still not resolved!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for sculpting. Great price, fast shipping and very attractive. I&#x27;d purchase them again and recommend them to others. I purchases a couple sets and am happy with their price and performance.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy here they do the job</li>
    <li> I had these UV Gel brushes and they are great! They work good with IBD Gel and Harmony Gel for building gel clear and glitter top coats. The Dotting tools are the absolute perfect size that you can ask for. I highly recommend these for anyone who does gel.</li>
    <li> I received this item way earlier than expected...all in good shape with sturdy packaging.  They&#x27;re a little shorter than i thought they would be, but nothing that hinders the product.  I haven&#x27;t used any of them yet, but they look like they&#x27;ll work just fine!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality and work great for applying gel. The dotting tools make designs with dots so much easier then the homemade tools I was using. Having different sizes in both sets gives you a lot of options.</li>
    <li> i love the design pens but the brushes are bushy after 2 uses. i soaked them in my brush cleaner and everything.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice their everything I wanted and expected. It did take the full amount of time listed for me to receive them bur it was well worth it</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for using with my gel polish, I also use them for builder gel.the dotting tools were a great bonus for me and work perfect for little designs. Longer shipping but that was expected and worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item 3 weeks ago, finally got package today and it contained individual cups to soak nails for polish/artificial nail removal that cost less than 1/2 of what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;This is a total rip off!!!</li>
    <li> great little set. I would buy this again if I had to.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails!  I have a lot of different kinds of nail brushes, but so far, I like these the best.  They are thick enough and narrow enough for my liking.  Other brushes were too wide and flat which makes it hard to keep the gel away from my cuticles.  The dotting tools are nice too.  Great set! Great price!</li>
    <li> The dotters are great, the brushes are not. I had them come apart after the first use.... you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Great price and really love the dotting tools. Dont know what to do with 6 of the art brushes because they are all the same size and shape</li>
    <li> Items received as communicated in description. Have not tried yet, but good quality.</li>
    <li> They took a while to get here. I was scared I wouldn&#x27;t get them. The brushes are amazing and easy to clean. The dotting pens are great also</li>
    <li> These are perfect brushes and made well. Love the pink an white design. Been using for a few montgs now with water paints and nail polish. They have not fell apart nor have the brissles shed any.</li>
