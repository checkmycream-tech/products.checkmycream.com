### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part?  </li>
      <li>, this is probably the best over-the-counter drying solution I have ever tried and do recommend it!</li>
      <li>I am loving this drying lotion!!!  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great!</li>
      <li>This acne drying lotion is one of the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>If the pimple doesn&#x27;t appear to be a cystic-type we&#x27;ve had great luck with in a 24-hour period of keeping it at bay.  </li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>this would be a great product.  </li>
      <li>However, the redness and swelling of the whiteheads had been greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>Happy to say that the skin around the pimple wasn&#x27;t effected with drying out or flaking.  </li>
      <li>If this formula works for you, great, but I don&#x27;t see it as a</li>
      <li>Both of them loved this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t describe itself as superior to benzoyl peroxide but as an alternative for anyone who has benzoyl peroxide sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is good for a spot treatment and the pimple is gone in about 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>The combination is great and you do have make sure you shake the bottle well before use.</li>
      <li>this Acnefree Drying Lotion was something I was very excited to give a try!  </li>
      <li>It is absolutely amazing, put in on at night and by morning either the breakout is gone or substantially improved.  </li>
      <li>Works amazing for my skin.</li>
      <li>so I shook it up to blend it up nicely.  </li>
      <li>This drying lotion is a nice addition to your medicine cabinet for that &amp;#34;skin emergency.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I cannot say that I found this product especially effective, or any more effective than good quality facial</li>
      <li>This lotion is the best we have tried so far.  </li>
      <li>I found this to be very light and drying.</li>
      <li>Dupe of the iconic Mario Badescu drying potion .&lt;br</li>
      <li>My youngest daughter thought that it was good and worth using.  </li>
      <li>I could see some improvement in their faces and think that if they would use this for a longer period of two weeks that it would show more in clearing up some of their problem areas.  </li>
      <li>In that case, the Proactive line is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I used the drying lotion for one more night and the breakout was gone.  </li>
      <li>and it took forever to convince my son that once it was shook up well it would be ok to apply.</li>
      <li>The medicine does feel potent when it&#x27;s on</li>
      <li>I was hoping (unrealistically) that I would be able to put this on overnight</li>
      <li>This is a really interesting product...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
      <li>but I think there are definitely better alternatives out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and potion out there, as I&#x27;m sure many of you have.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an interesting product.</li>
      <li>We have tried so many products that I have lost count.  </li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it .</li>
      <li>both are on top of breakouts, treating them as soon as they think about popping up.  </li>
      <li>You WANT the two substances to be separated when you use it - the oily stuff on the top part of the bottle and the creamy stuff on the bottom part of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>Some more warnings should have been on this, considering how strong it is.</li>
      <li>The antiseptic kind of absorbs in to the q-tip too quickly</li>
      <li>It works good on whiteheads as well as larger boil type pimples and is even good for razor burn and ingrown</li>
      <li>It is best used before bed as it wold appear as pink spots on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly, within seconds.  </li>
      <li>My son thought it was ok nothing special.  </li>
      <li>If you put it on before going to bed, you can notice a huge difference in the morning.</li>
      <li>That to me is worth it, because for me, it&#x27;s the redness that stands out on my face when I have a pimple; without the redness my face looks quite a bit better.</li>
      <li>is the second product we have tried from this brand and have seen great results.</li>
      <li>I tend to see it primarily along my jawline.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to keep them separate like this.  </li>
      <li>important thing about the Drying Lotion is to follow the instructions.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find this drying lotion very effective on larger zits, except perhaps in reducing redness a bit.</li>
      <li>This is a great overnight solution if your skin is not very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Although I love looking younger, I don&#x27;t love the blemishes!  </li>
      <li>a normal Q-Tip works fine with the Acne Free Drying lotion, I would suggest checking the makeup section of the store for a Q-tip like swab that is more pointed.  </li>
      <li>Always use it on clean skin and try not to get it on areas that do not have pimples or acne.</li>
      <li>The first product we tried was the scrub and we had great results with that and decided to continue to buy it regularly.</li>
      <li>You wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup over it or conceal it without rubbing it off; it is really just a nighttime treatment.</li>
      <li>so the bottle will last quite some time and is a good value for money.</li>
      <li>next day, the situation should improve somewhat, drying out a good amount of the blemish.</li>
      <li>This AcneFree lotion seemed to work better for him than most of the other over the counter medicines we have tried (and we have tried many).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I have not been as lucky as others who say they had pimples disappear overnight, but I have had overnight improvement.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a quick fix</li>
      <li>This drying lotion works quickly to reduce redness and to shrink pimples.</li>
      <li>As long as you&#x27;re willing to work with the application process, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Right before bed, I dab it on any problem area and in the morning, the redness and swelling are reduced significantly.</li>
      <li>This Acne free drying lotion has the exact ingredient in it but has the added ingredient of calamine to sooth the skin.</li>
      <li>I am prone to the bright red, large, cystic looking acne that stays around for 2-3 weeks at a time.  </li>
      <li>The product dries fairly quickly and kind of hardens onto your skin and does, indeed, dry out the acne.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t something that you will want to put all over your face as a prevention method, it is used right on the pimples when needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a magical cure, but it is one of the more effective over-the-counter treatments I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is really easy to apply and probably more hygienic as you use a cotton swab to dip into the pink sediment on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>bottle is a good size and little dab of this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easy, only takes a bit on a finger tip, and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Most definitely for use at night, after everyone has gone to bed.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly like they say it does, no problems at all.</li>
      <li>As a middle-aged woman most of my acne is hormone related.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m still looking for that magic potion to make the pimple disappear entirely overnight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>First time in my life my blackheads are GONE.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fully aware that there&#x27;s probably nothing out there that will ever make my acne permanently go away so with that</li>
      <li>have a Clinique Acne Solutions spot healing gel that I use on the first feel of something on my face that I don’t want to have appear.  </li>
      <li>It is not intended as a daily wash or anything for more concentrated spots of acne.</li>
      <li>It works great, albeit slowly.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m usually pretty willing to try anything.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Salicylic acid can be effective on acne, but garbaging it up with these other ingredients seems problematic.</li>
      <li>My kids are new to blemishes (pimples) and are very aware of what your skin can look like if you don&#x27;t take care of it.  </li>
      <li>This has certainly helped speed that process.</li>
      <li>but it certainly helps acne heal faster.</li>
      <li>We have tried even pharmacy prescriptions with only mild success.  </li>
      <li>How did it perform on real zits?</li>
      <li>This lotion didn&#x27;t really help that area</li>
      <li>Secondly, and more importantly, most zits don&#x27;t quite disappear overnight or even necessarily at a faster pace than if left alone.</li>
      <li>It does create pink spots, which my husband finds hilarious.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While I rarely get zits, my wife and teenaged daughter fight them regularly.  Both of them loved this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both are on top of breakouts, treating them as soon as they think about popping up.  This stuff works great.  Neither have had a pimple or zit fully form if they attacked it early with this product.  Not sure how well it works on existing breakouts, but it will stop a new one in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy, only takes a bit on a finger tip, and dries quickly.  Since you use so little, even if you have multiple to treat, the bottle will last a long time.  My wife and daughter have both been using this for about 2 weeks and the bottle still looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain salycilic acid, so if you have issues or allergies you may want to try something else.</li>
    <li> This product works about as well as I expected it to - it is hit or miss for me.  It did seem to help dry up some acne but other times I didn&#x27;t feel it did a thing.  As a middle-aged woman most of my acne is hormone related.  I tend to see it primarily along my jawline.  This lotion didn&#x27;t really help that area but it did help with the occasional zit that appeared on my face.  Not sure what the difference would be.  Maybe the jawline acne is a little tougher to get under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good size and little dab of this product goes a long way so the bottle should last a good, long while.  The pink lotion will leave your face with polka dots so this is a product you will only use at home.</li>
    <li> My son and I both used this over a period of a few weeks and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d recommend it. Does it dry out an emerging zit? Yes. The unfortunate cost of this lotion is that it dries out your skin quite a bit. In fact, my son and I both experienced a day or two after effect of dry, dead skin flaking off from the areas we used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s purpose is to control, via drying out, potential pimples, it&#x27;s use is limited. It is not intended as a daily wash or anything for more concentrated spots of acne. Therefore, it&#x27;s rather useless to both of us.</li>
    <li> This is a great overnight solution if your skin is not very sensitive. After the initial sting of the salicylic acid (used in wart removers, callus removers, and acne creams), your skin calms down a bit and forms a slight whitish crust on the area of application. Be careful to not over-apply and only put this stuff on the head or center of the blemish--you really don&#x27;t want this all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, the situation should improve somewhat, drying out a good amount of the blemish. It&#x27;s not a magical cure, but it is one of the more effective over-the-counter treatments I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final word of caution: do not get sun while using this product, or you might get some pigmentation. Some more warnings should have been on this, considering how strong it is.</li>
    <li> This works well enough for that occasional blemish. One does have to wear it overnight and then wash one&#x27;s face in the morning (to remove the dried-on product). For some, this may not be an option (I know that my dermatologist is adamant about not washing my face in the morning if I washed it at night). However, for a teen, this may an option (especially, if that teen merely suffers from a stray blemish once in a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not intended for those with severe break-outs. In that case, the Proactive line is phenomenal. This drying lotion is a nice addition to your medicine cabinet for that &amp;#34;skin emergency.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product does pretty much what any other salicylic acid product does. The addition of the lotion might keep the burning part of the acid down, but it is a real pain to get off your face without having to scrub pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you put this on and sleep with it. WARNING salicylic acid WILL bleach cloth. That means bedding, towels and clothing. Also be aware that you will look ridiculous when you put this on. The lotion dries white and you&#x27;ll look like you have polka dots. I, personally, don&#x27;t like to put this on and have anyone see me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the benefits of this product are any better than prior products, but the white spotty look is a definite detractor.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has battled acne for a while (and let&#x27;s not even talk about how long) knows that it can feel like an intractable problem. Benzoyl peroxide topicals have been the gold standard for OTC treatments. This product doesn&#x27;t describe itself as superior to benzoyl peroxide but as an alternative for anyone who has benzoyl peroxide sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so it doesn&#x27;t have benzoyl peroxide; what are the ingredients? I can&#x27;t locate this product on AcneFree&#x27;s own website, which may mean it&#x27;s been discontinued in which case this whole review is moot, but I did find a comprehensive breakdown on the NIH medications website. In addition to 1% salicylic acid, the ingredients include isopropyl alcohol (drying, irritating), water, calamine, zinc oxide (touted as a miracle remedy for zits when I was a teen), and titanium dioxide, a problematic ingredient that can cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that&#x27;s the background. How did it perform on real zits? A few weeks of daily use resulted in this report:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Stings on application (probably because of the alcohol)&lt;br /&gt;* Does not clear whiteheads (its purported objective)&lt;br /&gt;* Creates new inflammation (possibly the alcohol or maybe the titanium dioxide)&lt;br /&gt;* Produces calamine residue that&#x27;s difficult to remove in the morning (but must be removed unless you have very pink skin or don&#x27;t mind walking around with pink splotches)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid can be effective on acne, but garbaging it up with these other ingredients seems problematic. That may be why AcneFree has moved to a micro-benzoyl peroxide base for the products listed on its website. If this formula works for you, great, but I don&#x27;t see it as a Must Try.</li>
    <li> Works amazing for my skin. Oily T-Zone with stubborn blackheads. I started using this product a week ago and i also spread a thin layer of benzoyl peroxide over problem areas. First time in my life my blackheads are GONE.  So for all the mixed reviews....this stuff is now my staple for night time skin care.  Always moisturize before applying any acne product. My go to moisturizer is witch hazel. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The Acnefree Drying Lotion is calamine sediment under a layer of salicylic acid in an alcohol solution.  The alcohol drys, the salicylic acid works to clear the pimple, and the calamine soothes (and drys).  Without shaking the liquid, you dip a swab through to the bottom layer and apply to the pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did help clear my daughter&#x27;s pimples, and worked on my occasional pimple as well.  Did it work better than my usual routine?  I can not say that it did.  For my daughter?  Maybe-if only because the chalky, pink calamine residue reminded her to wash her face and rinse it really well every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is fairly simple, as long as you do not mind a streak of pinkish-white stuff running down your face before you catch it with the other end of the swab.  After application, depending on how prolific the acne spots are, you may look like you have some sort of skin disease that turns your skin a weird color.  Most definitely for use at night, after everyone has gone to bed.  It appears as though the product will last a very long time, as I have been using it, as has my daughter, for over three weeks now and the level in the bottom has barely decreased.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with acne treatments. Love how they help breakouts disappear faster, but hate how they usually leave my skin dry and flaky all around the affected area.  What I really like about Acnefree Drying Lotion is how it doesn&#x27;t cause that patch of unsightly dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product arrived, it had been shaken around in the mail and two solutions were not separated.  By the time I was getting ready for bed, however, the top layer was clear and the pink sediment had completely settled to the bottom of the jar.  I had a small breakout of whiteheads on my chin, the usual result of trying a new makeup product.  After my usual skin care routine of soap/toner/moisturizer, I applied AcneFree Drying Lotion to each whitehead pimple as directed -- dipping a Q-Tip through the clear liquid and into the pink sediment, then dabbing a dot of this on the pimple.  It dries very quickly, within seconds.  The next morning, the medication was still visible, although some of it had clearly rubbed off in the night.  However, the redness and swelling of the whiteheads had been greatly reduced.  I used the drying lotion for one more night and the breakout was gone.  The best part?  No rough, flaky, dry patch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a normal Q-Tip works fine with the Acne Free Drying lotion, I would suggest checking the makeup section of the store for a Q-tip like swab that is more pointed.  I happened to have some on hand at the smaller tips makes applying the drying lotion to a small area so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the look of this product on your skin after it dries, it isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;d want to wear out of the house.  It does create pink spots, which my husband finds hilarious.  You wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply makeup over it or conceal it without rubbing it off; it is really just a nighttime treatment.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like they say it does, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> it does work on drying pimples. Love it . I will recommend to my friends and family. Great.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but nothing in acne care is, in my vast experience. I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and potion out there, as I&#x27;m sure many of you have. I use this in conjunction with AcneFree&#x27;s Severe Acne kit. Right before bed, I dab it on any problem area and in the morning, the redness and swelling are reduced significantly. I don&#x27;t even wash my makeup off because I&#x27;m rather lazy about that at night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Takes a while to get rid of a pimple. I couldn&#x27;t use it longer because my eyes are sensitive and this makes me tear when I put it on my face.</li>
    <li> So, just a little dab will do it.  This simple product makes basic acne control a snap by using two common compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the solution separate, my tendancy is to shake it, one uses a Q-tip and dips into the bottom calamine solution while passing through the salicylic acid.  Apply to whiteheads at bedtime.  Usually within 3 days, it&#x27;s cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wells for spot treatments.  I remember as a teen using a cheap sulfer coumpound and slathering it on my face, like a mask, at bedtime.  It stunk to high heaven, dried the skin like crazy but did the trick for all over the face acne.  This one is the opposite: soothing, not smelly, minimal drying and for individual zits.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very light and drying. Some of my acne has an itch do it and it helps with that also. This does have calamine in it so if you put it on too thick it will be visible like calamine lotion. I don&#x27;t think this is any better than other products out there. While this does help with the minor itch and irritation of my acne I can&#x27;t tell that it makes the acne go away any faster.</li>
    <li> I have a teenager with a serious acne problem.  We have tried even pharmacy prescriptions with only mild success.  This AcneFree lotion seemed to work better for him than most of the other over the counter medicines we have tried (and we have tried many).  One thing grossed my son out though.  In the bottle, as the lotion sits, its the oils separate from the other ingredients and it looked really nasty.  It was actually like this when it arrived at our house and it took forever to convince my son that once it was shook up well it would be ok to apply. I think if your child has a few problem areas of acne this would be a great product.  Unfortunately its no miracle lotion for those really bad acne cases.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It works as it says. I&#x27;d never heard of this stuff until recently. It should be sold in stores. The antiseptic kind of absorbs in to the q-tip too quickly but I can probably refil with toner.</li>
    <li> This drying lotion works well but is messy going on and the fact that you have to put a cotton ball or Q-tip in through the liquid to get to the pink medicine is different. The medicine will leave white on your face while it&#x27;s on so you would only want to use it when in bed. The medicine does feel potent when it&#x27;s on and I believe it does work to help dry the acne. As long as you&#x27;re willing to work with the application process, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a long overdue review.  I&#x27;m not much of a 3-step acne solution product type of a person, but I suffer from adult onset cystic acne and I hate it so I&#x27;m usually pretty willing to try anything.  I&#x27;m fully aware that there&#x27;s probably nothing out there that will ever make my acne permanently go away so with that in mind, I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing about the Drying Lotion is to follow the instructions.  Instincts will have you shaking the bottle to mix up the solution (I did this several times without thinking then after realizing it, I had to leave the bottle on the counter for a while until the heavy &amp;#34;sediment&amp;#34; settled back to the bottom in order to use it).  So the pink chalky sediment sits at the bottom while the more clear liquid suspends above it.  It&#x27;s important to keep them separate like this.  You stick a cotton swab into the bottle all the way down until the cotton is covered by the pink sediment and then apply directly onto the pimple(s) after washing your face before bedtime.  You keep the product on overnight and then wash it off in the morning.  The product dries fairly quickly and kind of hardens onto your skin and does, indeed, dry out the acne.  This is good for a spot treatment and the pimple is gone in about 2-3 days. (I&#x27;m still looking for that magic potion to make the pimple disappear entirely overnight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it because you can&#x27;t apply it even in the early evening if there&#x27;s a chance you have to run to the store or bump into a neighbor for an evening walk.  You&#x27;ll look ridiculous with pink spots painted all over your face.  And if you&#x27;re not careful and hit the pillow too quickly, the solution will go onto your pillowcase/sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, this is probably the best over-the-counter drying solution I have ever tried and do recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin so I occasionaly have pimples pop up especially hormone related. Pimples do take quite a few days to go away if left on their own. This has certainly helped speed that process. It contains salycilic acid for acne and calamine lotion for its cooling property. The combination is great and you do have make sure you shake the bottle well before use. The one con for me is that it is a bit too drying for my skin type but it certainly helps acne heal faster. You pinky have to spot treat so the bottle will last quite some time and is a good value for money.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this drying &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. First of all, it&#x27;s not really a lotion but an alcohol-based salicylic acid solution with calamine sediment that settles at the bottom of the bottle. Ideally, you dip in a q-tip so that the cotton is soaked in the alcohol and has some calamine on it, and then you apply it to your zits; with other similar drying lotions that I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve only had to use the applicator that comes with the lotion to apply directly to zits. Secondly, and more importantly, most zits don&#x27;t quite disappear overnight or even necessarily at a faster pace than if left alone. I didn&#x27;t find this drying lotion very effective on larger zits, except perhaps in reducing redness a bit. So, overall somewhat useful if you have it, but I think there are definitely better alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> This is a really interesting product... you&#x27;re supposed to take a Q-tip and dip it all the way to the bottom of the bottle to pick up a little Calamine lotion before dabbing it on. That part bugs me a little because it&#x27;s wasteful: every time you use it, you have to soak a Q-tip, even if you&#x27;re just using one little spot. But it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been as lucky as others who say they had pimples disappear overnight, but I have had overnight improvement. A big pimple became a smaller pimple; a small pimple became just a red spot. I like that it&#x27;s a spot treatment so the rest of my face doesn&#x27;t get dried out. Be aware that this is only for use at night; your face will have light pink spots wherever you apply the medicine.</li>
    <li> I had my two daughters and my son try this out and they came back with mixed reviews.  My oldest said that it would help on some but not all acne.  My youngest daughter thought that it was good and worth using.  My son thought it was ok nothing special.  I could see some improvement in their faces and think that if they would use this for a longer period of two weeks that it would show more in clearing up some of their problem areas.  It isn&#x27;t a quick fix but I would still recommend getting this for help in controlling acne.</li>
    <li> I still get the occasional pimple, even though I&#x27;m in my late 30s. I do not regularly use any sort of facial care products or acne treatments. I just wash my face with soap in the shower and very occasionally use astringent when my face is particularly dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting product. You WANT the two substances to be separated when you use it - the oily stuff on the top part of the bottle and the creamy stuff on the bottom part of the bottle. Why? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s just how you&#x27;re supposed to use it. I mistakenly shook it up and *then* read the instructions. It&#x27;s actually kind-of fun to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, on all the pimples I&#x27;ve used it on, they seem to have reduced by the next day. I have a feeling this would not work on that deep, cystic acne I used to have back in high school. But, this does dry out my small pimples and reduce redness/soreness by the next morning. For my needs, it works. I have maybe 1-2 small-ish pimples during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s not miracle worker, but if your acne is small and not cystic, I can see this working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that little flakes of it come off when I sleep and I&#x27;m getting little chalk-like marks on my dark brown sheets. Not that big of a deal though.</li>
    <li> Being the mother to 3 up-and-coming teens this Acnefree Drying Lotion was something I was very excited to give a try!  My kids are new to blemishes (pimples) and are very aware of what your skin can look like if you don&#x27;t take care of it.  When a random pimple starts to rear its ugly head, they&#x27;re searching for this bottle.  If the pimple doesn&#x27;t appear to be a cystic-type we&#x27;ve had great luck with in a 24-hour period of keeping it at bay.  Happy to say that the skin around the pimple wasn&#x27;t effected with drying out or flaking.  Definitely reserve this drying lotion for the evening hours as it leaves a white-ish (Calomine looking) color on your skin… not appropriate for wearing to school.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the tiny size of this bottle discourage you as if you didn&#x27;t get your monies worth… this will last you forever.  Forever!</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I suffer from adult acne breakouts.  We have tried so many products that I have lost count.  This lotion is the best we have tried so far.  It is absolutely amazing, put in on at night and by morning either the breakout is gone or substantially improved.  Some take maybe two or three nightly applications, but usually the redness is gone after only one and then use it for one or two additional nights and it disappears totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems, it does what it is suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, don&#x27;t shake the bottle,  it is a two layer product.  The bottle may look small, but it but I think it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> This drying lotion works quickly to reduce redness and to shrink pimples. It does dry the skin when used often, so especially if you have sensitive skin, you will only want to use it when necessary and do not overuse. If you put it on before going to bed, you can notice a huge difference in the morning. You only need the tiniest little bit. The bottle is small, but since you use so very little each time, it should last for months and months. After you wash your face, just get a little on your finger and rub it on any acne spots or pimples. Always use it on clean skin and try not to get it on areas that do not have pimples or acne. It isn&#x27;t something that you will want to put all over your face as a prevention method, it is used right on the pimples when needed. You can just dab it on with your finger tip and you barely need a drop for a small area of acne. It works good on whiteheads as well as larger boil type pimples and is even good for razor burn and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second product we have tried from this brand and have seen great results. The first product we tried was the scrub and we had great results with that and decided to continue to buy it regularly. This drying lotion is now another product that we will continue to buy because it works.</li>
    <li> This acne drying lotion is one of the best I have tried. I was able to zap the zit progressively in the course of a few days without overly drying the skin around it. It&#x27;s important to follow the directions on the bottle as you are supposed to dip a cotton swab into the pink sediment at the bottom of the bottle, so don&#x27;t shake the bottle. It is best used before bed as it wold appear as pink spots on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product. It works great, albeit slowly. It generally takes 2-3 days for the pimple to dry out and disappear.</li>
    <li> Don’t shake the bottle.  I took it out of the package—which was special in itself and reminded me of Mattel—and saw that the pink stuff was on the bottom so I shook it up to blend it up nicely.  LOL.  You are supposed to leave it unshaken.  And seriously who reads the little print on the side of the box?  Just in case, it is also on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really easy to apply and probably more hygienic as you use a cotton swab to dip into the pink sediment on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Clinique Acne Solutions spot healing gel that I use on the first feel of something on my face that I don’t want to have appear.  In five years, I have probably used ½ of a .5 ounce bottle.  A little goes a long way.  It turns out that it is just salicylic acid that did not have to cost whatever Clinique charged for it.  This Acne free drying lotion has the exact ingredient in it but has the added ingredient of calamine to sooth the skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I ended up tossing it after I bought clinicians complex, which works!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously its not worth saving a few dollars if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It might look like the other more expensive formulations, but clearly its not.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my son in April, my face seems to think I am once again a teenager rather than a woman who just turned 40.  Although I love looking younger, I don&#x27;t love the blemishes!  I am prone to the bright red, large, cystic looking acne that stays around for 2-3 weeks at a time.  I am loving this drying lotion!!!  My acne isn&#x27;t gone overnight, but it is concealable after a day and it&#x27;s gone in 3-4 days.  LOOOOOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I found this product especially effective, or any more effective than good quality facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;It did dry up my oily T zone.  It was dried that skin that was not oily and that created some flaking.  Not a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the tight, pasty feeling on my skin after I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;Not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Dupe of the iconic Mario Badescu drying potion .&lt;br /&gt;It has two layers- pink sediment has calamine and clear top layer has salicylic acid in alcohol base.&lt;br /&gt;I had so so results.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on a truly huge and painful cystic pimple.&lt;br /&gt;Applied it nightly, and I don&#x27;t think it helped speed up resolution&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that it would work on smaller, less cystic spots</li>
    <li> This has good points and bad points. I was hoping (unrealistically) that I would be able to put this on overnight, wake up the next morning and have my zits be gone. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t work quite like that. My bottle came all shaken up, so as the instructions said, I set it on the table and within a few hours it had separated itself and looked the way it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s really easy to apply. You just stick a cotton swab all the way down into the pink layer and then dab it on to the pimples on your face. It takes a couple of minutes to dry, then you can go to bed. Now, like I said it&#x27;s not a miracle and your pimple will not disappear overnight, but for me, it reduced the redness by almost 100%. That to me is worth it, because for me, it&#x27;s the redness that stands out on my face when I have a pimple; without the redness my face looks quite a bit better.</li>
