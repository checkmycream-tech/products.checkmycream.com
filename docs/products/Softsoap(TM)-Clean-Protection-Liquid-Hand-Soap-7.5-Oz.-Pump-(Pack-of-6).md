      <li>I am very happy.</li>
      <li>If not then you are getting another type that isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>So, that is all good!  </li>
      <li>I am particularly happy because it does not have an overpowering fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many soaps out there, and this is the best.</li>
      <li>its a good buy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>This is good soap, antibacterial and smells clean but not perfumy.</li>

      <li>Seems to work okay in bathrooms.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything was packaged well, and I love the scent of Softsoap.</li>
      <li>very nice item, fast and safe shipping.</li>
      <li>Beware that the good stuff MUST say \\&quot;Clean Protection with light</li>
      <li>That is so much cheaper than buying these pumps, looks better (with a nice pump), and most importantly is much better for the environment,</li>
      <li>It has very good lathering power, and just enough moisturizers to keep your hands from drying out.</li>
      <li>I wanted a moisturizing soap that was easy on the skin but that also was antibacterial.</li>
      <li>These work just fine.</li>
      <li>This is fine with me but may mislead some folks.</li>
      <li>thank you so much!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems to clean my hands</li>
      <li>It lathers well, smells good, and does not dry out our hands.</li>
      <li>This product works great for general hand cleaning, and for faces, EVEN if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>so much for the 15% savings!!  </li>
      <li>There is no weird smell and your hands just feel clean.</li>
      <li>I bought the six pack because you go through these pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I may be alone in my opinion, but I don&#x27;t like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>It was a pretty good deal, but it was a little cheaper</li>
      <li>At first they tried to tell me it is the result of the shape of the bottle</li>
      <li>5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
      <li>its a good deal I will say it will last at least 2 months or more if you budget right</li>
      <li>We bought this soap to constantly clean and disinfect our hands when handling our young children.</li>
      <li>I just purchase a large liquid soap refill fro CVS or somewhere and fill up my dispenser.</li>
      <li>This soap was in the boys&#x27; bathroom, and he tried it on a whim, and it is SO gentle, that it works wonders for his face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It was delivered in a pack of 6 to my doorstep thanks to</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a very efficient soap, and you don&#x27;t need much to wash your hands.</li>
      <li>Not cutting grease is a major problem in the kitchen as you can imagine.  </li>
      <li>I think it definitely it makes us use more soap -- mostly because we instinctively look for the same touch-and-feel that we get with the other Softsoap</li>
      <li>one of the reasons I purchased this particular soap.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>To whatever travel use you put it, make sure that the soap dispenser \\&quot;stands up\\&quot; in your toiletry bag in a pocket that holds it firmly in place.</li>
      <li>In each case we found the Soft Soap to be far better than your typical bars of motel soap.</li>
      <li>My teenage son has acne and has tried many different soaps and cleansers, some recommended by the dermatologist and others we have simply \\&quot;tried\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re attractive small bottles with no strong scent.</li>
      <li>Kills the germs, yet leaves his skin leaving soft and supple, even though he is on a rather strict regimen of face-cleaning and medications for the acne.  </li>
      <li>What do you need to say about Soft Soap?  </li>
      <li>Overall, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m washing my hands of this whole situation and trying something different next time around.</li>
      <li>Last summer I packed a dispenser of Soft Soap in my LL Bean family-size toiletry bag.</li>
      <li>They dispense the right amount of soap, whatever you need, and you generally need very little to get the job done.</li>

    <li> very nice item, fast and safe shipping. I am very happy. thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> what???  i bought this through \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; and it cost $9.62 (with the 15% savings) for a pack of 6.  the very next month, it changed to $12.04, a 25% increase. so much for the 15% savings!!  A 25% increase?  on principle alone, i&#x27;ve canceled this subscription.</li>
    <li> I may be alone in my opinion, but I don&#x27;t like this product very much.  I purchased it because I wanted a soap that kills germs.  However, it is not very sudsy and it doesn&#x27;t cut grease.  Not cutting grease is a major problem in the kitchen as you can imagine.  And I have to wonder if it&#x27;s really killing 99% of the germs if I&#x27;ve still got raw hamburger fat on my fingers (leftover, let&#x27;s say, from making meatballs) after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.  Less of a problem is the lack of suds.  I think it definitely it makes us use more soap -- mostly because we instinctively look for the same touch-and-feel that we get with the other Softsoap products-- but that wouldn&#x27;t be a dealbreaker in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it for the kitchen or any place where grease is going to be a problem.  Seems to work okay in bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
    <li> My teenage son has acne and has tried many different soaps and cleansers, some recommended by the dermatologist and others we have simply \\&quot;tried\\&quot;.  This soap was in the boys&#x27; bathroom, and he tried it on a whim, and it is SO gentle, that it works wonders for his face.  Kills the germs, yet leaves his skin leaving soft and supple, even though he is on a rather strict regimen of face-cleaning and medications for the acne.  The other reviewer knocks this product for use in the kitchen, but when all these emollients are in the product, it is meant to kill germs and SOOTHE, rather than remove grease.  This product works great for general hand cleaning, and for faces, EVEN if you have sensitive skin.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> How do you write a review about soap? Hmmm. It&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this stuff does smell good.&lt;br /&gt;It does lather easily.&lt;br /&gt;The container has never broke.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean my hands (I haven&#x27;t been sick since 2005).&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a pack of 6 to my doorstep thanks to Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay . . . there&#x27;s my soap review. 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;;-)</li>
    <li> Spending no more then $6 to get 6 packs is nothing to complain. It&#x27;s a good deal. The smell of this soap is also refresh, I like it.</li>
    <li> These work just fine. They dispense the right amount of soap, whatever you need, and you generally need very little to get the job done. They&#x27;re efficient, up to the point where the bottle is getting low... you&#x27;ll probably want to pour the last of the soap into another bottle, as the pump stops working too soon. Oh, keep the bottles for other uses. I have one of them dispensing dish soap, now, and another for shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is good soap, antibacterial and smells clean but not perfumy. It was a pretty good deal, but it was a little cheaper and I did the subscribe and save, but it looks like this is no longer an option for this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Washes away bacteria\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the same thing as Anti-Bacterial Soap. This is fine with me but may mislead some folks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in bulk, so I decided to buy this through Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did! Everything was packaged well, and I love the scent of Softsoap. As long as the price doesn&#x27;t change, I&#x27;ll continue to buy this when I need it.</li>
    <li> This soap is a con job by palmolive the straw on it is too short and leaves over at least 10% of the soap on the bottom that isn&#x27;t caught by the straw. I called the company and they did not disagree with this fact.  At first they tried to tell me it is the result of the shape of the bottle but I claimed that even so the straw doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom at which point they told me they would note my dissatisfaction of this to customer relations. Meanwhile if you buy a pack of 6 soap dispensers you are really only getting 5 and 1/4.</li>
    <li> This soap is nice and soapy and smells good and has just the right amount of moisturizing. So, that is all good!  However, it claims to have Triclosan which is a antibacterial ingredient and one of the reasons I purchased this particular soap. I wanted a moisturizing soap that was easy on the skin but that also was antibacterial. But when I looked at the ingredients on the actual soap container Triclosan was not listed as an ingredient and the container also does not claim to be antibacterial anywhere on the packaging.  So, the product description on Amazon compared to the product description on the product itself seem to be out of alignment.   So yes, I like the soap, but no, it does not contain Triclosan and is therefore not technically antibacterial. I&#x27;m washing my hands of this whole situation and trying something different next time around.</li>
    <li> Just another one of those things I but online instead of at a grocery store or drug store.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What do you need to say about Soft Soap?  I bought the six pack because you go through these pretty quickly.  They&#x27;re attractive small bottles with no strong scent.</li>
    <li> We bought this soap to constantly clean and disinfect our hands when handling our young children. It lathers well, smells good, and does not dry out our hands. I am particularly happy because it does not have an overpowering fragrance.  Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Packing Tip: Last summer I packed a dispenser of Soft Soap in my LL Bean family-size toiletry bag. I unloaded it and put it by the sink in every motel we stayed at from Tucson all the way to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. I brought along another dispenser for the Queen Mary 2 and another for our ten-day German road trip in pursuit of information about WW 2. In each case we found the Soft Soap to be far better than your typical bars of motel soap. After all, sometimes the maid doesn&#x27;t even give you one, or she gives you only one bar for both the shower and the sink. It&#x27;s better to travel prepared with all the comforts of home.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you drive an RV, you can supply your RV bathroom with a dispenser like this. Whenever you stop, you can wash your hands in style.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.S To whatever travel use you put it, make sure that the soap dispenser \\&quot;stands up\\&quot; in your toiletry bag in a pocket that holds it firmly in place. Otherwise it might leak. That would be messy.&lt;br /&gt;by Linda Cargill, author of Key to Lawrence</li>
    <li> its a good deal I will say it will last at least 2 months or more if you budget right its a good buy</li>
    <li> I used to purchase these but no longer do so. I just purchase a large liquid soap refill fro CVS or somewhere and fill up my dispenser. That is so much cheaper than buying these pumps, looks better (with a nice pump), and most importantly is much better for the environment,</li>
    <li> I wash my hands extensively, all day long. I&#x27;ve tried many soaps out there, and this is the best. It has very good lathering power, and just enough moisturizers to keep your hands from drying out. Does not leave a film on your hands. There is no weird smell and your hands just feel clean. It&#x27;s also a very efficient soap, and you don&#x27;t need much to wash your hands. Beware that the good stuff MUST say \\&quot;Clean Protection with light moisturizers\\&quot; on the bottle. If not then you are getting another type that isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
    <li> I find that hand soaps at stores are pricey.  This gets me a lot so I don&#x27;t have to keep this item on my shopping list.</li>
