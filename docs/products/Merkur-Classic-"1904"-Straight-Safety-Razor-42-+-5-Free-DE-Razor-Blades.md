      <li>so it is very easy to drop this.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

      <li>not the \\&quot;top notch\\&quot; quality people say Merkurs have.</li>
      <li>I have been using this razor for years now and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the feel and look.  </li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay much more for it.</li>
      <li>This is the razor I use the most.</li>
      <li>Muhle and Jagger are much much better quality razors.</li>
      <li>When he recieved it, we were able to talk about it and \\&quot;I like that fancy razor alot Dad</li>
      <li>Used the Mekur blade first and loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderfully well made product, and with a little practice, it does indeed give a better , more satisfying experience than a Fusion or whatnot.</li>
      <li>This is my first DE razor and I must say I am extremely pleased!</li>
      <li>but it was easy to use.</li>
      <li>so it was easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>Nice looking razor with a good shave head the only reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hooked on the idea of using a safety razor from now on and this model was very easy to use for me to use right out of the box.</li>
      <li>While mild razors are ok, they&#x27;re not for me.</li>
      <li>So far this has been very suitable for me.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the important thing to remember.</li>
      <li>Simple elegance at a great price</li>
      <li>If you need another pass, re-lather and shave lightly at an upward direction.</li>
      <li>Merkur is doing a good job keeping the dream alive.</li>
      <li>The handle is nice and heavy and the shave feels great.</li>
      <li>I like the way they shave better than all those new more costly razors.</li>
      <li>My first safety razor and love it.</li>
      <li>I dropped it about 3 times from my face to the sink and the head came clean off.</li>
      <li>I recently cut my fingers pretty good when they slipped while changing the blade, but I&#x27;m more to blame for that than the razor itself, after all, it was made to cut things.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;ll get a better shave at a fraction of the cost over the long haul, he&#x27;ll look better afterwards as well once he gains confidence,  plus it&#x27;ll be better for his skin.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that the 5 free blades were fairly crappy, I put in some Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades in it and work great!!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it shaves better than my other safety razors, but it shaves just as good as any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Man it&#x27;s true what they say, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to</li>
      <li>Not a bad DE razor considering the price.</li>
      <li>Again, not a bad razor for the price</li>
      <li>This is much more of the 1904 original gillette model (real old school).  </li>
      <li>This was my very first safety razor.</li>
      <li>Takes some getting used to but totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Well constructed, good looking, and great price, my only complaint is how the blade is removed/changed on this beauty</li>
      <li>With many claiming to have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Three solid pieces which is extremely easy to clean and change the blade.  </li>
      <li>Having purchased one of these for myself about a month ago, I was excited to share a new experience with my son, if even from overseas.  </li>
      <li>I could tell the difference after the first shave and after about a week</li>
      <li>This my first safety razor.  </li>
      <li>My first shave, I was a bit nervous thinking</li>
      <li>You have to play with the blade to make sure it aligns properly.</li>
      <li>I found the handle to be a bit too short for my liking, but longer handled razors are made - by Mekur and many others.</li>
      <li>It became more essential during WW1 when a razor just like this was issued to the troops going overseas.</li>
      <li>I did have one issue at first</li>
      <li>I was scared using it at first my first safety razor.</li>
      <li>but it did not last more than six months.</li>
      <li>this is a replica of the razor that started it all, the first razor a man would use to shave himself.</li>
      <li>No cuts or anything the first time around and this thing will give you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Refils are only a dollar in most stores.</li>
      <li>I love the short length and weight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s solidly build and will last a long time but the finish isn&#x27;t the best.    </li>
      <li>That being said, it is far superior to the Mach 3 and the Fusion and Fusion Power and whatever other incarnation the multiblade comes in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recently I bought one of these razors and immediately knew this was a piece of junk. The cap was not even square! See the pictures. The molding of the backplate was terrible. I have returned the razor and have ordered another one from another vendor. Same story plus now I also had a missing chunk of plating on the handle. The threads are coarse and dirty. You have to play with the blade to make sure it aligns properly. I cannot believe this razor is made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a perfectionist. Some people probably would not care as long as they enjoy the shave. But I want to enjoy also the looks, the feel, the overall quality of the razor I shave with. Muhle and Jagger are much much better quality razors.</li>
    <li> If you want a close shave with no irritation buy this Merkur saftey razor.  It comes with one Merkur razor which is also excellent.  I also ordered other blades I haven&#x27;t used yet.  It is very well built and will last a lifetime.  I like the fact that it is not a butterfly type of razor (i.e. where you turn the knob and it opens the top and then you drop the razor in).  This is much more of the 1904 original gillette model (real old school).  You simply twist the handel and it comes apart the top, the base and the handel.  Three solid pieces which is extremely easy to clean and change the blade.  No moving parts and will last forever.    Simple elegance at a great price and I now look forward to shaving.  The best purchase I made in years.</li>
    <li> First time with the classic and it wasn&#x27;t too hard to learn.  I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t add that much more time in the morning.  Been using it for a few weeks and very few nicks...nothing worse than what I got with expensive cartridge blades.  I would highly recommend the switch and this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for some time now, and I&#x27;m very impressed, I&#x27;ve been getting decent shaves, even in the \\&quot;feeling out\\&quot; period, and I actually look forward to shaving after I got my hands on a badger brush and some of the Sienna shaving cream from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn. My only complaint is that the handle is a bit hard to grip at times, which isn&#x27;t a problem so much with shaving, but makes it a huge problem to twist the head off to change the blade. I recently cut my fingers pretty good when they slipped while changing the blade, but I&#x27;m more to blame for that than the razor itself, after all, it was made to cut things. I would recommend this razor for just about anyone looking to get into wetshaving.</li>
    <li> If you want to save money.... Refils are only a dollar in most stores. I like the way they shave better than all those new more costly razors.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews online that this would be a good starter razor. So far this has been very suitable for me. It is the perfect size and has eliminated the ingrown hair issue I use to have. If i could change anything, I would have gone with a two piece instead of this three piece. This is just for my preference.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Merkur Classic razor because I have sensitive skin. I have been using this razor for years now and absolutely love it. The handle is nice and heavy and the shave feels great. I use the Derby Extra blades which are very sharp and at a good price. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is the razor I use the most. I have other types, \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; razors. The old Gillette Superspeeds, a Schick Krona and Gillette Adjustable and a couple of others. While those are all good, this one is better. It is more aggressive than the other razors, with the exception possibly being the adjustable. While mild razors are ok, they&#x27;re not for me. This one gives me a great shave all the time (if I do my part). Granted it is small compared to the others but I got used to it. And it is smaller than the modern multiblade razors being made today. That being said, it is far superior to the Mach 3 and the Fusion and Fusion Power and whatever other incarnation the multiblade comes in. Remember that the best technique is to let the razor and blade do the work. None of this push against the face and pull it down. Find the right cutting angle (about 30 degress) and let it glide down your face. No pressure. That&#x27;s the important thing to remember. No pressure. If you need another pass, re-lather and shave lightly at an upward direction. It&#x27;s beard reduction. With a multiblade like the Mach 3, you do one pass and you&#x27;ve shaved your face 3 times. And most guys will do multiple passes over the same area, meaning that they acutally shave their faces 6,9, or 12 times. And then they wonder why they have such lousy shaves with irritation and bumps and redness. With many claiming to have sensitive skin. Shaving with this (once you&#x27;ve learned how) will show that it isn&#x27;t sensitive skin but lousy shaves which are the problem.  And while you&#x27;re at it get a decent shave brush, badger or boar and a decent soap or cream and ditch the canned goo or gel. Your shaving experience will improve greatly.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my son.  Having purchased one of these for myself about a month ago, I was excited to share a new experience with my son, if even from overseas.  When he recieved it, we were able to talk about it and \\&quot;I like that fancy razor alot Dad...I&#x27;ll look really good shaving\\&quot;.  Which is part of the whole point.  He&#x27;ll get a better shave at a fraction of the cost over the long haul, he&#x27;ll look better afterwards as well once he gains confidence,  plus it&#x27;ll be better for his skin.  He likes it alot so I anticipate a lifetime of great shaves for him with this razor.  Shipping was crazy fast too.</li>
    <li> Throw away your disposibles, and step into flavour country. Well constructed, good looking, and great price, my only complaint is how the blade is removed/changed on this beauty, it is a bit cumbersome as you have to take the unit apart. I plan on buying a Merkur that has the knob that opena and closes the razor, and putting this model in my \\&quot;away\\&quot; dopp kit.</li>
    <li> King Gillette revolutionized shaving when he invented this. Earlier safety razors used forged rather than the ultra thin stamped blades we know today. This razor shaves very well. I found the handle to be a bit too short for my liking, but longer handled razors are made - by Mekur and many others.</li>
    <li> I have always bought the mach 3 or 4 or some razors with five blades and I have had terrible razor burn on my neck for years.  I could tell the difference after the first shave and after about a week, I do not have a single bump on my neck.  I wish I had switched sooner.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out which blades work best for me, but I love this razor.</li>
    <li> Love the razor! Much much cheaper to use than any of the current disposables. I love the feel of the razor in my hand. Much easier to use than the straight edge I was using.</li>
    <li> Not a bad DE razor considering the price. Better quality than other cheaper ones but not the \\&quot;top notch\\&quot; quality people say Merkurs have. It&#x27;s solidly build and will last a long time but the finish isn&#x27;t the best.    Another issue is the handle, it&#x27;s fairly short so it might take a few shaves to get used to it.     I liked it though, it&#x27;s not overly aggressive, it&#x27;s forgiving, fairly well balanced, and original looking considering today&#x27;s standards.     The design is great if you want something with some \\&quot;character\\&quot; but don&#x27;t want to buy a used antique razor.     Again, not a bad razor for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t pay much more for it. There are other brands out there that offer outstanding quality at a similar price and, unless I have no choice, I&#x27;ll stick with those.</li>
    <li> The handle on this razor is to small and is hard to handle while shaving.  Also make the head of the razor hard to handle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razor shaving, I live overseas and the gillette fusion replacement blades are very expensive in Europe compared to the States. I bought this razor to try since it was recommended as a good razor for the beginner on another website. Everything arrived with my razor as advertised by the seller in less than a week to Europe. My first shave, I was a bit nervous thinking I was going to cut myself but it was easy to use. I&#x27;ve managed a dozen or so shaves without any cuts using this razor coupled with Derby blades and Taylor&#x27;s Sandlewood shave cream. I&#x27;m hooked on the idea of using a safety razor from now on and this model was very easy to use for me to use right out of the box.</li>
    <li> Man it&#x27;s true what they say, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to but yeah Merkur is doing a good job keeping the dream alive. I was scared using it at first my first safety razor. Thankfully I am left handed and I&#x27;ve always held my shaving razor a certain way so it was easy to get used to. No cuts or anything the first time around and this thing will give you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of getting the feather blades and going all out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Looks like the extra blades that came with it are from a brand called, \\&quot;Crown\\&quot; its made an Egypt and man does it kill my skin.</li>
    <li> Build quality is excellent, has a good weight to it.  Works great and feels better than a cartridge on my face.  Replacement blades are super inexpensive and last two or three shaves for me, which is good because I have a tough beard.  IMO, throw that over priced cartridge razor away and switch to a double edge safety razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  I love the short length and weight.  I will never switch back to disposable.</li>
    <li> This razor is a heavy duty razor, it has a very comfortable weight to it. It is small but not hard to use and the design of the handle makes it easy to use. My only complaint would be that the 5 free blades were fairly crappy, I put in some Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades in it and work great!!</li>
    <li> Wow!! Amazing product. I shaved with a fairly thick beard that would usually hurt when i shaved prior. This razor shaved it no problem, no irritation and i have some face eczema. It cut the hair like butter. Great!</li>
    <li> Nice looking razor with a good shave head the only reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the handle can be a bit slippery.</li>
    <li> this is a replica of the razor that started it all, the first razor a man would use to shave himself. Before that, only a wealthy man would have his valet shave him daily. Everyone else went to the penny barber. But with this, a man could do it himself. It became more essential during WW1 when a razor just like this was issued to the troops going overseas. But I digress. It&#x27;s a wonderfully well made product, and with a little practice, it does indeed give a better , more satisfying experience than a Fusion or whatnot. Now, for headshaving, I still prefer a Headblade- this is not really compatible with the shape of the human noggin. But for the face, treat yourself. You only get one!!</li>
    <li> This was my very first safety razor. Having used Mach 3 and other trio-bladed razors, I decided to give my &amp;#34;dad&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor a spin. I did some research on the subject, and Merkur razors in general before making a purchase. based on the reviews and others shaving experiences, I took the plunge. I&#x27;m glad I did. I used a quality badger brush, shave cream from Taylor of Bond street, Derby razor blades, and clubman bay rum aftershave. The weight of the razor is such that I really did not have to use much pressure. The razor slides down my cheeks effortlessly and you can see the results of a very close shave. Best I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I did have one issue at first and that was the short handle. I got used to it after about a weeks use. It&#x27;s like second nature to me now. There is a long handled model out there, but I think the short length balances well with the weight of the razor. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I received the razor on the schedule shipment time. Which was great. It was sealed very nicely. All in all the razor performs at tip top shape and is very nice looking.</li>
    <li> When looking into safety razors I was told don&#x27;t settle with anything that&#x27;s not from Germany by a well-respected barber and I have to say it&#x27;s an amazing shave and well made razor!</li>
    <li> I used a mach 3 before trying a DE razor and i will never go back. Gives you a close shave without the irritation. Takes some getting used to but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> First timmer for the DE world and this razor did a perfect job at never wanting to use cartridge shaving again....proper use of pre and post shave balms and youll feel like a movie star.....im ready for my close up....</li>
    <li> The great part about Merkurs is the heads are all identical.  I can swap heads with this razor and my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]] and they&#x27;re exactly the same.  I wanted a smaller handled razor to fit in my travel shave kit and this was the least expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 5 years now, and I&#x27;ve also tried a handful of cheaper DE razors and they just don&#x27;t compare to the functionality.  I&#x27;m all about saving money, but I ended up spending a few bucks over the years trying out the cheaper DE razors so I&#x27;d have a spare for travel.  My findings were that they all paled in comparison to the Merkur I had bought previously.  From the two buck Sodial to the more expensive [[ASIN:B00E6BQEEA Van Der Hagen Safety Razor]] they were all poorly made and didn&#x27;t offer a good shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally broke down and ordered a spare Merkur, choosing this one since it was the least expensive option at the time.  The head is exactly the same as my other Merkur, as I said before, so the shave is fantastic.  The handle isn&#x27;t quite as \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; as the knurled ones, but it still grips and I have no problem holding on to it.  A few others have complained that they dropped theirs because it was slippery, personally I don&#x27;t see that being an issue with how this is designed, I very much doubt that I will drop this razor any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, take it from someone who&#x27;s tried cheaper stuff, just buy a Merkur.  Get the least expensive one you can find if you have to, but just save yourself some time and money and buy the right razor the first time.</li>
    <li> This razor is very nice, well made, and it shaves good. I can&#x27;t say it shaves better than my other safety razors, but it shaves just as good as any I&#x27;ve used. I like to use the shark blades, they give good results and I highly recommend them. You might different results using different blades. It looks very nice it is a little on the short side, but I find that it is easy to hold and control. I highly recommend this razor. I think you will like it to.</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly and the razor was as expected.  This my first safety razor.  Love the feel and look.  Used the Mekur blade first and loved it. Tried the included Feather blade and it got even better.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and love it. Short handle took a little time to get used too but works great</li>
    <li> This shaved moderately aggressive. The finish looked good and it appears to be well built but it did not last more than six months. The handle is all metal and not very rough so it is very easy to drop this. I dropped it about 3 times from my face to the sink and the head came clean off. id recommend a vintage (i have a 1970) gillette superspeed for the beginner as it is just as forgiving if not more, and has a much better build quality.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I must say I am extremely pleased! It came with one Merkur razor blade and a 5 pack of Derby blades. I prefer the Merkur blade. The razor itself looks small but it fits just right in my hand. It is a beautiful razor and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Best shave ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Now that I have switched to the safety razor I do not see myself ever going back to the modern razors.</li>
    <li> The shaver is well built strong and great quality. If you have thick hair skip this product I know all the reviewers give this item great reviews but its a myth. First of all if you are using a fusion or Mach razor this is not going to work nowhere near as well and if you are in a hurry then don&#x27;t even bother. To get a close shave it will take you about an half hour and you will need to make several passes to get even close to the two passes with my Fusion. To me the price is not worth to get a crappy shave that takes almost a half hour to achieve. Didn&#x27;t work for me but might work for you. This is old tech and that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
