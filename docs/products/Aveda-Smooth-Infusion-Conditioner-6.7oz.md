      <li>nice conditoiner, great for my dry frizz¥ hair</li>
      <li>I can most definitely now see the great results from this</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years.</li>
      <li>When i use this conditioner, it helps reduce frizz, hair feels smooth and touchable.</li>
      <li>I use what ever shampoo i am in mood for and never used the Smooth infusion shampoo, wonder how that would work for me.</li>

      <li>Thanks Aveda :)</li>
      <li>Amazing product, there is simply no substitute.</li>
      <li>Smooth and so much easier to work with.</li>
      <li>What I love is how soft it is.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but this conditioner definitely adds its own talents to the duo.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and silky and very clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works great on my hair makes it smooth and soft but without making it feel weighed down.</li>
      <li>but I chose 3 stars because for me it doesn&#x27;t do the main things it advertises, which are to smooth your hair, get rid of flyaways, and make it straighter.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t Really use the straightnor anymore just on special occasions.  </li>
      <li>Exclusive plant infusion that creates a smooth new surface on hair:</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and so smooth.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Aveda products &amp; this 1 is no different.</li>
      <li>For the price and the reputation of the brand, I expected something more effective that would work on my hair, but it felt like any other conditioner.</li>
      <li>more like it does when I travel to dry climates.</li>
      <li>I bought the large bottle for almost 100 dollars.</li>
      <li>The cheaper brand (but still pricey) was very drying and didn&#x27;t give any \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; effect at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still pricey, hahaha.</li>
      <li>Even wet hair feels more conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My gray is coming in fuzzy and curly, and this product really helps.</li>
      <li>One night I switched back to my left over Aveda and my hair looked great the next day.</li>
      <li>I used an entire bottle of this conditioner in combination with the Smooth Infusion shampoo.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Really does what it promises - my hair acts</li>
      <li>: I have not noticed any difference in this category, even after also using the Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one tries to keep it straight even if the hair is not styled, love it.</li>
      <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner and the style prep smooth infusion after and the dry remedy drops as well.  </li>
      <li>For me it isn&#x27;t worth the extra price.</li>
      <li>I used dove conditioner for the same effect for years when my hair had much better texture, it did serve the purpose but definitely not as much as this does.</li>
      <li>and wow! tangles slide out.</li>
      <li>I do wish i came in the same large pump bottle I purchased of the shampoo</li>
      <li>Also, dove conditioners build up and curl up ur hair - mine is naturally wavy.</li>
      <li>My hair is still soft, silky &amp; shiny today.</li>
      <li>I usually air dry my hair, so that it will not get more damaged/dry.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, relatively thick, wavy hair.</li>

<li> My hair was so much harder to work with.</li>
<li> It made my hair stiff and coarse.</li>
<li> This is ridiculously expensive and really does not work well at all.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with Aveda products please move on to other products, if you are you NEED this.  </li>
<li> I have dark, long and thick hair that got some damage from heat.</li>
<li> But, that is a minor complaint.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> this conditioner onto shower shampoo tangled hair, give it a few minutes</li>
<li> I did use less than usual.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;ve started using it in combination with other Aveda Smooth Infusion products, I&#x27;ve gotten those nasty frizzies under control!</li>
<li> Maybe, but hard to tell.</li>
<li> Mediocre conditioner for an outrageous price.</li>

    <li> This does straighten my hair better. And the more you use it the straighter the hair. I don&#x27;t even have to use my straightener on some days after blow drying.</li>
    <li> Mediocre conditioner for an outrageous price. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner, straightener, and smoother, and I am very pleased. Well worth the price. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth and silky in years. The scent is nice and the results are great. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, relatively thick, wavy hair. I used an entire bottle of this conditioner in combination with the Smooth Infusion shampoo. Aveda claims that this product does the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Daily conditioning that smooths and softens hair up to 60%: I have noticed a definite difference in this category. My hair feels soft and silky and very clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Exclusive plant infusion that creates a smooth new surface on hair: Same as #1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Significantly reduces unwanted wave, helps prevent flyaways: I have not noticed any difference in this category, even after also using the Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Protects against surface damage from heat styling: Maybe, but hard to tell. My hair stylist still said I had a lot of split ends. I&#x27;m not convinced that a shampoo can protect against heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a pretty good conditioner but I chose 3 stars because for me it doesn&#x27;t do the main things it advertises, which are to smooth your hair, get rid of flyaways, and make it straighter. For me it isn&#x27;t worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as expected. If anything my hair got curlier</li>
    <li> Really does what it promises - my hair acts more like it does when I travel to dry climates. Would love it more if it had the trademark Aveda scent! But, that is a minor complaint. I plan to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair makes it smooth and soft but without making it feel weighed down. Thanks Aveda :)</li>
    <li> Only conditioner I ever use!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner for my curly and somewhat frizzy hair. Since I&#x27;ve started using it in combination with other Aveda Smooth Infusion products, I&#x27;ve gotten those nasty frizzies under control!</li>

    <li> I usually love Aveda products &amp; this 1 is no different.

    <li> nice conditoiner, great for my dry frizz¥ hair</li>
    <li> This is ridiculously expensive and really does not work well at all.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Life changing. I am a black female and no longer have to use relaxers going on 2 years now.</li>
    <li> For the price and the reputation of the brand, I expected something more effective that would work on my hair, but it felt like any other conditioner. I have dark, long and thick hair that got some damage from heat. Gonna have to keep looking!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have been using it for a couple of years and will continue to use it.  My hair is damaged from curling it every day and this products tames the frizz.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I bought the large bottle for almost 100 dollars. It made my hair stiff and coarse. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I have my hair highlighted blonde and I don&#x27;t think I could survive the after care without this line.  It is amazing!!!  Makes my hair so soft and so smooth.  There Is no frizz or fly away hair pieces.  What I love is how soft it is.  I don&#x27;t Really use the straightnor anymore just on special occasions.  I use the shampoo and conditioner and the style prep smooth infusion after and the dry remedy drops as well.  Silky smooth and looks so beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair is silky smooth &amp; flatter than it was before. So happy a friend of mine suggested these products.</li>

    <li> My hair loves this stuff.  My gray is coming in fuzzy and curly, and this product really helps.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner-it really makes your hair smooth and shiny (in a good way ;). And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a guy and YES I chose to use this product.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with Aveda products please move on to other products, if you are you NEED this.  It makes my hair feel so good.  I do wish i came in the same large pump bottle I purchased of the shampoo but I just purchased two of these to make up for it. Amazing product, there is simply no substitute.</li>
