<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this because of the review on EWG i was excited to get it, When i went to check the tracking, The tracking doesn&#x27;t work, i wrote it off and waited a few more days still didnt work finally the date it was supposed to be here passed, i sent messages to the seller only getting 2 replies which both said the same thing, Finally i file a claim with amazon, After one month the package comes, i decide to try it out and the smell is AWFUL! So bad i started coughing! I still applied it just to see how it worked, It didnt leave any white residue and smoothed on pretty good but the smell would not go away it stayed the hole day that plus the horrible costumer services defiantly made this the worst</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer with good sun protection that I&#x27;ve found.  It is rated as one of the top safest ingredient sunscreens by the EWG.  It keeps my face moisturized all day without being oily and looks great under my makeup.  I never go a day without it since I discovered it 4 or 5 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> I have used an entire bottle of this product and ordered a second one. I did like it because it goes on easily and does not leave a white cast on my face. I was even willing to put up with the stickiness it leaves on the skin. The big problem is that it causes my face to sweat when it is warm. I have never experienced this with any other product I have used on my face. In addition, it did clog my pores.</li>
    <li> dont know why people say this stuff isnt greasy  ive used it and instantly i feel like i just coated  my face in butter- its an awful feeling.   not to mention that it caused breakouts instantly- skin clearing? i dont think so.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product. I don&#x27;t doubt that it is good for the skin, given all the ingredients listed. But it leaves a very sticky residue that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate. As long as I didn&#x27;t touch my face or neck, it was fine. But if I touched my skin, even several hours after applying, there was a stickiness that never went away. I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on it.</li>
    <li> After much research and reading up on ingredients on various sun screens and sun blocks, I selected Keys Soap as my choice for protecting one&#x27;s face and neck against the powerful UVA/UVA sunshine rays.  Look for titanium dioxide, avobenzone, and zinc for broad-spectrum sun protection.  Try to avoid oxybenzone, added vitamin A, and added insect repellent in your sun screen/sun block, per Environment Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen guide.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen came highly recommended from two perspectives: an effective sunscreen and no harmful ingredients. However, I could not stand how this product smelled!  It smells like last week&#x27;s dinner leftovers. I have not used it again due to the bothersome odor.</li>
    <li> Finally what I have been looking for! A natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me look like Casper the Friendly Ghost. Goes on very easily, feels great-no gritty or oily feel at all. I break out easily, and this is the best facial sunscreen that I have used-it does not cause me to break out at all. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Up here at 6000 feet where the High Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, the sun is intense, and the air is dry.  Keys Soap sunblock does the job -- even when I spend the day out trail riding. My skin still feels moisturized at the end of the day, and yet it never feels greasy.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that super white coat of gunk on your skin that makes you look like you&#x27;re an actor in kabuki theater.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a non-chemical sunblock and chose this because the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommendation.  It feels pretty good going on and it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin.  I wish it came with a tint, and it can make my skin feel warm, but it is far better than some of the other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunblock/moisturizers I have tried.</li>
    <li> This product is so wonderful. It goes on smoothly and works well under makeup. I can&#x27;t stand when you buy an expensive moisturizer with a high SPF and then it ends up flaking or peeling under foundation. It&#x27;s a top-rated EWG.com product, so I feel good about putting on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause breakouts on my oily/combination skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I love it more than any of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. In addition, it ships quite quickly and they always include a free sample of your choice.</li>
    <li> I am a firm believer that people should protect their skin with sunscreen at all times! That being said, I am also very into natural products that do not contain harmful chemicals and synthetics. I have tried a wide range of natural sunscreens, and they were all super heavy and very slow to sink in, or if they did sink in they left a white or greenish cast (depending on the color of the sunscreen I was trying). Keys Solar RX is amazing! It&#x27;s a little streaky going on, but soaks in quickly and evenly and leaves no cast. It&#x27;s pretty thin and spreads very smooth so you only need a little bit. It has definitely improved redness in my skin, I normally have a very red complexion but it has balanced out a lot since I started using Solar RX. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves my skin with a beautiful texture. It gets a rating of only 1 (0-best, 10-worst) on Skin Deep&#x27;s cosmetic safety database (google it), which is amazing for a sunscreen. I seriously love this stuff. It&#x27;s expensive, but it last a long time and it&#x27;s so worth it anyways. I&#x27;d rather pay $30 a year (one bottle has lasted me almost a year so far, and I&#x27;m still using it) on facial sunscreen than have melanoma later. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Keys Island RX castile soap is amazing too, I use it to wash my face and my skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
    <li> We did our research on sunscreens (via the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website) that had the smallest overall toxicity and was most effective in blocking UVA and UVB.  This item ranked #1 or #2 on the list.  We&#x27;ve used it for over 1 year in the sub-tropics (Hawaii) and it works well -- haven&#x27;t yet burned with it on.  My husband, on the other hand, has burned when he forgot to apply it (I remembered and was fine).  We use it for daily application on our face, hands, and arms.  It is not waterproof.    The sunscreen goes on smoothly, is not sticky, and when a thin layer is applied doesn&#x27;t leave your face totally white.  In fact, my face tends to look smoother when I put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t cause pimple break-outs either -- I have combination skin and will get pimples in the sun if I *don&#x27;t* apply it.    I have read people complain about the smell -- it is very light and reminds me a little of turmeric or orange (depends on the individual bottle).  We don&#x27;t mind it.  I had morning sickness during the 1st trimester of pregnancy and the smell was so light it did not make me nauseous, even though all my former shampoos and lotions did.  We also liked that it posed the least carcinogenic risk for pregnant women.    Cost is ~$25/bottle -- you might get a little discount if ordering in bulk from the Keys-Soap website (not sure).  We got a free travel-size bottle (&lt;1 oz.) when we did that.  The cost is worth it to us because of the climate we live in.  We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Items arrived on time and very well packaged. Product is good, very easy to apply. Unfortunately, the astringent ingredients (blood orange and clary sage) make my skin sensitive to the sun, which makes the sunblock counterproductive.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen goes on easily.  There is no white substance left on the skin.  It covers well and isn&#x27;t too thin.    It does have the smell of rosemary which lingers.  It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell, however.  It is rated the best  by the Environmental Working Group and has no harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am always looking for natural products that won&#x27;t break me out.  I have been using Key&#x27;s Solar RX for 2 years now.  It protected my sensitive nose from sunburn in the sunshine of CA and now keeps that same nose moisturized during the drying heat required to get thru a cold WA winter.  This product is the perfect blend of moisturizer and sunblock without being greasy and with no discernable smell.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; sunscreen for 6 months. This is one of the best in terms of applying and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (my college-aged sons would disagree with me on the latter).  However, I want something that is at least sweat resistant. Also, the other big hit I have against this one is the price.  I will say it is much better than Loving Naturals Sunscreen which smells lousy, goes on greasy and stays white longer than the others.</li>
    <li> Had previously ordered this brand in 2010 and was very happy with it, but something is different about it now. It&#x27;s a much stronger and different smell than I remember, so pungent that I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it. It does provide good sunblock coverage, but is not waterproof, so it must be reapplied if you are out in the sun for a while.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is working better for my acne rosacea than other SPF 30 products, possibly because it is so pure. It feels on the heavy side when applying but that sensation disappears almost immediately. A little goes a long way, which is good since it&#x27;s expensive. It has no fragrance but does have a sort of a faint medicinal scent that is not bad at all. If you&#x27;re serious about facial protection, this is a great product. I think it&#x27;s pricey for covering other areas and use different products on my arms and neck, but people with sensitive skin might like it for all over use.</li>
    <li> Here are the EWG&#x27;s (Environmental Working Group) five most effective and safest sunscreens (It&#x27;s been on the news and such lately as well):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keys Soap Solar Rx Therapeutic Sunblock&lt;br /&gt;2. Trukid Sunny Days Facestick Mineral Sunscreen UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum&lt;br /&gt;3. California Baby Sunblock Stick No Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;4. Badger Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;5. Marie Veronique Skin Therapy Sun Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst five:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Coppertone Lotion Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;2. Zia Natural Skincare Daily Moisture Screen&lt;br /&gt;3. Formula 405 Aha Day Face Cream&lt;br /&gt;4. Gillette Complete Skincare Facial Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;5. Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Time Complex Moisture Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why this one is back-ordered a lot this summer.</li>
    <li> After reading an article on how different sunblocks rate on safety and effectiveness, and seeing how highly Keys Soap was rated, I bought it immediately and LOVE it.  It smells fresh and bright, it goes on smoothly and is not at all greasy, and it works really well.  On days when other parts of my body burned (when I used a different brand&#x27;s spray-on sunscreen), this product kept my face protected and never burned, even if I hadn&#x27;t applied it since the morning.  Love it, recommend it, swear by it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to have more experience with the product through both summer and winter to say finally whether or not it works for my skin.  In our hot and humid summer, I find it a little too moist.  But still, it&#x27;s better than other products.  I expect to continue to use it and to recommend it to others.  I like the way this product doesn&#x27;t show on the skin, unlike another excellent product I use.  In using this, I am following the recommendation from cosmeticdatabase.com.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best non-toxic sunscreen ever. Most leave a heavy white residue, this one leaves no trace. I always dampen my face a tad or mist it with water before applying and it goes on very smooth with less waste.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sunscreens, of varying expense, on my fair and sensitive skin. Most have stung, been too creasy, caused mild breakouts, and contained a litany of nasty chemicals. This sunscreen is rich but absorbs rather quickly into my normal to dry skin without irritation. While I prefer natural products, I must admit it comes in a very close second to performance. It is absolutely wonderful to have the best of both worlds. In fact, I am giving Keyes Solar RX as a Christmas present to friends and family who are sensitive to chemicals found in many commercial skin care products. I&#x27;ve been using the product  for 6 months and absolutely love it. Even better, a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this stuff about a week. I was looking for a moisturizer with more than SPF 15 and I&#x27;ve become more concerned about chemical sunscreens lately, so thought I would try this out. This was rated extremely highly on the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website, so, at least based on current scientific evidence, it should be very safe.     It goes on really smoothly, and my skin looks very smooth. My pores have not become any more clogged than with Obagi or Purpose, which I&#x27;ve used in the past. There is a scent, but it&#x27;s quite subtle and pleasant. Smells a little like oranges. I can&#x27;t see a white film or anything, which is nice, but my face does feel a little sticky. I actually have a tendency to rest my face on my hands a lot at work, and I&#x27;m actually thinking this might help me stop touching my face so much and help my pores stay a bit clearer.      I am a little concerned about the nano zinc-- basically, no one yet knows the effects of this. From what I&#x27;ve read, nano particles soak into skin like chemical sunscreens. They absorb the light, I think, and there is some theoretical worry about the damage the heat from the absorbed light might do to your skin.The \\&quot;data gap\\&quot; reported by EWG is 86% (What is a data gap? EWG says \\&quot;... some ingredients may appear to have low hazards, but this may be due to the fact that they have not have been studied or assessed completely.\\&quot;) About the nano zinc (data gap 73%, EWG lists concerns:Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Occupational hazards, Biochemical or cellular level changes\\&quot;) That said, I think every sunscreen has a ton of these concerns listed. The good thing to keep in mind is that all Key products do very well on EWG&#x27;s rating system, and it seems like the company is committed to making safe products.</li>
    <li> I found this sunblock extremely heavy, greasy and pore-clogging.  It goes on very thick and white and takes a long time to work it into the skin.  It feels like having a thick, oily, greasy layer on top of you skin.  My skin broke out very badly using this sunblock.  I don&#x27;t recommend it at all!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best physical sunblocks around.  I have folliculitis on my legs, and apply it after shaving, as it&#x27;s therapeutic properties tend to make my legs feel less itchy than other sunblocks; but to be truthful, not less itchy every time I use it.  I don&#x27;t use this sunblock on the rest of my body because it&#x27;s costly and there&#x27;s not much to a bottle.  If you&#x27;re sun conscious, as I am, this sunblock is worth a try if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> i too have tried everything for my very sensitive, pale skin...this one is my favorite...i also like the pump feature that prevents contamination of the product</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this. It provides great protection, goes on smoothly and without leaving white residue. I find the smell pleasant. It was also rated by EWG.org as 0 meaning low toxicity level which is very important for something that will be absorbed by the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Beat all my expectations. Have been using this for over a year and will continue to do so. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product has only the best ingredients. It&#x27;s also Vegan!! It&#x27;s the best. It smells wonderful, goes on like silk. It&#x27;s mild scented and feels incredible. It&#x27;s good for your skin and is very protective. I am extreamly fair and have tried many products. This one is the best and I will be faithful to it for life. I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it. Perfect for face, neck, arms and hands. Wears well undermake up and alone, blends well and quickly. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I wear sunscreen every day all year, so I&#x27;m always looking for something non-chemical that feels good on my dry skin.  This is my first time purchasing Keys it and I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or so now.  So far I like it - it is winter right now and I am mixing it with a little moisturizer.  It covers nicely once you work it in, and my face feels protected and moisturized (not shiny or greasy) all day long.</li>
    <li> I am now on my second bottle of this sunscreen and I love it. I use it everyday and have never had a problem with it feeling greasy, nor have I noticed a prominent scent with it. Whatever smell it does have fades relatively quickly. I have very very sensitive, break-out prone skin and have never once had a problem with this product causing me to breakout.  My skin is also very dry and will flake if I do not use a moisturizer. This lotion keeps my face hydrated all day long without it ever looking slick. I do wish it was a little cheaper, but at least a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading positive reviews online. After using it for a couple months, the pump failed and I was not able to extract the remaining ~80% of sunscreen. The company never replied to my subsequent emails. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> My skin is brown and I don&#x27;t burn easily BUT I do need sunblock because I can burn.  I  really liked this product, it went on without much rubbing and most of all I felt it did the job it was supposed to do.  I used it in the hot sun in Jamaica.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reviewing the EWG recommendation.  I have to say that I really like how light it is on my skin and the fact that it does a great job as a moisturizer.  This one goes on my face before I go outside everyday, and I consider it to be one of the most essential skincare products I use.  It is a bit pricey, but how can you not like SPF 30 (above which any other rating is only 1-2% more effective) and offers true broad spectrum coverage.  Also I&#x27;ve been using a daily application from the same bottle for about 5 months now, so it really lasts.  Completely non-toxic.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I used this ss religiously for two years, but they changed the formulation in early 2013, and I break out now every time I use it. :-(  It now has a very strong masculine scent, which probably comes from one of the essential oils, but for those considering it who do not have sensitive skin, it goes on much like a moisturizer, is not waterproof, will not act like a MU base, and will be reflective, so it&#x27;s a bit of a job keeping it from looking shiny. I had to blot it before applying powder to somewhat absorb the greasiness. It would probably work fine in very dry climates and for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a little over a month.  It is probably the best all natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.  SPF 30 and goes on clear and relatively easy, couldn&#x27;t ask for better protection. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive and acne prone skin.  I highly recommend at least trying the product.  A little goes a long way too, so do not be fooled by the price. This will last you months!</li>
    <li> it has a nice smell but somehow I just didn&#x27;t like the pump.</li>
    <li> On the very top of EWG&#x27;s list of recommended, safe products. It smells great and goes on well. I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every morning for over 5 months now. The smell is not at all offensive to me.  It&#x27;s a light, almost citrus-y fragrance that is gone very quickly. I love the dispenser because I know I am going to get every drop of the sunblock out of it, and I can tell exactly how much is remaining in the container.  It does leave a white haze when first applied, but it absorbs and the haze fades quickly. It does not feel greasy to me, but I must say that it has an almost tacky sort of feeling.  I wish it was a little easier to blend into the skin.  Overall, it&#x27;s a 5-star and I&#x27;m getting ready to order my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: February 2013.  I am nearly finished with my second bottle.  This bottle was quite different from the first.  For one thing, the first one had a pleasant fragrance, but this bottle is not so pleasant.  It isn&#x27;t offensive, but I do not particularly enjoy it.  Also, the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work as well.  A small amount of the moisturizer leaks out after I have finished, and it smears onto the inside of the clear cap.  And one other disappointment that I discovered when I wore it at the beach...my freckles popped out, even though I applied it a couple of times a day, and I was mostly in the shade.  That makes me wonder how much it is actually protecting my skin.  So now that I am nearing the end of this bottle, I have been doing a little research on some other natural sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  May 2013.  Changed rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.  So sad to have to give this report.  I took a chance and ordered a third bottle.  This time it came from a different Amazon seller than the first two bottles.  The packaging has changed.  You can no longer see how much product is remaining in the bottle.  But that&#x27;s minor.  What wasn&#x27;t minor was the terribly offensive odor.  The first time I applied it, I was almost nauseated by the smell and immediately washed my face.  I waited about a week and tried it again, but I still HATED the smell.  This time I left the product on hoping the smell would dissipate, but after about 30 minutes I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer, so again I washed it off.  Then I contacted the seller, Fresh Bontanica, to return the item.  I was dismayed to discover that it is their \\&quot;policy\\&quot; to charge a 30 percent restocking fee.  In addition, they said they would also take my original shipping fee out of my refund.  However, they actually took double what I had paid for shipping.  I paid $1.00 to have the product shipped to me, and they took $2.00 out of my refund for shipping.  (This had nothing to do with the cost to ship it back to them...I paid that myself.)  So my recommendation is this:  Do not give this product a try, and especially do not purchase through this Amazon seller.  They do not stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months.  My daughter is using it and told me about it.  It is a great moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;as well as a 30 sun block. I also use the Keys Luminos at night.  After I put the Solar Rx on, I just put a light foundation over it.</li>
    <li> the only sunscreen i can find that is free of almost all preservatives, foaming agents, etc.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great sunscreen for faces.  I have rosacea and need to use physical sunblocks.  I also am a contact lens wearer, and some chemicals eventually get into my eyes and sting. I won&#x27;t use products with chemical fragrance or parabens.  That leaves me with few options and I&#x27;ve tried lots.  Most products leave a white haze, not this one.  It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized, but not oily or shiny.  I don&#x27;t like it for all-body, it can be spread too thin.  Very nice product.  (note- this product does have essential oils and a scent)</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin very soft and I like knowing that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> This takes time to get used to. We are so accustomed to the chemical laden stuff on the store shelves that this will be a different experience.  It says it is good as a daily moisturizer, but I am using it as a sunscreen.  It is way too heavy for me as a daily moisturizer.  Not too sticky, but you do notice it at first. Maybe I am just used to it now.  Also has a distinct sage scent which does go away.  Best reason to use this is the lack of chemicals AND it does its job very well.  Have been using it on my face, neck and arms and no burns.  Worth giving it a try, I know I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I have gone thru a lot of the EWG rated sunblocks.  This particular brand, as others have noted, does not leave a whitish cast on your skin.  Part of this must due to the fact that it is not waterproof in any way.  If you plan on getting sweaty or getting in the water, chances are you&#x27;d end up like a lobster after this product is washed off.  However, if you are just going to the office and you don&#x27;t want to look like a lifeguard, then something like this product is probably a good choice.      Solar RX is on the thinner side and it doesn&#x27;t have the olive oil, beeswax-ish smell of other products.  Instead you have a nice, citrus smell, but it is not overbearing.  However, if you are extremely scent-intolerant, see if you can test this product before you buy.  Solar RX does have a bit of a \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; feeling on the skin for awhile, you will get used to it.  My skin is pretty sensitive and I have not had any breakouts after using Solar RX.      I&#x27;d stick to using this product on the face only and lower cost products that due leave a whitish cast where they are less likely to be noticed.  I also wouldn&#x27;t use Solar RX for any activities where I am out in the sun for hours at a time because it just doesn&#x27;t feel like a \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; sunblock to me.  However, for most days this product does exactly what I want and I am happy that I am not applying a bunch of nasty chemicals on my skin.</li>
    <li> Eureka!! I&#x27;ve tried so many different physical sunscreens with zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide that left my face greasey or with a slight white haze.  This does not do either of the two.  It is perfect!!! You can wear this under make-up.  It has 18.5% zinc oxide.  I don&#x27;t know of another sunblock higher than that. This is also my first time reviewing a product even though I&#x27;ve purchased a ton of things on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients. I use it on my dogs&#x27; noses. Two of my dogs have pink spots. It works great and is very safe for them.</li>
    <li> Loved the old formulation -- light rosemary scent, very faint and pleasant. Then in 2013 they changed the formulation. The smell is now strong and quite unpleasant. I thought it was just the batch my purchase came from (I bought direct from Keys, not via Amazon). However, the replacement bottles had the same problem. Then I hoped that I&#x27;d get used to it after a few days, but nope, it was still yukky a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed but I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Haven&#x27;t found anything else I like as well as the old version, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed the comments from other reviewers about mold.  That is a TRULY nasty thought. I still have a bottle and I&#x27;m going to open it and look.</li>
    <li> This product goes on well. Works, as in protects against uva and uvb. And used zinc oxide exclusively, the safest all around protection.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time; product as described; I&#x27;ve been using this on a daily basis for years, and I think it is a very effective product.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my face and neck. It goes on great under makeup and is not greasy at all. It was rated best sunsreen on many websites. I highly recommend this for EVERYDAY use. You should always have at least 30spf on.</li>
    <li> A dark green/black spot is growing inside the bottle and the bottle has never been opened!!! The expiration date is September 2014! Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I have a cat who barely has any hair on her ears. She gets a sunburn on her ears after being in the sun for even a minimum amount of time. After a lengthy online research, I finally purchased this sunblock for my cat. It is chemical free, which is a very important feature, since the cats like to lick anything and everything. It is easy to apply to the cat&#x27;s ears. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works pretty well. It&#x27;s broad spectrum zinc and doesn&#x27;t make me look white. However, I lost about half of the product because after I pump out some of it, it continues to pump out slowly over the next minute. So, there&#x27;s always a long strand of it hanging out of the top of the bottle, which dries out and becomes useless. What a waste! I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> The product works fine but the bottle itself is just horrendous and renders the product useless and harmful. For some reason,  there is condensation that occurs inside of the top part of the dispenser that eventually causes mold. I have noticed this condensation happening with every bottle that I have purchased,  but never thought anything of it until my husband noticed a slight discoloration at the top around the dispensing spout. I cracked open the top and saw that mold had developed inside all around the top. I WAS HORRIFIED that I have been using a moldy product. I wrote to Keyes about this but never heard back. Apparently they do not care.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness of this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve never gotten burned wearing this, but I don&#x27;t exactly spend very much time in the sun in general. My insistence on always wearing sunscreen stems from a fear of premature wrinkles more than the risk of skin cancer. That said, I am fanatical about mineral sunscreen, and have tried quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keys Solar isn&#x27;t the worst smelling mineral sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, but I also do not come across many that have a discernible smell. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell of Keys Solar, beyond that it is slightly metallic. I don&#x27;t actually mind it that much, except if it is on my hands or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is also really thick. A little bit goes a LONG way, and I&#x27;ve never gotten it to completely sink into my skin, even if I apply it really thinly. The sunscreen does not leave a white cast, but it does leave an oily sheen, like I&#x27;ve just been working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the great reviews, I trust this suncreen enough to finish the bottle, but I only plan on using it for hikes or outdoor sporting activities, where the heaviness of the sunscreen is less unpleasant, but I do not plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Well, I guess &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; is a relative term, but compared to the other highly-rated one by EWG that is not supposed to be greasy, this is much cheaper.  I&#x27;ve used it for a year or two.  Cheap sunscreens uniformly make my face sting, or break out, or both - I&#x27;m not sure what the problem ingredient is (are).  I tolerate this one well.  This sunscreen does take a while to completely disappear after applying it, and for that reason I get it on my collars a lot.  I&#x27;m not clear-thinking enough in the morning to put it on first thing, then put the clothes on after it&#x27;s settled in.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen meets all health requirements. It does not contain any of the detrimental ingredients that will affect your health in the long term. 99% per cent of the sunscreens on the market are cheaply made. They contain ingredients proven to cause cancer and do not block out the rays that cause premature aging. The best for both UVA and UVB is Zinc Oxide with a whopping 20.55%. Look at most sunscreens and they DO NOT contain Zinc Oxide. If they do it will still contain UREA and other health hazards that break down. This is the best . There is also NO white film left after applying. It is perfect for the face!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a long time for a sunblock that did not leave a white film on my face, did not irritate my eyes, did not contain bad chemicals , moisturizing and effective... Keys Solar RX is the only sunblock that satisfied all of these really basic demands.&lt;br /&gt;and on top of all of that, the dispenser is really a great idea, because it helps u avoid waste and measure your daily dose that is sufficient to cover my face and the back of my hands, one squeeze is all I need. Really an al around great product... Thank you Keys</li>
    <li> This is too greasy for me. It is like a thick white mask. The ingredients looked very safe, but it caused breakouts!</li>
    <li> I purchased Keys Solar RX Therapeutic Sunblock SPF 30 after ready reviews on the Skincare Database. Overall, I am happy with it. My one issue is that is is a little tackier and sticky on the skin than I like. One way I have found to work with that is to make sure that my skin is slightly damp when I apply it, and slowly work it into my skin. Otherwise, it is very good.</li>
    <li> I have worked with dermatologists and written skin care iPad Apps, as well as written for melanoma cancer pharma drugs. So I know a bit about sunscreen. So I ordered all 5 of the top EWG-rated sunscreens.The Badger brand lavender smelled great. But ALL were greasy EXCEPT Keys and Marie Veronique. Unfortunately, the Keyes left me with a burn on the first use. If you&#x27;re in day-to-day sun versus on the water or in a state closer to the equator or for instance, Australia where there&#x27;s little ozone, perhaps not a concern. It may work for you. However, if you want safe/proper sun protection, you&#x27;re going to need zinc AND titanium non-nano particles. Non-nano particles mean the particles aren&#x27;t so small that your skin (the largest organ of your body), can&#x27;t &amp;#34;drink&amp;#34; them in and absorb them from your pours (like all of the other carcinogenic chemicals you put on your face from your makeup). But that&#x27;s not the reason you need it for sun protection. The size of the particles actually creates a barrier to the sun. It&#x27;s what gives you a white tint. If you don&#x27;t have that, you&#x27;re not fully or properly protected. (Sorry to say). But I have tips for avoiding this if you&#x27;re using it daily below makeup.  I actually preferred the texture of the Keys, and the moisture, but it&#x27;s not waterproof and it&#x27;s not worth a dime if it lets ANY sun through. And sadly, the Keyes failed me miserably.  I recently had laser to remove sun damage, and the Marie Veronique has done an impressive job of keeping me the exact same color winter and summer. Even better, the tiny $30 bottle has lasted over a year and is WATERPROOF and I have never once had to reapply. Pretty impressive considering I&#x27;m on a competitive rowing team and in the water at least four days a week for a minimum of 2 hours/day. The Marie Veronique can be layered on for long term protection - or apply moisturizer first, then use it under makeup for a thinner application that has the exact same effect as a Brightener. Without moisturizer the Marie Veronique is dry (almost powdery), and will go on with a white cast. It is NOT greasy and will not leave your hands greasy).  My friend died at 34 of skin cancer from a single freckle because she went to a dermatologist that used the naked eye to detect melanoma (instead of seeing a doctor with a Digital Dermoscopy machine for early Melanoma detection).  EWG&#x27;s top-rated sunscreens can be found on their website annually.  Marie Veronique now carries a tinted sunscreen that has rave reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the chemical free claim, but the smell is so bad, I dread putting it on.  It feels heavy when I put it on and it does leave a residue but it does not seem to increase or decrease my tendency to have mild breakouts.After 3 weeks it does not seem to have improved my skin in any way.  I will probably finish this bottle if I can force myself despite the smell, but not likely to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have olive skin and have been trying to find a natural sunscreen that works for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is better than other natural sunscreens I have tried.... but I no longer use it on my face because of how oily it made me.&lt;br /&gt;I have both oily and normal/dry skin on my face, and after a couple hours of wearing this sunscreen, I had to use oil blotting sheets on my face!&lt;br /&gt;It also made my skin a slightly lighter color than what it normally was. The sunscreen feels a little heavy when you put it on, but all natural sunscreens pretty much feel like that.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry skin, this will probably work for you. If you have any type of oily skin or have bangs, this product will probably not work for you.</li>
    <li> This formula feels nice on the skin. It is moisturizing and somewhat thick, and doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a white cast. There is some question about the safety of nano size particles though. I am liking the MyChelle brand facial moisturizer with spf better.</li>
    <li> The best sunblock I have ever used in my life!</li>
    <li> Very good product; my husband who&#x27;s really white doesn&#x27;t burn when it is applied on and doesn&#x27;t make him ghost white ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years. A good sun block product that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals. Doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. Good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen as it was rated highly,primarily based on what is in it and safety of ingredients.  I tried it twice and got really burned.  I play golf in the sun once a week and it is the only sunscreen I have ever used that caused me to burn.  I had to throw it away.  Tried the Kiss My Face, that was also highly rated, this week and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> Spreads easily, blends in well, doesn&#x27;t leave a white film, protects skin, expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much. Love the small pocket size too.</li>
    <li> Smell is not the best, but it goes away quickly.  Feels nice after going on AKA not greasy, which is so nice.  Dispenser is really nice for small amounts and lid snaps tightly on for travel.</li>
    <li> PROS: Moisturizing, great for people with dry skin. White residue at first, but will absorb into the skin eventually. When the product gets older, you will see more white cakiness, although I still use some product from 5 years ago and it still seems to work! Top quality ingredients, I know these and they did not spare any expense to put nutrition into the skin (do research on black cumin seed oil). Smell is good, I don&#x27;t know what those other reviewers are complaining about. Does not sting eyes like a lot of other sunscreens. I use this around my eyes, then Devita sunscreen everywhere else on my face. (See my review for Devita Professional Skin Care Ultra Solar 50 SPF sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Can be greasy so it may be hard to keep reapplying it throughout the day because of the buildup of oils. Not good for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The new and improved formula does not leave a white streak. I changed my review from 5 stars to 4 because I started using it on my whole face and my freckles came back! It may not work as well as I thought. I may continue to use it around my eyes because it does not sting. The only product that prevents my freckles is a chemical one: La Roche Posay Anthelios 60 SPF, and it has way too many chemicals. I will see what Devita does for me. (See my review for Devita Professional Skin Care Ultra Solar 50 SPF sunscreen).</li>
