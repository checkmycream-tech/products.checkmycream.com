      <li>what a pleasant fragrance, I sprayed it this morning with my Bodylotion</li>
      <li>And surprisingly it stays on too</li>
      <li>it smell good</li>
      <li>Very refreshing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sooo happy to still be able to get them from amazon.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, if you plan on buying this product and want to maintain the smell, then plan on spraying it more than once a day!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still nice and stays on for hours.</li>
      <li>I really liked Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;Go</li>

      <li>I love this smell, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy</li>
      <li>Love it, amazing as always</li>
      <li>I am glad that I found a place to order this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell; this smell isn&#x27;t refreshing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so glad I chose this, because I was hoping not to be allergic to it, and I am not, I hope this review will be posted, I did one yesterday, but it did not post.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s refreshing</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and the ease of using.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume</li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>and I just love it...</li>
      <li>I still had a phenomenal experience.</li>
      <li>P.S. Men love the smell ladies : )</li>
      <li>I just love the dove body mist</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scent a couple years ago and was saddened to learn they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>Very happy with product, cant find here locally anymore</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>not too strong just enough to make you smell awesome after your shower</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and light and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>It nice to spray on you right after you get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>They refunded my money in full and I repurchased and everything was as it should be!</li>
      <li>why pay $15 for a body spray when you can get the best body mist for less than $5.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a light, somewhat flowery mist,</li>
      <li>Thanks Dove, and Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>The smell is so fresh!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, great to have around when you dont want that heavy perfume smell!</li>
      <li>This product smells good for the after-shower effect but do not use too much as it tends to be a tad bit overwhelming for people whose senses are fragile.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and same great look..</li>
      <li>, scent does not fade away quickly.</li>
      <li>I alway loved the smell, but I cannot tell if it lasts long throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I’m feeling pretty awesome lately.</li>
      <li>Great little after shower mist for summer.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance, since I can&#x27;t buy it locally</li>
      <li>I ordered this after I wasn&#x27;t able to find it at my local store!!</li>
      <li>&amp; I get fast delivery</li>
      <li>, it is mixing very well with my chemistry, but I would like to know if there is a Bodywash with this fragrance?&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks..</li>
      <li>This is a real deal at 2 bottles in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can’t really think of anything else it could be.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and reliable.</li>
      <li>It fresh and not overwhelming, more people should wear it.</li>
      <li>Fresh\\&quot; Re-balancing Body Spray, because it has a nice but not overwhelming fragrance.</li>
      <li>Speaking for my personal use only, i would definitely buy again and recommend for sure.</li>
      <li>It smells very diluted compared to what I purchased from an actual store.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that the Pomegranate Dove spray smelled almost the same as this bottle, so if you want to try something new for more of a variety than Pomegranate is not a good choice if you already have plum/sakura Rebalance or visa versa.</li>
      <li>but it dissipates fairly quickly and leaves behind a more subtle scent.  </li>

<li> Its always hard to tell.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so so so disappointed in this...</li>

    <li> Best smelling stuff ever! Cant find it in stores any more :(</li>
    <li> I like it. I’m feeling pretty awesome lately. It’s got to be because of this, right? I can’t really think of anything else it could be.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same scent but it&#x27;s still nice and stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> I love this smell, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy</li>
    <li> I found the body wash here, at Amazon, the deodorant at Walgreens, but I couldn&#x27;t find the Body Mist---back I came.  This is a real deal at 2 bottles in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light, somewhat flowery mist, but it dissipates fairly quickly and leaves behind a more subtle scent.  Great little after shower mist for summer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, cant find here locally anymore</li>
    <li> Wonderful sent and it lasts through the day!  not too strong just enough to make you smell awesome after your shower</li>

    <li> The smell is so fresh!  This is my second purchase and will buy it again and again. It&#x27;s like taking a shower lol! Just love it.</li>
    <li> This body mist is not mild but neither is it overpowering. It smells like a wonderful bunch of flowers on a spring day. And surprisingly it stays on too, scent does not fade away quickly. For the price this is a great buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so so so disappointed in this...I receive 6 or 5 I think 1once bottle that&#x27;s not what I bought...it was 2 pack 4oz bottle I ordered...</li>
    <li> This product smells good for the after-shower effect but do not use too much as it tends to be a tad bit overwhelming for people whose senses are fragile. Speaking for my personal use only, i would definitely buy again and recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Still smells delish and is still an awesome product too! Fast delivery and same great look.. Thanks.. P.S. Men love the smell ladies : )</li>
    <li> It fresh and not overwhelming, more people should wear it.Especially during the summer</li>
    <li> why pay $15 for a body spray when you can get the best body mist for less than $5. I won&#x27;t wear anything else .Dove is great.</li>
    <li> The product was supposed to be two 3 oz bottles of the body mist as the packing envelope stated, however I received six 1 oz bottles instead. I like the Dove body mist which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, since I can&#x27;t buy it locally I am glad that I found a place to order this product.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent a couple years ago and was saddened to learn they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore. I&#x27;m sooo happy to still be able to get them from amazon.  It&#x27;s refreshing and light and lasts all day. Shipping was fast and reliable.</li>

    <li> Purchased this item for my daughter. She loves the Dove Body Mist sprays.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the ease of using.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, great to have around when you dont want that heavy perfume smell! Spray this stuff on after a shower, and you will get compliments on your great smelling fragrance! It&#x27;s inexpensive, and smells great!</li>

    <li> Wonderful refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> I really liked Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;Go Fresh\\&quot; Re-balancing Body Spray, because it has a nice but not overwhelming fragrance. It adds a subtle touch and is not overwhelming. But, I did notice that it tends to wear off much faster than regular perfume which is to be expected since it is much less concentrated. Therefore, if you plan on buying this product and want to maintain the smell, then plan on spraying it more than once a day!

    <li> I wrote my review yesterday, I just so like the Rebalance Plum &amp;sakura blossom Body Mist, what a pleasant fragrance, I sprayed it this morning with my Bodylotion and I can still smell it this afternoon, it is mixing very well with my chemistry, but I would like to know if there is a Bodywash with this fragrance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I chose this, because I was hoping not to be allergic to it, and I am not, I hope this review will be posted, I did one yesterday, but it did not post.</li>
    <li> It smells very diluted compared to what I purchased from an actual store. I am definitely returning. This experience has made me nervous about purchasing fragrances online.</li>
