      <li>Great sponge brush.</li>
      <li>This is a great sponge.</li>
      <li>I honestly brought the brush just to have it and found this to be a great use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/17/14&lt;br</li>
      <li>i loved my foam applicator</li>
      <li>Good sturdy quality</li>

      <li>Wonderful for soft coverage.</li>
      <li>I usually love ecoTools brushes.</li>
      <li>Interesting type of brush.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite makeup tools.</li>
      <li>A must have for all the glam gals :-)</li>
      <li>If you wet it before use, the makeup spreads wonderfully and is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This brush works great for under eye concealer and overall foundation blending.</li>
      <li>Im pretty sure mine is going in the garbage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a very cheaply made item, Not that soft to the touch</li>
      <li>It is very large, I had to laugh everytime</li>
      <li>but you may not be completely satisfied if you are attached to different styles of sponges.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done and brush seams pretty durable.</li>
      <li>I expected more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying out Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Matte Mouse, and couldn&#x27;t find a brush or sponge that fit in the tiny jar.</li>
      <li>I mainly use this to blend my under-eye concealer.</li>
      <li>The sponge/applicator came off the wooden stick in the middle of my first use!!</li>
      <li>It is not at all large.the handle is a bit tall considering how small the sponge is.it has a side that is flat on the sponge so its actually easier to apply( very useful) and doesnt suck up any of the foundation :)its a must have.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Agreed with the other review its kind of laughable, Im glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this product.</li>
      <li>The sponge is very soft feeling but somewhat stiff in that is doesn&#x27;t move and bend easily.</li>
      <li>The first one worked out very well for me lasting me over a year with proper care.</li>
      <li>This works well, but doesn&#x27;t absorb much product, so it can take several applications.</li>
      <li>Foam is very soft and has two sides to help apply better, one side is flat while the other is round.</li>
      <li>If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it, and it would not have been worth the trouble to return.</li>
      <li>I kind of want to re-purchase since it&#x27;s not that expensive</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it because I will inevitably have to wash it and</li>

    <li> These sponges are terrible. Just moves the makeup around and the shape doesn&#x27;t allow for even coverage.dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Great sponge brush. Will buy again. Good sturdy quality</li>
    <li> Would NOT ever advise anyone to purchase this item.  The wood handle came unglued before I even had a chance to use this brush. STILL have not used the brush. The sponge end is not what I was expecting. It&#x27;s definitely a very cheaply made item, Not that soft to the touch so I am not sure how well it would do applying foundation.There is some type of hard item in the middle of the sponge that makes the sponge hard, not spongy like I thought it would feel,</li>
    <li> Wonderful for soft coverage.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for concealing under my eyes. I pat instead of rub and it gives me great and even coverage. I like the size and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> So, so great! If you wet it before use, the makeup spreads wonderfully and is super easy to apply. c:</li>
    <li> This is a great sponge. I like that it has the handle as it makes it seem easier to apply makeup. However, I did find it a little cumbersome when trying to apply concealer around my eye area. The handle and shape of the sponge made it difficult to get in to the tight corners by my eyes and nose but it wasn&#x27;t impossible. The sponge is very soft feeling but somewhat stiff in that is doesn&#x27;t move and bend easily. Either way, it still applied my makeup evenly without streaking. This was a good purchase and I intend to keep using it but you may not be completely satisfied if you are attached to different styles of sponges.</li>
    <li> i loved my foam applicator its a little small&lt;br /&gt;but its very good quality of brush i feel that it does a great job&lt;br /&gt;when i use it</li>
    <li> The applicator is way too big and DOES suck up all the foundation that is put on it. I bought it for applying and blending under eye concealer and its just…. No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreed with the other review its kind of laughable, Im glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this product. Because of how little I spent it means theres just no point in even trying to return and dealing with the hassle and shipping costs.  Never mind.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite makeup tools.</li>
    <li> The sponge/applicator came off the wooden stick in the middle of my first use!! I expected more. Very disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Ecotools Foam Applicator. The first one worked out very well for me lasting me over a year with proper care. Foam is very soft and has two sides to help apply better, one side is flat while the other is round. The foam does not soak up too much foundation nor waste any foundation. This brush works great for under eye concealer and overall foundation blending. Its easy to use and a good size as well. I recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not the sponge type feel I was expecting.  It is very firm.  I was hoping for something softer like a beauty blender type feel.</li>
    <li> Interesting type of brush. I&#x27;m trying out Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Matte Mouse, and couldn&#x27;t find a brush or sponge that fit in the tiny jar. This works well, but doesn&#x27;t absorb much product, so it can take several applications. Otherwise, great quality.</li>
    <li> Came three for the price of 4.79$!!!</li>
    <li> It is very large, I had to laugh everytime I tried to use it.  Tried it twice then tossed it.  If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it, and it would not have been worth the trouble to return.</li>
    <li> I usually love ecoTools brushes. But this one is not what I expected. Its supper hard and not even the least bit flexible. I literally TRIED to use it once and put it down not even 5 secs later. Im pretty sure mine is going in the garbage.</li>

    <li> I mainly use this to blend my under-eye concealer. Gets the job done and brush seams pretty durable. I honestly brought the brush just to have it and found this to be a great use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/17/14&lt;br /&gt; I changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars. After regular cleaning of the brush it starts to deteriorate. Yes, brushes can shed and ect, after washing, but the foam started to break into pieces to the point that I didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with it anymore and discarded it. I kind of want to re-purchase since it&#x27;s not that expensive but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it because I will inevitably have to wash it and process might start again.  At this point I think just using a beauty blender or similar product would suffice although I prefer the way this foam applicator blends.</li>
