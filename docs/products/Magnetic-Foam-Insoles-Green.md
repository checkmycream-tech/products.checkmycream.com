### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great insoles.</li>
      <li>Glad I did!!</li>
      <li>, I have never felt so good as since I have the magnetic insoles.</li>
      <li>I have lost count of how many of these I&#x27;ve bought!  </li>
      <li>I just bought some of these as an experiment &amp; noticed within minutes that I had more energy with these in my shoes!  </li>
      <li>I can now save money I do not have to keep buying shoes after shoes any more because my pain is gone for good.</li>
      <li>but that is actually a good thing because advanced cases like hers, a lack of sweat is problematic.</li>
      <li>I work in the food and beverage industry, and always on my feet walking many miles/day</li>
      <li>I wear them most of the day and have found that the ache in the injured foot is gone.  </li>
      <li>so no doubt it would be most of what you paid for them.</li>
      <li>my feet have never felt better</li>
      <li>I love my insoles</li>
      <li>The insoles with their energy moving power better perfuse the nerves that are irritated and decrease pain.  </li>
      <li>I searched the internet for more healthy alternative treatments and found a suggestion of using magnetic insoles.  </li>
      <li>North pole magnetic therapy can help you with many aches &amp; pains &amp; injuries.</li>
      <li>Want more energy?  </li>
      <li>They feel very comfortable and easy to trim to desired size.</li>
      <li>They were on the flimsy side and became frayed easily.  </li>
      <li>and they made a huge diffrence-</li>
      <li>I am keep these, I have cut it to fit shoe</li>
      <li>If nothing else they are comfortable insole pads</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge believer of magnetic therapy AND acupressure, so these provide both plus a little bouncy softness!  :D</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small investment to make and the payoff is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>These soft insoles with magnets imbedded in them are amazing.  </li>
      <li>It was so surprising I rushed to the internet to see if others had had that same experience &amp; saw some had.    </li>
      <li>I would of appreciated them giving  you more info on what you were purchasing.</li>
      <li>With my second purchase on order, I will be able to have insoles in all of my sneakers--for work and play!</li>
      <li>We cut them to size and they are pretty true to the lines.  </li>
      <li>Who can argue with success?  </li>
      <li>The other good thing about these is that the magnets are all North pole facing your foot.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
      <li>When I cut it to my size, the edges frayed and came undone after the first day.  </li>
      <li>When I first ordered these insoles it stated they were for women, when I received them the size said size 10 to 11 which I concern that as a men size.</li>
      <li>I am starting to believe in the magic of magnets.  </li>
      <li>Try them first before meds &amp; surgery.  </li>
      <li>We both wore them and felt no uncomfortable pressure points from the magnets</li>
      <li>Not a real problem as I wear socks, but it could have been secured better.  </li>
      <li>but I expected a bit more from them.</li>
      <li>When I emailed to return they would deduct the shipping price which they don&#x27;t tell you ahead of time how much it would be</li>
      <li>They really really really worked ...........</li>
      <li>I realize they were not very expensive</li>
      <li>The magnets aren&#x27;t even strong when applied to another magnetic, there was minimal tension.  </li>
      <li>I had read a lot about magnetic therapy and spoke with a person who knows a doctor that highly advocates them</li>
      <li>He was on large doses of opiate pain control with still only hit and miss relief.  </li>
      <li>You might be really surprised.</li>
      <li>So far she has noticed when she uses these</li>
      <li>and so far I dont feel any difference.</li>
      <li>The premise is that they move natural energy in the body which increases the capillary flow of blood to the furthest vessels (feet and hands) allowing increased blood supply which then increases oxygenation to the capillaries.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps is too early to give my opinion, I will wait and update.</li>
      <li>My feet burn a lot, hurt a lot, and I have a broken bone that 5 years later will still give me pain if I walk on it funny or wear non supportive shoes.  </li>
      <li>My feet feel less fatigue and the sharp pain I get from that bone has not happened more than 2 times in the last 2 weeks, so I am really hoping it will help it heal.  </li>
      <li>My next pair, I will glue them with some sort of a soft fabric glue to see if the liner will stay on longer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had insoles like this about 5 yrs ago and they made a huge diffrence- these unfortunitly have not.  Not to mention they are small if you wear anything above a womens 10 or a mens 8 they will not fit properly.</li>
    <li> I tried wearing these for 2 days already. They make my feet hurt. I will not order these again. The magnets hurt.</li>
    <li> I am keep these, I have cut it to fit shoe</li>
    <li> Cannot tell that they helped any</li>
    <li> not enough magnets or gauge to make a diffeence</li>
    <li> I got a pair for myself and for my husband.  We cut them to size and they are pretty true to the lines.  We both wore them and felt no uncomfortable pressure points from the magnets and he is on his feet all day, felt energetic and less tired wearing them.  My feet burn a lot, hurt a lot, and I have a broken bone that 5 years later will still give me pain if I walk on it funny or wear non supportive shoes.  My feet feel less fatigue and the sharp pain I get from that bone has not happened more than 2 times in the last 2 weeks, so I am really hoping it will help it heal.  I like these.  The only complaint I have is that they have a layer of fabric over the rubber, that is not fully glued down over the whole insert.  When I cut it to my size, the edges frayed and came undone after the first day.  My next pair, I will glue them with some sort of a soft fabric glue to see if the liner will stay on longer.  Not a real problem as I wear socks, but it could have been secured better.  I am starting to believe in the magic of magnets.  At this price, you can afford to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was excepting the whole insole to be magnetic but it is only the few visible parts.  The magnets aren&#x27;t even strong when applied to another magnetic, there was minimal tension.  I think I just bought insole padding.</li>
    <li> Will not stay in place</li>
    <li> The fabric is like terry cloth, so everytime I take my shoes off, I have to reinsert, and often struggle with getting them to stay flat/would-be glide back in....</li>
    <li> I do not believe in voodoo science; but these suckers seem to work.  Who can argue with success?  The pain went away in two days.  Who knew?</li>
    <li> Three words; they don&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the magnets have no polarity to them. Not sure if it&#x27;s because they are old and need to be re-magnetized or just what. I requested to send to back for a return and never heard back from the seller. Poor communications! The insole itself is very thin and very cheaply mad. LOOK ELSEWHERE MY FRIENDS!</li>
    <li> Want more energy?  I just bought some of these as an experiment &amp; noticed within minutes that I had more energy with these in my shoes!  It was so surprising I rushed to the internet to see if others had had that same experience &amp; saw some had.    Get extras, even for your slippers.  The other good thing about these is that the magnets are all North pole facing your foot.  South pole - or bipolar which combines N &amp; S - can actually do you some harm.      North pole magnetic therapy can help you with many aches &amp; pains &amp; injuries. Try them first before meds &amp; surgery.  You might be really surprised.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t do what they said they would and the magnets actually hurt your feet.</li>
    <li> They nseemed to help me in relief</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this soles for two weeks and so far I dont feel any difference. Perhaps is too early to give my opinion, I will wait and update. They feel very comfortable and easy to trim to desired size. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> I was having circulation problems in my feet.  I had read a lot about magnetic therapy and spoke with a person who knows a doctor that highly advocates them so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I was amazed at the results.  I wore them all day long next to my feet, under my socks.  They really really really worked ........... I was amazed.  I&#x27;m a believer now and am passing the word.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered these insoles it stated they were for women, when I received them the size said size 10 to 11 which I concern that as a men size. I considered trim them but then you would cut into the magnetics which would defeat the purpose of getting them. When I emailed to return they would deduct the shipping price which they don&#x27;t tell you ahead of time how much it would be so no doubt it would be most of what you paid for them. I dediced to keep them and maybe someone in my family can use them. I would of appreciated them giving  you more info on what you were purchasing.</li>
    <li> These soft insoles with magnets imbedded in them are amazing.  My dad has suffered from Diabetic Neuropathy for over a year.  He was on large doses of opiate pain control with still only hit and miss relief.  I searched the internet for more healthy alternative treatments and found a suggestion of using magnetic insoles.  The premise is that they move natural energy in the body which increases the capillary flow of blood to the furthest vessels (feet and hands) allowing increased blood supply which then increases oxygenation to the capillaries.  About 64% of users find some relief.  The insoles with their energy moving power better perfuse the nerves that are irritated and decrease pain.  My dad went from morphine twice a day + hydrocodone every 4-6 hours in betweeen, to being off all pain medication (including extra strength acetaminophen) for 12 days.  He is now walking 3 blocks twice a day and building some muscle mass back in his legs.  I can recommend these insoles.  It&#x27;s a small investment to make and the payoff is wonderful.  I do not recommend the acupressure magnetic insoles as the \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;  are hard to walk on.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000K5TMAO Magnetic Foam Insoles - Green]]</li>
    <li> I love my insoles my feet have never felt better I can now save money I do not have to keep buying shoes after shoes any more because my pain is gone for good.</li>
    <li> If nothing else they are comfortable insole pads</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try these insoles for a long time, but retail prices had kept me away. When I saw them on Amazon, I figured I&#x27;d give them a try for the price. Glad I did!! I work in the food and beverage industry, and always on my feet walking many miles/day, I have never felt so good as since I have the magnetic insoles. With my second purchase on order, I will be able to have insoles in all of my sneakers--for work and play!</li>
    <li> Great insoles. They give me relief from leg spasms.</li>
    <li> I have lost count of how many of these I&#x27;ve bought!  My feet hurt all the time, so these are cut to fit my Winter house slippers, my Summer house flip-flops, my boots, clogs, &amp; any shoes that are a little too hard or a little too big.  I&#x27;m a huge believer of magnetic therapy AND acupressure, so these provide both plus a little bouncy softness!  :D</li>
    <li> I have not tried them yet.  I am concerned because I have very small feet and hope I don&#x27;t have to trim away any magnets.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother who has neuropathy, congestive heart failure, poor circulation and cold feeling all the time.  So far she has noticed when she uses these, she feels warmer which seems to indicate an improvement in circulation.  I am hopeful that there will be improvement in other areas with continued use. I also bought a pair for myself to help a foot injury I&#x27;ve had for some time in one foot. I wear them in my house slippers because they are too thick for my shoes.  I wear them most of the day and have found that the ache in the injured foot is gone.  I also noticed that the ache seemed to return when I went all day without wearing my insoles. I am hopeful with continued use, the ache will be gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2013 My Mom&#x27;s legs were beginning to turn black from the CHF.  The insoles seem to have helped reverse the black coloring in her legs from the heart condition.  She wears the insoles when she walks in the house and not regularly.  She complains that her feet sweat but that is actually a good thing because advanced cases like hers, a lack of sweat is problematic.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in these insoles.  They were on the flimsy side and became frayed easily.  The magnets on the instep wore through the cloth and worked their way out the ventilation holes.  This made for uncomfortable feet and poor fit.  I am already replacing them with another brand.  I realize they were not very expensive but I expected a bit more from them.</li>
