      <li>amazing stuff</li>
      <li>but it did have a nice conditioning effect.  </li>
      <li>So THAT&#x27;S what those people do to get that kind of look.</li>
      <li>great to bring out the blonde, need to use a really good conditioner because it strips the oils from your her</li>
      <li>The Weekly Brightener, however, is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I alternate using this along with the demineralizer and my hair color looks great!</li>
      <li>It does remove most of the rust staining from my hair.  </li>

      <li>I love this, takes some getting used to the smell, but overall amazing results on my hair!</li>
      <li>The Malibu Blondes will brighten you hair, but it will also leave it very dry and in need of a very good conditioning after the treatment.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product as part of the shampoo, conditioner, weekly brightener combo pack.  </li>
      <li>A good buy overall.</li>
      <li>I am amazed at how this product transformed my hair from the very first use.</li>
      <li>After using them the first time I was hooked!  </li>
      <li>Works amazing on blonde hair and keeps shine.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week to keep my blonde highlights looking nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>I use Malibu hard water wellness shampoo, followed by these packets, and a purple conditioner that probably all helps to work like a beautiful system.</li>
      <li>I used this yesterday for the first time along with the Malibu Wellness Shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I purchased this after it was recommended by my stylist as a way to keep my highlights fresh and vibrant in between colorings.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and this is the only one that really works.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and the packets are measured more for shorter styles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s going to extend the life of my highlights and save a little cash without having to get highlights done so often.</li>
      <li>My hair has really responded.  </li>
      <li>That really helps raise the gunk and discoloration out.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying purple shampoo and after one wash I was able to see less brassiness.</li>
      <li>and I swear my hair is getting more golden not very happy with this purchase</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see big results right away .</li>
      <li>This weekly brightener brings my highlights right back to the color</li>
      <li>my blonde all that much</li>
      <li>that leave my hair not as soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>Soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see it was a powder when I opened it.</li>
      <li>They help me lighten my hair after a few weeks of dying it and it makes it feel fresh all over again!</li>
      <li>This actually does a fabulous job of toning down my reds and enhancing my blond.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone blonde a few times and usually wind up darkening after the color starts to look more caramel than cool blonde</li>
      <li>It made my hair soft and eliminated the dry, frizzy ends.</li>

<li> It seems a little dry after use though</li>

<li> but they dried my hair out.</li>
<li> Swim team means at least twice a week in the harsh chlorine.  </li>
<li> seems to dull my highlights after a couple of washings.  </li>
<li> I came out of the shower and was shocked.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these work great to freshen up your natural or by choice blond hair.  their price is the same that they charge at the beauty supply store</li>
    <li> The Malibu Blondes will brighten you hair, but it will also leave it very dry and in need of a very good conditioning after the treatment.</li>
    <li> These are great. They help me lighten my hair after a few weeks of dying it and it makes it feel fresh all over again!</li>
    <li> I got this product in conjunction with malibu well water shampoo because the water at my house was leaving deposits in my hair, turning it orange. You use this product once a week, and I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my hair is noticably blonder. It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s going to extend the life of my highlights and save a little cash without having to get highlights done so often.</li>
    <li> I alternate using this along with the demineralizer and my hair color looks great! If you have a lot of hair like me, I recommend using 2pks for optimum results.</li>
    <li> strips blonde color from hair</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how this product transformed my hair from the very first use. I have blonde hair that was very dark and discolored by the iron in my well water. When I used this, I could actually smell the iron coming out of my hair. It made my hair soft and eliminated the dry, frizzy ends. Plus, it took the brassiness out of my blonde, highlighted hair. My hair felt like it did 15 years ago! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after it was recommended by my stylist as a way to keep my highlights fresh and vibrant in between colorings. It does everything it claims, a rarity when it comes to beauty products. My hair is soft, shiny, and the color looks great. I only need to use it once a week, so it&#x27;s also quite affordable. I hope they never stop making this great product!</li>
    <li> It removed greens and copper tones from my hair and make the color even better. It made my hair dry so I recommend to use really good conditioner after using it.</li>
    <li> Helps preserve salon color.  Causes some itching on my scalp.  A good buy overall.</li>
    <li> This product is a life and money saver.  I highlight my haut with bleach.  Unfortunately our well water is heavy on iron, which turns my highlights a lovely orange tint.  This product works great, it takes most of the orange tinge out of my hair after one treatment !  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product as part of the shampoo, conditioner, weekly brightener combo pack.  I didn&#x27;t especially love the shampoo and conditioner.  The Weekly Brightener, however, is fantastic!  I have long hair that is naturally dark blonde.  I have 3 different shades of blonde highlights and I was concerned these crystals would mess up my various tone highlights.  After using them the first time I was hooked!  I have country public water... that&#x27;s the only way to describe it.  It&#x27;s not well water, it&#x27;s not super chlorinated city water... it&#x27;s public water in the country.  And whatever is in it seems to dull my highlights after a couple of washings.  This weekly brightener brings my highlights right back to the color they were the day I went to the salon.  It&#x27;s incredible.  I can&#x27;t recommend these highly enough.</li>
    <li> This is Tim&#x27;s wife writing (we share an account) Anyway, imagine a product that actually does what it says it will do? I must say I was MORE than a little skeptical. I used this yesterday for the first time along with the Malibu Wellness Shampoo and conditioner. I was surprised to see it was a powder when I opened it. But I followed the directions and put it on in the shower, covered it with a cap and then waited about 5 minutes. Then I used the shampoo and conditioner. I came out of the shower and was shocked. All the red brassiness was GONE and my hair looked like something out of Hollywood. So THAT&#x27;S what those people do to get that kind of look. It dried shiny and soft. OK I&#x27;m impressed. And believe me that&#x27;s sayin&#x27; something...</li>
    <li> Swim team means at least twice a week in the harsh chlorine.  Once a week, altering this with the Malibu chlorine treatment, has kept my daughter&#x27;s hair healthy and not dingy!</li>
    <li> My scalp has been burning for a week since I used this!</li>
    <li> It works!  This actually does a fabulous job of toning down my reds and enhancing my blond.  Use it once a week or so.  I also use the shampoo too.  Both are excellent products.  No sulfates.  My hair has really responded.  Soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> These are great fior in between your hair appointments.  I use it once a week to keep my blonde highlights looking nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this, takes some getting used to the smell, but overall amazing results on my hair!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on chemically lightened hair. We have extremely hard water with high levels of minerals (especially manganese iron..&#x27;rust) that leave my hair not as soft and bouncy. Use this once a week and all mineral traces are removed. love love love it.</li>
    <li> Loove this product, excellent price! Works amazing on blonde hair and keeps shine. Wonderful, and keeps hair color looking great!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I use it once a week to cleanse all the residue from hair that builds up from my well water and styling products to keep my hair looking great.  I have tried many products and this is the only one that really works.</li>
    <li> I did not find it &amp;#34;brightened&amp;#34; my blonde all that much but it did have a nice conditioning effect.  I will continue to use the product but just not expect any &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see big results right away . I have long hair and the packets are measured more for shorter styles. I ended up buying purple shampoo and after one wash I was able to see less brassiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone blonde a few times and usually wind up darkening after the color starts to look more caramel than cool blonde like it&#x27;s supposed to. I started with Malibu weekly demineralizer packets and I enjoyed them but they dried my hair out. I decided to try this and after a month of using it with every shower my hair lost its contaminated, somewhat rusty colors and was replaced by the cooler platinum tones that I had done at the salon. I use Malibu hard water wellness shampoo, followed by these packets, and a purple conditioner that probably all helps to work like a beautiful system. The biggest blonde booster I&#x27;ve done is shampoo, apply two packets (I have long and thick hair you may only need one) and put a frosting cap on and use the hair dryer for thirty minutes. That really helps raise the gunk and discoloration out. Now if you start with a yellow or orange blonde as a result of incomplete processing this won&#x27;t work like a miracle. If you did have white blonde and noticed it&#x27;s looking tarnished later try these packets. They&#x27;re really awesome.</li>
    <li> In sed this two weeks in a row and I swear my hair is getting more golden not very happy with this purchase also makes my hair feel really dead until it&#x27;s conditioned</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product as I have ferrous iron in my well water.  It does remove most of the rust staining from my hair.  It seems a little dry after use though and I have a little trouble mixing it in my hand while in the shower.. ie getting enough water mixed in without it dripping on the floor before I get it on my hair.  I do like that it helps the color issue though.</li>
    <li> After using it for the last 4 weeks not really seeing a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> great to bring out the blonde, need to use a really good conditioner because it strips the oils from your her</li>
    <li> my hair turns a dull blonde in the winter. I started using this and it looks like it did in the summer.. amazing stuff</li>
