      <li>However, after two weeks of not using it, I noticed I was losing more hair without it.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>

      <li>I also STRONGLY ADVISE you to STOP SELLING any Nexxus Food Supplements if they do not have a printed expiration date.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed a foul smell from the bottle itself (which I attributed to a \\&quot;strong vitamin smell.\\&quot;)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy these pills are working and speeding up my hair growth, because I was about to cry with my hair so short!</li>
      <li>Use one pill a day, and have notices significant reduction in hair loss over a period of 3 months, did reorder it again.</li>
      <li>I would like an apology and a full refund, please.  </li>

      <li>I have asked Costsell.com for an apology and full refund.  </li>
      <li>I used this product years ago and my hair grew tremendously....</li>
      <li>I will know more once I complete this bottle.</li>
      <li>This product really and truely works for me.</li>
      <li>The day I first took this pill, I started experiencing diarrhea.  </li>
      <li>They smell funny, too.  </li>
      <li>the first time i burned my hair with the hair dryer, the heat was waaay too hot.</li>
      <li>Only thing is you have to make sure to increase your water intake because it will make your urine smell</li>
      <li>and I have a different head of hair:)</li>
      <li>My hair is more wavy than curly, but what is growing from my scalp are definitely considered curls.  </li>
      <li>I read the other reviews which said it was an effective product.  </li>
      <li>I have PCOS and experienced a lot of breakage and dryness due to low levels of estrogen.</li>
      <li>I have tried several hair supplements over the past two years and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>If you have thinning hair or have breakage, I recommend this hair product because it really works.</li>
      <li>After continuing to have diarrhea, I finally called Nexxus--toll free number was on the bottle: 1-866-913-0015--and gave them the Lot # printed on the bottom of the bottle:</li>
      <li>My hair is shedding and breaking just as much as ever even though I have been trimming it.</li>
      <li>So that means I don&#x27;t remember it being all that better than the other hair vitamins I have used.</li>
      <li>Someone spoke highly about these</li>
      <li>Women&#x27;s hair naturally sheds but this Nexxus product really assists in thickening, nourishing, strenthening, and growing the hair.</li>
      <li>However the changes that I have noticed are: My hair is thicker at the roots, thicker than normal.  </li>
      <li>I have not used it long enough yet to tell anything, but I can testify that it did work for me before. :)</li>
      <li>I noticed new growth within a couple weeks of taking this vitamin twice a day.</li>
      <li>After a relaxer, my hair had grown more than usual.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed my new growth is much thicker and growing faster.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and looks a bit fuller.   </li>
      <li>I really like them and can notice a difference after only a month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every few months she asks me to please see if this product is still available from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My hair was nearly bald/thinning on the sides</li>
      <li>The Overnight Treatment Creme has taken my naturally curly/wavy hair to BONE straight flat hair.  </li>
      <li>I recently used my first bottle and have seem a different in the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>The curls that have been growing from my scalp are definitely curlier than normal.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering another bottle because 1 month is not enough to really say that they work well enough or not.  </li>
      <li>I took only one a day and after several weeks could see lots of new growth coming in.  </li>
      <li>As for the actual pills, they look like regular old vitamins.  </li>
      <li>the main active vitamins-works the same!</li>

<li> the main active vitamins-works the same!</li>
<li> I have used about half a bottle and so far my hair seems to be growing faster and the thinning has stopped.  </li>
<li> BUT as long as Im taking Vitatress it doesnt happen.</li>
<li> Only minus, it does increase my appetite, so I don&#x27;t take every day.</li>
<li> I was looking for a supplement that would make my hair stronger because it seemed my hair couldn&#x27;t resist detangling, especially when it was wet.</li>
<li> I have used Nexxus products for 3 years now: Therrape Shampoo, Humectress Conditioner, Emergencee Reconstructor (sent from the Heavens) and other various styling products.  </li>
<li> and so I bought these pills and was and still am seriously amazed at how fast these pills are helping my hair</li>
<li> The only down side to this is that it is taking forever!  </li>
<li> For the amount I paid for this, I could&#x27;ve bought the same active vitamins at a drugstore for much less, without the smell, and with an expiration date.</li>
<li> Please check back in a few months for an update on this review</li>
<li> After being on this for about three months, I noticed not much changed.</li>
<li> Will definitely recommend for someone with thinning hair or excessive hair loss.</li>
<li> they believe this is an out-of-date bottle, and recommended that I discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely upset.  </li>
<li> Although I cannot say that this product increases hair growth, I can say it stops/slows down my hair loss.</li>
<li> Suddendly  I started to notice that my hair was becaming very thin and weak, looks that I was going bold on my sides</li>
<li> I DO NOT recommend is a waste of money.</li>
<li> anyway i needed to place another order but unfortunately the price went from $16-$17 to almost $68 probably due to a different seller.  </li>
<li> The first thing I noticed was the really bad smell when I opened the bottle-the smell of eggs (yuck).</li>
<li> Too bad the rest of my hair is completely straight.  </li>
<li> Not sure where you bought your stock from, but it sounds like you&#x27;ve been swindled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually take one tablet every day aside what is recommended.</li>
<li> Seriously, you could not find half a curl or wave in my head.  </li>
<li> So I bought this product when I started experiecing ongoing months (about 4-6) of excessive hair loss and eventually hair thinning.</li>
<li> 2 weeks after I got the bad haircut and started taking these pills I already began to see a difference in my hair, it was shinier, getting longer, and felt thicker and now a month later my hair is already almost down to my ears and still growing.</li>
<li> and I was DESPERATE to regrow my hair back to what it was</li>
<li> I got a horribly bad short haircut, I mean like boy short, after an unfortunate accident with hair bleach</li>
<li> I am writing this complaint letter because you have sold/shipped me an expired product!  </li>
<li> I started using it again and the amount of hair loss decreased.</li>
<li> From my personal experience I received these vitamins and they had no expiration date and a horrible horrible smell, contact the seller they never got back to me, I should&#x27;ve listen to my first mind and not bought these pills after seeing no expiration date and someone getting sick reviews, smh!!!!</li>
<li> FOUND THEM EXPENSIVE</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the bottle I received was expired.  </li>
<li> I have been unable to find them anymore</li>
<li> I started using it after a bad color job which made my hair fall out.</li>
<li> To bad I can no longer find this product</li>
<li> too bad</li>
<li> NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT</li>
<li> After taking these supplements, I became sick.  </li>

    <li> I recently used my first bottle and have seem a different in the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> Suddendly  I started to notice that my hair was becaming very thin and weak, looks that I was going bold on my sides and  my nails they broke contastly so I decided to cut them short, but they keep chipping...I was very frustrated. My hair stylist recomennded this vitamins, and currently I&#x27;m taking twice a day, after a month I noticed how my hair was looking an feeling thicker...and my nails they are stronger than ever, now I let them grow and thy look amaizing. Also I recommend the Vita Tress shampoo, that works along with the vitamins for a better result,you wouldn&#x27;t regreat this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was not at all impressed with this product.My hair is shedding and breaking just as much as ever even though I have been trimming it. I&#x27;m going back to Hair formula 37 which is more expensive but I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares out there.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago and my hair grew tremendously....It was longer than it had ever been before.  I moved to a different state and stop using it for years.  My hair was nearly bald/thinning on the sides and I decided to try and find the product that had been successful for me before....I&#x27;m glad I did..... Recently, I began using the creame, pills, and shampoo simultaneously and I have a different head of hair:) I can also testify... This product works and I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the bottle I received was expired.  After taking these supplements, I became sick.  I called Nexxus diretly (1-866-913-0015), and they asked what the printed expiration date was on the bottom of the bottle.  My bottle had NO EXPIRATION DATE, only a Lot Number (LOT #H05029). Nexxus informed me that ALL THEIR CURRENT BOTTLES NOW HAVE EXPIRATION DATES.  I have asked Costsell.com for an apology and full refund.  Below is the email I sent Costsell.com today:&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Hello, I ordered the Nexxus VitaTress Food Supplement from you (on Amazon).  I am writing this complaint letter because you have sold/shipped me an expired product!  Please note: The day I first took this pill, I started experiencing diarrhea.  I also noticed a foul smell from the bottle itself (which I attributed to a \\&quot;strong vitamin smell.\\&quot;)  I also could find NO EXPIRATION date on the bottle.  After continuing to have diarrhea, I finally called Nexxus--toll free number was on the bottle: 1-866-913-0015--and gave them the Lot # printed on the bottom of the bottle: LOT #H05029.  Based on this Lot #, and the fact the bottle does not have an expiration date (all Nexxus&#x27;s current bottles DO have expiration dates) they believe this is an out-of-date bottle, and recommended that I discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely upset.  I have never had this type of experience buying a product on Amazon&#x27;s site!  I would like an apology and a full refund, please.  I also STRONGLY ADVISE you to STOP SELLING any Nexxus Food Supplements if they do not have a printed expiration date.  Again, all the newer current bottles from Nexxus DO HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATES.  Not sure where you bought your stock from, but it sounds like you&#x27;ve been swindled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darryl Miller&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime Member</li>
    <li> This product really and truely works for me. Im on depoprovera birth control shot and it makes your hair shed BUT as long as Im taking Vitatress it doesnt happen. Keeps my hair nice, healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> I got a horribly bad short haircut, I mean like boy short, after an unfortunate accident with hair bleach and I was DESPERATE to regrow my hair back to what it was and so I bought these pills and was and still am seriously amazed at how fast these pills are helping my hair regrow.&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 weeks after I got the bad haircut and started taking these pills I already began to see a difference in my hair, it was shinier, getting longer, and felt thicker and now a month later my hair is already almost down to my ears and still growing. The pills take time, but they work!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy these pills are working and speeding up my hair growth, because I was about to cry with my hair so short!</li>
    <li> I noticed new growth within a couple weeks of taking this vitamin twice a day. After a relaxer, my hair had grown more than usual. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product when I started experiecing ongoing months (about 4-6) of excessive hair loss and eventually hair thinning. I was looking for a supplement that would make my hair stronger because it seemed my hair couldn&#x27;t resist detangling, especially when it was wet. Tons of hair would come out. After being on this for about three months, I noticed not much changed. My hair was still falling out, as a matter of fact, it&#x27;s been worsening; however, I can say that the product helps your hair grow longer, faster. It&#x27;s a good product if you want to grow your hair longer at a faster pace.</li>
    <li> Someone spoke highly about these so I decided to give them a try. I really like them and can notice a difference after only a month. Only thing is you have to make sure to increase your water intake because it will make your urine smell</li>
    <li> My hairdresser in TX suggested it after I was shedding lots of hair following the birth of my daughter.  I took only one a day and after several weeks could see lots of new growth coming in.  I was without it recently because we moved and couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so I have ordered it again.  I have not used it long enough yet to tell anything, but I can testify that it did work for me before. :)</li>
    <li> I am a 10 year breast cancer survivor.  After losing my hair to chemo it never did grow back.  I tried everything I could find but nothing worked.  I started taking these supplements in December 2010 and in 3 months I started seeing results.  I also use the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo and Scalp Cream.</li>
    <li> I have used Nexxus products for 3 years now: Therrape Shampoo, Humectress Conditioner, Emergencee Reconstructor (sent from the Heavens) and other various styling products.  So you can say I am a Nexxus junkie.  But for 1 year now I have been using Nexxus Pro-Mend Overnight Treatment Creme.  The Overnight Treatment Creme has taken my naturally curly/wavy hair to BONE straight flat hair.  Seriously, you could not find half a curl or wave in my head.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to bring back my curls, nothing works.  So I am reserved to just letting it grow back.  I found these pills on Amazon and I was hoping that these pills would help it grow faster, but I dont think they work to make hair grow faster.  I have been taking them twice a day for 1 month. However the changes that I have noticed are: My hair is thicker at the roots, thicker than normal.  The curls that have been growing from my scalp are definitely curlier than normal.  My hair is more wavy than curly, but what is growing from my scalp are definitely considered curls.  Awesome!  Too bad the rest of my hair is completely straight.  The only down side to this is that it is taking forever!  As for the actual pills, they look like regular old vitamins.  You know, big multivitamins you get from GNC or something.  They smell funny, too.  The smell is not enough to not take them, but it is noticeable. I will be ordering another bottle because 1 month is not enough to really say that they work well enough or not.  Please check back in a few months for an update on this review</li>
    <li> I order this product for my wife.  She has taken this tablet for years and always insists that she has to have it for good, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Every few months she asks me to please see if this product is still available from Amazon.  It&#x27;s on my regular order list that Amazon keeps.  So, what can I say, she wouldn&#x27;t take anything else.  Hope this helps some of you others considering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vann</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair or have breakage, I recommend this hair product because it really works. I have tried this for the second time. the first time i burned my hair with the hair dryer, the heat was waaay too hot. This second time, it is after giving birth to my daughter.  Women&#x27;s hair naturally sheds but this Nexxus product really assists in thickening, nourishing, strenthening, and growing the hair. Very economical!</li>
    <li> I love the Nexxus Vitamins.  I noticed a differnce after just 2 weeks.  My hair seemed fuller, especially around the edges.</li>
    <li> great product...fast shipping</li>
    <li> Do not buy the Nexxus vitatress vitamins, Nexxus does not sell these pills anymore and any pills that you buy will be expired! From my personal experience I received these vitamins and they had no expiration date and a horrible horrible smell, contact the seller they never got back to me, I should&#x27;ve listen to my first mind and not bought these pills after seeing no expiration date and someone getting sick reviews, smh!!!!</li>
    <li> I can attest that this product does aid in hair growth. I&#x27;m an African American women and I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months. I started using it after a bad color job which made my hair fall out. Rather than cut it all off I opted to wait till I had regrown atleast 6\\&quot; inches of health hair. So I started taking the Nexxus VitaTress Hair Food to help my hair grow back faster and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed my new growth is much thicker and growing faster.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product b/c I read the other reviews which said it was an effective product.  I have used about half a bottle and so far my hair seems to be growing faster and the thinning has stopped.  My hair feels soft and looks a bit fuller.   I will know more once I complete this bottle.</li>
    <li> Although I cannot say that this product increases hair growth, I can say it stops/slows down my hair loss. I stopped using it for two weeks because after using it for months, My hair didn&#x27;t get any thicker. However, after two weeks of not using it, I noticed I was losing more hair without it. I started using it again and the amount of hair loss decreased. I will never stop taking this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. They are really good for thinning hair and hair loss. My hair ha grown a lot and has thickened.</li>
    <li> I no longer use broke me out horribly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. I used two full bottles of this product but I don&#x27;t see any progress!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was the really bad smell when I opened the bottle-the smell of eggs (yuck). The second thing was -the no expiration date. For the amount I paid for this, I could&#x27;ve bought the same active vitamins at a drugstore for much less, without the smell, and with an expiration date. Skip the purchase and go to Target/Walmart and just buy the main active vitamins-works the same!</li>
    <li> Use one pill a day, and have notices significant reduction in hair loss over a period of 3 months, did reorder it again. Also hairs appears to be stronger. Will definitely recommend for someone with thinning hair or excessive hair loss.</li>
    <li> Like everyone...hair damage can be a given...blow drying, heat, chlorine. I feel these vitamins are helping restore/maintain the fragile fiber that we call hair...i think it helps.  Only minus, it does increase my appetite, so I don&#x27;t take every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve used better supplements that worked fast. I did not like how it seemed to change the texture of my hair. Probably will not use this again.</li>
    <li> Great vitamins.  Healthy hair and nails.  To bad I can no longer find this product</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND THEY HELPED MY HAIR LOSS.&lt;br /&gt;I FOUND THEM EXPENSIVE BUT, I ONLY BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES I BELIEVE.&lt;br /&gt;I USED THEM AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE VITA TRESS ESSENTIAL KIT SO,&lt;br /&gt;THEY ALL WORKED GOOD FOR ME. NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT NEXXUS.&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASE NEXXUS HERE IN MONTREAL, SO ITS ALL GOOD.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even recall using this one but it popped up in my list of items to review. So that means I don&#x27;t remember it being all that better than the other hair vitamins I have used.</li>
    <li> I have tried several hair supplements over the past two years and this one is by far the best. I have PCOS and experienced a lot of breakage and dryness due to low levels of estrogen. This vitamin has revitalized my hair with shine and strength. I usually take one tablet every day aside what is recommended. Try the product, you will definitely be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> These are so good and getting hair healthy and helping grow hair. I have been unable to find them anymore</li>
    <li> Too costly for handling &amp; shipping</li>
    <li> i purchased this product along with biotin 10,000 mcg and biotin shampoo based on amazons&#x27; recommendation. these products worked great.  anyway i needed to place another order but unfortunately the price went from $16-$17 to almost $68 probably due to a different seller.  too bad i guess i&#x27;ll have to find another product</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what suppose to do. like drinking water. I DO NOT recommend is a waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
</ol>
