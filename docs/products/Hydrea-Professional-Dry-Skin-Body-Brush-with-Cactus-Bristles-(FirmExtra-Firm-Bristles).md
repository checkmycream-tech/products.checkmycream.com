      <li>After showering, my skin felt amazingly smooth and</li>
      <li>Fabulous skin brush.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t lose bristles like the cheap brushes do.</li>
      <li>Works great love this out with the old in with the new skin</li>
      <li>I originally brought this brush upon the recommendation of a teraphist.  </li>
      <li>I bought the brush to use for dry skin brushing and it works great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but I had to dock 1 for this brush really not being good for more tender/delicate flesh.</li>
      <li>I bought this along with oz naturals sweet almond and  nut body .  </li>
      <li>Well constructed and with extremely stiff bristles, unlike most, finally, the perfect brush!</li>
      <li>Really stimulates, and revitalizes!!</li>
      <li>Not for first time body brushers!</li>
      <li>If you love dry brushing you will love this one.</li>
      <li>Not necessarily because I believe it will remove cellulite or give me good chi or anything like that, but because it feels AMAZING and helps with my dry skin.</li>
      <li>i really recommend this its beautifu nice looking product, happy to have it, the bristles r really tough</li>
      <li>in all, I love this brush so far.</li>
      <li>worth the price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dry brushing for 20 years and this is the very best dry skin brush I have ever found.</li>
      <li>Good for dry body brushing if you&#x27;re okay with using a more medium to firm bristle.</li>
      <li>By the way: No more ingrown hairs, firmer skin, less coffee necessary to wake up and the pleasant feeling that I bought a really good product for a fair price.</li>
      <li>The firmness of the bristles is just right</li>
      <li>It has helped greatly with the red bumps on the back on my arms.</li>
      <li>This thing is really well made!</li>
      <li>first thing I noticed?</li>
      <li>I thought the bristles were not going to be hard enough, but they are perfect!</li>
      <li>Nice and soft - yet sturdy bristles definitely do the trick!</li>
      <li>Very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Firm</li>
      <li>Greatly helped reduce acne on my upper arms after a few weeks of using.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very sturdy so you have to control how much pressure you use</li>
      <li>but it makes you feel very invigorated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made too.</li>
      <li>otherwise it really</li>
      <li>While this seemed a bit pricey, once I received it I appreciated the quality.</li>
      <li>Really gets in there and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It has a nice feel in the hand, the wooden back is smoothed and well finished.</li>
      <li>nice, firm bristles.  </li>
      <li>The strap is sturdy and the bristles are nice and stiff</li>
      <li>I bought a total of 4 so far, and the seller is super super nice!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had to be very gentle at first, because I used it like my previous softer ones and scratched myself at first!</li>
      <li>Fantastic dry brush!  </li>
      <li>Very nice , firm without being too harsh.</li>
      <li>First, it arrived a solid 2 weeks ahead of schedule, all the way from the UK, in the middle of the Christmas rush - pretty</li>
      <li>Nice firm bristles for dry brushing.</li>
      <li>A little stiff and &#x27;scratches&#x27; at first, but not terrible.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be wasting  my money on other brushes as long as this one stays available to purchase</li>
      <li>Very stiff bristles but not painful.</li>
      <li>Like all good dry brushes it is hard and makes you a bit tender, but my skin is glowing and still has a little tingle hours later!</li>
      <li>the bristles are 1/2&amp;#34; long vegetable/cactus bristles (I think) and fairly soft and pliable.</li>
      <li>I started with a Bass brush that I purchased from Whole Foods -</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s more firm than some of the other dry body brushes on the market it definitely takes a few days to get used to, but once you do it works very well.</li>

<li> Does not &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; like other brushes.  </li>
<li> My skin was pink, but almost itchy, like all the blood had rushed to the surface, or like how you&#x27;ll itch like mad when you work out the first time after having not worked out in eons.</li>
<li> I will admit that the firm bristles were almost too painful for my torso, so I will either have to toughen up or maybe keep my Bass brush for the more delicate areas.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m kinda little anyway.</li>
<li> but I have to be careful not to brush too hard</li>
<li> I just got it a few days ago but have to keep myself from over use.</li>
<li> I use it to remove dead skin from my legs.  </li>

    <li> I love this brush thank you</li>
    <li> Works great love this out with the old in with the new skin</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use!</li>
    <li> While this seemed a bit pricey, once I received it I appreciated the quality. The strap is sturdy and the bristles are nice and stiff which is what I wanted. It has a nice feel in the hand, the wooden back is smoothed and well finished.</li>
    <li> After trying a cheapo brush from Walmart, there is no comparison!  I bought the brush to use for dry skin brushing and it works great.  The firmness of the bristles is just right and it doesn&#x27;t lose bristles like the cheap brushes do.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing skin brush! I have tried many different companies skin brushes, and this is the best. I actualy see the dead skin flake off! I recommend this for those who have skin brushed regularly before with a softer brush. The brush&#x27;s thistles are shorter and stiffer, which I believe gets the job done better. I had to be very gentle at first, because I used it like my previous softer ones and scratched myself at first! So remember to start slow and gentle.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!  I just got it a few days ago but have to keep myself from over use. It is beautiful and feels great! Like all good dry brushes it is hard and makes you a bit tender, but my skin is glowing and still has a little tingle hours later! The band is a bit big for my hand but I&#x27;m kinda little anyway.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this too hard, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> i really recommend this its beautifu nice looking product, happy to have it, the bristles r really tough n nice looking with nice grip</li>
    <li> Very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Firm, numerous bristles&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price</li>
    <li> If you love dry brushing you will love this one. One warning though, it is not for the faint of heart since it does not take prisoners. If you want an exfoliation, that&#x27;s what it will deliver. And boy, does it feel good when your circulation gets going. It&#x27;s my favorite part of the day when I get out the brush before stepping into the shower and come out refreshed and squeaky clean. By the way: No more ingrown hairs, firmer skin, less coffee necessary to wake up and the pleasant feeling that I bought a really good product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I originally brought this brush upon the recommendation of a teraphist.  My husband had a stroke and has weakness in this legs.  The upward motion of the brush on the leg seems to stimulate the muscles and make his legs work better.  I use it to remove dead skin from my legs.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> nice, firm bristles.  Does not &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; like other brushes.  Love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect.  Nice and soft - yet sturdy bristles definitely do the trick!</li>
    <li> Absolutely FIRM. Not for first time body brushers!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this brush! It has helped greatly with the red bumps on the back on my arms. And is a quick way to exfoliate!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  I use it everyday before my shower.  A little stiff and &#x27;scratches&#x27; at first, but not terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I thought the bristles were not going to be hard enough, but they are perfect! Very firm.</li>
    <li> Nice firm bristles for dry brushing. Quality brush.</li>
    <li> Just received and Seems to be a great brush.</li>
    <li> Fabulous skin brush.  Bristles are a little stiffer than others I&#x27;ve used (I believe they also make one less aggressive), and I really see the dead skin being brushed away and the tingling after brushing.</li>
    <li> l&#x27;ve been dry brushing for about 2 years now. Not necessarily because I believe it will remove cellulite or give me good chi or anything like that, but because it feels AMAZING and helps with my dry skin. I started with a Bass brush that I purchased from Whole Foods - the bristles are 1/2&amp;#34; long vegetable/cactus bristles (I think) and fairly soft and pliable. It worked well, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I decided I wanted to try a firmer bristle. After reading some reviews, I decided to purchase the Hydrea Firm/Extra Firm since I had a $25 gift card from Achievemint and the item was only $24.99. First, it arrived a solid 2 weeks ahead of schedule, all the way from the UK, in the middle of the Christmas rush - pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed? This thing is really well made! The bristles are about 1&amp;#34; long, packed densely and tight, and the strap is wide and attached solidly to the wood base. There&#x27;s not a lot of play in the bristles, so I knew I&#x27;d be in for an experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush hurts, but in that &amp;#34;hurts so good&amp;#34; kind of way. Like foam rolling or sports massages. The first time I used it, after 2+ years of using my Bass body brush, I could SEE dead skin flakes coming off of my legs (gross!). The sensation was prickly and almost hot, but good. I did long strokes on my legs and circular strokes on my torso. I will admit that the firm bristles were almost too painful for my torso, so I will either have to toughen up or maybe keep my Bass brush for the more delicate areas. My skin was pink, but almost itchy, like all the blood had rushed to the surface, or like how you&#x27;ll itch like mad when you work out the first time after having not worked out in eons. After showering, my skin felt amazingly smooth and wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this brush so far. I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but I had to dock 1 for this brush really not being good for more tender/delicate flesh.</li>
    <li> Very nice , firm without being too harsh. Perfect for dry brushing.  Delivery was a bit long though.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!!  I bought a total of 4 so far, and the seller is super super nice!!&lt;br /&gt;I TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> Most fabulous body brush, ever! Really gets in there and gets the job done. Well made. Very stiff bristles but not painful. Excellent for the soles of the feet especially. Thrilled to find something that isn&#x27;t Made In China for a change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dry brushing for 20 years and this is the very best dry skin brush I have ever found. Well constructed and with extremely stiff bristles, unlike most, finally, the perfect brush!</li>
    <li> Fantastic dry brush!  Really stimulates, and revitalizes!! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Bristles are harder than expected. Does a great job but I have to be careful not to brush too hard otherwise it really hurts.&lt;br /&gt;Would still recommend.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect that I bought another one. I won&#x27;t be wasting  my money on other brushes as long as this one stays available to purchase</li>
    <li> Just got this today. My trainer recommended it!!  I love it!!!!  Used it twice today!!  My skin feels so soft and kind of invigorated!!  I bought this along with oz naturals sweet almond and  nut body .  Seriously. I feel like I figured out a priceless answer!!!</li>
    <li> It was delivered very quickly. I love the product.</li>
    <li> Love it! The bristles are very sturdy so you have to control how much pressure you use but it makes you feel very invigorated. It&#x27;s very well made too.</li>
    <li> Good for dry body brushing if you&#x27;re okay with using a more medium to firm bristle. If you have delicate or sensitive skin, you probably wouldn&#x27;t like this brush. Because it&#x27;s more firm than some of the other dry body brushes on the market it definitely takes a few days to get used to, but once you do it works very well. Greatly helped reduce acne on my upper arms after a few weeks of using.</li>
