      <li>the darkness faded and my skin underneath my eyes even tightened up a bit :)</li>

      <li>I love this eye cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I would buy it again, it really works great</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is so different, this works well, not enough for me, but i have eczema on my face. I find it moisturizing and comforting, give it a try, it&#x27;s so much nicer than chemical products that cost much more.</li>
    <li> Shipment delivery was good.. product doesn&#x27;t really work though.... thanks</li>
    <li> good product, very gentle and it works!</li>
    <li> Nice cream when I got to bed for under eyes</li>
    <li> Takes care of the super dry areas around my eyes and I wake up without puffiness - love it!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this eye cream. I noticed after 2-3 days some lightening of the dark areas under my eyes and was super thankful. Trying new products always scares me especially on such a tender area but Opulence has been wonderful and if I was starting to have wrinkles, they disappeared too. I have been a big promoter for y&#x27;all. My friends have the same results so far ;)</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I used the entire jar and there was no change in the puffiness,or dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The cream has a nice light scent and feels very luxurious. It has so far been working great! I saw a difference in the area under my eye were I put the cream after just a few days. And the best part is that its all natural!</li>
    <li> Have found this product excellent for puffiness under my eyes.  I have very sensitive skin and no problems.  Excellent value for price. Don&#x27;tove the fragrance but it disapates quickly.</li>
    <li> Snake oil (Snake cream?)</li>
    <li> I Love how all the ingredients are all Natural and it really does seem to help with not only a very smooth feel, but my under eye fine lines seem to have diminished!</li>
    <li> I saw good reviews of this, and while I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be sure, so far I&#x27;m really pleased with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used &#x27;name brands&#x27; that don&#x27;t work as well.  Overall, my undereye area seems clearer and smoother with this cream.</li>
    <li> My eyes have always felt \\&quot;tired\\&quot;, no matter how much sleep I get at night. I have used other products without much success and always leaving the black circles under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations since I hadn&#x27;t seen the results from other creams - I was shocked at how great this product works and my eyes feel great! I have noticed a visible difference (besides feeling the soothing sensation) after about a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason this product works so well is because it&#x27;s using natural, chemical-free ingredients and the company cares about what they are making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Thks.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or dark circles or anything. I got this so my eyes can look more bright and awake since I don&#x27;t get much sleep during school season haha, and it really works. My eyes look soft and bright and I&#x27;m really glad I bought this. I no longer look sleep deprived lol</li>
    <li> Absolutely! When Maple Holistics offered to send me a free sample of their eye cream to review, I was very interested, as well as honored to be asked. I have taken exceptional care of my complexion since my early twenties – almost forty years. I am happy to say that my efforts have had good results. I love to sample skin care products, but many of them are not worth a cent. I mostly use prescription strength skin care products, but I was willing to sample this eye cream because of its natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what are my thoughts about it? I really liked it. This is an excellent moisturizing eye cream that feels wonderful. I live in the extremely dry climate of Colorado. Before I moved here I never had to use a moisturizer! I really like the Opulence Eye Cream because it is rich and creamy without being greasy. It does not migrate into my eyes, either. It absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn’t make my make-up smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this eye cream for two weeks. I did not expect it to make radical changes in my skin, and it hasn’t. I am pleased, however, in the improvement and softened appearance of the lines around my eyes. I plan to purchase the Opulence Eye Cream after I have used up my sample. I recommend this product highly. It feels fabulous.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has helped out a lot, I try to use this twice a day! My fiance also uses it. And it helps with the dark circles I get under my eyes and also the puffiness under my eyes. I like the fact when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, I can wake up and use it. It feels like it energizes my skin under my eyes. I really think everyone should try this.&lt;br /&gt;And this photo is not edited. My lovely result.</li>
    <li> My real battle is with dark circles. I think I can see improvement. This jar will last a long time, even though I use it EVERY day.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I have noticed the bags forming under my eyes, especially if I&#x27;ve gone without sleep for extended periods which does happen on occasion.  I was seeking an effective solution to this problem that isn&#x27;t requiring me to apply Preparation-H gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came highly recommended so I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a very light textured cream in a fancy container that is applied with gentle dabs (rubbing the bags makes it worse).  I note for the record that I don&#x27;t have circles or darkness; just the puffy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is essentially a concealer.  It will make any puffiness less visible, less obvious.  However the puffiness will still be there; so don&#x27;t purchase this expecting the puffiness to magically go away.  There is a disclaimer on the container that says &amp;#34;severe&amp;#34; cases may require surgery; mine isn&#x27;t anywhere near as severe as some cases, and in fact if you weren&#x27;t looking up close you might not even see the puffiness.  Despite that the cream was not able to really do much besides make them less visibly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad thing, but not what I expected, and definitely not my takeaway of how it was presented.</li>
    <li> Well, after reading all the RAVE reviews, I had to try this stuff.  I have been using it religiously for 3 months now, under my eyes morning and night, and I still don&#x27;t see much of a difference.....Still have puffy circles and wrinkles, but I guess it&#x27;s possible that they are SLIGHTLY diminished.</li>
    <li> Teen guy here, I just entered college as a freshman and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the stress or new surroundings but the areas below my eyes were looking not good! It looked like I wasn&#x27;t getting enough sleep when I knew I was. I said what the heck I&#x27;ll try this cream and it has been working pretty well for me so far. I&#x27;m about a month into it and my skin under my eyes look tremendously better! It&#x27;s definitely a nice boost back to the old self esteem! Good stuff packaged well and shipped in no time! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> it leaves the skin, dry and it made my puffiness worst. Very unhappy with the product. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this and i wanted to love it.  I saw some amazing reviews so i gave it a try.  I have had it for 4 months.  It really didnt do anything that benefited me.  Over the course of using it i noticed my eyes getting more puffy after each time.  i stopped using it to see if it was just allergies.  Unfortunately, i saw the puffiness reduce after stopping applying the cream.  Just to be thorough i tried one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this cream makes my eyes more puffy and i havent noticed any reduction in improvement in the darken under eye area.  Bust</li>
    <li> This eye cream product is really great! It has a natural and refreshing aroma and it is very gentle to the skin. I’ve been using it for a while and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative effects from it. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I had high expectation for this cream, but it doesn&#x27;t help with puffiness or wrinkles under eyes. I am very disappointed. Will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this to help with dark circle and bags/puffiness.  I started using s little less then a week ago.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet but I&#x27;m giving it 2 weeks.  My dark circles and bags aren&#x27;t major but I do work full time and have 3 children so I&#x27;m tired and busy... They under eye area is better but I&#x27;m hoping I see more results in the weeks to come. It&#x27;s very nice and light non greasy and absorbs nicely!  It&#x27;s a nice eye moisturizer!</li>
    <li> have ordered and used it several times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels So good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hasnt bothered my eyes a bit...ty so much Maple Holistics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first eye cream ive tried then bought it from you again and again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Abel&lt;br /&gt;8565 W. Carlton St&lt;br /&gt;Merridian CA 83642&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORDER # 104-0332978-4825814 of this and another..love them both..hope this helps</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great results!!!  Got rid of the dark circles.</li>
    <li> IT didn&#x27;t work at ALL -- I have more then half left because it is worthless. I bought it based off of reviews.</li>
    <li> IT OK REALLY HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT YET</li>
    <li> Love the cream, it&#x27;s nice and thick but spreads easily.  It keeps the eye moisturized all day.  Normally I have issues with some eye creams losing the moisture effect and when I get home after work, the eye area is dry and makes me look zombish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is interesting though, not bad but....I don&#x27;t know; it&#x27;s kind of grown on me.</li>
    <li> I hate giving a bad rating, but I don&#x27;t understand how people like this product?  I&#x27;m a guy, who has had dark circles for 50 years, I had finally decided to try and do something. First I tried a caffeine eye cream, which was OK, and it absorbed quickly. Then I decided to try this stuff. I might as well be putting motor oil on my face, this stuff is greasy. And it burns my eyes.  Everyone says you are supposed to dab an eye product underneath your eye, you cannot dab this stuff. And it is hard to wash off. I tried using it in the morning, at night, or both, And the smell is not pleasant.  At least it only cost me a little over 20 bucks. I&#x27;m not even going to give it away, I&#x27;m throwing it out. I wish I had something to say that&#x27;s positive, maybe I can use it to grease up a bicycle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not too far back and stayed using it until now in order to provide a better review and not say it doesn&#x27;t work. It does work slowly, it has an awful smell like it says (carotene) yuk but it has smoothed the crows feet lines around my eyes and helped reduce the puffiness and black mark around it which is due to not getting adequate sleep, always under stress, and just very tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One order of this product was all it took to fully clear the dark ring, smoothe the lines and reduce wrinkle that were around my eyes. Hopefully the same can happen to everyone who uses this product though everyone is different and may work differently or needing of other orders.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the scent isn&#x27;t that pleasant but to get the job done I can take it!</li>
    <li> this is my second jar and it does,t seem to work</li>
    <li> This was awesome!  Works great with my [[ASIN:B00GCQMSVA Best Vitamin C Serum]]. When I use both products together I really started noticing a difference. I can tell my skin is softer, my eyes appear brighter, and I look awake, rather than tired. The dark circles and puffiness that I regularly had have gone away, so I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs their dark circles and puffiness to go away.  Definitely will be a repeat customer on this one!</li>
    <li> Really it is okay but I don&#x27;t know if this product works for puffiness and dark circles.  I used for long time; maybe six months and I don&#x27;t see any changes but wrinkles?  Perhaps.  The cream smells funny but only for eyes.</li>
    <li> I Like this eye cream...I bought it because I have dark circles under my eyes...After using this cream I see the dark circles starting to lighten up...I recommend this cream</li>
    <li> Received cream a few weeks ago. Very nice texure, not thin. And not thick. Alot like ponds texture is.  not greasy. I am showing some signs of wrinkles smoothing. I have deep wrinkles. Only problem I had was the strong menthol smell. Not all of you  will agree. I have sensitive nose. Very nice product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> seriously! instant improvement when I used it... the darkness faded and my skin underneath my eyes even tightened up a bit :)</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this item due to having dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have tried the bubble bath from this same company and really enjoyed it, so I thought for the affordable price, why not try it? So, I&#x27;ve been using it once a day, at night actually for about 2-3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve began to notice a real difference in how my eyes appear when I wake up in the morning. The puffiness has gone down, and the dark circles are lightening. I will definitely continue using this!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream since I received it and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  There was no paperwork with it, so I&#x27;m not sure how long I am to use it before seeing results.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm, how to rate this cream.  Well, it has a nice consistency, goes on easily, has a pleasant fragrance, seems to be priced right.  Honestly, once we age and have  wrinkles, puffiness,  and dark circles there is nothing short of  surgery or other procedures  to remedy these aging signs.  Perhaps it is too early to tell if the cream does anything to alleviate the dark circles (the reason I bought it) but I see little evidence that anything has changed.  Makes me wonder if I should believe my lying eyes or if I should keep believing in miracles.  In all fairness this cream may work beautifully for those with young, taunt, slightly flawed  skin.  So, yes, I would recommend the cream but be realistic in your expectations.</li>
    <li> I am with the other 1-star reviewer. This cream is \\&quot;luxuriously\\&quot; thick, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all! I still feel the residue the next morning. Not to mention the fact that while I have it on, my eyes water CONSTANTLY! Which is awful if you have eyeliner/mascara on. ..... I hate to speculate, but a lot of these reviews seem fake. The only other site I could find reviews for this product on had very, (I mean VERY) similar wording. Something&#x27;s not right. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I put under my eyes so when Maple Holistics sent me this to try I was hesitant. I love that it is Paraben free, &amp; holistic/balanced so I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;It was very soothing and soaked in quite nicely. It really seems to help my puffy eyes after I get off a 12hr night shift. I&#x27;m happy that after drying, it didn&#x27;t leave flakes like most other products seem to do. I will definitely be buying this when my sample runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I got this free for review purposes.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Really works. Tried it one time, now im hooked.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and lines around both of my eyes. I also have dry and sensitive skin. This eye cream has a smooth creamy texture and a very nice light scent. Within about 2 weeks the area around my eyes had been transformed. No more dry, flaky skin and lines softened. This is the first eye cream that did not irritate my eyes and actually delivered the results that were promised.</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream for my wife and she loved it! She said it took away her dark circles and baggy eyes! Which I whole heartedly agreed with. What a great product! Guys you should get this for your gal!</li>
    <li> I first purchased Opulence more as a moisturizer to help prevent wrinkles around the eye than to lighten my dark circles, which were not severe. I have been using now for 8 months, it has lightened what darkness there was and keeps my eye area hydrated, in fact it is such a nice, soothing, light moisturizer that I use it all over my face and neck twice daily. It has not caused my dry, sensitive skin any problems unlike the other heavier moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. In fact it has improved the texture and color so much that I don&#x27;t wear foundation and I get complements on how great my skin is, which is amazing since my face used to be red, irritated and broken out! All I do now is wash and apply Opulence, for me at least simpler is better!</li>
    <li> Good product I really love it.</li>
    <li> First time user here. As soon as I received mine, I used it under my eyes. The moisturizer feels soothing upon application. I noticed my puffy eyes became less puffy in a matter of minutes. Great smell as well!</li>
    <li> I find that since I have started using this and my other products, the fine lines and dryness have diminished tremendously.  I would prefer it to be a bit more creamy, but other than that, I am most pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this would have worked under my eyes, but I used it to moisturize my forehead and it did wonderful things for my skin. Unfortunately, it has a heavy, cloying scent. It made my eyes water and itch and I eventually had to give it up. The scent is so sweet that I&#x27;m guessing the main ingredients have a funky smell and the sweetness was used to cover it. If this is not the case, and the manufacturers decided to produce a scentless version, I would try it again. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it actually had a retin-A like effect of minimizing small dry lines on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a month now and i really dont see any major changes, the bags are still there. The darkness may have lightened a very little but i barely notice, however it doesnt irritate my eyes i will continue to use this product until its gone but doubt i will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I never realized how much difference a good eye cream can make. Someone advised me to start a beauty routine as I have been in the habit of not doing so, and I was recommended to get this cream, which I am glad for because it has made a positive difference. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough for results.  It does have a rather strong odor that isn&#x27;t pleasant,&lt;br /&gt;but I will get past that if I see some positive results.</li>
    <li> This is really no different than your average drug store lotion. Only difference is the price. This stuff is way more expensive!</li>
    <li> This product helped with my under eye wrinkles that accumulated from long sleepless nights in college. I&#x27;m happy with the results- my eye wrinkles started to fade after daily usage for a week. A friend recommended this product to me, and I am so glad she did! If you suffer from under eye wrinkles, I would say definitely give this product a go.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this eye cream! I received a small sample from Maple Holistics from a Facebook giveaway. I was looking for a nice day time eye cream and this really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Some Pros are:&lt;br /&gt;~Its really thick in consistency so it really feels hydrating for under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;~It does not have a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;~Makeup goes on really well over it!&lt;br /&gt;~It lasts a really long time because its so thick you really only need a little to go a long way&lt;br /&gt;~My eyes seem really awake and not tired throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Cons are:&lt;br /&gt;Its doesn&#x27;t work great on dark circles or bags. I thought I could use this as my night eye cream but its not as strong as I thought it would be. Day time seems to work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;-The only other main complaint I have is it did sting my eyes a little bit in the first week I used it. If I put it too close to my waterline my eyes started to water really bad. But if you put it lower on the eye it works really well and I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it since.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product.  I have been using it two years.  It lasts forever.  It makes wrinkles disappear right before your very eyes.  I have also noticed my dark circles have disappeared.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t have a shelf life since I have 7 jars of it in my closet.  I just don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. I am 67 years old.  It is my favorite of all creams used on my face.  The smell, that I didn&#x27;t care for when I first got it, is no longer there. Strongly recommend‼️</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about Maple Holistics. I&#x27;m a bit of a homeopathic junkie but their products prove to all my friends who think I&#x27;m over-the-top how effective homeopathic products really are.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream doesn&#x27;t coat my eyes in makeup, use chemicals too sensitive for my skin (in fact, formula is all natural) or promise benefits it can&#x27;t deliver. Every application to the skin under my eye feels creamy and just... right. It feels right. And after a few weeks, lines started to shrink and after a month and a half my dark spots which made my eyes look slightly baggy were reduced 80%.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an eye cream that works naturally and helps solve the real problems behind what&#x27;s causing the unwanted look on the skin, this is a product for you. If you want a cream base infused with synthetically formulated actives to do the job, yeah it&#x27;ll probably work faster but the moment you stop using the cream, the moment the skin will shrivel up to a worse state than before.</li>
    <li> My face started to show wrinkles and that really bothered me a lot but I was fortunate enough not to go through what other people do and try all sorts of products to improve their skin. I got the chance to use Maple Holistics and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve used for my skin and believe me in just a month my wrinkles got lesser and now I don&#x27;t even see those lines anymore. This works for me and I&#x27;m sure this will work for you too.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me the rest of her tub of Eye Cream to try because I was skeptical. I have dark circles under my eyes and the only product I have found thus far was a Clinique product but it left my skin greasy. I really like how this product from Maple Holistics gets the job done without any compromising on my part. I definitely recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I like this product . It seems to be helping with the puffy eyes .i never had much dark circles to begin with so I cannot comment on that .its worth a try for that price !</li>
    <li> Maple holistic s products are defining skin and hair care using organic products . Their products smell amazing and they really work</li>
    <li> This was another &amp;#34;on a whim&amp;#34;  buy,  after a couple of friends told me it was a miracle-in-a-silver-jar.  I&#x27;m all for miracles,  and I love silver,  so that made it a shoe-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar contains a very generous amount of product,  and you really do need only a tiny blob to treat both eyes.  It&#x27;s very,  very smooth and rich,  but it does blend in wonderfully.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effects-wise,  I look at myself in the mirror too much which makes me a little less-than-objective.  I&#x27;m not noticing much,  but my husband certainly is  -  the dark circles are definitely lessening,  and there&#x27;s a clear reduction in puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to eye products and though I&#x27;ve used various other brands (Caudalie,  Kiehl&#x27;s,  to name but a few)  but when it comes down to it,  I&#x27;d buy Opulence every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because it has a bit of an odd aroma.  It&#x27;s not bad,  per se - it&#x27;s just...weird.  Then again,  my nose is weird and I go nose-blind with little prompting.  As long as this remains on the market though,  I&#x27;ll keep buying smell or no smell!</li>
    <li> Did not see a difference after using the entire product.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice any difference after months of use</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin but this product has taken cared of it. I&#x27;ve never seen any side effects after a week of use. I&#x27;m hoping to see positive results after a week or two. Hoping to become wrinkle free and become more confident in no time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream that had authentic carrot essential oil. This is the only one I found. I got it, it works, five stars. Excellent product - &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just happened to try this because my shampoo arrived open and messy. Benjamin was really nice, prompt and offered a new bottle plus an extra product of my choosing. I received the requested eye cream in 6 sample jars to share with my girlfriends on my 45th birthday. Turns out...this product is a winner on all our lists, including husbands! No more dark circles, and feels great to apply something that is natural and moisturizes well. In Hawaii we need the added protection. I have noticed a smoother appearance. The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I reapply after a day&#x27;s work and a shower to freshen up. I did work for a high quality botanical company here and I love supporting products that work with your body&#x27;s chemistry. A great gift for anyone on your list! I hope you try it or gift it!😊</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have used. It is thick and rich so you only have to use a very small amount. But it feels wonderful and I have noticed a huge difference with the dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3UTUHFT2BDOXW]]Maple Holistics Eye Cream is aimed to treat dry, puffy, and sensitive skin under the eye. The cream has a light Menthol scent with a sweet undertone. I personally prefer unscented creams, especially for use at night as the smells keep me from falling asleep quickly. I noticed that I put the cream on and do something that causes me to sweat, my skin under the eyes where the cream was applied begins to tingle (not in a good way). This only happens when I sweat, no tingling otherwise. The cream is very rich and thick, and takes a little bit of time to get absorbed (a minute or so). It feels like a good moisturizer. Has it decreased wrinkles and puffiness? Not noticeably so far (2 weeks of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither my container nor Maple Holistics web site contains a list of ingredients for the cream, but Amazon description does:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is described to be Paraben and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free. It contains Water, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Wheat Germ (Triticum Vulgare) Oil, Sesame (Sesamum Indicum) Oil, Myristyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Calendula (Officinalis) Extract, Cornflower (Centaurea Cyanus) Extract, Saccharomycesm Ferment Lysate Filtrate (Naturally Derived Active), Sodium Alginate, Rosewood oil, Daucus carota (carrot seed) oil, Sodium Citrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics explains how this cream works by highlighting several ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Carotene ingridient which is considered one of the most efficient ingredient to enhance appearance of mature skin. Rather than just lightening the outer layers, it works to stimulate cell growth and remove toxins underneath the skin provides a more toned and youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;✔ Rosewood blend and Marigold extract have a positive effect on constrict blood vessel (which affects dark spots) and sooth and soften puffy and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of 2 photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #1 shows the tub with the cover off&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #2 shows the thick texture of the cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this eye cream from the manufacture for sharing my experiences (good or bad) in a review. I have described the positives and the negatives of my experience.

For me it ranked &#x27;ok&#x27;, I liked the richness of the cream but was not crazy about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> not bad but burns the eyes.......not much of a difference for me</li>
    <li> I am a 67 year old male who has never used an eye cream.  I opened the package at work and put some on without a mirror.  When I arrived home I was surprised at how good the circles under my eyes looked.  I plan to use it for the long term to see if it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day, in the mornings and at night. So far I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the dark circles under my eyes (the reason I bought this). If I had to say I saw a difference I might say the color of my under eye bags are getting slightly lighter but by no means going away. The one thing I noticed from the first use is the smell. I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to but it has a sort of manufactured smell for being a natural product but the only reason I say this is because I can&#x27;t place the smell to anything natural. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is a definite bonus because my skin is so sensitive around my eyes. I also think this product is a good bang for your buck because the cream is very thick and a little goes a long way. Over all I will keep using this product until it is gone but unless I see more improvement over time I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the good reviews i decided to buy it. Biggest mistake ever. I have a medium toned skin and really dark circles under my eyes (genetics not lack of sleep) and this product didn&#x27;t help at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell good, very very heavy so it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed completely by the skin, and finally NO RESULTS after 2 weeks of using it twice a day. Please, save your money, and don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 weeks day and night with no visible results. I have used other products from Maple Holistics that I really like but this one just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using opulence under my eyes and it has reduced the puffiness 100%! I am turning 51 next month and will continue to use opulence to guarantee that the puffiness willnotreturn. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought Opulence luxury eye cream after reading some of the reviews about the product and doing research on the company. I have had dark circles around my eyes since my twenties.Now in my late thirties i noticed some wrinkles and wanted to try a new product.I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and do see some improvement.I have used other products in the past but so far Opulence Luxury Eye Cream seems to be living up to its reputation.But since it is still a little bit too early to really rate this product for now I am gonna give it 4 stars and with the hope that it will receive  one more from me.</li>
    <li> Well, like most advertisements in womens beauty products, this did not deliver. None of the dark circles, puffiness, or dryness under the eyes diminished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who is naturally pale with olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 2 weeks since I got it. The smell is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very rich and  takes a while to absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets rid of the puffiness, small bags under the eye. That&#x27;s where you can feel your skin tighten up.&lt;br /&gt;However, does not get rid of the dark circles, which is one of my big problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 3. other&#x27;s might get different results. Mind where somewhat of a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is a one of a kind!  It has a refreshing, natural aroma and a delightful texture.  It looks good enough to eat (but that would be bad, please don’t).  It moisturizes like crazy, good stuff.</li>
    <li> The product has no instructions with it,  I have used it daily but have seen no results I am not sure what I am supposed to epect</li>
    <li> This is triple the amount of eye cream I usually would get for the price of 12.99.  I have used it for one week and under my eyes look better already.  It is really helping the fine lines.  I don&#x27;t have the dark circles, but all else is awesome with this. Will buy again:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about two months now, and I suppose my eyes do look a bit less dark and more moisturized. However I wouldn&#x27;t say this product has made a drastic difference, and I&#x27;m sure there are more effective products out there for dark circles. I like that the ingredients are safe and non-toxic. It&#x27;s pretty basic as far as eye cream goes, so using this is better than nothing at all. But I would try another eye cream out before buying this one again.</li>
    <li> This may be a good moisturizer, but the strong scent is awful and therefore I can&#x27;t stand to use. And I&#x27;m not sensitive to smells on facial products.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin but decided to try Maple Holistic Eye Cream because their  Winter Shampoo Set was so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was just as surprised and pleased with their eye cream.  BOTH ARE FANTASTIC PRODUCTS!!!  Now, may I please beg for production of facial cream? If it is anything like the eye cream, I am sold for life!!! Not kidding!</li>
    <li> I have tried it only for a week so far. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird. I think its mostly odorless. The tub is huge for eye cream. I&#x27;m hoping to see results in a month.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait several weeks to actually rate this product because I think that to give something like this a fair shake, you have to give it time to do its job. The first day I used this around my eyes, I felt a little tingling. I was kind of concerned at first, but it quickly went away. Within a few days, I noticed that the skin under my eyes seemed less fragile - and that the moisture level had increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few weeks I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes were less pronounced. The skin around my eyes seemed more supple and bright. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and have barely put a dent in the jar (a little goes a long way) and am confident this cream has helped improve the skin around my eyes. I use it as a part of a total skin care regimen. There is not a single product that can do everything for your skin alone - keep that in mind when you are looking for results. The price is excellent and I love the quality of the product. I would definitely recommend adding this to your skincare regimen!</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes of reducing the dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for 2 months now.  Sadly, I have seen no improvements.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great, it does what it is supposed to. It moisturizes my under eye nicely, which is what I got it for mainly.  I have&#x27;t noticed a reduction in my under eye dark circles but that will probably take a little longer to happen anyway.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change, wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product. Can&#x27;t seem to find anything that seems to work but still searching</li>
    <li> I will definitely order this product again. It lightens under my eyes some, but causes smooth, soft skin around my eye, a lot. I love how smooth it makes my skin around my eye and can&#x27;t imagine wrinkles even having a chance if I keep using this as a hydration system for my eyes.</li>
    <li> The first few times of use, there was a strong scent that made my eyes water.  After that, there is no reaction at all.  A little goes a long way, and its a good buy for the container size.  There is a noticeable improvement in dark circles, puffiness under eyes.  I expect to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Teen guy here, it looked like I wasn&#x27;t getting enough sleep when I knew I was. I said what the heck I&#x27;ll try this cream and it has been working pretty well for me so far. I&#x27;m about a month into it and my skin under my eyes look tremendously better! It&#x27;s definitely a nice boost back to the old self esteem! Good stuff packaged well and shipped in no time! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I use it as a night cream. It smells great and I love the consistency of it!</li>
    <li> This cream is ok. I used it everyday for a few weeks and my under eyes feel very smooth and look soft. I can&#x27;t stop touching my eyes. I always looked tired but my eyes  seem more awake so it&#x27;s good. The smell is a little off but other than that it&#x27;s a good cream.</li>
    <li> Wish there&#x27;s a zero-star option I can pick...</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream. The consistency is of Pond&#x27;s cold cream. I especially appreciate that you get a good amount of eye cream for the money. Most eye creams come in very small jars.</li>
    <li> no major complaints about this cream, just didnt see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Absolutely no change after continuous uses.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 months so far. I&#x27;m of South Asian descent, male, aged 23, and I&#x27;m a healthy student who exercises and lives a somewhat active-lifestyle. &amp;#60;&amp;#60;This is for those who are specific about whose using this particular product since product affects each and everybody differently. Well here is what I do with the product when I apply it, I apply it once in the morning after my facial routine and at night time before bed. I don&#x27;t apply any sunscreen or what not over my undereye area because the area is very sensitive. The product does seem to keep my undereye looking smooth and soft (looks and feel). I have an oily-combo kind of skin which I have forgotten to mention. I like the product overall, it does what it does and its a natural product and priced at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;ve used products that cost from as little as $10 to $100+. This little jar (it is not at all too small and you get so much product unlike other brands and high-end ones) is so great and it&#x27;ll probably last me 2years+ if I just apply it twice daily. So try it guys, it works wonders and it isn&#x27;t heavy like some other eyecreams.</li>
    <li> i love opulence eye cream  the texture was so creamy the way it felt on your skin was smooth and supply and a little tingly i love the feel  the scent was so lite not over powering at all.  even after an hour or more the usual cream would have disappeared not opulence still felt smooth ans supply</li>
</ol>
