<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mom has used this for eons. She digs it.</li>
    <li> I really love the beads on this wash! They do a great job of cleansing my face without leaving greasy residues.</li>
    <li> This is the best solution I&#x27;ve found to clearing up acne - which says a lot, since I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. It clears up my acne within two days!</li>
    <li> I can not stress enough how amazing this product is for acne, scars, blackheads, pores and even just as a cleanser its the perfect scrub i use it 3-4 times a week and it is so amazing, ill never use anything else it smells great too if you&#x27;re looking for a good scrub i really recommend you give this a go, all it can do is help!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it feels so nice on your skin but one con i don&#x27;t care for is that the little beads don&#x27;t rub into your skin, they just stay little bead-like things until you have to wash the cleanser off, but other then that it works great and I would indeed buy it again after I run out! :D</li>
    <li> I bought this blemish and blackhead control scrub for me because well the product title says it all. I wash my face everyday and after washing my face I feel it smooth and soft. I do get blemishes while using this but also other factors affect I guess. I have oily skin so for sure this will not work for people with oily skin. Overall this really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for so I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is one of the all time best facial scrubs on the market. You can spend tons of money on more expensive scrubs but this does a better job and is much more economical than most. You would be a fool to waste your money on other facial scrubs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for years and I love how my face feels after getting out of the shower. My face is clear and not shiny during the day. I went on vacation once and forgot to bring it so I bought something equivalent and my face didn&#x27;t feel as smooth or shine free until I got home and used this again. I&#x27;m 33 and get asked all the time if I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love the scrub.  It feels great on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be clearing my blackheads or acne.</li>
    <li> The blemish and blackhead control version of the ST. Ives Apricot Scrub is a great face wash for removing makeup, and for exfoliating old skin from your face. This consistency of this formula is thicker than most face washes, and the particles in it that make up the abrasive scrub are densely packed, so you get a ton of scrubbing cream in just a small amount of product. Much more exfoliation power than in the original Apricot Scrub version. It&#x27;s great for removing long wearing, color-stay foundation, which tends to need something with a little extra scrubbing power in it to get all of it off of your skin. It cleans out pours and leaves skin super smooth, without drying it out. It works quite well, and it&#x27;s been a favorite face wash of mine for well over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and would definitely recommend it.  It is not as abrasive as you may think.  My skin feels refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite drugstore facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY?&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly. I&#x27;m a total sucker for good smelling products. Not that chemically, perfume-y, super sweet disgusting smell. This smells so fresh and like apricots.&lt;br /&gt;The cream consistency is perfect and the micro-beads are very exfoliating without being too rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean the blackheads and pores in my nose as well as I had hoped. I had to use a separate blackhead cleaner, pore sealer (Murad) to really clean all that gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER...&lt;br /&gt;To use a good moisturizer afterwards because it will dry out your skin if you use it often.</li>
    <li> Excellent! My face has never been softer. Within a few days my face had also cleared up almost completely. Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Package came good. Looks nice. I am in Australia and its difficult to get St. Ives products as they are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help my skin when I have unwanted breakouts. Mario Badescu, Acne Free, Clean &amp; Clear, and many more. Sometimes I get breakouts, but I was getting them a lot more for some reason and nothing helped until I found this. I purchased this scrub at my local store for much more money about 3 months ago. I also purchased the St. Ives Apricot Fresh Skin scrub, which I highly suggests using together. This was the only product that helped me get ride of my breakouts and from getting any more. I found this on Amazon for $3.29 in a 6oz tube, which is amazing. A little goes a long way,and  It makes me feel so refreshed after I wash my face. This is the best smelling acne scrub I have tried by far, no chemical smell, like other products. It has 2% salicylic acid, oil free, and 100% Natural exfoliants. It says for best results use 3-4 times per week, but I use it everyday with a light hand. Overall I love this face scrub and I can&#x27;t live without it now. Also shipping was very fast only 3.days, I got it before the scheduled shipping date. It was from Amazon itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs for over 40 years.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried, I use a Buff Puff with it, to help remove dead flaky skin.</li>
    <li> This scrub leaves my skin super smooth. It doesn&#x27;t lather so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into, look elsewhere. But it&#x27;s super gritty and it will show your face who&#x27;s boss.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving int 3 stars since everyone else seemed to have such great results. I used this face wash as directed and I broke out even more. It really dries out your skin, which is never good. I still use it, but less frequent, hoping that will give me better results.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!  I seen a difference in my skin appearance within the first use.  Smaller pore appearance, skin looks radiant.  I use once daily at night and in the morning I am ready to start the day.  My makeup appears better due to the pore reduction.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT, GAME CHANGER FOR CHEAP!</li>
    <li> Always have liked this product to make your screen feel soft and close up some of your big porous and get rid of blackheads.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like I&#x27;m scrubbing almost everything away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product prevents blackheads or not since I don&#x27;t really have any.  But I do like the product.  It makes my facial skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Gave me spots, as I thought it would. I never get spots and wanted this for blackheads but it gave me so many spots I&#x27;ve stopped using it! At least the smell is okay and I can use it for my legs. Too harsh for your face. Didn&#x27;t do anything for blackheads. Boo!</li>
    <li> I ordered the one on the picture because i was unable to find it in stores. I received the one with the orange color that they currently sell in stores.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I hre used it once in the past and absolutely adored it! The shipping came really fast, I have just reviewed today, and I was suppose to recive it on June 26. Your skin feels refreshed and the it doesnt have a medical smell. I personally, like the smell. Oh, but it&#x27;s the wron picture, though. You&#x27;ll recieve an orange one, but it&#x27;s still very nice.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my blackheads have doubled, I have 3 new zits, and my skin feels no smoother whatsoever. Didn&#x27;t appreciate that at all! This just wasn&#x27;t the scrub for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favirote skin product to pamper myself with. The smell really isn&#x27;t that great (I think they need to introduce something which really does smell like apricots), but it is very effective at removing dirt and oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be applied in the bath or shower. It is very messy and has a tendency to glop everywhere. Plus the acne medication can stain fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also strongly recomend purchases of the larger sizes because I go through the little tubes on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars, cuz it&#x27;s worth it! This scrub is the best for my skin, because it leaves my skin really really soft, clean and nice. Can not live without it now. Use it 3 times a week and you&#x27;ll see the difference!)</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;m almost positive I&#x27;ve seen an improvement on my face, not just when it comes to zits or blackheads, but in how it looks, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever change facewashes. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. It really makes your skin feel fresh right after using it!</li>
    <li> The prouct didnt really work for me. I was clueless at the time of using this product because I didnt know you werent supposed to scrub your face if you have active acne because all it does is spread bacteria forming even more acne and aggrivates the acne you already have. Now I know that if I have acne, I can only use chemical exfoliants instead of scrubs. However, if you dont have acne, it works great for oily skin and preventing acne. It can be very abrasive, so be gentle with it. The product also smells very good.</li>
    <li> I love the entire line of St. Ives scrubs.  I am constantly rotating between all of them!  If you haven&#x27;t tried, you should.  They exfoliate without cutting into your skin.  Even if you have open wounds, (pimples/ zits) it doesn&#x27;t hurt, just exfoliates!</li>
    <li> My skin is oily, and I have been told it is acne prone, even though I actually rarely break out. Since I have started using this product, I have not had any zits, and I have been very impressed with the quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as part of a new &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; skin regimen I&#x27;ve recently started, and since starting this regimen, I have in fact noticed that the tiny forehead and neck lines I was starting to see in the morning don&#x27;t seem to stick around for very long or don&#x27;t appear at all. I should add that I am fairly young (around 30) and am mostly interested in preventing these temporary wrinkles from becoming more permanent establishments. I&#x27;m not sure how this works for someone with already established wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Aveeno sunscreen, a silk pillow for sleeping, a few drops of almond oil at night, a coconut oil washing once a day, an Aztec mud mask with apple cider vinegar once a week, a daily apricot scrub, a daily slathering on of an all-natural retinal product, and a frequently used rose water toner all at once. With that being said, I am not sure if one product had more of a role than the others. I have been very satisfied with the products I have purchased, though.  Whew, I feel like that is a lot, especially considering I was just washing with water a month or so ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in knowing any of the specific brands, please let me know! Otherwise, happy shopping! I hope you find what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The hard beads inside the soap give a deeper clean, smells nice.</li>
    <li> This face wash is the best exfoliating face wash on the market. The smell is excellent and it works so well. I have been using it for almost five years and will never part from it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub because I love St Ives products, and while it is a good scrub (smaller granules than the normal apricot body scrub that St. Ives makes), it still feels like the pieces are &amp;#34;too big&amp;#34;. St. Ives makes a green tea scrub that has smaller granules, which I think work better on my face - but I bought this so I will use it until the bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say, I just think there is a better version by the same company. However, if for any reason you can&#x27;t use their green tea facial scrub, this is a good second choice (or if you just prefer apricot).</li>
    <li> HI! So, I have heard good things about this product. Great things. If it works for you, great. Here&#x27;s one itty-bitty problem.  If the formula is still the same, all of the exfoliating bits are made out of ground apricot pits. Good idea, right? Wrong! Most exfoliators have these teeny but uniform, man- made balls which do the job. Every time you use THIS product, you are scrubbing shards of a wood-like substance into your skin, making micro tears in it. Yeah, not good in the long run. I did receive this advice from a licensed dermatologist. I&#x27;m sorry, but if this really works to clear up your skin, use it until you&#x27;re clear, and then use it MAYBE every few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this product for awhile an just love it. Does exactly what it says it does an leaves skin feeling great</li>
    <li> I had to tried this product because there were so many good reviews. Both my son and I have acne and this product did absolutely nothing and the bottle was used in its entirety.</li>
    <li> This has always been my all-time favorite exfoliating scrub. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands from Neutrogena to Clean and Clear and they did not work on my skin. This scrub is not harsh on my skin nor does it not make my skin feel dry after using it. (Note I have combination skin). This does actually help remove dead skin from my face, help fight acne, and I even notice a reduction of blackheads on my face since using this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and it will forever be my favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Lots of beads to scrub you up real good.</li>
    <li> The product works great, was as described.  I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> The apricot scrub is pretty much the only thing that works reliably on my perpetually oily face. The little beads do a great job of scrubbing. I&#x27;ve bene using this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Do you have overactive sebaceous glands?  This apricot seeds are awesome to exfoliate and let the acne medication in this facewash let in through your pores.  It&#x27;s a must have for anyone with skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve blackheads on the tip of my nose and I hate it! I&#x27;ve been using this for a while in the shower and it really does work. My skin is fair and super sensitive and I will say this is a bit more grainy than the &amp;#34;fresh face&amp;#34; St. Ives, so be careful not to be too rough. It smells good and it feels like it really cleans out my skin. After I remove this in the shower, I use a moisturizer and my face feels super smooth and clear :)</li>
    <li> Used this back in high school and it worked well, so I decided to get it again. I realized the way to use this is by being careful on how much you use it throughout the week. You should only exfoliate 2-3 times a week. I did that with this and it worked so well and cleared up my acne, not to mention the smell!Would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Came a lot earlier than expected Exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> this product is a great product...</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. But recently noticed that St. Ives is now part of Unilever. The package no longer says &amp;#34;no animal testing&amp;#34;. Where it used to say that now just says Unilever. And I think Unilever does do animal testing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be some ingredient differences, too. I compared it to a old tube I found laying around and noticed that there used to be more flower extracts and botanicals. Now the only natural extract is apricot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This use to be 5-star product for me but with the changes, I&#x27;m dropping it to 3. Hopefully Unilever will bring back the natural ingredients that made St. Ives special. And maybe they&#x27;ll stop animal testing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub does still work though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but my skin needs to be exfoliated pretty frequently. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for that, and as a guy, I like that it&#x27;s really inexpensive (about $1 a month with daily use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product every day, my skin is clear and doesn&#x27;t get red. When I don&#x27;t use it, it looks like I have windburn, and nothing else quite does the job (or at least not for this price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend, however, insists that this type of exfoliation will be bad for my skin long-term. I trust her, she&#x27;s an expert in beauty and cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I can find a product that penetrates my beard hair and exfoliates the skin underneath and doesn&#x27;t cost me $10 a day to use, I&#x27;ll stick with St. Ives.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than any other drug store scrub.  It leaves my face oil free and dries up pimples quicker than any other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I love how cheap it is too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Some people use it as a scrub every few days, but I use it every day as a facial wash. My skin always feels refreshed after I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years on my face to keep my skin clear. It&#x27;s gentle (I have sensitive skin so this is important) but it works really well. I just keep it in the shower next to my shampoo.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this product. The first time I used it I kind of barely put it on my face, just to see how it was going to react, then the next night I put it on my whole face, scrubbed it really well, and my face has never been this soft before. It is incredible! It is a must try!</li>
    <li> Awesome scrub, smells good too. The grains in this are bigger ad courser than other scrubs which is a good thing if you like the scrub to be more intense. Can be used everyday, it wont dry you out. I don;t know what it does for my acne but I do like the way it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Veey mild on the face and does exactly what it says it would. Its a product everyone should have in their washroom.</li>
    <li> have been using it since i was in high school. clears skin, takes off that make up, gets the job done. like a mini facial every time i wash my face :)</li>
    <li> I used this to help alleviate my razorburn on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so my razorburn had reduced drastically.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for other uses such as a facial cleanser and smells pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my teenage daughter. It did nothing to help already existing breakouts and seems to have caused more breakouts. She said it made her face extremely dry and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I love this item so much it is used every night!</li>
    <li> I do like this scrub A LOT, it controls black heads and blemishes. It also leaves your skin very soft and feeling clean. It is worth the price!!!!!!!! The only thing i do not like its that it it doesn&#x27;t eliminate the blackheads you already have.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better than Apricot scrub to remove the leftover makeup and residue your makeup remover left behind. I use this every night on my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff Is awesome</li>
    <li> I like this anti-acne face washer a lot.&lt;br /&gt;First, because it leaves your face smelling great after you wash your face. S&lt;br /&gt;econd, because it just does its job to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;And third, because it dosent leave your face skin dry like most if the other face wash creams.</li>
    <li> My go to face cleaner. Almost all face cleansers have broken me out in the past but not this one. It took care of a lot of skin issues and was even great leaving on to sit and keep washing off and reapplying for tough white heads and build up around my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and isn&#x27;t too abrasive. It&#x27;s also incredibly inexpensive - I love it.</li>
    <li> When I use this scrub in the shower, it leaves my skin feeling cleaner than just using the water alone.</li>
    <li> One of the best facial scrubs out there. A little goes a long ways as this type seems to have more beads/sand pieces than the average face scrub. It&#x27;s a really good exfoliater for regular use.</li>
    <li> This scrub is one of my faves!! I really love this &amp;#34;blemish control&amp;#34; one better and prefer it to the original apricot scrub. I have semi-sensitive skin with occasional breakouts and this product keeps me feeling clean, moisturized (a  bit) and exfoliated. Typically I use this 4-5x a week and it is a nice balance for my skin. It says that the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; factor is high but I don&#x27;t really agree, it isn&#x27;t that rough on the skin mainly I think because it has so many creamy elements in it as well. I would definitely recommend it! One of my favorite face/body scrubs! (And I use a lot of high end products too, just as a reference).</li>
    <li> It took me years to find something I like, can use, and doesn&#x27;t smell like rubbing alcohol. This is one the the first products that actually works for my skin and helps keep it clean and wonderful. My girlfriend who has eczema, now uses it as all and she says it doesn&#x27;t dry her out or irritate her skin like other products. So give it a try and hopefully it works for you.</li>
    <li> I trust St. Ives a lot with my face. I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for years now. Paired with the green tea one they have as well. They both really have helped me with break outs and the green tea helps as well with calming the redness. I have extremely oily skin and break out often and St. Ives has really helped with my skin. Now if only the acne marks would go away faster, then I&#x27;d have a flawless face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget though, EVERY skin type is different and it&#x27;s not guaranteed that you will enjoy this product as much as I do. Thankfully it&#x27;s pretty cheap, so I do encourage you to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft and clean without drying it out but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the blackheads. I do like the strength of the scrub</li>
    <li> Expect this to dry out your skin. It&#x27;s and exfoliating scrub and works accordingly. Have moisterizer on hand and follow directions using 1x per week.</li>
    <li> Works great for Blackheads. Nice Scrub. A must have in your skin care arsenal!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite!! Love the scrub effect!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Great scrub while easy on the skin. Keeps face clear and soft. Can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
    <li> I needed a new scrub to help get rid of the tiny black heads on my nose and help shrink my pores. I was kind of skeptical at first, but after using it a few times I really like it. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, not the best, but it doesn&#x27;t stink. It&#x27;s gritty and I like it that way. I like my cleansers to get in there and get rid of the dry, dead skin. When I run out I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Ummmm.... I don&#x27;t love it but I don&#x27;t dislike it. The product itself is okay and the smell is fine, but it leaves my skin a bit dry and red, leaving me to have to moisturize again. It doesn&#x27;t really get rid of blackheads too well, but I spot some gone after scrubbing a while. Not bad, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again. Keep in mind that we all have different skin types though, so it might work like a miracle for others.</li>
    <li> This really works nicely on my acne prone skin.  Some people state to use it a few times a week but I use it just about everyday after I get home from the gym.  It gets the sweat off nicely and then I wash with Purpose Facial Wash for Acne skin.  We have purchased this about three times now and will again.</li>
    <li> Definitely exfoliates, but I think it exfoliates too much! I&#x27;ve read that apricot is very rigid and sharp, and that almond, sugar or salt scrubs are less abrasive. If you want to stay in the St Ives line there&#x27;s a tea tree scrub that is rated much less abrasive than this scrub and works wonderfully and smells amazing. I think they also have Grapefruit which I haven&#x27;t tried but is also rated gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have tough skin, this is probably OK for you to use. I have pretty sensitive skin and found that I could only use it occasionally, but knew it was pretty bad for me in terms of abrasiveness. Now that St Ives offers less abrasive scrubs I lean towards the Tea Tree.</li>
    <li> Works great, although works better for me with the use of 2 times a week. My non sensitive skin seems to have new pimples if I use this everyday. Would recommend to others which a great deal like this. Much cheaper than stores.</li>
    <li> This product has apricot shells. These shells create micro cuts on your skin causing you to break out even more. I do not recommend the apricot scrub. I do like St. Ive&#x27;s other products, but I do not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub.  Here&#x27;s how I use it: I apply on wet hands and massage into wet face making sure I get a good lather build up.  Then I use a facial brush to really scrub the dead skin off.  I have found that this second step does wonders and really helps with preventing acne.  If I go a day or two without this process, I can feel my face getting gross and acne start to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scrub; highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t break out bad so I can see Little results like how much my pores shrunk. And I use with clean and clear for oily skin cause make up is what causes my break outs. But this scrub is for black heads and shrinking pores. Works very well</li>
    <li> This is the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve used soo far.. It&#x27;s gritty enough but not too much.. And I love the fact that it contains salicylic acid!! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> It never came to me but i bought it from a store. It&#x27;s decent. I thought it helped with my breakouts cuz it did make my cheek look less red after using it. But i don&#x27;t know. Not using it anymore</li>
    <li> i wash my face with this everyday in the morning and i love it</li>
    <li> My skin: large-pored and acne prone as well as ultra sensitive and dry. I&#x27;m 16, so it isn&#x27;t very mature.&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up at my local Kroger for just under three bucks. Normally, I would have run screaming in the opposite direction of something that says in the description that &amp;#34;..excessive drying may occur..&amp;#34;, but I was in a hurry, liked the price, and was in dire need of something to rid my face of the ever-increasing blemishes, so I hadn&#x27;t read it. I was very cautious about using this once I returned home, but I gave it a whirl. I use as directed and ONLY use it on the acne patches on my face (the entire circumference into mid-cheek). After two days of using it 2-3 times a day, the bumpy acne has transformed into faded red spots and the discoloration from past acne is fading rapidly. Because it is incredibly drying, I apply coconut oil directly after use. This has been quite helpful, quick, and does what it says, but once my skin has cleared considerably, I will retire this product until I have another bad breakout. I would advise people with similar skin types to use this only as a spot treatment.</li>
    <li> I swapped my other brands of facial wash for this product (mainly because it&#x27;s much cheaper for the amount in the bottle) and it works well. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of apricot, but this product smells nice. It doesn&#x27;t have that medicinal or soapy scent like many other products do, which is a plus in my book. It also seems to work quite well on my face. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry and I have yet to notice a breakout from it. The only thing I could do without (and my reasoning for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5) is the mess made from the exfoliating grains in the product. Even with rinsing several times, the product leaves a grainy residue on my face and will make a mess in the shower/sink. Even so, it&#x27;s a good product. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as claiming that I absolutely love it and consider it a staple in my beauty/hygiene regimen, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> My first time trying this product last week, and it is seriously a life changer!! I can not believe the results that I have seen by using this for just a short time. I immediately see a difference and I cant believe how wonderful my face feels! I cant rave enough about this scrub, it is seriously amazing. I have always been skeptical as to what products I will use on my face. but this is definitely worth trying. You cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> Works better than proactive for me at least. Battleing white heads.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub for over twenty years now and my mother has been using it for even longer than that. I swear by this stuff! It always leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth, soft, and radiant. I also use it on my back and shoulders to prevent any acne breakouts from happening there too and I use it to scrub my elbows and any other dry areas because it’s an amazing exfoliant. It’s a pretty mild scrub so it’s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Made my pores larger and way more visible. I&#x27;m really hoping they shrink since I stopped using it, but so far they haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent way too much money and way too much time on other products but keep coming back to the classic Apricot Scrub. It&#x27;s cheap and works great. Leaves my skin feeling clean, clear and soft.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, cheap and does a great job, why does amazon require so many words to provide a review - annoying and this is my last time submitting a review for that reason</li>
    <li> My husband loves this face wash!  It is a scrub which helps with oil and keeping his face nice and clean every day!!</li>
    <li> Nice product - fresh scent, not TOO abrasive, seems to work well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several exfoliating scrubs over the years. Most of them significantly more expensive than St.Ives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is effective. The grains are large enough to clean out pores and exfoliate off dead skin. St. Ives also makes a sensitive skin formula, which is obviously gentler on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have oily skin and large pores. We love this scrub and use it daily. Nothing keeps pores cleaner, and the price simply cannot be beat. If you don&#x27;t have oily skin you probably only want to use this 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We order this through the Subscribe &amp; Save problem so that we never run out. We even buy the travel size tubes so we don&#x27;t get clogged pores when on trips.</li>
    <li> I like this face wash and use it twice a day. I have tried a lot of acne products and I am really impressed with this face wash. Actually the best face scrub that I have used and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have always used this scrub, I can&#x27;t remember how many time I would try other scrubs but I love that this one is 100% natural, so I always come back to it. It is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> I recently changed some medication, and broke out a little, I love the smell of this product, and it leaves my skin super duper soft!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it for Blackhead Control per se, I normally just get the Apricot Scrub but I couldn&#x27;t find it. I really don&#x27;t know the difference but it always leaves me feeling fresh and clean and helps to keep my pores clean. Great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good scrub. My face def felt cleaner and smoother after. Would buy again but switching over to all natural brands now</li>
    <li> my first choice for an exfoliant scrub is $18, so at that price I don&#x27;t buy it very often. St Ives is my second choice. I have tried many drugstore scrubs and most have scrub grit that is too small. Some you can barely feel the grit so how is it exfoliating?  St Ives has a texture you can feel and your face feels really clean after.</li>
    <li> Great scrub! I also like the tube better than the tub as it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth :) it does the job</li>
    <li> A very good exfoliator for the face.  Not too hard on the face.  Only use once a week in addition to a mild cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff about once a week. Does a good job for deep cleaning scrub. Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> wonderful face wash. I love the scrubbing beads. makes my face feel very nice. It&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
    <li> I found this easy to use in the shower and rinse off. I use this prior to a mask to keep my skin smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews by others saying that this really helps with sensitive skin. However, I found this made my breakouts even worse. The scent wasn&#x27;t bad, but I wanted something that would help control/prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best facial scrubs I have ever purchased. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Good ole St. Ives, they never fail. My face feels different and this has only been 3 days of use so far. Its softer, less oily and I&#x27;m in the mist of a break out now and they are going away faster than with my previous product.</li>
    <li> among different products I tried this one stands out. The quality of this product was the best for me. It has a very nice smell. I did rate only quality not the price.</li>
    <li> I love the scrub you get with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t tear into your skin, has enough beads to feel as though you&#x27;re getting some exfoliation, soft aroma of apricot, not &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; at all, and washes off clean.  Really quite nice.  The only drawback for me is that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as though the pores have been cleaned or opened.  On a steep price discount, I&#x27;d probably purchase again but never for full price.</li>
    <li> It helps to polish my leg skin. I use it one a month and it exfoliates better than any other scrubs I ever used before. And I used from both over the counter to natural expensive scrub products. this is still my Number #1 :)</li>
    <li> It has made my skin incredibly soft and helped me get rid of acne scars and prevent future acne</li>
    <li> I used to love St Ives and that they did not test on animals. They sold out recently to a big corporation called Unilever and now St Ives products are no longer cruelty free. if you don&#x27;t know what that means look up animal laboratory testing. It&#x27;s hideously cruel and unnecessary</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for over 20 years ... great stuff</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and will be 60 next week. I use this every day and love the way it makes my skin feel smooth. I would highly recommend but not for dry skin.</li>
    <li> once or twice a week and this stuff clears up blackheads and helps remove old skin which is reducing the appearance of acne scars. I use in combination with Dr woods black soap and deja vu daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used countless products many high end and I always end up going back to my st Ives</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. My skin looks more even, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like if I use this two days in a row, I end up with more acne than I had before. I&#x27;m not sure if others experience this, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying. Maybe the exfoliation beads are too rough for my skin? I&#x27;m not entirely sure that I have overall less acne than I had before I began using this scrub. It smells really strongly, too.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have blackheads around my nose and this has done a marvelous job of fighting them.&lt;br /&gt;Although I did purchase it specifically for its blackhead-eliminating reputation, I&#x27;ve been using it on my entire face and have noticeable results in pimple-prone areas.&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is that its not overly drying and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin:&lt;br /&gt;Very fair&lt;br /&gt;Combination&lt;br /&gt;Acne-prone</li>
    <li> Works as described, plenty of scrubbing particles.</li>
    <li> I developed rash after using the product, was disappointed I think my skin is very sensitive.  If you have sensitive skin do not use this product</li>
    <li> I really loved this product it...I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...love it....</li>
    <li> it is very helpful for exfoliating scrub and it has a good smell. i use this to clean my face twice a week</li>
    <li> I use this scrub as my only face wash. I have used it for about 5 years daily in the shower and it works great without leaving your face too dry.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Was looking for an add on item so that I could get free super saver shipping and ordered this. Product was as described. Have not started using it yet though.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; because pompholyx eczema has no definitive solution, but this gel help soften hands after blisters appear and skyn dries.&lt;br /&gt; unfortunately i cannot prove 100% it works or not until next full eczema attack. I read of this gel on the web and decide to buy in us and test it....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years, I LOVE IT! Exfoliates my skin and makes my face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, and it&#x27;s pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t use the plastic balls that are getting banned in NYC and other cities</li>
    <li> Do NOT use 1-3 times daily like it says to in the directions. While it makes my skin feel smooth and clear, I suddenly broke out all around my cheeks and chin and jawline area after about 4 days of use, and got really painful white bumps that got super red. I&#x27;ve never broken out like that before, just random pimples here and there, and the only thing that I did differently to my face was use this scrub. Some googling shows me that a LOT of people who used this daily had the same thing happen. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, mine is pretty oily actually, so I didn&#x27;t think I had to be cautious and just followed the directions. Don&#x27;t do what I did! I may keep it and use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scrub of all time. It&#x27;s inexpensive, not at all rough and doubles as a mask. As a 55-year-old, I still have some breakouts and I do believe this scrub helps to keep the breakouts to a minimum. When used as a mask, I end up with such soft, smooth skin. I use it a couple of times a week in the shower as a scrub then once a week as a mask. Loving the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the price-it&#x27;s usually more in a local drug store/CVS type of a place. Happy with the purchase, although my bottle of scrub did have a dent in it that won&#x27;t seem to come out-not a big deal as it didn&#x27;t affect the scrub, but it made the whole bottle lopsided a little bit. Not a deal breaker for something I use in the shower, but just a head&#x27;s up. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this stuff for years. Its really the most simple, scrubby face wash. Its perfect. The scrubbers are perfect sized, they never make our faces sting, and they keep our skin from breaking out with the salycilic acid</li>
    <li> I buy this for my 12 year old daughter for preventative measures since she is getting to that age.  I use the firming one myself for wrinkles and toning.  I have used St. Ives for decades and just love their products!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I use it daily for smooth skin.  The price is affordable and the results are immediate.  The formula is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
    <li> I didnt buy this here on Amazon, I actually got this at walmart and this stuff has been working great for my skin! Its like feeding your skin apricots! Its worked wonders for my face and I am almost acne free! It smells REALLY good and it used natural stuff to exfoliate your skin its 100% natural so its definitely good for your skin :)</li>
    <li> Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> Mild enough and good smell!  I apply it on whole body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years. It works really well and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face too dry or too greasy. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The BEST!!!!!!!! reasonable price and it works great!! Would recommend to both males and females. Leaves skin smooth and perfect.</li>
    <li> my teenage daughters luv this as they can have a lot of breakouts and blackheads sometimes. I tried it and didnt work for me though as i find it makes my dry matured skin even drier.</li>
    <li> After using this, you will feel that your skin is much softer than it was!&lt;br /&gt;I like it. But since there are some rumors that it will damage your face leaving you with big pores, I stopped using it on my face and used it only on my feet!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Greatly cleared up my skin and makes it super smooth. Definitely highly recommended. Don&#x27;t waste money on all those expensive products.</li>
    <li> I love the way this exfoliates my skin. My fiance even started using it! I havent used this product since the mid 90&#x27;s but now that I have used it again, I wont switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scrub and exfoliator! I loved the smell of it as well!</li>
    <li> Sufferer of acne forever.  Got tired of Proactiv&#x27;s price and tried this stuff instead.  It works just as well plus leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  I combine it with Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Radiant and then use my Clarisonic.  Skin has a healthy breakout free glow ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I have no cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend?:  YES</li>
    <li> I love apricot scrub and this product is the best. The price is also great on amazon. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this scrub... the consistency, the fragrance, and most importantly how it works.. the results.  I would defnitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this 2-4 times a week on my face, makes my face look bright and radiant, while I have little to no breakouts while using it</li>
    <li> The best face scrub I have ever used. I use this everyday for the past 4 years to keep my skin soft glowing and blemish free. Almost everyday I get told how beautiful my skin is! I do think a lot has to do with genetics my dad has great skin even at 56 only one wrinkle! Lol but I do think this scrub works .....my skin feels baby soft after and glowy couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I love this scrub!!! Nothing gets my face smoother than st Ives apricot scrub. I use it every other day to keep my face nice and smooth. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t burn my face. My only complaint is the scrub is a bit messy especially in the sink and can be a little more difficult to wash off but other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Came super fast in the mail and this is the body and face scrub above all face scrubs!!!! I swear by this!! Great quality!!</li>
    <li> OMG😍😍😍 ok I&#x27;m thirteen and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t thought the roof in the price aspect, yet still an affective product and this stuff is amazing!!! Saw results in no joke two and a half days  Also I have used the &amp;#34;equate beauty apricot scrub&amp;#34; too it works just as well. You can get it at Walmart for $1.97 i don&#x27;t think you can beat that</li>
    <li> It is a grear produciton. After I used it every time, I feel I refresh myself. So cheap for quality.</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing!  I used it for the first time over the weekend and you can see immediate results.  I have NEVER used a scrub on my face just cleansers.  This is my first attempt at it and I&#x27;m so impressed.  My skin was so refreshed and appeared to glow just from the first wash.</li>
    <li> I have never tried any St. Ives products before, but my friend said that they are quality products. So I decided to buy this scrub and I was shocked of how well this stuff works. I always used the Clinque 7 days scrub, and sometimes I would purchase some other high priced scrubs because I have such sensitive skin and I can break out so easily. So I only trust the expensive stuff. But I was realizing that I was sometimes breaking out using a scrub. This is the ONLY scrub that doesn&#x27;t make me break out! It gives me such a deep clean!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months now, 5 times a week. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I usually always have little break outs but I haven&#x27;t had any since I&#x27;ve used this product!</li>
    <li> Okay first off this smells sooooo good LBS. I have tried Clean &amp; Clear, Clearasil, Garnier, but when I discovered this I did not stop using it. I have been using this since I was a Sophomore in HS. Over 4 years later, I am still using it with nothing negative to say about it. Within the first 2 weeks you are going to tell the difference. Your face feels so deeply cleaned and light. It does exactly what it says. And you dont need much. Just a dime size amount goes a long way. A dab on the cheeks a dab on the nose,forehead,and chin, and I promise you will make it last for at least 3 months. I dont think I will ever switch my facial cleanser. EVER.</li>
    <li> Another favorite of mine- nice scent, just rough enough to be effective without scratching up your skin. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 14 yr. old granddaughter, and it does a great job controlling her blackheads and blemish situation.</li>
    <li> Not the product pictured.  You end up getting the orange bottle.  I contacted St. Ives directly and they stopped selling the blue bottle over a year ago.  This seller should really update their website.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me a few years back and I&#x27;ve been using it and loving it ever since. Makes me feel super clean after use.</li>
    <li> I love this facial scrub, and this is a great price.  It makes my skin feel so smooth and eliminates blackheads.</li>
    <li> A really good scrub.  I&#x27;m a fan of this one because of the scent.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s also not completely hidden.  It&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the stuff works too.  A couple days and it is clear that it is making a difference.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> The scrubbing beads in this product are really bad for your skin. My skin has cleared up considerably since I switched to CeraVe facial clenser.</li>
    <li> Love it and smells good. I have sensitive skin and this works fine. Not oily doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> Works well and keeps the face clear!</li>
    <li> I live for my st. Ives blemish &amp; blackhead scrub if your face seems dull and dry and you may have a pimple here and there and you scrub with st. Ives 2 times a week you will see immediate improvement it really works I love this product I go nowhere with out it.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I have tried other facial cleansers to clear AND prevent pimples or example, Neutrogena Deep Clean  Cream Cleanser but all it did was give me more pimples and a burning sensation with every use. I decided to try this facial scrub  because a friend recommended it, I had an apricot scrub in the past with good results and all the positive reviews on here. I have to say this product WORKS! My face is a fresh,smooth and clear as a baby&#x27;s. My skins is RADIANT, my complexion looks a whole lot better than it did before I started using it. Within the first week of using it, I noticed very positive change in my skin, I&#x27;ve been using it for about about a month now and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw a pimple on my face, even during my monthly cycle. I am not the type to write reviews often but I just had to for this product. It is absolutely AMAZING. It&#x27;s worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> 5 Stars,love love it. Tried so many cleanse from cheapest to most expensive &amp; this is the only one removes blackheads in my nose &amp; clears my pores &amp; soften my face.  For me it&#x27;s  the best cleanser &amp; its cheap.</li>
    <li> It worked, until I figured out that it was the root cause of my lips itching in the morning. I&#x27;m allergic to lanolin, and this product has it.</li>
    <li> Great price and great scrub. My skin always looks really nice after I use it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very famous scrub that I&#x27;ve seen many beauty gurus talk about on Instagram and YouTube. I&#x27;ve been using the apricot scrub for years now and I have never thought about using a different scrub. I use it in the shower because your skin is soft and the pores are open in the steam so it&#x27;s easier to clean the dirt off. You don&#x27;t want to rub your face too hard because it stretches skin and the skin on your face is extra sensitive. This scrub isn&#x27;t too creamy like some other I have seen so I love that. It leaves the skin soft &amp; smooth and clear! I love this and swear by this product so buy it people!</li>
    <li> Cleans VERY well. Blackhead control works unbelievably well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years. I like it because it contains Salicylic Acid, as the active ingredient, and it&#x27;s great for breakout all over your body, not just your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently begun using it all over my body. On my upper arms I always had these small bumps of dry, red, \\&quot;chicken\\&quot; skin. I scrub this on my arms every time I take a shower and the bumps have completely disappeared. So great to have smooth baby skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used to break out on (how do I put this delicately...) my bottom, behind my thighs and sometimes on my bikini line (I know, disgusting, but I have fair, oily skin). Since I begun scrubbing all over those areas too, I have smooth, break-out free skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it in the shower on my legs, right before I shave. Give your legs a good scrub and you will not believe the smoothness after you shave. The blade runs so smoothly. Better than shaving cream and it also took care of the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; red bumps I used to get. Your legs will also feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is amazing and every time I&#x27;m in the store I purchase it because I like to keep in on hand.</li>
    <li> I have used this scrub for a while now. I have noticed that when I do run out of the product i break out. This scrub does a good job clearing oils from my face.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing, i haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. i have oily skin and it dries it up and i feel lke it makes my face so smooth. i usually mix it with another blemish cream</li>
    <li> Apricot scrub is coarse, like their other products. I did not find it to be irritating to my skin. I use it in rotation with other skin products. Does what is supposed.</li>
    <li> It gave me a clean feeling. But left my skin feeling a little dry and tight. Nothing that some moisturizer can&#x27;t handle. All in all a great product for  maintenance of clean and healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Of all the facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried over the years, this one has worked the best without over-drying my skin. I&#x27;ve used this or one of its store brand knock-offs for the past 3 years, after rotating through several brands that either didn&#x27;t work against acne or would over-dry my skin. My face feels much fresher, clearer, and lighter after using it, the scrub feels like it really exfoliates your skin without being abrasive at all. This product has salicylic acid, but doesn&#x27;t cause the problems other acne cleansers has when you use or overuse them. And even at stores, this scrub is usually priced really well. I REALLY recommend it for light to moderate acne or as a facial scrub. I even use it on my arms sometimes.</li>
    <li> such good reviews all over this product but unfortunately for me its a one star out of 5. seems to work well for others but its just not doing any changes for the better but only for the worse. my skin is breaking out with pimples more then ever now and i hate wasting money on these products with great reviews but do nothing for me. owell guess il have to waste more money and try other products until i find the solution.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful, it&#x27;s all natural, and there&#x27;s no damage to the skin for using daily like most scrubs and exfoliaters.</li>
    <li> Loooove this scrub. Use it all the time. It&#x27;s a shower time necessity!</li>
    <li> i use it about twice a week and it removes dead skin cells completely. before i use it in the shower i clean my skin with a cotton pad and alcohol.  afterward i follow up with a salycilic acid hydrator mixed with cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Works okay, smells great and leaves skin soft. It&#x27;s not the best considering it takes longer than other acne creams, but it&#x27;s natural and smells AMAZING so overall great product. I would definately recommend it(:</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it to wash my face every morning and night.  The paste has decent sized scrubbing particles to get dirt off your face, but as long as you don&#x27;t press too hard with your hands/washcloth, it shouldn&#x27;t be too abrasive for your skin.  After using it, my face feels shiny and smooth.  Make sure to apply facial lotion after cleaning your face though, to avoid drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also came with a sample of St. Ives Skin Renewing Collagen Elastin Body Lotion.  That stuff smelled funky, and I did not like it very much.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash and smells great. The granular cream makes me feel like the bursting bubbles face type of face wash. The shipping was very fast and the tube is quite big should last for several face washes.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub on my night time cleaning regiment.  I have very oily skin and acne prone.  After using this scrub, I don&#x27;t have as much break outs as before,  I have noticed that my skin is smooth and not as oily in the morning.  I do not use a moisturizer after the scrub and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my skin, removes the oil and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t overdo it, this scrub is definitely scrubby!</li>
    <li> can not believe that this was cheaper than buying locally! I love this stuff it makes your face feel so clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Same great product I&#x27;ve used for years with the benefit of acne control ingredients.  I scrub *very* gently when using this for great results without irritation.</li>
    <li> ITS JUST GREATTTTT!!!!!!AND SMELLS SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great.  Keeps black heads under control.  I have sensitive skin, so I use only twice a week.  Skin feels really soft and smooth after use.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives apricot face scrub for past 8 years and I never found it being worse than other more expensive drug store face scrubs. I&#x27;d say this scrub is better than other big brand babies. The scent is very pleasant, and the scrub does not irritate the skin nor breaks it out. I have used a LOT of different brands and types and I experienced variety of side effects like super dry skin, more pimples and irritation. This scrub cleanses your face squeaky clean, it clears acne and leaves your face SO refreshed and soft! Cheaper than all other scrubs in the drug stores yet more effective than all of them combined! I also like the green tea scrub by this same brand. So try it out as well.</li>
    <li> I choose a birth control that works well but gives me acne I tried just soap,clean and clear,microdermabrasion,proactive you name it I tried it I heard this apricot scrub worked well and it does my face is clear of acne just wash once a day and it does the job!</li>
    <li> Used to use the sensitive skin one but really wasn&#x27;t abrasive enough to do what I wanted. This one is much better!</li>
    <li> I have got expered item. I check on webseit [...]&lt;br /&gt;code on scrub is 05093JB47&lt;br /&gt;Date of manufacture:&lt;br /&gt;25 of May, 2010&lt;br /&gt;General shelf life: 36 months&lt;br /&gt;bad It looks like your product was manufactured more than 3 years ago</li>
    <li> i use it on daily basis. St. Lves crubl is a great addition to the regular face washer that i use twice a day. it provides fresh sense everyday</li>
    <li> I know so many people that LOVE this!  My husband&#x27;s one of them.  Works really well and keeps your skin soft.  Just don&#x27;t scrub too hard.  It may have the reverse effect and scratch up your skin on your face.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff---it feels very refreshing in the morning. The scrub itself has a nice exfoliating effect, smells pretty neutral.</li>
    <li> Works just as described....keeps acne breakouts at bay and helps to reduce oily skin.  Perfect for a gentle weekly (or daily) exfoliating scrub.</li>
    <li> Gets me clean all over.</li>
    <li> I love this. I found that with gentle exfoliation, I don&#x27;t break out as much. I&#x27;ve happily used this for years!</li>
    <li> i do not recommend this for daily use as it is very rough on your skin, also i dont know how much its really doing for my black heads, i haven really noticed a difference in the few months ive been using it. the smell is pleasant but it feels like im kind of scratching my face every time i use it. i feel like it dries my skin out more as well. it might work great for other people but i guess i have too sensitive of skin for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my only facial cleaner for over 15 years and I still have great skin. I need to use moisturizer when I wash with this but it is not as drying as many of the cleansers out there.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!  Great exfoliater to keep skin fresh and clean.  After using this product my skin is so much softer and brighter.  I use this product at least once per week.  I especially love the Salicylic Acid in this product.  I&#x27;ve used this scrub with the Salicylic Acid and without.  Both are great, but I do like this one better.  I especially like to use this product if I&#x27;ve forgotten to take my makup off the night before.  I will use this in the morning to get a good deep clean and exfoliate.  Great product.  I also love using this product before I use a self tanner.  Self tanner will go on so much smoother and you will acheive a much nicer and even tan after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different brands of scrubs.  This one does a great job for a fraction of the price.  Other scrubs tend to have smaller scrubbing particles which may be a little easier on your skin.  This product is very course and gritty with larger particles.  I just scrub a little lighter and in a circular motion.  But for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use a scrub and who isn&#x27;t sensitive to the Salicylic Acid.  My husband uses the original with out the acid and I use this one.  Both are fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product,  I&#x27;m pimple free since trying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of facial cleansers, organic, natural, etc.  And this product is by far the most effective one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I used to only use Proactiv solution, but always ran out of facial soap first.  I&#x27;ve found this not only to be a fine substitute, but I actually prefer it to the Practiv soap!  Makes my facial skin soft, smooth, and happy!</li>
    <li> I liked this scrub.  I used it and it made my skin feel so soft.  It did not dry me out.  I am not sure how well it works on blemishes and blackheads yet.  I liked the way it made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Love this product even though skincare gurus say it&#x27;s bad for your skin. It&#x27;s been working for me for all these years!</li>
    <li> Helps to clear blemishes resulting from spots. Have been using this product for the last 20 years. Also helps to clear pores and evens out skin leaving smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for around a year now, so here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is pretty gentle, so if you have sensitive skin, this is a good fit.  The scrub is basically a cream with beads spread throughout, so it feels really gentle on the skin.  The cream foams up a little bit and feels cool on the skin.  It&#x27;s easy to wash off--just splash some water on your face.  For me, my skin feels a little bit dry after using it, so I follow up with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub claims to control blemishes and blackheads, but I found it didn&#x27;t really help with these problems.  I get acne around my chin, but this didn&#x27;t reduce it.  I also have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin, but alas, they still linger after using this scrub...I use a mask to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to really exfoliate off dead skin cells without feeling too harsh though, and my skin feels clean, clear, and soft after I use it.  That&#x27;s good enough for em, since I&#x27;m cheap and don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on skincare products.  I use this scrub 3-4 times a week (as indicated on the bottle) in conjunction with Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser and Freeman masks.  The result...an almost blemish free face with minimal imperfections, aside from that big thing in the middle of my face which most people call a nose. ;)</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives. I have misguidedly tried many other generics, and they are just not the same. This leaves my face soft and not oily. It&#x27;s also not rough on my screen that it over dries it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week, and I see a difference in my skin. I use it every other day and continue to use my normal routine for my face otherwise. It has diminished my pores and leaves my skin soft and nice. Got some for my daughter too, and she is having the same results. Will definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product. I don&#x27;t like most exfoliating products, but I have always enjoyed this one. The grains or particles that exfoliate are plentiful and the scent smells fresh and natural. Out of the numerous products out there, I feel this one is more natural and quite effective with dead skin and blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have used many different scrubs over the years and this is by far the best scrub I have used.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and free of dirt, oil and make up.  A small amount goes a long way and it&#x27;s very affordable for everyday use.  I have combination skin and this scrub left my skin feeling clean and fresh.  I love it and will be back to buy again!</li>
    <li> LOVE that this scrub doesn&#x27;t have those environmentally hazardous micro-beads in it.</li>
    <li> great product, I always use it</li>
    <li> For such an inexpensive product, it really gets the job done. I love the walnut shells because other exfoliating scrubs use the plastic beads that are too wimpy to exfoliate anything or get deep into your pores.When you scrub your face with this you can really feel it working. The scrubbing will exfoliate your hands as well as your face leaving both super soft. The walnut shells are not too harsh. I scrub quite roughly and it does not irritate my skin. If your  skin is more sensitive you can simply scrub gently or use it less frequently. I do not think it does much for my blackheads because they are too deep, but it is the best exfoliating scrub I have used.I&#x27;ve tried dozens of expensive exfoliating products and this is the only one where I feel the dead layers of my skin are removed and all that is left is the soft new skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this facewash for years-it is a great price and abrasive enough to clear your face of dried, dead skin and blackheads. I used to scrub my face with this, and the use a regular facewash, but this is product is good enough to use on its own.</li>
    <li> Use this daily and have for months now. I have combination skin and this is an excellent face wash for that. I&#x27;m ordering it on subscribe and save and you can&#x27;t beat it.  This is better than a lot of the higher prices face scrubs I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my face in the past few months and will continue to order this. One tube lasts at least a month or two. Such a great value!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since I was a freshman in high school. I used it once a day as a teenager and it really did help with my breakouts. It looks and feels really natural. I would call it my holy grail scrub! I get rashes on my arms easily and use this scrub on my arms sometimes and it helps them too. Nowadays I use this scrub once a week. It keeps breakouts to a minimum and smooths and brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using these for almost 2 years, and I have seen lots of improvements on my skin. Thanks St. Ives!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub for years. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and didn&#x27;t bring my skin care arsenal. A couple months went by and I noticed my skin starting to break out and have patches of dry skin. I immediately purchased a tube of St. Ive&#x27;s and within a couple of weeks my skin was clear and soft again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It exfoliates wonderfully and leaves your skin feeling soft immediately after you use it. I sometimes put it on a natural sponge to get an even greater exfoliating effect (when my skin is really dry) and I&#x27;m never disappointed! It makes my makeup go on flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended my boyfriend use it since he gets breakouts occasionally and he has completely ditched his skin care products for this as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts me at least 4 months, so at this price it&#x27;s an absolute steal. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> does the job really well and smells good! it has a rough gritty feel to it that really helps eliminate blackheads. left my skin feeling smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this because two people I knew had this product and it made my face feel AMAZING. I think it does an awesome job cleaning dirt and oil but in reality it didn&#x27;t affect ANY of my blackheads - nose, cheeks, chin and forehead - but has kept my breakouts under control. So in conclusion its great for fresh clean feeling but shouldn&#x27;t be used for &amp;#34;blackhead control&amp;#34; or pore minimizer.</li>
    <li> Seems to work good for exfoliating dead cells and not too drying if use 2-3 x week. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but it feels like you are rubbing sand into your face.  Leaves a noticeable residue in the sink after rinsing off.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and it seems to work better than other products.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 bottles, this is really great stuff especially for the price.  The ingredients are essential, Salicylic Acid is in all of the expensive acne cleansers and will only help if you use it as regularly as possible.  You have to keep using it forever or else it will come back, so a cheap product is awesome.  I love the natural apricot scrubbers in this, I feel like it makes a real difference.</li>
    <li> Using it right now and it gets the job done. I&#x27;m really happy with the product and so is my skin. :)</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone because it does not work!&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and I have not had any improvements at all.</li>
    <li> This is not what I am looking for</li>
    <li> i love using this product</li>
    <li> Use on feet, not face!</li>
    <li> I must say I have never been so anxious to write a review on a product before but I must start out by saying after just a few uses I have seen and felt the results on my skin. I have always had acne since I was 12 years old and I am now 30. I learned to just accept it and find products that help control it. I purchased a sample of this product from Target for .97 cents and shortly after I purchased the entire tube for a little over 3 dollars. I notice an immediate difference in my skin after 3 days of use. My skin is more clear and soft as it ever has been. I have not been using my dark spot corrector because I don&#x27;t want to overuse products with certain chemicals in it. The Blemish Control Apricot mask smells wonderful and it is very gentle on my skin. I love it! I&#x27;ve never had a product with such fast results. I would certainly recommend this to those who want a gentle scrub depending on the sensitivity of your skin that can be used every day. How I use this product is I first wash my face with a gentle cleanser than I add the scrub afterwards while my face is wet, I actually leave it on my skin once I have rubbed it in for about 15-20  mins and rinse it off and add my moisturizer I think this is great to use in the summer or winter.</li>
    <li> i use to use this a lot n it kept my face pretty clear. My skin was never flawless or perfect but it did a good job keeping pimples off. I ordered proactiv b/c i wanted to have PERFECT skin like in the proactiv commercials. big mistake, proactiv made my breakouts worse than they had ever been before. i used a ton of products after to try n make my breakouts out and nothing worked. I bought this scrub again n my face began clearing up again. again it doesnt give you perfect skin but it&#x27;s really good for the price. at most i usually only have about 2-3 zits on my face at a time.</li>
    <li> Great for scrubbing dry skin off. It also helps any pimples that pop up and clear away excess oil. I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> Its very useful to clean my face</li>
    <li> This scrub has changed over the years and it&#x27;s a little more harsh now than it was years ago with that being said scrubs in general are not very good for sensitive skin and they can irritate skin problems causing redness and peeling IF using more than ONCE A WEEK. This is an ok scrub if you ONLY use it once per week and only use a LITTLE product at a time, a little goes a long way and a bottle can last a year or more if you use it sparingly. If you want something more gentle try a little baking soda and a baby washcloth to exfoliate and wash your face with dove UNSCENTED beauty bar, this is what my dermatologist recommends and it has worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice exfoliator, makes your skin feel smooth. BUT I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin because when I used it three times in a row, it broke me out. Now I&#x27;m using it once a week and I&#x27;m very gentle in the process. I&#x27;m fine with this scrub.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove black/whiteheads, and no other scrub will be able to remove them too, because they SIT IN THE SKIN. It helps to PREVENT APPEARING them for a time, but doesn&#x27;t make them disappear.</li>
    <li> It works alright. Personally, the walmart brand blackhead scrub does work a lot better for my face and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three days and I&#x27;m already feeling the effect. My face feel softer. I&#x27;ve. Used alot of product but this is the best so far</li>
    <li> One, it&#x27;s easy and fun to use. Two, it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and three, it works. I&#x27;ve only had this for a week now, and I just want to stock up on it so I never run out!! Wow, it makes your face feel so clean, and paired with other skin products, clears my face completely! It&#x27;s simple and it isn&#x27;t harsh or damaging to the skin, and it&#x27;s nicely packaged in the bottle! &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from Amazon, got it for free at CVS because of Extrabucks. I use this or the Green Tea Scrub every morning and have had no problems. Just be sure to moisterize your skin, because it may dry your skin out. I have normal skin, but do suffer from blemishes and the ocassional pimple or two on my nose. This has really helped my skin to feel clean before I put on my makeup and has done a great job of getting rid of the blemishes. For the price, you really can&#x27;t get much better. Great bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clear out my black heads. I had very little acne before using this but after 2 weeks of daily use my face is completely broken out. It has not helped in the least with my black heads. I have tried TONES of products for clearing my face and this is the worst one that I have tried. It is cheap for a reason. I stupidly bought 2 bottles of this because of the great reviews (one for at my apt and 1 for when I am at my parents house). I urge you to NOT waste your $$$ on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying several products and thought st.ives was a simple, effective product, but it wont help my blackheads or acne. it helps a little, my skin always feels soft, its gentle on my skin, but it just doesnt do anything for me. i decided to go with X out and see if something stronger will help</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to use as a preventative maintenance cleanser. It&#x27;s extremely exfoliating, so if you have current acne, it&#x27;s most likely way too harsh and probably not going to help. However, if you&#x27;ve got your acne under control, this is great at sloughing off dead skin cells, dirt and oil to prevent future breakouts and even fade post acne marks. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fast  shipping and excellent product&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference after the first use:it removes all the dirt and blacheads, my face is cleanner than when I use other facial cleansesrs&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have always had very sensitive skin, but this is one of only two products I&#x27;ve found I can use without irritation.  (The other being Purpose Face Wash.)  This scrub has a great smell, isn&#x27;t too rough, and washes away easily.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face and around my neck it it smells great and gets rid of greasy feeling to the skin. I even see pimples reduce faster than normal (than if I used commercial products). This product is designed to treat skin and it does just that. Love the apricot smell to it!</li>
    <li> Started using this alternating between 3-4 times a week (as directed by the back of the tube) and seemingly got some results. Didn&#x27;t really prevent blackheads, but helped stop random red blemishes from appearing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks of 3/4 uses per week it started to irritate my skin due to what I assume was over-exfoliation, and the results didn&#x27;t seem that great anymore.</li>
    <li> I use every other night on my face, and I have bad acne, and it makes my pores smaller, face brighter, and acne less red, smaller, and less noticeable. Defiantly only use ever other day though because it drys your skin out if you use it too much.</li>
    <li> IMMA GIVE THIS PRODUCT A BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT 4 TO 5 WEEKS TO SEE FACIAL WASHES/ SCRUBS EFFECTS, YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR SKIN TIME TO ADAPT, SO FAR, BEEN USING FOR A WEEK, BLACK HEADS???? EHHHH... NOT GOING AWAY, SOMETIMES THEY ACTUALLY LOOK WORST, GIVING IT ITS TIME THOUGH, IT IS A VERY GOOD EXFOLIATION IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SMOOTH, USE IT 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK, IF USING IT MORE, BUY A LOTION TO HELP PREVENT PIMPLES, BECAUSE TO MUCH EXFOLIATION  WILL CAUSE BREAK OUTS, POINT BLANKS, BECAUSE IT OPENS THE PORES AND THE BACTERIA SPREADS IF YOU DONT HAVE SOMETHING TO PREVENT IT, MY RECOMMEND LOTIONS. TEA TREA OIL SKIN CLEARING LOTION, FROM BATH AND BODY WORKS. WILL REVIEW AGAIN IN ABOUT A MONTH, AND LET YOU GUYS KNOW THE PROGERESS OF MY BLACK HEADS! HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE PRACTICALLY GONE!</li>
    <li> Started using this when I was 14 years old. 22 now and still loyal to this. I feel like this thoroughly cleanses my skin like nothing else. I get cranky if I have to crash at someone else&#x27;s house and can&#x27;t use this in the morning (I use it twice a day, morning and just before bed). I&#x27;ve bought travel sizes of this stuff to carry around just in case. I&#x27;m Asian and have I think combination skin, quite oily around the T-zone. When I first started using it, I broke out a tiny bit just because the salicylic acid was doing the initial cleaning, but smooth sailing afterwards. Managed to not have a lot of breakouts through the awkward years and it&#x27;s still doing me good. Love the smell, even though the formula changed slightly in those years. When I used to only use powder, eyeliner, and eyeshadow on my face, this alone was enough to remove all my makeup, but now that I&#x27;m using BB cream or foundation, I use jojoba oil to remove makeup first and follow it with this. I highly recommend this product. When I was a teen, my friends were shelling out tons of money for Proactiv or Clinique or Lancome or Biotherm, you name it, prescription medications, etc, but I just used this and had less breakouts than a lot of them. According to genetics, I should have had a lot of breakouts during my teens, so you can&#x27;t necessarily say that it was genetics. A few of my friends who used St. Ives made it through their teens without breaking out much, too. Give it a shot! It&#x27;s &amp;#60;$4 very well spent.</li>
    <li> St. Ives is awesome.  It works and it&#x27;s cheap. What the heck!?  My son, who has eczema uses this product as well and it does not irritate his eczema at all.  In fact, he uses a lot of the St. Ives products and does very well with them.  Like the oatmeal bath wash -- awesome for him.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my favorite facial products.  I have very oily skin and feel the need to exfoliate often, this is where the product comes in handy.  Even with my daily facial regimen it works well, doesn&#x27;t scratch or over dry.  Can&#x27;t comment much on the effects of controlling blackheads as I have other products that I&#x27;ve been using to aid in that.  Will be adding this to Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to have it delivered to my door regularly as to have it on hand.  It&#x27;s sold locally at a big box store but there it always seems to be out of stock and with the Amazon program I&#x27;m saving time and money by having it conveniently delivered to my mailbox.  Definitely recommend this product from St. Ives.</li>
    <li> If you want to look younger then exfoliate several times a week with this stuff. It really works great for keeping your skin smooth and flawless. Just be sure to be extra gentle when using it on your face..</li>
    <li> It works good, but it&#x27;s hard on your face and doesn&#x27;t smell good.😒</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product today at Walgreens, and I got to say.. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Just like other customers&#x27; reviews said, it leaves your skin feeling hydrated and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The only con about this is the fact it is has this gritty substance that can be irritating for some skin types.&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin, but this scrub does not irritate it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely fond of it, and it seems like my skin is already beginning to clear up!</li>
    <li> The scrub seems way to harsh.  I don&#x27;t think my skin needs to be scrubbed in this way and is probably bad over time.  I stopped after researching a bit; kind of confirmed my concerns.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this scrub in the shower and have for many, many years.  My face always feels clean and refreshed after use.  Love the smell, and a tube can last a long time since you need just a small amount.  Great price here and love that I can use S&amp;S to purchase!</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager, 14, I tried this product and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin except make it feel soft, but it didn&#x27;t actually clear up any of my acne. Here I am 6-7 years later and it&#x27;s helped keep blemishes at bay...for the most part. I get a couple, but I&#x27;m not breaking out as frequently. When looking for a product, gauge and note what kind of skin you have. That&#x27;ll help a lot. Just turns out for me, that my skin didn&#x27;t like this product as a teenager but cooperates with it as an adult. Try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Also be ritual with it. I scrub every morning and night, no matter what. Also keeping my hair out of my face has helped.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different face washes over the years and none of them even come close to this one. I have relatively frequent breakouts and a constant issue with blackheads. Other products might help reduce existing pimples, but will leave my face feeling dry and/or was not effective in preventing further breakouts. There are a lot of products that say they will get rid of blackheads, but I&#x27;ve never found them to be very effective. I bought this product on a whim because I was (as usual) looking for a new face wash. I know St. Ives makes good products, but usually they are pretty expensive and I&#x27;m young and on a budget. When I saw how cheap it was on Amazon, I had to try it. After a few days of using this scrub, my acne cleared up and I saw a noticeable reduction of my blackheads. My skin in general just feels healthy and smooth. The scrub has beads in it to help exfoliate deep down while still being gentle on your skin. I have no issues with my skin getting dry, even with the cold weather and snow. I&#x27;ve had no issues with this product whatsoever! I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and thrilled with the noticeable results. I think I have FINALLY found my forever face wash! I wish I would have started using this face wash years ago, I could have save so much time, stress and money. I would recommend this product to anyone, no matter your skin type.</li>
    <li> I have used st ives apricot scrub since I was a teen, and it easily became a beauty must in my make up bag. It cleans well, removes dead skin makes my skin feel soft and takes away tiny blackheads from my nose. It is not for everyone though, if you have sensitive skin, it may be too harsh for daily use. Its still a great product.</li>
    <li> When my skin has been overwhelmed by humidity or falling asleep with a face full of make-up, St. Ives Blemish and Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub is just the ticket. The price is definitely right, and the effectiveness of this product is legendary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Have always loved this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and works well on combination skin I bet it would work on any skin type thanks</li>
    <li> the smell is great and it really works to prevent blackheads from forming. I use it twice a week and i can visible see the difference when i dont!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really feel clean after using and it takes off all makeup in addition.&lt;br /&gt;It works deep into the skin unlike some of the other products out there</li>
    <li> I have few pimples and black heads. Florida has bipolar weather which would mean acne pop up too. But ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product my face has been cleared and renewed 90%and let me add that I have oily skin too. So try it because it&#x27;s cheap yet miraculous for that price.</li>
    <li> St. Ives is good. I needed a new scrub and remember liking this brand long ago. Can&#x27;t say it &amp;#34;controls&amp;#34; blemishes or blackheads (then again, not too many will), but it does at least clean the face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years and love it. It makes my skin feel soft, takes off my makeup, and the gritty texture is one that is not harsh. I won&#x27;t use any other facial scrub--this keeps my face clear and my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> I am unfortunately prone to blackheads. This is what I use to get rid of them and also to prevent them from cropping up. I use it in my morning shower and at night after I take my makeup off. I love the fruity smell and the way my skin feels afterwards - tingly and smooth. Great for exfoliation as well. Don&#x27;t bother with generic brands (like I did) - they just don&#x27;t work as well as this does.</li>
    <li> after used it, my face is so smooth, and the skin look like crystal</li>
    <li> Forget about all of the crazy prices on the name brand cleaners, this will do the same thing at a fraction of the price. Active ingedent is the same as the high dollar brands!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I really prefer the apricot seeds as an exfolliant rather than the plastic stuff they use in other products. It has a nice smell when you use it, but it doesnt linger after you&#x27;ve washed it off.</li>
    <li> Much better than i thought given it is so cheap! I use it every other day, like the smell and the natural ingredient of it. Definitely will buy more St. Ives product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it everyday. I used to buy the equate version, but the pieces in it are too big and sharp. This controls the pimples better and my face isn&#x27;t as oily as it used to be.</li>
    <li> We love this product. It makes our skin so smooth, gets rid of blackheads and keeps our skin feeling very clean. We use it every night when showering. Then we use nice moisturizer and our skin has always been very healthy doing this. Even our 10 year old daughter uses it as she had some face acne and this cleared it up.</li>
    <li> Love the price and the add on I just recently started using this product and I love it one of the best I&#x27;ve used and I won&#x27;t go back to regular</li>
    <li> love it and hate it. Cant use it consecutively in a row during the week. it does make the skin look better and takes out all the junk. but makes it dry too. I have a very oily skin and mine gets really dried after 20 mins of washing this off. I am happy with the clearsil scrub that is not very abrasive as this so I use it everyday. still, I do like this. I am a male , 29 .</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for about 15 years (ever since I was a pre-teen) and recommend it to everyone with oily/combo or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is coarse enough to really scrub your face but not too coarse in that you get red scratches everywhere. The stuff really isn&#x27;t sharp, they must tumble the ground up seeds or something because it feels really good. I love it and find it keeps my skin, which seems to shed like a lizard every single day, from being a mess. I use it on my elbows and other places I want exfoliated as well with the same success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since moving in my boyfriend has been using it also and loves it. He has facial hair so he only uses it in the shower (since it is a little more difficult to rinse out of body hair) but it seems to work well for his combo/acne prone skin. I&#x27;ll use it at the sink sometimes but generally it&#x27;s part of my showering as well since the ground up bits of apricot seed can be annoying to get off of your skin without a constant stream of water. You can use this daily if your skin is not super sensitive but I find it better used as a &#x27;once in a while&#x27; thing not &#x27;all the time&#x27; as a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it a lot I&#x27;d suggest the oatmeal one since it seems to be a much finer grain and is much less abrasive along with the bonus of moisturizers. (Boyfriend likes it and uses that one on days he feels like a gentle scrubbing with moisturizing help)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like the original apricot more and so use this in the shower once/twice a week then as a daily (or multi-daily) cleanser I use the foaming cetaphil facial wash along with one of those round cellulose sponges to &#x27;gently buff and scrub&#x27; my face clean. I have super oily skin and the cetaphil is probably my best friend when it comes to keeping it in check but, as I said, have skin that sheds a lot so that&#x27;s what the apricot scrub keeps in check. Overall, must have and will continue to buy it until I drop.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product only for a few days and have already seen a huge difference. The area around my nose is really prone to flaking and dead skin build up, and this has helped tremendously. It makes my entire face feel smooth and soft without drying it out. I have also noticed a difference with discoloration and redness that I have dealt with for years! I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub since it was introduced back in the mid-1970&#x27;s and it&#x27;s a fantastic product!!  I always get the &#x27;Blemish Control&#x27; version, not because I have acne anymore (I&#x27;m nearly 60), but because the coarseness of the scrub removes all the dead skin and leaves my face glowing with fresh, smooth skin.  People who meet me for the first time can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m even over 40.  Ok, that&#x27;s part genetics, but I also give credit to this wonderful face scrub and my Jergens lotion.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this scrub. It smells great, has nice large scrubby kernels and also leaves the skin moisturised. Pbably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skins as it is rathher abrasive but that&#x27;s how I like my scrubs!</li>
    <li> I am using twice a week and my skin has a more even tone and my pores&lt;br /&gt; do seem smaller.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; makes my face feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I am a guy who has been using Pro Active and several other expensive products since I was a teenage...Yikes, that&#x27;s over 10 years now! My Wife convinced me to at least give the St. Ives product a try so I did. As usual, I got a pimple or two while switching to the new product but my face is now clearer than ever. What I also noticed about other brands is that if I stopped using them for a couple days (ie: road trip, business travel, etc.) I would be ridden with Acne for weeks as a punishment! Now with the St. Ives I don&#x27;t get that same reaction, I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry flaky skin, and its at a fraction of the cost. If this review was helpful, please give me a thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for around 5 months now, and I was disappointed that it did pretty much nothing to remove my blackheads from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Although, I found that it does do an excellent job for counteracting pimples that appear on my face. I use this to wash my face 3 times a week as directed, and it prevents the pimple from getting all disgusting on my face, I haven&#x27;t had a bad pimple since I started using this actually which makes me reaaally happy.&lt;br /&gt;At first I had a few breakouts when I started using this, I did some research and discovered that apparently using an exfoliator during the first few weeks you&#x27;ll have breakouts, I&#x27;m not sure how true that is (the internet isn&#x27;t the most reliable information source at times) but the breakouts have since ceased, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues regarding that since those first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason why I&#x27;m disappointed with this is the total lack of anything happening to my blackheads at all. I bought it mostly to help get rid of blackheads without having to drop tons of money I don&#x27;t have, and alas, my blackheads are still here and haven&#x27;t changed for better or worse in five months. I also noticed that this is kind of drying for me in spots, it dries out the sides of my nostrils and the skin between my eyebrows, making them flakey. This is with the directed weekly usage as well, and that&#x27;s always annoying because dry skin can actually make blackheads worse by causing your skin to produce too much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall should you buy it? Maybe, it might work wonders for someone else or destroy someone else&#x27;s face, it&#x27;s hard to determine since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different. My skin is dry/combination and moderately sensitive, if that helps. If you don&#x27;t have the money to drop 50 dollars on a single product, I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;Am I going to repurchase this? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Prevents nasty pimples almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t have a disgusting smell.&lt;br /&gt;-No residue left and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The breakouts for the first few weeks, might make people hesitant to continue use of it.&lt;br /&gt;-Does absolutely nothing for blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be very drying in certain areas.r /&gt;-No residue left and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The breakouts for the first few weeks, might make people hesitant to continue use of it.&lt;br /&gt;-Does absolutely nothing for blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be very drying in certain areas.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and it helps prevent / remove buildup on my face. I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m gentle with it, but other scrubs don&#x27;t exfoliate enough. I use it before using Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control to prevent breakouts. I use to use St Ives alone and the salicylic acid wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent breakouts for me. It might work for other people though as I breakout very easily.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for years.  Great natural face scrub. Prefer it over many other brands which would cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> I used to be so acne prone and still get the occasional big zit but with just using this face wash twice a day I can say that my skin has never looked so good.  It exfoliets very well and over the past year using it my scaring looks so much better.  It is great stuff I wouldn&#x27;t consider anything neutrogena or johnson&amp;johnson puts out as quality, they are all junk!  This is the only face wash I&#x27;ve used in my life that makes my face look great and actually stay oil free throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works great!~</li>
    <li> Great face wash in the shower to exfoliate prior to wet shaving with a safety razor or straight razor.</li>
    <li> Good clean smell, best scrub I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I used a St. Ives scrub product years ago and my usual dry acne prone skin had an off the charts bad reaction to the it. A week or so ago, I got such an amazing price on the St. Ives blemish control scrub that I decided to give it another chance. I was so pleasantly surprised. First of all, I love how thick and grainy this product is because that is just what I want in an exfoliant. Second, I did not experience over dryness which I usually do with a lot of acne products. And third, I have not experienced additional breakouts or irritated skin. Overall, I am extremely happy with the product and the best part is, even at regular price, this product is much cheaper than my usual face wash.</li>
    <li> Tried clean n clear and neutragena for the longest and did absolutely nothing to get rid of my acne spent so much money too ... Until finally I tried st. Ives and it worked wonders !!!! Love it the best and being environmently and animal friendly is a huge plus !!</li>
    <li> I used this for a 2 months and I still get black heads , and blemishes its not very useful</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and like the easy shopping online so I ordered it.  It works great.  My kids said &amp;#34;you could have gotten that at the drug store mom&amp;#34;.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. i&#x27;ve been using it for a long time! i just wish i could still find the big tubs of it that would last forever! i feel like some gets wasted in the tubes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. Sadly, I&#x27;ve only recently come to realise just how damaging it is to delicate face skin. I know how nice it can be to feel how &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; this exfoliator can be... But it causes micro tears. Take it from me, a former super fan of this product... Stop buying it! Find a gentler exfoliator. Your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> it is not very strong but clean really well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing this scrub for looong time, and thanks to Amazon&#x27;s add-on program, I got this for a very low price. I didn&#x27;t even know that it was for acne-prone skin, I saw the reviews and thought \\&quot;what will I loose\\&quot;. This scrub is wonderful. It smells so nice, and it leaves my skin silky. I have normal skin prone to breakouts but they are nothing like acne.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on your skin but makes you break out more</li>

    <li> I bought it for my daughter before at Walmart and she loved it. I bought it this way because it was more convienent for me at this time.</li>
    <li> I cannot use it because it dries my skin out instantly.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it makes my skin feels really smooth! I use it almost every day. My only wish... is that they remove unnecessary chemicals!</li>
    <li> Excellent face scrub with a nice light scent to it. I have been using this product for nearly a month now and purchased this squirt tube for my brother. You don&#x27;t need to scrub hard at all when using this product. The beads will do most of the hard work for you. Just make sure you use a good moisturizer or lotion afterwards because this product tends to dry out your skin if you are planning on using it multiple days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely a noticeable reduction in the amount of blackheads present on my nose. However, don&#x27;t expect a disappearing act with this product. St. Ives advertises it as a &#x27;blackhead controller,&#x27; not a blackhead treatment. As such, this face scrub does its job controlling blackheads quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the blemish controlling aspect of this face wash because I rarely get any blemishes.</li>
    <li> when i first got this in mail it took over a week ! and the bottle was open and not as full as the other acne washes ive used. it was like 2/6 of the bottle was used and then they saved the rest and put tape on the top and just sent it .the scrub does its job of keeping a sorta clear face but i guess the longer you use it the more clearer your face gets . ive only used this for 2 weeks but i see 2/5 of my face is clear so this is a okay scrub</li>
    <li> Seriously the best stuff I have used yet. Im 15, a girl. I have looked and tried some of the most strongest and even dermatologist prescribed acne medications.  I dont have horrible acne,  just some breakouts and ill ive wanted is clear skin. This is the only one that has actually worked. I scrubed it on, let it soak for 2 minutes then rinsed with cold water to close my pores. I woke up the next day and only had 2 zits. I am amazed. And highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and it leaves a feeling in your skin that you can&#x27;t compare to anything. It really does what it promises. You will want to take a shower just to put this on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, a little bit goes a very long way. I use it about 2-3 times a week and my skin always feels super soft and refreshed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than 3 times a week, as it could be a little irritating to sensitive skin. Although I don&#x27;t struggle with acne on my face, my face can look dull and dry sometimes and this really helps to give me a fresh glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to break out alot on my back and shoulders and I have a ton of post acne scars. I&#x27;ve just started using this  when I&#x27;m in the shower, so I&#x27;m expecting the same results. I will update any progress I see on my back and shoulders. It&#x27;s crazy cheap in Walmart, so don&#x27;t bother getting it on Amazon. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this face scrub to use everyday, and this is less powerful than neutrogena deep clean which causes minor irritation on my face. But St. Ives Apricot scrub provides more conditioning and excellent cleaning for me. Great price and helps keep my face smooth and clean everyday.</li>
    <li> I like this face wash and think it does a good job cleaning but why the lower rating?  When I looked on the back of the tube I noticed it states that the cap is made of plastic #5 and the tube itself is made of plastic #7, which usually means it is made of polycarbonate.  Polycarbonate is derived from BPA!  I was very disappointed in learning about this as I use to think this was a more natural product since that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s advertised and that it is paraben-free.  I use to use this all the time and it&#x27;s great that its paraben free but it&#x27;s no use to me if BPA is leaching into my face wash.  I really couldn&#x27;t believe the tube had BPA in it!  Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this again until this is made BPA-free!</li>
    <li> It is the standard reveiew that it def works as it is supposed to be working and no 2 doubts about it. Good product cheaper at Amazon. Can be used to complete orders about $25 for free shipping:)</li>
    <li> I love that this isn&#x27;t as expensive as some as the other products out there, but I think it works just as well. A fantastic exfoliator - my skin feels like silk after I use it! Easy to rinse off and helps control my acne. Been buying this for years and I&#x27;ll keep buying this for years.</li>
    <li> Love! It smells so good and your face is really smooth and nice afterwords.</li>
    <li> Leaves face smooth and removes dirt and cleans the pores, blemishes really do go down and it smells good</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always had great results. I have sensitive skin and an oily t-zone and it is gentle enough to use every few days.</li>
    <li> I have tried other scrubs and I keep coming back to this one! My skin is so clean and clear! If I miss using it 2 days my skin gets oily and clogged, I will always have this on supply!</li>
    <li> My mom recommended I try this and so far I am impressed. I like the smell and the fact that it feels like liquid sandpaper. It does not hurt my face but the grit in it make me think it&#x27;s cleaning my pores deep down and scrubbing away the old skin.</li>
    <li> year after year this is one of the best products I ever try, It just gives one a clear completion in a wink.  strongly recomend it</li>
    <li> i like this scrub and have been using it for years in the shower.  makes your face feel clean</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> not good, not sure what this suppose to do,</li>
    <li> nothing better in terms of exfoliation</li>
    <li> Great scrub and a good deal buying in bulk online.</li>
    <li> 100% recommended, since I try this scrub my acne skin look more clean.</li>
    <li> St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  Washing my face with using this St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz every night bath,  reduces my chances of getting acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product at regular price and I wrote my honest review at my own will and free time.</li>
    <li> This stuff has done wonders for me skin. I love it so much. It has helped minimize my pores, prevent breakouts, and it has also helped even out my skin tone. I usually have Rosacea on my cheeks, and literally 3 days after using this product you can&#x27;t even tell I ever had it. I wont use any other facial scrub for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have black heads (on my nose) but I really like this scrub.  It has a pleasant smell and my face feels really smooth after washing.</li>
    <li> Made me break out. Very upset with the product. Harsh on sensitive skin. Cuts microscopic holes in your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use on my face! I have used it daily for years and. Do not feel clean without it. Finally convinced my teenage son to start using it an he has had a lot of improvement with his acne. I usually buy this in bulk because we use so much of it. You can&#x27;t beat the price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of facial cleansers, including Neutrogena, Loreal Go 360, and generic brand apricot scrubs. They were either too oily or made my skin dry. This product, however, clears up my skin, makes my skin soft and smooth, and moisturizes it instead of drying it out. I&#x27;ll forever be a St. Ives user now.</li>
    <li> this product has not done much for me....has not improved anything at all. blackheads are still so visible. mxm so ill give it an ok</li>
    <li> Best buy on this stuff I&#x27;ve seen in. While</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
    <li> I use this scrub about twice a week on my face and neck as well as on my feet, elbows and knees. I love the smell. This actually hydrates my skin really well. I&#x27;ve used it on and off for a few years now and I&#x27;m always happy with it and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s cheap works well. Feels good afterward, not much to say other than it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
</ol>
