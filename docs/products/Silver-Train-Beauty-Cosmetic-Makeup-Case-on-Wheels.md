    <li> Great product, great price, but came damaged. Haven&#x27;t heard anything back about it after I reported it more than a week ago. So I&#x27;d be a little careful before ordering.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this.  The case appears to be very sturdy, and has made it through the snow this winter so far.  It&#x27;s perfect to hold all the various cosmetics and she is more organized and feels more professional going to jobs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother who is a hairdresser. She loved it from the moment she saw it was black and silver. So far all her clients have been talking about how professional and how neat it looks.  Quality of the product is sturdy, it might not break anytime soon (hoping it will last a few years for it&#x27;s price), it might be somewhat heavy if you fully load it since it has a lot of space inside to be filled. Separators can be removed easily so it adjusts anyone needs.</li>
    <li> I love this case! It holds everything perfectly! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for what I need; love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I love it so much that I don&#x27;t even want to work! I just want to keep all my makeup in it BRAND NEW!</li>
    <li> My friend loved it as her birthday gift. It fits everything she has and a little extra both with makeup, hair, wigs, and even some clothing if need be. It&#x27;s easy to carrier or tote around. It comes apart and goes right back together easily and it protects everything inside by holding it securely in place.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a hairstylist and an educator.  She loves it. She puts all her supplies to go to hair shows</li>
    <li> My son absolutely loves the flexibility and versatility of this case.  It was a great gift and one that will get plenty of use!</li>
    <li> This case is absolutely awesome!!! A little bit pricey for the simplicity of the case, but a good buy for my purposes!!!</li>
    <li> She loves it nice product</li>
    <li> This can be used for so many things.  Makeup, art projects, crafts, light tools, etc.  well made.  It was a hit with our creative makeup artist.  Even our family authoress thought it would help when she goes on book tours to tote around her books and supplies.</li>
    <li> The case was poorly put together, you can see the glue coming off certain areas. The wheels are uneven and don&#x27;t stand right.  The case is hard to roll. Very unhappy. I have one similar to it and it&#x27;s made so much better.</li>
    <li> The case is awesome it fits all my current makeup. My only worry us the handle is a tinge wobbly, besides that it&#x27;s prefect!</li>
    <li> I bought this case for my grand-daughter who is a cosmetologist. She said, &amp;#34;I love it. I got everything into it.&amp;#34; Works for me...</li>
    <li> I received my case today. I mainly ordered it to store all my make up neatly.  The fact that it can come apart and be transported makes this product so perfect for me.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough to hold all my essentials and more. It is also a great space saver . I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive case for my Halloween makeup. Shipped quick.</li>
    <li> I read the others reviews and I decided buy this item, looks good so far, I like the design, but I thought this would be a little bit bigger, anyway is working good. Notice that 38.5 inches tall is with the handle pulled up.</li>
    <li> The case was a Christmas gift for my daughter. The case came quicker than expected and seemed to be packed well. When she opened it on Christmas morning and started looking through it, we found that the quality of the tray and inserts was poor. The material on the interior tray was pulled back on the corner and there was damage to the back of the tray. The dividers for the tray were not made well and also of poor quality. I wanted to send it back, but my daughter did not, fearing that she might not get a replacement. I repaired the damaged the best I could and she is excited about having a case she can use to haul all her makeup for the theater. To be clear, I never contacted the seller about this issue so I place no blame on them. The quality of the product just was not up to the standard that I expected.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my makeup needs. I love it. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She just loves it. She is going to beauty school.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I&#x27;m studying cosmetology and I needs this for all my supplies and not only is it really cute it has a lot of space and it&#x27;s not difficult to find the compartments. Also my shipment came super fast!</li>
    <li> shipping time is ridiculous came dented and missing the mirror</li>
    <li> My daughter just received this for Christmas and so far she loves it. There is a lot of storage space and she likes the movable spacers in the top case and the bottom tray. I don&#x27;t think this case is top quality, but for the price I think it is a good value. It has a nice look to it, but we will see how it holds up after months of use.</li>
