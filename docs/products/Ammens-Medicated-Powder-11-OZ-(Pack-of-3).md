      <li>In addition to the diaper rash, her whole diaper area turned bright red.</li>
      <li>like the scent of the powder fresh best.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This was a present for a friend&#x27;s birthday, and she was just thrilled to get it.</li>
      <li>and it is worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
      <li>I bought this at the store first and really liked it,on line was cheaper and the exact same product.</li>
      <li>I gave it three stars because I know from past experience that it works great for some kids, but in her case, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>

      <li>I am allergic to most similar products</li>
      <li>My mom swears by this powder and has been using this for many years, but the local drugstores stopped carrying it .</li>
      <li>Yes, really!  </li>
      <li>This product has been my solution to preventing body odor for many years, as I&#x27;m allergic to all the anti-persperants and most other commercial body powders.</li>

      <li>I particularly use it instead of roll-on deodorant.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;cost</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years but have been having trouble finding it in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It is soothing, healing and consistently the same each purchase.</li>
      <li>Some of the smaller stores carry it but the price is a lot higher.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s all I need to feel fresh and stay dry.  </li>
      <li>For the smell pleasant but faint</li>
      <li>They were all allergic to the diaper rash creams, so when my grandbaby had a rash that wouldn&#x27;t clear up, I bought the Ammen&#x27;s for my daughter to use.</li>
      <li>have been buying this for years to give to a friend how has a 21 year old son with cerebral palsy and it has prevented diaper rash for all the time they have used it on him.</li>
      <li>I bought for my 98 year old grandmother in the Bahamas.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for diaper rash when my children were young.  </li>
      <li>I would have opted for Gold Bond, but Amazon provided me with an alternate acceptable due to the free shipping incentive.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other powder, medicated or non.  Not easy to find, so getting a bunch at one time is very helpful.</li>
      <li>My reasons for wanting it, and no other, are it&#x27;s cooling feel and prevention of heat rashes.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Have used this powder for awhile, and it has generally performed well for me.  </li>
      <li>Generally I just have to use once a day although sometimes twice.  </li>
      <li>Some rashes are actually fungal infections, and this works so well to clear it up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this as baby powder and it&#x27;s amazing! I use it every time I change my son&#x27;s diapers and he never gets diapers rashes. and he REALLY soaks his diapers. This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> Great for eliminating foot oder. I don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ammen&#x27;s Medicated Powder since I was an infant, and I would not think of using any other product.  It is still the best after 60 years!</li>
    <li> have been using this product for years.  will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product has been my solution to preventing body odor for many years, as I&#x27;m allergic to all the anti-persperants and most other commercial body powders. I don&#x27;t perspire a lot and twice/week application works well for me, along with daily showers using anti-bacterial body soap from Amway.  I&#x27;ve experimented with many products and this combination works for me.</li>
    <li> No longer carried by Walgreen&#x27;s, can&#x27;t find in stores, glad I am able to get this on Amazon. I order in bult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best medicated powder and also a good deodorant. I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Very nice silky light powder, soft scent so man can be comfortable using it too. It&#x27;s all we use now.</li>
    <li> Good Product! Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Have used Ammens for years, but I had an allergic reaction to this lot.</li>
    <li> I Like Ammens...&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Ammens for years..&lt;br /&gt;I like it...&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many powers and Ammens beats them all&lt;br /&gt;bp</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It is wonderful to find a source for it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Susan Condon</li>
    <li> I have used this since 1964.  There is nothing that comes close to its effectiveness!  It is soothing, healing and consistently the same each purchase.</li>
    <li> I would have opted for Gold Bond, but Amazon provided me with an alternate acceptable due to the free shipping incentive. Ammens is the \\&quot;Avis\\&quot; here and Gold Bond the \\&quot;Hertz.\\&quot; Not much separates them, however.</li>
    <li> My mom swears by this powder and has been using this for many years, but the local drugstores stopped carrying it . Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my body and face since I was a child.  It prevents the sun and heat rashes I usually get especially in the summer.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for getting rid of and preventing heat rashes and chafing. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy to use that&#x27;s the only negative about this but it does it&#x27;s job. For the smell pleasant but faint so it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all!</li>
    <li> I have used Ammens for years and believe it is the best on the market! I had a hard time in the past trying to find this product after  Walmart and the Navy Commissary stopped carrying it.  Some of the smaller stores carry it but the price is a lot higher.  So glad to find it on Amazon and at a decent price.  Praying that Amazon will continue to carry it.  Tried Gold Bond which is carried by Walmart and the commissary, but that powder is very uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> My best friend recommended this for me and it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps you dry and comfortable, and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> This was a present for a friend&#x27;s birthday, and she was just thrilled to get it. I was blessed to see her so delighted with the product which she uses regularly as recommended by her doctor for skin chaffing.</li>
    <li> I used Ammens Powder on my own children for diaper rash (and to avoid diaper rash!)  Some rashes are actually fungal infections, and this works so well to clear it up. It also works on athlete&#x27;s foot and other irritating rashes. It came doctor recommended 38 years ago when my first child was born, and now I use it on my baby grandson who has very sensitive skin. I also use it in his little chubby folds so sweat doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Price could be cheaper</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, but not able to get locally. Thank you for still having it available. My reasons for wanting it, and no other, are it&#x27;s cooling feel and prevention of heat rashes.</li>
    <li> This powder is great.  I&#x27;m been using it for years.  Apply once a day and that&#x27;s all I need to feel fresh and stay dry.  My husband and son use it as well during the hot summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store first and really liked it,on line was cheaper and the exact same product.</li>
    <li> Heals all kinds of rash</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder, instead of deodorant, since I had a surgery, that left me unable to use any underarm deodorant, without breaking out in a rash. I still have the rash, on occasion, but the powder REALLY HELPS to keep it under control!!</li>
    <li> been using it for years. non abrasive. dries skin well.&lt;br /&gt;not stinkily scented. prevents fungus. highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;cost effective packaging of a product not always available in&lt;br /&gt;retail pharmacies.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. A little pricey but worth it. Have not been able to find in stores as of late.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Got this for my Dad because he couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;He loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best powder for anyone that get heat rashes. Keeps me try and it also geat on your tire wet feet, after a long day at work.</li>
    <li> Great powder. One does not need to use deodorant which has chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent of the powder fresh best.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for any kind of rash and can be used on children too.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stain like deodorant does either.</li>
    <li> Back in the 70s we were sold all sorts of deodorants and antiperspirants to keep ourselves presentable. Then I discovered Ammens powder.  A slight dusting of it, kept me sociably acceptable for all day and more, regardless of how much I would sweat. To this day, this is my choice of product for this purpose. And if I begin to get a rash or itch someplace, Ammens solves the problem. Yes, really!  So, that&#x27;s 44 years of experience with this product. It is not easily available, however, Walmart does not carry it, so when I purchase, I buy at least three at a time. I have several in my home in California and I have two extra here in my home in D.C. I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Love this powder.  I bought for my 98 year old grandmother in the Bahamas.  It keeps her cool and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!! Use it every day!  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This is a top quality powder because it does not contain aluminum as the others do. Another hard to find product but well worth the cost. I recommend to anyone who has problem with chaffing or heat rashes.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I have been using this power for as long as I can remember, I like them better then most of the newer powder out there today</li>
    <li> Amens medicated powder has been in use at my house long before I started having kids. The difference between Amens medicated powder and other powders is very obvious. That is why when I could not find Amens medicated powder in the stores I quickly turned to amazon.com  and it is worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
    <li> This is the best medicated powder I have tried.  I have used this brand for 40 years.  It is great for children or adults.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but its been very difficult to find Ammens Medicated Powder on store shelves near where I live, so one day I thought to look for it on Amazon.com ~ and there it was!!! I&#x27;ll never have to tread through store after store looking for it again!!!!  As for the product...it was worth treading through store after store looking for it ~ because it is the best medicated powder there is. I&#x27;ve used it for many years pretty much head to toe... and it works great for diaper rash on babies too! I just mixed it with a little Vaseline and the diaper rash goes away. Works great for heat rashes too. Great for foot powder, etc. etc.  Just great stuff!</li>
    <li> Have used this powder for awhile, and it has generally performed well for me.  Generally I just have to use once a day although sometimes twice.  It has never irritated or been a problem.  Have tried others with less success for me, but it comes down to personal preference.  Used to see this in stores everywhere, but it seems to have a more limited distribution now.</li>
    <li> WORKS GOOD  DOES NOT HAVE AN OVER WHELMING OR PERFUME LIKE SMELL.  DOES NOT CAKE UP  FEELS NICE.  GOOD VALUE</li>
    <li> I have used Ammens Medicated Powder for years and years and always recommend it to others for skin relief.  I particularly use it instead of roll-on deodorant.  In the past year or so, it has become impossible to find in drug stores or supermarkets, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online, in packages of three.  I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s still available and that it arrives here so quickly.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  I have been using it for yeaars and  am no longer able to go  shopping for myself.</li>
    <li> When my kids were small, Ammen&#x27;s was the only thing we could use on their diaper rash. They were all allergic to the diaper rash creams, so when my grandbaby had a rash that wouldn&#x27;t clear up, I bought the Ammen&#x27;s for my daughter to use. Unfortunately, my granddaughter was allergic to the Ammen&#x27;s powder. In addition to the diaper rash, her whole diaper area turned bright red. I gave it three stars because I know from past experience that it works great for some kids, but in her case, it didn&#x27;t. I gave a bottle to my son to use when he runs long distances and kept one here to use as a body powder. It is good for those purposes.</li>
    <li> In the hot summer months, this is just the best product ever! Keeps you dry and prevents chafing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I remember this powder when I was a little girl.  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this in the stores any more.  It gets rid of rashes and itching quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years but have been having trouble finding it in the stores.  I am allergic to most similar products so this is great for me me to have a large supply on hand.</li>
    <li> Best powder ever,,keeps skin dry..I buy the bulk pack in amazon so I would  never run out.</li>
    <li> Ammens Medicated Original Powder has been in my home for many years.  It is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; in the summer when perspiration causes itching and chafing.  It is an item for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Very good for the humid summers in the South. Smell is not as medicinal as Gold Bond. Price is very good compared to CVS&#x27;s regular price.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!!! Took away my baby&#x27;s heat rash in one day! The cornstarch base is So soft and silky. Doesn&#x27;t puff up like talcum powder based powders so you don&#x27;t have to worry about holding your breath so you don&#x27;t inhale a big puff of powder. it&#x27;s just great stuff.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other powder, medicated or non.  Not easy to find, so getting a bunch at one time is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Perfect find, powder is amazing and hard to find locally at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> have been buying this for years to give to a friend how has a 21 year old son with cerebral palsy and it has prevented diaper rash for all the time they have used it on him.</li>
    <li> Keeps your butt, baby butt smooth and dry.</li>
    <li> I used this product for diaper rash when my children were young.  By far, absolutely the best product for diaper rash.  Also works very well for other body rashes.  We have been using this product in our family for over 35 years.  Hard to find in stores but we will do whatever it takes to find it.  Currently ordered from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for making it available.</li>
    <li> The lid messes up and doesn&#x27;t want to twist</li>
    <li> I have used this powder all of my life. I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, so I set out to find it online. I was so happy to see it was still around!</li>
