    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Nu Skin products.</li>
    <li> I have  found this to be a good facial pH toner for my skin which is dry.   It also works well to pick up any residual dirt or make up after cleansing and leaves the skin feeling comfortable not tight.  The downside is that it&#x27;s pricey - so I&#x27;m still in the market for an effective pH toner, but reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I love it! Everything the good reviews had to say is true..... So give this a try, u will love it too!</li>
    <li> A very nice and refreshing toner! You can really see what is left on a cotton ball after use. It really makes your face feel truly clean!</li>

    <li> Best toner ever!  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh...not oily or dry.</li>
    <li> I feel the product is probable good  but I like placing my orders and they want to charge my credit card very month and one product coast $80 and the 0ther $85  I called and said no and she argued with me high pressurize sales.  then If I don&lt;br /&gt;t like the product they want me to ship it back.  LOL another cost these people are to much.  sad business deal this way.</li>
