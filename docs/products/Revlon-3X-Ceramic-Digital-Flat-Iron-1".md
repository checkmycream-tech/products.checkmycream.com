### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>PRODUCT IS JUST PERFECT</li>
      <li>I followed the mfr. temp recommendation for my type of hair (330 degrees), and I&#x27;m getting excellent results.</li>
      <li>I paid $17.99 for this and it is great for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great straightener.</li>
      <li>It did a great job of straightening my hair.  </li>
      <li>But it is actually a great product.</li>
      <li>If you hold the iron at that point, it will clamp perfectly every time and you&#x27;re not at risk of accidentally touching the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is perfect for what I need it for, straightens my hair in minutes and heats up to a decent amount.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels very light.</li>
      <li>specs say the plates are tourmaline ceramic; they glide very smoothly over my hair</li>
      <li>In the end there were still parts that would not straighten no matter how many times I worked on it.</li>
      <li>The on/off switch and temperature control are on the top of the iron and designed so that you cant accidentally change the temperature setting or turn of the unit without meaning to.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and leaves hair with great bounce</li>
      <li>I have silver, wiry hair and live in a humid climate, so I use it every day with great results.</li>
      <li>this product is very good for using , and the price is very cheap the quality is very good as like the product expensive</li>
      <li>This is easily eliminated by holding the iron closer to the plates.</li>
      <li>Get it if you are looking for a straightener that is cheap but get the job done</li>
      <li>Overall, I think this is a very good iron at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight, fine textured and medium+ thickness.</li>
      <li>I use a flat iron most days to finish my styling and achieve a smooth, glossy look.</li>
      <li>But it does its job, gets VERY hot, it has a self lock mechanism that I love so its not all laid out open.</li>
      <li>The only qualms I have about it is it does not have a light that shows its still on, but I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t have said light when I bought it.</li>
      <li>There is a digital display on the top of the iron that is very clear and easy to read.</li>
      <li>wife says takes too long to heat up and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough but works great</li>
      <li>worry that it might be too hot, but the bottom line is that after trying just about everything out there and doing TONS of research on different products - I bought this on a whim and got WICKED LUCKY - by far the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever used because IT WORKS on my hard to manage hair.</li>
      <li>I recently ordered this straightener and my first thought when I took it out of the package was that it felt cheap.</li>
      <li>- the highest setting is VERY high</li>
      <li>Very light, and attractive, its not bulky or ugly looking.</li>
      <li>For my type of hair, the Revlon RVST2082 works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I began using it on my medium length semi straight hair.</li>
      <li>or I look like one of those before commercials that you think can&#x27;t be for real.</li>
      <li>It straightens my hair very well and does not burn it.</li>
      <li>flat iron looks and feels well made and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>There are three raised lines on the outer side of both the top and bottom arm of the iron; you can clearly see them just above the digital window.</li>
      <li>its pretty straight with somewhat of a wave, so any straightener works for me, I only picked this brand to match my dryer.</li>
      <li>My hair looks smooth and shiny, and already feels less dry/frizzy since I&#x27;m now using a much lower temp than I was with my \\&quot;pro\\&quot; iron.</li>
      <li>Its cheap plastic and extremely lightweight.</li>
      <li>Tried it in multiple outlets and clicked on the on button, tried to go to a higher setting NOTHING.</li>
      <li>My only problem was that I couldn&#x27;t get it to handle my ends a little better.  </li>
      <li>and I am FLABBERGASTED at how well it works on my 43 year old, naturally wavy, ALWAYS FRIZZY, bra strap length hair.</li>
      <li>Bought this back in April, but I didn&#x27;t open it until recently as I rarely ever straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>I liked a friends WET to DRY one too, but it was too wide.</li>
      <li>I have plain hair, nothing special.</li>
      <li>Like some other reviewers, I&#x27;m really starting to wonder if some of the high-end units are really worth the price.</li>
      <li>If you have fine to medium texture and/or thin to medium thickness hair, I think you&#x27;ll find this iron could work well for you</li>

    <li> I have plain hair, nothing special. its pretty straight with somewhat of a wave, so any straightener works for me, I only picked this brand to match my dryer. But it does its job, gets VERY hot, it has a self lock mechanism that I love so its not all laid out open. Very light, and attractive, its not bulky or ugly looking. I enjoy it very much. If you guys would like personal pictures I can upload.</li>
    <li> It never reaches the maximum temperature. It works but not that effectively as expected.</li>
    <li> it keeps pulling the strands of my hair</li>
    <li> Takes a million presses on the power button to actually turn on</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this straightener and my first thought when I took it out of the package was that it felt cheap. Its cheap plastic and extremely lightweight. I felt that it would break if I ever dropped it. I began using it on my medium length semi straight hair. I had straightening serum in and it was set to 450 and it took me 45 minutes to straighten my hair. In the end there were still parts that would not straighten no matter how many times I worked on it. Overall, a very poor product. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t work, it had to be returned.</li>
    <li> About my hair: I have a roughly chin-length, modified bob that is angled toward the front, and stacked/textured in the back. My hair is straight, fine textured and medium+ thickness. Due to color processing and other abuses, I must blow dry and style my hair or I look like one of those before commercials that you think can&#x27;t be for real. I use a flat iron most days to finish my styling and achieve a smooth, glossy look. For my type of hair, the Revlon RVST2082 works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron looks and feels well made and is comfortable in the hand. The on/off switch and temperature control are on the top of the iron and designed so that you cant accidentally change the temperature setting or turn of the unit without meaning to. It has five, pre-set temperatures: 230, 280, 330, 380 and 430. There is a digital display on the top of the iron that is very clear and easy to read. It shows whether the unit is on or off, what temp setting you&#x27;ve selected and indicates when the unit has reached it&#x27;s temp. I haven&#x27;t timed it but it seems to reach the selected temp faster than the 30 seconds indicated by the mfr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mfr. specs say the plates are tourmaline ceramic; they glide very smoothly over my hair and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with grabbing or snagging. I have some very short hair at the base of my neck and I can feel the warmth of the iron when I use it to smooth/straighten those sections, but I have not had any problems at all with burning myself. If you hold the iron at it&#x27;s base, near the cord, you may find the  plates don&#x27;t clamp together correctly (they may slip a little). This is easily eliminated by holding the iron closer to the plates. There are three raised lines on the outer side of both the top and bottom arm of the iron; you can clearly see them just above the digital window. If you hold the iron at that point, it will clamp perfectly every time and you&#x27;re not at risk of accidentally touching the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little dial on the side of the iron, all the way at the base, near the cord, which allows you to lock the iron closed (clamped) for storage or travel, which is nice. A couple of things to note: the plug is a standard, small wall plug, not one those large, square safety plus with the test and reset buttons that you often see on hair appliances.  Also, this is not a dual voltage unit so if you plan to travel to Europe you&#x27;ll need a different iron or the necessary adapter/converters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Revlon flat iron is replacing a very expensive, so-called professional iron purchased at a salon, that had a disappointing lifespan and didn&#x27;t perform all that well. Like some other reviewers, I&#x27;m really starting to wonder if some of the high-end units are really worth the price. Overall, I think this is a very good iron at an extremely reasonable price. If you have fine to medium texture and/or thin to medium thickness hair, I think you&#x27;ll find this iron could work well for you and I&#x27;d recommend trying it. I followed the mfr. temp recommendation for my type of hair (330 degrees), and I&#x27;m getting excellent results. My hair looks smooth and shiny, and already feels less dry/frizzy since I&#x27;m now using a much lower temp than I was with my \\&quot;pro\\&quot; iron.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS JUST PERFECT</li>
    <li> wife says takes too long to heat up and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough but works great</li>
    <li> The straightener pulls my hair and wasn&#x27;t at all what I was expecting. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this back in April, but I didn&#x27;t open it until recently as I rarely ever straighten my hair. DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK. It just shows the digital OFF button. Tried it in multiple outlets and clicked on the on button, tried to go to a higher setting NOTHING. Unfortunately, I passed the expiration date to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how its supposed to feel or because it&#x27;s missing something inside.</li>
    <li> This is about the 6th hair straightener I&#x27;ve tried. I liked a friends WET to DRY one too, but it was too wide. I happened across this in a local WALGREENS when I was just looking to replace one that just died. I grabbed this one because it wasnt the most expensive and it had temp control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about $20 bucks for it and I am FLABBERGASTED at how well it works on my 43 year old, naturally wavy, ALWAYS FRIZZY, bra strap length hair. I use it daily on my bangs, and occasionally to straighten or spin the length. The next to highest setting works like a charm for my daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING - the highest setting is VERY high (I think its 400 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry that it might be too hot, but the bottom line is that after trying just about everything out there and doing TONS of research on different products - I bought this on a whim and got WICKED LUCKY - by far the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever used because IT WORKS on my hard to manage hair.</li>
