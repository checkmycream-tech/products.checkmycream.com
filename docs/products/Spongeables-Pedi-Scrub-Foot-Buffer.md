      <li>I bought more to keep for him and my 2 sons.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It smells good, feels good, and you walk away with really clean, soft hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t use mine that diligently, but it would give my feet a nice tingly feeling, which is great if you&#x27;ve been standing on your feet several hours a day.</li>
      <li>and I figured the Pedi-Scrub Foot Buffers would be an easy way to prevent calluses.</li>
      <li>but the scent is just way too strong.  </li>
      <li>But the smell was so strong it permeated my house</li>
      <li>I originally bought the Lavender &amp; Tea Tree Oil fragrance, which is light and lovely...</li>
      <li>Love the mild scent and soothing aloe.  </li>
      <li>was pleasant but not invigorating, so I didn&#x27;t mind too much when replacement time came right when the box said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hell, I liked them so much I started using them myself.  </li>
      <li>They are great in the summertime especially to keep my feet from cracking and drying out.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product that I bought a bunch of them to use and to give away as gifts.  </li>
      <li>The Pedi-Buffers really do make them feel better and look better.  </li>
      <li>While scrubbing, you&#x27;ll enjoy a light, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Great for exfoliating the dead skin on your feet, and i&#x27;m sure this would be great to expand the time from one pedicure appointment to the next!</li>
      <li>the higher the better...</li>
      <li>I originally used them for myself, but my husband had stain/grease on his hands and Dawn wasn&#x27;t working to get it off</li>
      <li>It just smells really clean.  </li>
      <li>They are also cool and refreshed,</li>
      <li>Product was adequate</li>
      <li>It does feel good at the end of a long day.</li>
      <li>When the soap runs out, I thoroughly wash the sponge, squirt it with my favorite all-over soap, use it as a body scrubber, and start a new one for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how baby soft my feet are and how quickly the Pedi-Scrubs worked their magic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially nice when your feet are hot or tired and</li>
      <li>For guys and girls who like to feel clean:  This one&#x27;s a real winner.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does a good job on rough heels, but it&#x27;s the massage</li>
      <li>The foaming part is really about the only part that I really liked.</li>
      <li>I thought it would moisturizer more and take if more dead skin.  </li>
      <li>I am scent sensitive and these scrubs are WAY TOO STRONG smelling.  </li>
      <li>They clean your feet and leave them super soft.</li>
      <li>a little luxury that&#x27;s actually good for you.</li>
      <li>Great idea, this morning my whole car smelled like serious eucalyptus and I&#x27;m going to give them someone right away or toss them out!  </li>
      <li>my feet  feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>First time I purchased these</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try them</li>
      <li>These are  great  for tired, achy feet after working or shopping all day.  </li>
      <li>They were already pretty soft</li>
      <li>Recommend using this for 10-15 minutes, wiping down and then applying some O&#x27;Keeffes&#x27;s for healthy feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only downside is cost, but they&#x27;re worth every penny</li>
      <li>Although it may not seem to be a product that guys would normally buy and/or use, I consider it to be a foot saver.  </li>
      <li>It has really thick soap with a nice smell, it DOES NOT leave a girly odor on your feet.  </li>
      <li>so much I immediately put them back in the box and sealed it.  </li>
      <li>old fashioned lavendar with the zing of Tea Tree Oil.  </li>
      <li>They smell fresh and last a long time.</li>
      <li>I just ordered more (a package of 3) of these recently (November 2016) and noticed that one of the three was much lighter than the other two, which means that it has little to none of the aromatherpy/soothing soap in it.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing after a long day on my peds!!</li>

    <li> I originally used them for myself, but my husband had stain/grease on his hands and Dawn wasn&#x27;t working to get it off so he tried a spongeable, and it worked great.  I bought more to keep for him and my 2 sons.</li>
    <li> Very soothing after a long day on my peds!!</li>
    <li> I like the foot scrubber sponge and would purchase again. Good scrubby for feet and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I love my girlfriends&#x27; feet.  They were already pretty soft and I just wanted to pamper her, well, because, I&#x27;m pretty awesome and she deserves it.  So this purchase wasn&#x27;t made to correct a problem, but to enhance the distal part of my woman&#x27;s legs.  Hell, I liked them so much I started using them myself.  Lavender too..  Although the girlfriend thought I had used them previously, which I have to admit, I thought about, but that&#x27;s another story altogether.  Recommend using this for 10-15 minutes, wiping down and then applying some O&#x27;Keeffes&#x27;s for healthy feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing this didn&#x27;t fix is that she still won&#x27;t let me crack her toes, but I can&#x27;t blame them for that.  If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;m listening.  I&#x27;ve tried to do it when she&#x27;s sleeping, watching TV or not paying attention and I always get caught.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the ingredients listed Shea Butter and Olive Oil and I figured the Pedi-Scrub Foot Buffers would be an easy way to prevent calluses. They are...but what you get besides the softening is a really lovely foot massage. There is a textured pad on one side that you use to buff away hard skin...hence the name &#x27;Buffer.&#x27; It certainly does a good job on rough heels, but it&#x27;s the massage that&#x27;s Money!  After a day of tottering around the office in heels...the higher the better...my poor feet look and feel like illustrations for the Spanish Inquisition.  The Pedi-Buffers really do make them feel better and look better.  I&#x27;m amazed at how baby soft my feet are and how quickly the Pedi-Scrubs worked their magic.  I originally bought the Lavender &amp; Tea Tree Oil fragrance, which is light and lovely...old fashioned lavendar with the zing of Tea Tree Oil.  The Citron Eucalyptus Aromatherapy is more aromatic and very refreshing.  I&#x27;d use the Lavendar-Tea Tree Oil at night for the sheer relaxation the scent inspires, and the Citron Eucalyptus in the morning for the  \\&quot;rev you up\\&quot; feeling.  A nice treat for the feet...a little luxury that&#x27;s actually good for you.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product that I bought a bunch of them to use and to give away as gifts.  Although it may not seem to be a product that guys would normally buy and/or use, I consider it to be a foot saver.  Dirt, odor, callouses; you name it and this little sponge can help a lot.  It has really thick soap with a nice smell, it DOES NOT leave a girly odor on your feet.  It just smells really clean.

    <li> I bought these at my local store and was disappointed to not be able to find them again.  They are great in the summertime especially to keep my feet from cracking and drying out.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done on my feet when they need a good scrub.  Makes my feet feel good too. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> Great! Works  well!  Good  cross between a scrubbing  sponge  and a pumice  stone!!  Leaves  my feet  feeling smooth and soft.  They are also cool and refreshed,</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at my local drugstore on a whim, and now I don&#x27;t know how I lived without these scrubbers -- which is why I now get them delivered by subscription through Amazon.  My feet have never been happier.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I thought it would moisturizer more and take if more dead skin.  It does feel good at the end of a long day.</li>
    <li> I used these before and there great. Smells good and feels good to your feet. Great Product. I would tell everyone that loves there feet to buy this product.</li>
    <li> For guys and girls who like to feel clean:  This one&#x27;s a real winner.  Save yourself some time and set up &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; because Spongables are sure to become a staple.  Scrub your footies with this bad boy and those sleepy eyes will pop open.  It&#x27;s especially nice when your feet are hot or tired and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is cost, but they&#x27;re worth every penny -and- they last a lot longer than the promised number of washes noted on the box.  When the soap runs out, I thoroughly wash the sponge, squirt it with my favorite all-over soap, use it as a body scrubber, and start a new one for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their hand scrubber lasts way longer than promised and it&#x27;s such a treat.  It smells good, feels good, and you walk away with really clean, soft hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys - These are not just for women!  While scrubbing, you&#x27;ll enjoy a light, clean scent.  I&#x27;ve never noticed a lingering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests often ask, &amp;#34;What is this?&amp;#34;, so I stock extras to give to people I like.  They always call to rave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a 3rd Spongeable and the pink body sponge was pleasant but not invigorating, so I didn&#x27;t mind too much when replacement time came right when the box said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one scrub with Spongeables Pedi Scrub Foot Buffer and the Spongeables hand scrubber, I knew I&#x27;d use them forever.</li>
    <li> First time I purchased these and I love them!  They are great for prepping summer feet and it smells so good!  I will be using these all the time now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just basing this review on scent alone.  I am scent sensitive and these scrubs are WAY TOO STRONG smelling.  They were sealed in plastic in a sealed box and I could smell them through the box.  I still opened the box to check them out and the smell just burned my throat and eyes so much I immediately put them back in the box and sealed it.  But the smell was so strong it permeated my house and I had to put the box in the trunk of my car.  Great idea, this morning my whole car smelled like serious eucalyptus and I&#x27;m going to give them someone right away or toss them out!  I really wanted to try them but the scent is just way too strong.  Yes, the scent is invigorating to say the least, but if you are scent sensitive I would avoid them.</li>
    <li> Product was adequate but I&#x27;ve had better.  The foaming part is really about the only part that I really liked.</li>
    <li> These foot scrubbers contain the right amount of coarseness to massage the soles of your feet and a perfectly scented moisturizer to soften.</li>
    <li> These are  great  for tired, achy feet after working or shopping all day.  They smell fresh and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this by the recommendation from a friend. She worked, at the time, in retail and would come home everyday from work and wash her feet with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use mine that diligently, but it would give my feet a nice tingly feeling, which is great if you&#x27;ve been standing on your feet several hours a day. Great for exfoliating the dead skin on your feet, and i&#x27;m sure this would be great to expand the time from one pedicure appointment to the next!</li>
    <li> this is the best product especially for traveling.  the entire family uses them now. so convenient. and they smell great.</li>
    <li> These are a staple for the bathtub or shower. They clean your feet and leave them super soft. The eucalyptus and citron give your skin a tingling feeling. I love this product.</li>
    <li> My feet have never felt better!  One side of the sponge removes the dead skin and the other side smooths the skin.  Love the mild scent and soothing aloe.  It&#x27;s like giving yourself a foot massage every time you shower.  UPDATE: I just ordered more (a package of 3) of these recently (November 2016) and noticed that one of the three was much lighter than the other two, which means that it has little to none of the aromatherpy/soothing soap in it.  Returning them all because one is defective would be a pain so I&#x27;m keeping all of them.  Buyer beware!  These are pretty expensive to get two for the price of three.</li>
    <li> This is a great scrubber for between pedicures.  I use it every time I take a shower and my feet feel nice and clean!</li>
