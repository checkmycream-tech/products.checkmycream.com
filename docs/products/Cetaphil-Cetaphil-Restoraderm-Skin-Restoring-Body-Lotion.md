<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> BEST ECZEMA LOTION FOR KIDS! Seriously, I have tried them all, and this was the only one that cleared up my toddler daughter&#x27;s eczema. Would recommend for anyone that has spent gobs of money on Aveeno and the like.</li>
    <li> The best out there, for babies and grown ups.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for my babies who both have Eczema</li>
    <li> this is my new go-to lotion for my kids eczema skin.  used to use eucerin and I think this product works much better to clear eczema fast. gentle, good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My kid&#x27;s dermatologist suggest I buy this for her extra sensitive skin and eczema.  After a few months of usage, she still gets eczema patches and complains of itchy skin.  For something this pricey, I was hoping it would work better.  But I&#x27;m going to keep using it b/c I don&#x27;t know what else to use.</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all but more detail, Ive had psoriasis for a few years now and been through a couple steroid creams, my prescription steroid creams worked too but I find I don&#x27;t need them if I consistently use this lotion, which I like because its safer than steroid creams. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has really dry hand from being a mechanic and the the soap he uses at work really dried him hand, but he likes this location.</li>
    <li> I seen that my 1 year old son had this rash all over his body including his face. It was on his chin, on his feet where like little water bubbles, hands, and diaper area and all over his waist, he did not have it on his private are just on top before getting there. I obviously thought he had like a yeast infection or something of that sort which I then ruled out because it wasn&#x27;t directly on that area, and for the rash every where else I though was like from a bug. Im not an expert so I took him to his doctor and he told me It may be eczema so he gave me some cream which did not work. I then decided not to go to the doctor and bought some AVEENO BABY Lotion, Body wash for Eczema since my oldest son who is 2 had really dry skin I bought him AVEENO and it worked so  It worked great but the rash on his waist, belly and diaper area left some scarring so yea you can tell he had like rash, pimples whatever people want to think. Anyway It ended up coming back especially the water bubbles on his little feet so I decided to look up products on the internet and came across this (Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisterizer) by accident. I decided to go to my local wal-mart to see if they had and they did. After I took my son a bath I put this all over his body especially paying much concern to his feet. The next day I noticed some redness from a rash he gotten all over he&#x27;s tummy and upper arms that week had gone down and the water bubbles on his feet looked smaller, I was flabbergasted, so WOW. I kept putting on after his bath and It has gone away especially the water bubbles on his feet. I actually can&#x27;t believe it worked. They look popped like if they popped on their own. I will keep using this product I hated seen my baby with eczema which now I am sure it is. On the directions it does say use twice a day which I don&#x27;t do I like using after his baths because I feel using it twice a day is dirty your basically rubbing all your sweat all over your body and it still obviously worked how I am using it but that&#x27;s me. He is still one and I only have been using it for a month and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stop until he is older then its up to him. It is really expensive and I was not about to buy it but am so glad I did. Im also going to buy the body wash. I totally recommend this product you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Only one word. Excelent. My doughter that has eczema uses it every single day and it realy make her skin better.</li>
    <li> Read reviews that it was supposed to help eczema, but it didn&#x27;t relieve the itching or read spots like other lotions have</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recently recommended this and it has rapidly become her lotion of choice. We also use it on our 8-year old son&#x27;s eczema and as an all-over lotion for him. Neither of them have experienced any sensitivity problems at all. It goes on feeling \\&quot;thick\\&quot;, but rapidly absorbs and does not have a lingering greasy feeling like many other lotions. I like it because it does just about the best job I&#x27;ve ever seen on winter-time dry skin on my hands..plus it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.    The only drawback I&#x27;ve seen so far is the price, but Cetaphil products tend to be a bit on the high side in general and the Amazon price is very competitive with the local drug store chains.</li>
    <li> It has a thin silicone like feel to it which is nice. It isn&#x27;t oily at all and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes however it makes your skin look and feel moisturized. I use it on my infant daughter who has sensitive skin and it works really well. It barely has a smell to it, especially after it has been applied. If anything I would say it smells like aveeno lotion and a hint of nail polish remover. that sounds horrible but i swear it isn&#x27;t even strong enough to notice unless you put your nose right in it after its been applied. I definitely recommended this product.</li>
    <li> delivery in excellent conditions packaging and on time, perfect product (new) as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Use it daily. Haven&#x27; had a problem with my eczema since I started using it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema so I ordered this lotion based on all the reviews. Once we received it and tried it, she started screaming that it was burning her skin. I also have a couple of patches of eczema on my hands so I also applied some and it did in fact burn! Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very dry skin, especially in the winter months, and all other lotions I&#x27;d tried on her did not help much, e.g. did not maintain moisture for long, until I found this brand.  This one is not greasy and maintains moisture for a whole (school) day.  I&#x27;m really happy that I found it.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin...</li>
    <li> Like SO MANY products, this may work ok as a moisturizer, but don&#x27;t use it on your child if she has even the tininess open scratch or active excema because it stings miserably and she will scream and cry.  I really don&#x27;t understand how these products think it can be OK to cause such stinging.  To all the people whose skin seems to have been burned, NO, it&#x27;s not an allergic reaction, the product is causing a chemical burn.</li>
    <li> love it, gentle for my family skin</li>
    <li> Saller&#x27;s service was good.&lt;br /&gt;But for me this product was not so good.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough as I expected</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since I was 4 and this is the first lotion I have used that has stopped the inflamation and hasn&#x27;t required use of steroids.  It&#x27;s only my first week of using it, and the results have been great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. Works well and lasts long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a  nice lotion ever I have used.Actually I have used it for my two kids for eczema.</li>
    <li> It leaves a soft feeling on the skin and my skin also feels moist after applying to my skin.  The moist feeling stays that way for a while.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatric dermatologist recommended this and the body wash for what she thinks is eczema. I use Cetaphil for myself (facial wash, facial moisturizer, body bar) so that&#x27;s why I was confident in using this product for my baby when the derma recommended it.  Less than 24 hours after I used the Cetaphil Restoraderm on my 4 month old daughter, her rashes got even more inflamed and spread.  I returned the product right away (Not Amazon, but a local drugstore).  Lesson learned: use product on a small area first before trusting anyone that it works!  Now I use Baby Eucerin Aquaphor healing ointment and body wash to maintain my baby&#x27;s skin!  I won&#x27;t even attempt to use a product for baby when the it does not say \\&quot;for baby\\&quot;.  Adult skin is just way different!</li>
    <li> I spend summers in Canada and winters in Florida. My dermatologist in Canada recommended this product to me last summer to aid a small patch of Eczema on my hands. It works well. It is sold in Canada and USA. Name is slightly differnent in each country, but I am assured by corresponding with the manufacturer that the product is identical. Just different packaging.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin cream. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and my skin absorbs it with no greasy feeling. I used it on my toddler. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive to so many chemical ingredients in almost everything with which I come in contact. I can safely use Cetaphil Restoraderm and not worry about skin reaction. It is also a nice, thick moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. The price I get at Amazon beats the discount stores so I&#x27;m a happy girl.</li>
    <li> so much better than soap, especially in the autumn and winter.  My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil products, and she was right.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive to lotions to do years and years of horrible acne and using every acne product on the market.  This is the only face lotion that I will use and know my skin will not break out.</li>
    <li> I could tolerate nothing on my face until this.  Used with the Restoraderm cleanser, my face feels moisturized and silky for the first time in years.  At first the lotion feels like nothing special.  However, as the day wears on, my face feels more and more moisturized.  No irritation.  No more flakes.  Just be careful not to get any cleanser in the eyes or it burns like hell.</li>
    <li> In the winter, my fingers and knuckles get dry and cracked. This is the only moisturizer that has ever prevented that.</li>
    <li> Product was as orders and worked great.</li>
    <li> thank you.&lt;br /&gt;sorry, im late.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I was diagnosed with eczema late last year when I went to an allergist thinking my severe skin peeling and dryness were allergy related (the eczema was made worse by an allergy to methylchloroisothiazolinone which the Dr. diagnosed during the testing). A dermatologist physician&#x27;s assistant gave me a sample of Restoraderm lotion because it has ceramides.  My skin began go improve almost immediately.  I have a spare bottle on hand at all times.  I even use it as my morning and evening facial moisturizer (my face was a mess from the eczema). And, of course, it does not use methylchloroisothiazolinone as a preservative.  I only hope that it stays readily available.</li>
    <li> Very effective for eczema</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS IN MY SCALP FOR PSORIASIS AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU JESUS! IT WORKS! NO ITCHING OR SCALES!.</li>
    <li> Dr recommended it, I use it because of my sensitive skin and it really works. Not heavy when applied, doesn&#x27;t take much to work</li>
    <li> my 4 yr old has severe eczema and this lotion is amazing on his skin.  i would recommend to use this along with the cleanser.  My husband and myself also started using it and are amazed at how our skin looks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use on a scalp condition he&#x27;s had for around 30 years or more. The skin at the back of his head was always dark red and itched all the time.  You seldom saw him that he wasn&#x27;t scratching his head. He&#x27;s been using this product and the Restoraderm cleanser as a shampoo for two months.  Now the redness is nearly gone and he seldom feels any itching.  It&#x27;s a miracle.  He had used so many different prescription drugs that were quite expensive (over $250 after insurance for a small tube that lasted three months or less) so the price on this is like pennies.  Thank you, Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> I get really dry patches on my arms and stomach when seasons change and the weather gets colder. That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time for me to stop using fancy, heavily scented body washes, soaps and lotions and stick to the basics. I purchased this recently as my skin was getting itchy showering twice a day. The bottle is not big and I am sure I am using more of the lotion than recommended but it is definitely soothing and moisturizing. I am enjoying this scent free lotion and feel like I am doing something beneficial for my skin. I am a Cetaphil fan (face cleanser) and very happy with this purchase. Will most likely repurchase and most definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased for elderly relative on recommendation of her dermatologist.  Months later, she reports it helps a lot and plans on reordering routinely.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product has been great at helping with my infant&#x27;s eczema.  It was better for him than other lotions I have tried.  I even put it on his scalp.</li>
    <li> I am a 18 year old female and I started to see signs of acne at age 17. I began to try all sorts of products to clear my acne but my skin just began to get worse, especially on the forehead.  My skin was damaged and dry and I have very sensitive skin so it was hard to find something that didn&#x27;t irritate it.  My dermatologist gave me a sample of this stuff and I began to use it all over my face in the morning and at night after cleansing my face with kinerase gentle cleanser.  I absolutley love it! Its so moisturizing and gives me no breakouts.  Its not heavy and not greasy.  I really recommend it!:)</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used this on the dry, flaky skin on my hands, face, and neck where excema occurs. This was a poor life decision, as my entire face and neck are now broken out in hives. This happens with several other brands of moisturizer, but based on the dermatologist&#x27;s recommendations, I decided to give cetaphil restoraderm a try. Never using this again, I&#x27;m going back to yu-be, which works wonders and has never given me an adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> this works great for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> We purchase this lotion for our new born baby, as he has very dry skin, but I end up using it everyday for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It has no scent and dry very quickly to the point that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble with my skin in the last couple years, and this product has really helped to minimize outbreaks.</li>
    <li> it smells like milk and butter. so good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good product. I found significant  improvememt on the 4th day, I will keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Compare to other brands&#x27; eczema product and price is not bad also!</li>
    <li> Calmed down a lot of red irritation on my face.</li>
    <li> great body moisturizer. It make me soft.</li>
    <li> Its clear up my aczema I recommend it strongly no any prescription stuff works with me this one does million thumbs up</li>
    <li> Recently I went to a dermatologist because my face was red, dry, and itchy in places (especially around my nose and eyebrows). He said I had dermatitis and that it was difficult to treat. He gave me a prescription cream for the itching, which helped somewhat. After buying this lotion, however, the dermatitis cleared up; I have no more itching or redness. I have not needed to use the cream from the dermatologist. I also recommend the Cetaphil face wash-it is wonderful! There is no drying like some of the products made for the face. I was using Neutrogena for years, but my skin kept getting worse (especially since I moved to Montana).</li>
    <li> I like this product very attractive . Bye.</li>
    <li> Since I begin using this product all over my body each morning and evening, the itchy red spots that I was experiencing have disappeared.</li>
    <li> very good!!  this item has good moisturering ability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 3 weeks and it has really improved his eczema. It&#x27;s a dense lotion but not really greasy and it doesn&#x27;t bother his skin as some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I apply to my 2 1/2 yr olds after he showers (with the cetaphil restoraderm body wash) at night and  again when I get him dressed in the morning. He doesn&#x27;t like me applying it to his face so for that I use the HERO Stick by TruKids for that, it&#x27;s quick and he doesn&#x27;t mind it. Also, if you tend to put your child in the bath tub the Mustela Stelatopia Milky Bath Oil works great!</li>
    <li> Love It, Love It, Love It!!!  I initially bought and used this lotion for my granddaughter who has eczema (which this IS great for), but started using it by chance for my extra dry skin.  It worked so well for me that I too started using it, so although I  think this lotion is a little &amp;#34;pricey&#x27;,  it is worth the investment for us.  I have found that  there are larger sizes at places like Costco, so I started buying the lotion there.</li>
    <li> Ordered this blue pump head came seperated, I assume this is so it won&#x27;t leak in shipping. This lotion is so expensive; this is the cheapest price I could find.</li>
    <li> I have a 4 month old daughter and she developed eczema during her first 3 weeks. I tried some other brands, but this lotion really works! Thank you Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> My review for Restoraderm Calming Body Wash was meant for this product.  Best I have found at retaining moisture.</li>
    <li> Excellent industrial strength moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by my dermatologists and it works very very well. And since only a little bit is needed it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I don&#x27;t have eczema.  I DO live in New Mexico (it is very dry here and skin cracks in the winter.)  I got a sample of this from the esthetician at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office after I had a facial procedure.  The procedure left my skin (face and neck) slightly chapped for a few days.  WOW!  There is something different about this lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck.  I bought a full-size bottle at Costco so didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon but I wanted to leave a review as this is amazing for dry skin.  Since it was so great on my face and neck, I decided to put it on my winter-chapped hands and very dry feet.  Again, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;  It is hard to explain but this seems to put down a layer of moisture that is sealed.  I do have mild rosacea and actually have oily skin so if it was greasy, I would get zits.  Nope.  on my face, I put a primer on afterwards then mineral makeup and my 57-yr old face looks moisturized and smooth.  LOL, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of crows feet or laugh lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some other reviews, I&#x27;m going to try it on a couple of places around my ears and scalp that get itchy.  This is usually controlled by using dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a dermatologist, ask them for a sample.  Heck, call cetaphil and ask them to send you a sample.  I do wish that they had a sunscreen in it -- hopefully in the future.</li>
    <li> This is working so well on my hands.  It&#x27;s wintertime.  I have a new puppy, so I&#x27;m washing my hands a lot.  This moisturizer is keeping my hands in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face.  I have rosacea, and I have been very happy with my skin since I began using this product.  This really provides the kind of long-lasting moisture that my face needs.</li>
    <li> I use Restoraderm to combat winter chapping on my fingers and as a substitute for cortisone for related eczema. I am so happy to find something to use to help with the eczema instead of cortisone. Restoraderm is not as &#x27;strong&#x27; as cortisone, but with a couple uses a day, I keep my eczema problems at bay. Seems to provide a protective layer on the hands that lasts through several hand washings, but is not sticky once it sinks in.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been suffering from Eczema and we tried all types of creams/lotion available in the market including aquaphor, Eucerin, Vani cream, Aveeno mosituring lotion but it didnot help and only Cetaphil restoderm helped. Her eczema didnot clear up completely but atleast it didnot increase it, skin stayed moisturized and looked the same without any flare-ups.</li>
    <li> An excellent, fragrance free moisturizer. It provided immediate dermatitis relief. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found yet to keep my son&#x27;s eczema prone skin smooth and supple. We use morning and night and this lasts about 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> Very good Body Lotion for Atopic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this Body Lotion to my daughter and i very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This cream works well with my daughter&amp;#34;s skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s sticky and takes a while to soak in. otherwise o.k.</li>
    <li> This product is a real life saver. Tried numerous products before finding this one and haven&#x27;t tried anything else ever since. Initially used this after an oatmeal bath and it really works. Skin got super soft and more resilient to minor irritations. A real safe alternative to the steroids(Hydro-cortizone) commonly prescribed by doctors.&lt;br /&gt;Shared our complete experience of tackling our 3 month old baby&#x27;s eczema at kloudoscope dot com</li>
    <li> Great on my son&#x27;s eczema</li>
    <li> rich, not sticky. good!</li>
    <li> This is not a suggested buy.  Beware :&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s greasy and heavy.  If The patient has any open wounds from the eczema, it&#x27;s going to burn that area of the skin. I purchased this for a child under the age of two. This was not a good thing at all. And did not clear up anything</li>
    <li> My son was diagnosed with eczema last month. We tried everything to help his skin stay moist and to keep his skin from getting further irritated. Most everything else was way too greasy or it didn&#x27;t last long enough to moisturize his skin well. After asking the pharmacist if there was something better, she recommended Cetaphil. I was skeptical because everything else we had bought that says its for eczema and accepted by the NEA either was too greasy or just didn&#x27;t work. But, I figured I had already spent tons in other products, what&#x27;s one more? Well, I tell you.. after using this, along with the cleanser at night, for two days (plus a steroid in the REALLY bad spots), his dry patches are almost GONE. His cradle cap has completely cleared up as well. I won&#x27;t buy anything else now. We&#x27;re going to let his carelady use the old lotion (Aveeno Baby for Eczema) during the day for now just to finish it out, but then after that, we&#x27;re replacing it with this stuff. To me, it&#x27;s totally worth the price if it keeps him happy!</li>
    <li> Pro: The Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturize works great every time for since he was 3 months old for dry skin/atopic dermatitis/eczema, it last about 2 months and works best when combined with Eucerin to help trap the moisture into the skin.  We apply the moisturizer first and then Eucerin on top to all affected areas.  We saw improvement within 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: is It is expensive and cannot be used alone for really dry skin</li>
    <li> At first I used this lotion for my hands only as it kept them moisturized for a long time unlike so many other hand lotions that you need to reapply after 5 hours or so. But one night I got fed up with all these anti aging department store creams, lotions, organic oils whatever you name it I&#x27;ve tried it! Loads of $$ lost.....And nothing absolutely nothing made my face feel moisturized; every morning I woke up with a tight feeling skin. So I tried this Cetaphil restoraderm lotion on my face and at first it stung a bit and caused a minor break out. But that can happen when you try a new face lotion. Well, the result is phenomenal! Softer, supple, brighter, even toned younger looking skin and my face feels completely moisturized. I honestly think that Cetaphil brought my face back to the right Ph balance and now pple are surprised to hear I&#x27;m 49 years old.....they think im in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product, we can&#x27;t use regular baby lotion on grandbaby, have been using this since he was born, just LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for my 13 month. Work well to keep her skin smooth and hydrated. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> In 2012, I had some breathing issues and was hospitalized for a week. Apparently is was a resurfacing of an asthma issue I had as a child (I&#x27;m 61 now). Anyway, the asthma was accompanied by a moderate case of eczema (which I understand is a common thing). I had eczema breakouts all over (arms, legs, back, and chest). My dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream called Desoximetasone. Twice a day, I dabbed this cream on the eczema along with a moisturizer like Aveeno. A couple months ago, I came across this Cetaphil Eczema Calming Body Lotion and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s amazing. I apply it after taking a shower. My eczema has been reduced by 97%. I rarely use the steroid cream. I stopped using the Aveeno too and solely use the Cetaphil. As an experiment, I stopped the Cetaphil for a few days and the eczema started to return. This stuff is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer!  My son had some dry patches as a young baby and I&#x27;ve been using this on him (almost exclusively) since he was about 4 months old.  It&#x27;s more expensive but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s miraculous as red skin is perfectly moisturized skin overnight!  I&#x27;m a huge fan and at 2+ years old, my son uses it daily after his bath.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have moderate numular eczema, of which can be very stubborn.  This moisturizer is smooth, light, and comfortable.  It is not chalky or heavy.  This isn&#x27;t going to cure anything, but while using it with other medical treatments I noticed significant improvement over a few weeks.  I use it 2x per day on my body.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face, although I am sure it is fine to do so.  You do not have to have eczema to use this product - I would suggest it for anyone.  This product can be a bit pricey, but a little bit goes a long way.  It was really tough for me to switch away from a luxury brand moisturizer, but this is hands down the best I found.  I also recommend the bar soap.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more, but you know when they make something that actually works on everyone&#x27;s eczema, everyone will know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad at all, and for regular itchiness, it works great. I have MS and I get itchy skin and it helps with that, but is no miracle cure for the Exzema.  I wasn&#x27;t using the body wash in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy it again anyhow, because it alleviates the need to use the cortisone cream - so it&#x27;s a good product for the office. It absorbs well and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have scalp psoriasis (a autoimmune condition that causes scaly dry skin and can be aggravated by normal soaps and shampoos) I was prescribed a steroid ointment for my condition which did end up working...until I ran out and it set me back $50. I decided to try something else and I had heard good things about cetaphil for eczema and dermatitis problems so I gave this new product a shot. My head was a big red scaly mess and I was losing hair so I had nothing else to lose. I have use both the restoraderm lotion and the body wash for a month (yes on my scalp) and I am symptom free. I can&#x27;t say enough about how well it works.</li>
    <li> My 5 month old infant has very dry, flaking skin in patches from either cradle cap or eczema or both.  Whenever I used a product containing mineral oil or petrolatum, her condition would deteriorate.    This is one of the very few products I could find anywhere that works for eczema on infants but does not contain mineral oil or petrolatum.  It works very well at soothing her skin.  I use the lotion often and she drinks it up.  I only wish they would develop a thicker cream as well in this line, because I would use that product also.    I would highly recommend this to any infant with very sensitive or dry skin.  It is worth the price to relieve the dryness and itching.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother who suffers from skin disorders and didnt work for him. But Aveno did work, try that one first.</li>
    <li> I picked up a sample of this stuff at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and carried it around for a few days thinking it was cleanser. When I realized that it was moisturizer, I tried it on my face. I still had no idea it was for \\&quot;eczema prone skin.\\&quot; The moment I put it on, my skin felt wonderful, and even looked better (younger). So I bought a full-sized bottle today. It is not greasy at all but very emollient somehow. I&#x27;ve since tried it on my hands which are a little chapped from the cold weather. It is really lovely stuff! Almost miraculous. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Only thing that works on my daughter</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist for my Exzema.  It is fragrance free and goes on smoothly without having to rub it in so vigorously.  I have been using it for over 3 yrs along with their Restoraderm Bath Wash.  Great for all ages.  Love Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> It cleared up a lot of my eczema. Wish I could afford to buy it all the time? It felt good on!</li>
    <li> very cheap and as time goes by i will need more as the doctor recommend this for my son who has eczema real bad.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t offer any itch relief from my eczema, even when paired with the calming body wash. I&#x27;ll be looking for a stronger product.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this lotion for radiation skin care but started using it on my face. I really like how soft it makes my skin feel. I would definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used so many different skin products over the years - I have very dry skin and eczema/atopic dermatitis. The dermatologist recommended this and it was a bit difficult to find and it doesn&#x27;t feel great when you put it on, but the results are outstanding. My skin is not red and dry. It is smooth and natural color. Yay! I am over 50 and so happy to finally find something after soooo many years of trying different products.</li>
    <li> I use this with dove to save money.  I have eczema. I use this 2-3 times a week and use the dove one. it&#x27;s white has no smell and won&#x27;t clog you pours and for sanative skin and no fragments.  So doing that you will save money!</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. Dry skin and itching disappears. I have recommended this product to family and friends.IMG_20150214_210816.jpg</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil Restoraderm lotion and body wash were prescribed to use for my baby&#x27;s eczema. We also had an initial Rx cream (more like an oil) that we used at first to get his eczema under control, but it was extremely messy and had a lot of warnings on the label that scare you when applying to an infant! We lotion him up with this after each bath and he rarely ever has an eczema flair up any longer. The lotion goes on smooth and is easy to apply. I am so glad I found this online because I had a really tough time finding it in a store, and the doctor said it had to be the Restoraderm name, not just regular Cetaphil lotion.  Do note that on the back of each of the bottles is a $2 off coupon for the body wash(and vise versa, a coupon for the lotion on the back of the wash), which you could use in-store if you can find it.</li>
    <li> I had to use this lotion after another brand and product caused red blotches and dry patches on my pregnant belly.  This calm my skin condition.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion. I use it daily after showering, and myeczema has calmed down significantly. I won&#x27;t go w/out this lotion!</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing</li>
    <li> Slightly heavier than I expected, however gets absorbed well and leaves hands&lt;br /&gt;Cannot comment on eczema bc I don&#x27;t have the condition, but I have very dry hands bc I work in the medical field and I wash my hands 100 times a day and this cream is good for my hands</li>
    <li> Exceptional Product!  Cetaphil is a leader in skin products and this one is a great moisturizer and gentle for all skin types.  I use it all over, especially in the winter and it helps immensely.</li>
    <li> This is working well with my keratosis pilaris.  It&#x27;s smooth and thick and soaks in pretty quickly without leaving a greasy residue.  Once it is on, I don&#x27;t notice it, but the moisture lasts for a long time.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This lotion reduces redness and itching better than just about any OTC lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve used all the big names. My only slight gripes are that it doesn&#x27;t last too long and is rather expensive for the quantity you get. I would pair this with a cheaper moisturizer, applying the Cetaphil to only the most irritated areas of your skin that are dying to see visible improvement. Safe for sensitive skin and face.</li>
    <li> Really helps to calm my eczema. Works the best when compared to other lotions and creams I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My 15mo has eczema and since I started her on this cheaper alternative, I&#x27;ve found that it helps control her eczema from acting up. Love that it is fragrant free and light on the skin. But I&#x27;m a little disapointed that Amazon no longer ships this to singapore free. I&#x27;m not sure why but I hope some day it would change its mind.</li>
    <li> My son started to have eczema since he was 4 months old (he&#x27;s now 2y4m). For the past 2 years, putting aquaphor and hydrocortisone has become part of our daily routine. Some doctors suggested Dove&#x27;s plain soup but it didn&#x27;t work. Some suggested doing some allergy tests by removing some potential allergens from his diet, such as milk, eggs, cheese..etc. I tried most of them and it did improve his skin condition a little bit but not significantly. After he has been on soymilk for three months, I googled to the website of National Eczema Association. They highly recommend Cetaphil Restoraderm series. I tried body wash and this restoring moisturizer. WOW, most of the rash on his arms were GONE after about a week. Rashes on his legs were still there and I suspected it was due to daily bathing in the hot water. So I reduced the frequency of his baths and also lower the water temperature. Also keep using the body wash and moisturizer. Now most of the eczema on his legs are not obvious. I am soooooooooooo happy and highly recommend Cetaphil Restoraderm products to those who suffer from eczema.</li>
    <li> I have actinic keratosis and horrible dry skin to go along with it.  The keratosis produces white scaly patches on my skin that get itchy and red.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers to no avail.  This stuff works!  It keeps my skin moisturized and soft.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and absorbs fast.  It also doesn&#x27;t take a ton of it to work into your skin.  I only wish it came in a tube, because I go to the pool 3x a week and don&#x27;t like taking a bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Moisturizer is a great product!  It gently helps to restore damaged skin to a healthy condition.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone who needs a decent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It seems to have done the trick with my eczema.</li>
    <li> My son has atopic eczema and this is the only product that helped. I am not comfortable using cortisone too often, and this product, combined with the lotion, made his skin clear within a week or so. Note: his eczema is very mild, and is typically only during winter months.</li>
    <li> Very good! Good quality! Good price! I love it!</li>
    <li> Dont know if it helps my Eczema better than others, but it sure it expensive.  Doesn&#x27;t feel as greasy as some others.</li>
    <li> This Really Helps! This is the first product which actually help me with my &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; skin problem.</li>
    <li> I have Excema really bad. This is soothing and very gentle. My face can even tolerate it. My skin is very dry and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> UPDATED: Our son is three now. This lotion still works flawlessly. One note: It can sting. Blow on the skin after applying; it takes the sting away.     ORIGINAL: I&#x27;ve never written a review before (though I use them constantly). This product gave me such peace of mind that I had to come tell others. Our son got eczema when he was about six months old. It was scary--not just becuase it looked so painful, but also because anything could have been causing it and we didn&#x27;t know where to start. We used steroid creams for about six weeks, which helped a good bit but certainly didn&#x27;t cure the eczema--and no one could give us a good answer on how long the steriods were safe to use (the package said two weeks; the doctor said longer). The doctor finally recommended this product: \\&quot;You have to get the Restoraderm, not the regular Cetaphil. Use it twice a day, every day.\\&quot; We did. The eczema went away COMPLETELY. No greasy residue (Aquaphor--ugh--greasy and ineffective), no odd smell, nothing. When we ran out in the early days, the eczema would come back within two days; our son is 14 months old now and can go a few weeks without it before some little spots start to appear. This lotion is given a relatively high safety rating on the skindeep website--even higher than so-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; eczema lotions. Amazon is by far the cheapest place to buy, and it&#x27;s finally on Subscribe and Save. If you&#x27;re not having success with other eczema treatments, please try this.</li>
    <li> By far the best moisturizer ever! Very gentle, no odor at all! Skin is supple and feels awesome for most of the day. You will love, love , love it!!![[ASIN:B003TQU1Q0 Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer, 10-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by my daughter doctor. She has atopic eczema and have used a variety of cream. This does a good job in moisturising her skin.  I got 3 bottles and have already ordered another 3 for her.</li>
    <li> My skin is much better since I started using this product on the advice of my doctor.  You need to use it regularly to notice any benefits.</li>
    <li> Our baby was getting rough dry skin patches on the creases of her elbows and knees.  Within a week or so of using this lotion, all traces of the dry patches were gone.  We have tried many other lotions in the past, including the cetaphil cream.  This lotion proved best for the stubborn irritated dry patches.</li>
    <li> Helped my mother get rid of some eczema related sores. She has reordered it twice now and uses this exclusively now.Recommended by dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Works great. Came recommended to me by my dermatologist friend.</li>
    <li> This works so well after showering. I have dermatitis and a bit of eczema I would usually use a different common body lotion that would  leave my skin blotchy, red and severely itchy. Using this moisturizer not only moisturizes my skin but also leaves it much less red and barely itchy. I will definitely be buying this again once I run out. It is a little oily/greasy when you first apply it but it absorbs into the skin well enough.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had the worst eczema for over a yeae, this cleared it right up!</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump didn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
    <li> I am about 15 months into Topical Steroid Withdrawal or Red Skin Syndrome from the overuse of topical steroids and my skin was dry and red and flakey.  It was stagnant and not healing and I was beyond frustrated.  I got this from my derm and tested it on my left wrist.  After just 2 applications that day, it was noticeably different.  I then used it on my face and neck after a few days and significant improvement.  It was so unbelievable to me that I questioned whether or not  it secretly had steroids in it.  After several days I am LOVING the improvement of the moisture in my skin.  VERY surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:  This product does burn if your skin barrier is compromised.  The wash stings until you rinse and then, of me, it is instant relief.  The lotion Also stings on highly effected eczema ti areas and can make my skin red initially, but it always calms to a great moisturized but not greasy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for a long time on my face. My toddler has a problem with dry skin and nothing seemed to work/protect. This was my last stop for a better moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First, I thought this would be a good moisturizer for my face. And I assumed it was for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, no where on the bottle did it say it was for your face. So I was to worried to put it on. (pore clogging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it has smoothed my arms quite well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my arms and legs, and it makes them very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily in my baby´s body and face. It is excellent. Whenever her skin is a little red, I apply more than once a day and it gets better very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema on my hands and legs for years. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products - from a prescription steroid to holistic oils and creams - nothing has cleared up my eczema like this product. I also take a Vitamin E pill daily, the combination of the two has been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific cream for awhile now.  It is great for sensitive skin after showering with Cetaphil regular bar soap.  I told my dermatologist and she said that is exactly what she uses.</li>
    <li> Great product! I moisturizes the driest skin. I love that it is not perfumed, too.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see an improvement  after using this product on my children who have excema. The dry spots look better instantly and they have fewer flare ups. I only wish it came in a larger size since I use it on all my children.</li>
    <li> feels sticky. not good for countries in tropical weather</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I use it everyday and my itchy skin is a thing of the past! YAY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema since I was born.  Never in my life have I found a lotion that moisturizes like Cetaphil Restoraderm.  Trust me, I have tried even the most hard to find lotions and cream.  This is only one in 5 products that the NEA have suggested for use on sensitive eczema skin.  And it&#x27;s worth the price.  Yes, in the beginning, it feels a little light, but after 3 weeks of use, my skin does not have the dryness and inflammation that occurs with every other over the counter product I&#x27;ve tried.  Normally, each week I have to use a steroid ointment to settle my skin from the past week.  Not so with this product.  Every time you switch products, the body needs to re-adjust to the new ingredients.  I wish Cetaphil made something like this for the face.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my mother who has very sensitive and dry skin. It&#x27;s probably the only thing that works for her. I buy the moisturizer to pair with it. Been buying this for my mom for three years now.</li>
    <li> My 8 month old son has eczema that started at about 2 months old.  In addition to the usual red, flaky, dryness, his opens and weeps in some spots (my poor baby!). I have tried EVERYTHING....$90 prescription moisturizers, homeopathic remedies, slathering him with the inside of an aloe leaf and shea butter... I could put a down payment on his first car with the amount I have spent on creams and nothing has helped except topical prescription steroid creams, which I hate to use and are not safe for continued use.  He is classified by his dermatologist as having \\&quot;severe\\&quot; eczema.  I tried this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist and was pleasantly surprised at just how well it moisturized.  We usually keep him slathered in Vaseline or Aquaphor at all times (making for a slippery, shiny, baby with stains all over his clothes), but this is WAY better.  It absorbs well and leaves the skin \\&quot;soft as a baby&#x27;s butt\\&quot;!   Nice and smooth, and the pump on it makes it much more convenient then the tubs some of the other stuff comes in.  I must mention that although it moisturizers well, it is not as effective at decreasing his inflammation, and he is still red in some spots, but no longer dry flaky and way less itchy.  I imagine this also has to do with the fact that his eczema is severe, and someone who has mild to moderate eczema might have total relief from it.  Regardless, this is by far the best product we have tried so far and way more convenient then waiting 30 days for my insurance to improve the newest, most expensive prescription moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is great for my skin, and I have tried so many creams and lotions that I lost count.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing ability is shining.</li>
    <li> Love this product, this is the best price I can find.</li>
    <li> It has improved my skin condition and has a long time moisturizing, my skin feels better now( I have serious eczema )</li>
    <li> I have been a long time sufferer of Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema for years now. I am 34 years old now but have had it since I was about 3-4 years old. I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists throughout the city and they tell me the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing research on the National Eczema Association website, I found Cetaphil&#x27;s Lubriderm. I&#x27;ve always liked Cetaphil&#x27;s cream and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is probably the one lotion that has helped really restore the moisture in my skin and helped my eczema!  Use this along with the Cetaphil Restoraderm Cleanser and you&#x27;ll notice a significant different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Since 10 years old, I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema. My bout with this annoying skin disease has cost me a fortune when it comes to finding things to moisturize my dry itchy skin. Cetaphil is one of the only lotions/moisturizers out there that helps with my dry eczema skin. It does the job when it comes to moisturizing my dry skin real well and it does not leave a greasy feeling. It&#x27;s also good enough to use on the face as an alternative to face moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I wish I had taken photos.  The skin on my face and neck is prone to eczema, rough dry patches and is normally covered in bright red blotches.  To make matters worse, I have allergies to many of preservatives and chemicals in face creams and lotions. I discovered Cetaphil through Reddit after reading a poster rave about the product.  For a cost this low, I thought I would try it. I had little to no expectation that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, its been three days since my first use and it is honestly like I had a skin transplant.  My face and neck are the exactly the same color as the rest of me!!  Zero eczema, no trace of dehydrated skin, no flakes, just soft, silky, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it has taken me this long to find this stuff, but I am so happy I have.  Sincerely the best stuff out there for skin like mine.  I wash with DHC Cleansing Oil and use this product in the morning and at night.  No break-outs or problems.  Just pretty skin.  It sort of rocks!</li>
    <li> Very nice item yiyeotda practical and affordable prices&lt;br /&gt;Well I will use&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad a good deal doeseo</li>
    <li> My baby was born with rashes and his pediatrician diagnosed him having an eczema. The pediatrician recommended this lotion, Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer to be applied as necessary in lieu of ordinary baby lotions. She advised me to use it with Cetaphil Restoraderm Body Wash and Hydrocortisone 1% Lotion. I wash my baby twice daily (morning and night) and followed by cetaphil &amp; hydrocortisone 1% cream. I only use the steroids for a week and after that I stick with cetaphil body wash and cetaphil lotion. Now, my baby boy is 4months and 2weeks.... His skin is silky smooth and well moisturize! This product is so effin AMAZING!!!! I even use this, myself since I have an Atopic Dermatitis and works great for me, too! Our family is in love with Cetaphil products because of the efficiency and effectivity! I will certainly continue using this product and recommend to others!!!</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes that this would help after reading all of the reviews. I should have known better. My five month old has eczema most on his stomach. I just used this on him and his spots became angry red and he started screaming. There&#x27;s a couple different alcohols listed in the ingredients which could be why it was burning him. WHY can&#x27;t a company make something to help people with this condition that isn&#x27;t full of harsh ingredients!!!!!!????? More money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion. I was having severe, angry, itchy, eczema outbreaks on my jaw line and cheeks due to the dry weather and too hot showers. I tried everything, from Dr. Weil&#x27;s Mega-Mushroom line at Origins to plain shea butter with lavender and NOTHING helped. I would always wake up to dry skin and nasty rashes. But this stuff is a God-send. I finally wake up to skin that is smooth, soft, supple, and looks fabulous. I have acne-prone skin and I find that I have to be very careful about what I use so it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. This stuff fits the bill!    I kept reading about ceramides and niacinamide for antiaging and strengthening the skin&#x27;s lipid barriers to prevent pollution damage, increase resilience, etc. So needless to say I was so excited when I saw this had all of the ingredients needed for healthy, moisturized skin and it doesn&#x27;t  include parabens (eeeek...exciting!) That is NOT the case for CeraVe FYI.    Bottom line? Buy this stuff pronto if you have dry skin and/or are concerned about keeping your skin healthy for years to come. From my knowledge, this lotion does it all.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked after only two days of use. Its as if the eczema on my arms disappeared ! It definitely moisturized well and took the itch away ! Only downfall is buying in the store is super expensive, but, I would keep buying it over and over because it is that good !</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion along with the body wash on my baby boy since he was an infant.  He is now 18 months old, and we still use it daily. My baby had eczema on his face and some on his body in the early months.  I tried other moisturizers: Eucerin, Aquaphor which is totally greasy and made it worse, and Aveeno Baby Eczema Cream.  The Restoraderm body wash and lotion were recommended by my pediatric dermatologist. We use both daily.  The lotion is very rich and moisturizing without being too greasy. It works well with the body wash.  The body wash is gentle with low foam and little smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use both the wash and the lotion, I cannot say definitively that this lotion eliminated my son&#x27;s eczema alone. I would not say it is a &#x27;cure&#x27; for eczema, but it definitely improves the condition of the skin for faster healing.  I do recommend using both in tandem. It seems that my son&#x27;s skin began to look healthier over time and today he rarely has any eczema outbreaks. His skin is nice and smooth now, especially on his cheeks. I am so glad we found this solution for us because I did not want to use steroidal creams on a daily basis. The prescription cream that we used sparingly and rarely was desonide.  This lotion and body wash really made a difference and prevented us from having to rely solely on a steroid cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion and wash are sometimes hard to find in stores, and are very expensive when you do find them. If you use it on a regular basis and don&#x27;t have time to run around town searching for them, I recommend Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save feature. Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I have found. If you are in a pinch, the Aveeno Baby Eczema Cream is a good alternative, but is a tad lighter although I do like the Aveeno on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, please test this product and any other product on your baby before slathering it all over to ensure there is no allergic reaction to the product.  There is always the potential for the rare occurrence of an allergic reaction.  I hope that this product works for the vast majority of babies/people.  It definitely works for us!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good. Works well for itching skin</li>
    <li> This was the lotion that my sons pediatrician recommended I tried it and after just two uses my sons eczema the redness was down by 35 % after just two uses! We have tried other more expensive lotions we&#x27;ve even tried one with Manuka honey in it , that was $40 for only 8oz ! That did not help my sons eczema , although it was a great face lotion .&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil restorderm calms eczema down fast! Reddness reduced in just a few uses. Its still light weight lotion , not super greasy . its is slightly oily gives of a slight shine on the skin . anyway best product iv used yet ! Very affordable</li>
    <li> good product.  we use it all the time.</li>
    <li> My son has bad eczema that was flaring up with other brands. My dermatologist recommended this and the Cetaphil Restoraderm soap. Plus, she said she uses it on her little girl. It is a fantastic product -- moisturizes without a wet or greasy feeling. Absorbs very well. Great for little ones -- my son was 3 when we started using it.</li>
    <li> I guess skin products are really dependent on your skin type, absorption, etc. It works fine as a normal lotion but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s especially helpful on eczema.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i bought this hoping it would help my husbands excema. He Started seeing a huge difference in one week- the skin no longer looked rough and cracked and became very soft. He no longer has the urge to scratch the area. Now after one month of use you can hardly tell he had it. After suffering for two years and seeing a dermatologist its great to finally see something work.  This is so amazing!</li>
    <li> It smells good my baby love it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t solve my eczema issue on my face, but still use it overall as a moisturizer. Not a bad product.</li>
    <li> It does nothing to control the itch of my atopic eczema. it burns when i put it on and it is very thin and watery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I have tried just about everything.  Found this on Amazon and read reviews.  If Amazon can&#x27;t deliver this on time I will buy it locally.  I have seen in drugstore outlets but never paid much attention to it.  Read the reviews here and click and ordered.  This stuff has been excellent for my severe dry skin.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product by a skin specialist. Saw improvement after 1 week usage so we proceed to buy another 6 bottles. Unfortunately after 1 week plus, his skin have an open scratch upon using it on him,it  caused him to scream and cry in pain. After that there&#x27;s no noticeable improvement in his condition but pain every time we apply the moisturizer on him.</li>
    <li> I have bad flaky Eczema for years. There was a major transformation after 3 days of use. Only facial lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Moisture will last a couple of days if you let it.</li>
    <li> My son has been using these for quite sometime and his itchy skin is all gone.</li>
    <li> My 3 month old had very dry skin on his legs and arms.  This moisturizer took it away....I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has inherited my tendency to develop Atopic dermatitis. In fact, her hands break out just like mine did when I was younger. Now, my hands and arms are affected by Atopic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way, she used this moisturizer on her hands at night, with cotton gloves to help moisturize her skin, and within days her hands had healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately two days ago my arms started to develop Atopic dermatitis so I tried this moisturizer. Literally overnight my skin had returned to normal. I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? You bet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my legs, and for years have used regular lotion to help keep it from itching so much. I went in to my dermatologist after a many year hiatus, and he told me about this new type of lotion developed just for eczema patients. When I use it daily I have almost no new outbreaks of legions, and I am almost never itchy.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.. A must for our family. My baby&#x27;s dry flakey skin clears up immediately after use.. I have even used it on my face when it feels really dehydrated and tight. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review on anything, but I feel so thankful for this product that I thought I should! I am 32 and have had mild sebehorric dermatitis on my face all my life. I have tried at least 40 different products on my face (including other cetaphil products) and have reacted to them all.  My face burns and turns bright red with all products.  This stuff is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t look or feel like anything special, but leave it on and it works! My face still gets slightly red, but nothing like other products.  Winters are usually horrible for me, but with this moisturizer it&#x27;s no problem.  Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with Restoraderm soap. I like the product. I also use it on my face now. It works much better than any of my brand name facial creams. I personally think Aquaphor is the best of all, but it is very greasy and can&#x27;t use it everyday all over the body and face (for baby or me) so I use Aquaphor to treat any skin conditions (rough skin, small blisters, rashes, redness etc) and in diaper area for baby (I highly recommend this. it works wonders if you apply it after every diaper change. Helps prevent diaper rash, as well as keep that sensitive area soft and supple) and use this lotion for everyday use, after bathing baby or anytime her skin feels dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame how it gets really expensive to buy it in Brazil, where it goes to 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good cream for babies with sensitive skin.  Our little one needed something thicker.  I am hoping once his eczema gets better we can start using these again.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works magnificently! My dry feet were cracking and all but bleeding. Two days and they&#x27;re oh so much better! Perfectly satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product works so well for my son who suffers slightly from eczema.. so much cheaper herev than pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. I use it on my face too!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. So far this is the only product that I have bought that actually works and keeps her skin moisturized</li>
    <li> My doctor remconmended this for my 4 year old some who has excema... What a blessing it has been to have this in 4 days it is all but gone.. SO worth the price.. Best money i have spent on trying to help with his problem..I also love the body wash.. It helps so much.</li>
    <li> For me, many hand &amp; body lotions feel greasy or heavy.  Not this.  Feels very light; feels good to put it on, even right after a shower.  A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> Please see my review of this product under it&#x27;s companion product, Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Wash.  I can&#x27;t live without them both.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer for my eczema prone skin that Ihave used.  Believe me, after a life long struggle with eczema that is saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye Bye itchy hello Ahhhhhhh!!!!!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, but covers well.  For very dry skin, you may need to apply it twice daily, but it is one of the best lotions out there for problematic skin types.</li>
    <li> May I know the expiry date as well?</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using this body lotion exclusively for the last 2 years.  I discovered it after an excruciating summer with a bad case of folliculitis and an allergic reaction to some medication.  My entire body was covered in hives for some time and my skin was not happy.  This lotion is gentle and helped calm my skin down.  I love that Amazon includes it in the subscribe and save program.  I always keep an extra bottle or 2 of it on hand so I never run out.  I highly recommend it not just for eczema but also for anyone with sensitive skin or if you are dealing with folilculitis.</li>
    <li> My 14 month old son has had eczema on his entire body since 6 weeks of age. We were sent to dermatologists, we checked for many food allergies, we tried different formulas. The verdict was that he had no allergies, just eczema, and that it was likely caused by something in the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We switched to Bounce free &amp; clear dryer sheets and a free &amp; clear detergent as well. These two things helped tremendously but he still had constant eczema and itched a lot. It occasionally became infected so we looked for every cure we could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried Cerave, Aveeno, multiple types of Eucerin, Vanicream and Vaniply, California Baby, Johnson &amp; Johnson baby oil, etc etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN... we tried Cetaphil Restoraderm based on the reviews (frankly, it all has amazing reviews, you just have to find what works for you). This stuff did the trick instantly. We&#x27;ve been using it for months and we saw an immediate change. His skin *healed* and became SOFT, which absolutely never happened with any other lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now 14 months old and has zero eczema on his legs, arms and body. He has it on his face but it has calmed down about 30% with the use of this lotion mixed half and half with petroleum jelly. We&#x27;re on our third bottle and simply could not be happier with this product. I hope it never ever ever is discontinued!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a mom/friend who noticed my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema (inner elbows and wrist). I have tried nearly everything with only moderate success: CA Baby Calendula Cream, Babyganics, Aquaphor, Episcencial and Aveeno. This has by far been the most suceessful at preventing reoccurance. I use it along with the bodywash. It keeps my daughter&#x27;s skin soft and well moisturized. I use it in the mornings and after evening showers. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
    <li> best for eczema and dry skin, newborns up to adults.  our dermatologist recommended it and we LOVE it. been using on whole family for two years now.</li>
    <li> The best moisturising ever! Love it! Recommend it! Everyone should have one! Perfect for dry skin! Baby, kids, adult etc...</li>
    <li> amazing.  relief nearly instantly.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got it fast but son is allergic</li>
    <li> I have paid a lot more money for moisturizer and this product is great for one-fourth the price!.  My dermatologist recommended it and I&#x27;m glad he did.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to me along with the companion product, the body wash. The lotion is very soothing and non-greasy. I use it along with prescription medications - it goes on last. I keep a bottle in the kitchen as well as on my night table. My palms were dry, raw, cracked and peeling. With the help of this lotion, they have completely cleared up. I highly recommend this product. And thank you, Amazon, for having the lowest price around!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended to use daily with the matching body wash to get rid of severe eczema on my 2 year old... cleared it up in less than a week!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very mild excema and my dermatologist recommended this. I looked it up on the EWG website and was thrilled to see it rated so low. Then I tried it and was even more thrilled! I rarely have rashes break out (as long as I use a good quality lotion regularly) but I itch constantly. This stopped the itching!! And my skin feels so soft. At my last skin checkup my dermatologist said my skin looked great. I do use coconut oil at night a couple times a month. But this lotion has been incredible for me!</li>
    <li> The only lotion that has worked for my daughters eczema.</li>
    <li> After trying several over the counter ointments recommended by my daughter&#x27;s pediatrician and dermatologist, we finally found an over the counter product that works to manage her eczema. Thanks to this product, I&#x27;ve been able to minimize the amount and frequency of use of steroid ointments.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found in a while but my skin is really dry and it&#x27;s flaky again within 18-24 hours.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything out there that can heal it completely as I&#x27;ve tried so many things.</li>
    <li> My son was suffering from baby eczema and nothing worked for my 1 yr old except for this Cetaphil Restoraderm.  Our pediatrician recommended it and also used Cetaphil wash.  His eczema is much better and almost gone next day.  His skin is back to baby smooth &amp; soft again.  I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;ve tried Aquaphor, Curel anti-itch and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Used to be itchy right out of the shower. Now I&#x27;m not :)&lt;br /&gt;Also, sometimes the tops of my thighs above my knees would start itching for no apparent reason. Seems that using this lotion has stopped that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Happy as a clam!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion, of about 12 that we&#x27;ve tried, that gave my son great results within days! When I applied it on my dry skin I noticed a bit of a sting/tingle, not too bad, but maybe it&#x27;s because it so effective. I&#x27;m so happy my son&#x27;s skin feels like baby&#x27;s skin again! I put it all over his body and on his face and have no complaints :)</li>
    <li> It is not Restoraderm at all, It doesn&#x27;t really calm the Eczema. It seems it is not original. Never buy it again.</li>
    <li> i luv my cetaphil it gos on nice when i put it on it go right in to my skin last all day  i have itching skin i have the bodywash to i took a bath got out put this on man it stop my itching some people said it burn it did not burn me at all every skin is different so i can only speak for me i luv it i pray that every body find what they need for there skin peace.</li>
    <li> This lotion, while not cheap, appears to be helping my sever dry skin when no other lotion I have tried worked.  I can put it on the problem spots and it seems to keep them moist all day.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my eczema prone skin, highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Use this after using the calming body wash and your skin will be happy!</li>
    <li> More of a lotion than a cream, which is what I was hoping for. Would get again.</li>
    <li> Good for dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s extremely sensitive skin. It is easily absorbed into the skin and keeps it soft and moisturizer all day.</li>
    <li> This is the best hydrance cream, it recovers your skin glow.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for my hands, which are easily irritated by too much hand- and dish-washing, dry weather, and even &amp;#34;the unknown&amp;#34; that cause cracks and other uncomfortable red flare-ups.  I use this after every hand-wash.  It soaks in pretty quickly, and does not leave any greasy feel or scent.  I even ordered a bottle for my elderly mother whose fingers were painfully cracked this winter with the dry weather and all the extra dish-washing she was doing around the holidays (nope, she won&#x27;t slow down!).  Anyway, this lotion worked for great for her, too.  The only place I can find it is here on Amazon.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, which arrived promptly and in good condition.  This moisturizer is non-greasy, and feels amazing on the skin.  It is a great facial moisturizer, and I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Purchased this by mistake thinking it was the Cetiphil Body Wash. I decided to keep &amp; use it. Have to say that this works great for dry sensitive skin or minor skin irritations. However, your skin does feel sticky for a time after using.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy but very smooth.  It feels nice after.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I use it for eczema on my hands along with the wash. Does a great job, and the size of this product is a good value for your money.</li>
    <li> good product, very fulfilled in delivery</li>
    <li> I recommend if you try this, try it on a small patch of skin first. My pediatrician gave this to us to try because my 3 month old has been suffering with eczema for the past month. We have tried Aveeno Eczema Cream, coconut oil, Eucerin, Baby Aquaphor, cornstarch, hydrocortisone, Johnson&#x27;s Natural, SheaMoisture, and this. Of those, he was allergic to the SheaMoisture and this. Aveeno did nothing (actually it caused a breakout after the weather got warmer), the coconut oil caused some irritation, the Aquaphor kept things from getting worse, the cornstarch actually calmed the redness down but his skin was still scaly and rough, and Johnsons dried him out. The only thing that has worked is a Eucerin/hydrocortisone combo (TEMPORARILY). With the SheaMoisture, my baby just broke out and dried up. With this lovely Cetaphil, he started screaming IMMEDIATELY. Kicked his feet so hard, his butt was lifting off the changing table. Tears and limbs were flying! After an emergency bath, he was covered in hives everywhere the lotion touched. I couldn&#x27;t believe he had such a HORRIBLE reaction to this stuff. Turns out, there is an ingredient that contains macadamia oil (or something like that) SO if you have any kind of nut allergy this will certainly ruin your day. I&#x27;ve heard others complain about a stinging/burning with this but it didn&#x27;t seem to accompany hives. My baby has a nut allergy, so he got both. The day the pediatrician gave us this lotion was the day my baby went in to get blood work done to test for allergies, so I had no idea this was an issue until the results came back today. Shame the doctor didn&#x27;t think of it...&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED NOTE: We have been using Triple Cream Eczema Care for a little over a week or so now and it seems to be doing wonders.  There is still some redness that comes and goes but it is SIGNIFICANTLY better and I don&#x27;t have to slather him up with a prescription.</li>
    <li> I have had chronic eczema issues throughout my life. This has been the only non steroid solution that has kept my condition under control. Since using this lotion routinely I have not had to see the dermatologist in over three years.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon but I bought it after reading the reviews on amazon, so I felt like writing one to add to the wealth of review on amazon.  This is an EXCELLENT moisturizer.  I first got introduced with cetaphil when my daughter was newborn and broke out in rashes with any and every other baby product I used.  The pediatrician recommended Cetaphil products and we got hooked.  However, I still used more expensive department store bough facial products (i.e., cleanser and moisturizer).  However, after this harsh winter, my facial skin got really dry and started getting flaky.  The make up won&#x27;t stay on and the skin will begin to flake off by mid afternoon.  I tired all sorts of ultra-moisturizing (and also ultra-expensive) creams I could get my hands on at the the department stores (clinique, estee lauder, origins, and the likes), but nothing seemed to help.  Then I saw this at the drug store, quickly checked out the review from my phone and bought it.  It worked wonders.  Just in 3 days, my facial skin is back to it&#x27;s normal self.  It&#x27;s soft and feels great and I have said goodbye to the flaky stuff.  Excellent product.  It is very thick and really meant for super dry skin.  Now that my skin is back to normal and it&#x27;s getting warm out, I might switch to using this as a night cream, but I will certainly continue using it.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion.  I received a sample a few years ago and have been hooked ever since.  I initially used it to heal my extremely dry and cracked hands in the winter.  I put the lotion on my hands each night before bed.  No other lotion has worked for me to keep my skin intact when the weather is cold and dry.  I also put it on my face just because it makes skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works very well for me as I have severe eczema. I also use other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried several others. It works very well on this 60 something&#x27;s dry skin. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of lotion to alleviate my eczema but nothing seems to work until my dermatologists recommended me this lotion. I use this together with the body wash. I just hope that they have a bigger size (30 oz) that is not too expensive. I found one here in amazon, unfortunately it&#x27;s about $ 80.oo.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with fast delivery by DHL even year ending holidays.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used before but I expect it is more effective for sensitive my daughter skin.</li>
    <li> great for very dry skin. I also use it on my face and have not found any better.</li>
    <li> My son has allergy and he couldn&#x27;t sleep well in night because itchy.&lt;br /&gt;With this produce, it seems the itchness is a bit reduced and he can sleep better.</li>
    <li> Use it my self and my son, it a fantastic cream does what is required, keep skin moisturized, it helps me not to scratch, its also absorbed quickly in the skin. It&#x27;s been helping the areas affected by the eczema to recover nicely, takes time and constant use but it has good results.</li>
    <li> I like the product but have not had it long enough to know if it will completely heal  what I am putting it on.  It has helped so far and may take care of the problem in the long run.  It is very rich and yet goes into the skin without leaving to much of a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> This one is Not as effective as Cerave moisturizing cream, I highly recommend Cerave for Eczema treatment.  The cetaphil makes my daughter&#x27;s skin smoother but not really has the same effect of keeping her skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin and this cream hydrates perfectly and does not have any bad oddor. My dermatologist has recommended it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion that I can find for my wife who has sensitive skin and the anytime someone comes over that needs lotion. Because of the nature of the lotion I know that I can let anybody borrow it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference in my eczema.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for people with eczema. It works especially well on your face. My eczema cleared up around the eyes, but the eczema didn&#x27;t totally disappear on my arms. If you apply larger quantities it will eventually go away though. I was pleased with the results and definitely helped!</li>
    <li> A miracle for my psoriasis and my dry skin in general. I&#x27;ve given this as a gift to someone who simply has dry skin and they are hooked.</li>
    <li> This lotion is smooth and non-greasy.  It works wonderfully on the eczema on my face and feels so good when I put it on.  I can feel my skin drinking it in.  Many lotions burn open eczema but this does not burn.  It is gentle enough for the infant eczema on my grandson&#x27;s cheeks also - he arrives with very red, burnt, chapped cheeks but by the end of the day and 3 applications his skin is no longer red and on its way to healing.  I love this lotion.  I already use the gentle soap in the bath and have pump bottles of gentle facial cleaner in the bathrooms and at the kitchen sink for hand washing.  Between all my Cetaphil products it may be a good winter for my eczema despite the wood stove!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Best on the market. Could sell in bundle packages, for people who uses it in a continuous way.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a good product for my daughter who suffers from mild eczema but I was wrong. As soon as I applied it on her arms she started screaming that it hurts. So I immediately wiped it and washed her arms. I never thought Cetaphil would make this kind of product. They should be aware of this. I would suggest anyone who tries this to try it in a small area before they start lathering it in their body. I am pretty sure this product is not for very sensitive skin especially with eczema.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist has wife using and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used for my baby.  I will buy more of this later for sure!</li>
    <li> best for eczema and acne-prone skin.  my dermatologist recommended it for anywhere on the body, including my acne-prone face.  it&#x27;s never caused a breakout.</li>
    <li> Not good for skin with eczema.  I was really hoping this was going to work. It took a while before the skin reacts negatively.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily and does not leave a residue. It has no smell that I can tell. It&#x27;s worked fairly well on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My one year old son broke out in a crazy rash and by doctor&#x27;s orders we applied this stuff. After maybe a few days his skin cleared up 100%. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really calm anything down.  Threw the bottle out after it sat for a year unused.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and extremely sensitive skin. This works great as a skin conditioner  and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin at all. My only complaint is the price. Even with subscribe and save, the price is a little high for the amount of product I receive.</li>
    <li> THE BEST LOTION I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a physician friend. The best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It was working for a few weeks and then it just is not enough anymore. I switched to Eucerin, it seems to keep the problem from getting worse, but it remains to be seen if that will last. I suppose there just isn&#x27;t anything that will be very effective.</li>
    <li> my son has eczema since he was born and his skin is always hanging on the line of being clear and breaking out.  We have tried a few different eczema lotions and they all seem to irritate his skin after time.  we have been using this for a couple weeks now and it seems like his skin is improving and staying that way.  i would recommend this lotion</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin during the winter months. Helps my eczema feel better, but it does not replace medication to clear it.</li>
    <li> The group of atopic children are bought agony.&lt;br /&gt;Topical at the moment I can feel the skin is smooth, refreshing footwork&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be very nice in the winter moisturizer</li>
    <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this  product. I ordered it and realized it cost more than a prescription copayment!. However, I will continue to buy it because the results a re more impressive than my other prescriptions. Hope it works for your issue..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin to dyes and fragrances all of my life and I have tried every moisturizer on the market. This is the ONLY lotion that doesn&#x27;t break me out! My whole family uses it and I would highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product! I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I use this product on myself for my dry skin and on my daughter who has eczema. It definitely does its job and moisturizes. My daughter’s eczema outbreaks clear up pretty quickly with this because she isn’t scratching all the time, and it keeps my extremely dry skin nice and smooth and full of moisture. Would definitely recommend this product for anyone with eczema or really dry skin. Would have given it 5 stars but I’m not a big fan of how it smells.</li>
    <li> The lotion stays on my skin even after I shower. I only apply it every other day. It works well for very sensitive skin or very dry, ashy skin too.</li>
    <li> If any of you reading this are like me, I always like to read the 1 star reviews first. Well, my daughter and myself both have eczema. We have both been having intermittent success with Neutrogena face wash, Aveeno coloidial oatmeal body wash, Aveeno oatmeal lotion for me and A&amp;D ointment for my daughter. The allergist recommended Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash and lotion. Using it on  my daughter caused her to immediately scream and cry in pain. After four separate applications and no noticable improvement in her eczema, I threw the lotion out in anger. The body wash doesn&#x27;t seem to have any positive or negative affects. When using the lotion on my face (I was in the middle of a clear skin episode with no redness or flaking) the very next day my skin was inflamed, itchy and flaky far beyond my normal eczema flare ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was saddening to me as so many reviews have this lotion as the holy grail of relief. I conclude that although it may be very effective for most, some of us unfortunate people experience bad reactions.</li>
    <li> The only thing that helped my boyfriend who was on Accutane. The treatment did cure his acne, but during treatment, his skin was extremely dry to the point of just peeling off his face. This lotion was the best product we tried, not burning when applied to raw skin, and keeping the flaking to a minimum, while not making him look &amp;#34;greased&amp;#34;. You do have to reapply it every hour, but it DOES WORK. It also feels great on my naturally dry skin, going on smoothly and not leaving any sticky residue. If you can afford good lotion, THIS is THE lotion to buy!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff! I have been using it on my infant son, recommended by the pediatrician. He had eczema and this stuff works! It even cleared up his cradle cap. I use the wash and lotion together.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil lotion so good. Moisture love it. This is only our baby care. This is how I write skin supple and light, neunde ~ I love her.</li>
    <li> I am soooo bummed about this product. My young daughters have nut allergies and I was excited to get the referral to buy this from their allergist, AND I was happy to read that this lotion was \\&quot;Free of fragrances, parabens and nut oils.\\&quot; However, when I put the lotion on my youngest she broke out in a rash all over her chest, face and every where else I put it. I don&#x27;t understand how this product can claim  that it is free of \\&quot;nut oils\\&quot; when shea butter is made from the Shea nut and is considered a tree nut by the Food Allergy Research &amp; Education (FARE) organization! I will be calling Cetaphil and the allergy network to complain, this not ok.</li>
    <li> My son has patchy scaly dry skin from a very serious food allergy about a year ago. I tried many brands of moisturizers and body wash which just couldn&#x27;t improve his situation. Then my PD told me to try Cetaphil and his situation improved within a month. I was amazed and now, he&#x27;s only using Cetaphil and nothing else.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my doctor for my dry skin. I have used many other lotions, but this has been better than all of them. I have put it on the automatic reorder system so that I receive it every two months.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my baby&#x27;s facial eczema within days.</li>
    <li> My 1 year old daughter has eczema and I can tell this cream helps instantly as she stops scratching the moment we put it on.  The oatmeal creams actually made her eczema worse.  We were very thankful that this works as well as it does.  We will continue to purchase on subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three years now. It works great! I get rashes and itchy skin from the sun and heat. This is the only lotion that has helped with the itchiness and keeps the rashes away. I do try and stay out of the sun. This has been a great replacement to the steroid creams I was prescribed which I have not had to use now in over a year. I use it for my face, neck, arms and legs. I&#x27;ve never experience any burning even when I had a slight rash.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for anyone who has a difficult patch of irritated skin. I does a good job of calming and allowing healing.</li>
    <li> perfect for managing my son&#x27;s eczema</li>
    <li> Had a minor eczema on both of my arms. Tried all sorts of lotions morning and night and all it did was prevent it from getting worse, but never healed it. Tried cetaphil a few nights in a row and my eczema was pretty much gone. Again, my condition wasn&#x27;t bad, but cetaphil did help heal it completely.</li>
    <li> must have for baby with eczema.</li>
    <li> With the amount of cold severe winter weather we&#x27;ve been having, to find a lotion that my hands prefer is a real plus. It comes in a jar or a container with a push tab or a tube to carry wit you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this lotion had a scent, which is not recommended generally by dermatologists (I worked for one for 6 years) since one might be allergic to scents.  It is a pleasant one though.  Wish mine was scent free, but that could be something I missed.</li>
    <li> I have seen this brand for years and  never used it.  I purchased this cream for my eczema for extra moisturizing, it did a good job.  I have since purchased the facial moisturizer and  I like that too.</li>
    <li> Great stuff even if you don&#x27;t have exzema. If you want your moisturizer to stay with you, this is the one. For me, with exzema, it works really well at keeping my legs from breaking out. This was half the &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; prescribed to me by a wonderful dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;very moist through out the day and night&lt;br /&gt;good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Our doctor recommended this Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer for psoriasis.  It works well and the price is the best around.</li>
    <li> Works the best for my baby with exzema. Aquaphor would not work this time around and my ped gave me samples of this. Cleared it up fast and his skin is back to looking baby smoothe</li>
    <li> I have a 6 month old lil boy and we were just scratching our heads trying to clear up his eczema until we finally found this beautiful solution! After using this product for a week we saw great improvement and will recommend this product to EVERYONE. Thank goodness for all the amazon reviewers and my diligent husband because we have tried almost every &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; product out there (tried Episencial, Weleda, Earth Mama Angel Baby and I can&#x27;t think of the others). GoodGuide.com has a high rating for Restoraderm with a 10 out 10 for health (that&#x27;s really good! and means the ingredients are safe) while the regular Cetaphil cream has some concerns (rated 7 out of 10 for health and has some ingredients with some level of concern; eg. chemicals banned in other countries). Got this on subscribe &amp; save + Amazon Mom for 2 bottles per month (cause this kid needs to be lotioned up else that eczema starts creeping back lil dry spot at a time). I stand by this and love it!</li>
    <li> One of the only moisturizer I find that actually work.  A bit on the expensive side but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> People say I look late 30s. I&#x27;m 50. Reason is exercise, no smoking and this lotion after every shower and shave.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I bought it for my two year old granddaughter who has eczema. It&#x27;s working well. Her skin is healing and feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Everyone has a blemish it two or three, and this moisturizer is good for almost any issue. I have had several eczema breakouts on my body and this has been so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the body wash, this moisturizer is theo erect balance. Non greasy, non streaky, this moisturizer gives on well and feels so good on the body. It is not heavy but light in consistency, and is the perfect balance. I use it, my daughters use it, my son uses it. We area family who live Cetaphil products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 07-21-14</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my kids. I like the texture. It is not as thick as aquaphor etc.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!</li>
    <li> Irritates my eczema patches, which turned bright red and more inflamed within five minutes of applying the Cetaphil Restoradern lotion.  Hope I can use the remaining 9.99 ounces as a straight body lotion, or I&#x27;ll be tossing it.  Eucerin Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme works far better on my few recurring eczema patches.  [[ASIN:B00005NAOD Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7 Ounce]].  Would be cost prohibitive for use on extensive areas, but works quite well for me (loads better than this Cetaphil did).</li>
    <li> still haven&#x27;t found a better moisturizer. just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey because i fly through these!</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> We have a 17 mo old daughter who&#x27;s been suffering from extremely rough skin, oozy at times and very itchy.  We&#x27;ve used Eucerin, Cetaphil cream, Weleda \\&quot;Skin Food\\&quot; and \\&quot;Calendula\\&quot; cream, Aquaphor, Aveeno, Mustela and Dove sensitive washes, and nothing has worked as well as the Restoraderm.  It does seem to somehow coat and hydrate the skin, such that there is an obvious difference overnight.  She now has soft and smoother skin...this is after 2 nights of use.  I am looking forward to its continued use and hopefully its continued positive results.  We also have a 3 and 5 yo, and they both are benefiting from this cream as well.  After buying 1 bottle to try out, I am now ordering 4 more.  We have the wash as well, I am not sure that it is very effective, as we&#x27;re using both in tandem.  But I know the cream is doing a lot of good just using it during the daytime.  It is not greasy, but very light...amazing considering it works so effectively.  Thank You Cetaphil Restoraderm!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have THE most sensitive skin and up until this lotion I thought I was just doomed to have terrible bumps or unmoisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No scent, no breakouts like the original Cetaphil, and I&#x27;m ultimately a very happy camper. So happy to have stumbled across this. :)</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this moisturizer and it is amazing...it is rich and healing, and it thoroughly rubs in.  i use it all year round, but it is especially good in the winter.</li>
    <li> as a parent you would do everything and spend as much as needed to give comfort to your 6 month old who cant speak but tries to always explain with his eyes how he feels when eczema outbreak happens. I have tried multiple branded creams to give him comfort but some didnt work at all and few looked like it is loosely working at times. finally, one of my friend recommended Cetaphil to control dry and itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say it worked like a magic from first application!! ...  happy baby, happy parents!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This lotion is on the expensive side, but it really makes a difference in the appearance and feel of your skin.  It is definitely worth the money, especially if you have eczema or really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A good body lotion, to me, is one that provides the maximum moisturizing without being too greasy or sticky, and that does not sting when applied to dry skin</li>
    <li> I used to have very red cheeks. This has calmed the color down and never causes breakouts of any kind. I use this on my face at least 2x daily.</li>
    <li> I do not have to use eczema medication if i use this daily. That is amazing.</li>
    <li> I tried Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Moisturizer for dishidrotic eczema on my hands, which causes periodic breakouts (small itchy, weeping bumps) followed by extremely dry, cracked, and peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eczema was mostly confined to the palm side of my fingers, but I made the mistake of applying the Restoraderm product to both the palms and backs of my hands.  As a result, the backs of my hands (which previously were NOT affected) broke out in a red rash.  Discontinued the product immediately, and after some recovery time the backs of my hands are mostly normal again.  Based on all the good reviews it sounds like this product works well for many people, but beware - a number of people appear to be very sensitive to it.  If you must try this product, spot test it for a couple of days first to be sure your skin won&#x27;t react.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had much better luck with a product called Triple Cream Severe Dry Skin/Eczema Care.  It is greasy for sure, but if you apply a little bit all day long, and more at night (ideally without covering), it slowly improves the dryness.  In my case the Triple Cream did not seem to cause any additional skin reactions.  The skin on the palm side of my fingers still gets dry, but the peeling and cracking issues are greatly improved.</li>
    <li> I was having an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product that also severely dried out my skin, and I saw lots of recommendations for this type of lotion. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product for my child skin.</li>
    <li> Nice for really dry skin that tends to break out.</li>
    <li> I really love this brand Cetaphil. All its products really works, it really moisturize my skin, leaving my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was referred to use this lotion by a dermatologist. When applied after bathing this lotion absorbs very quickly,  leaves no film, and you only need to use about a quarter sized amount. This lotion smoothed my winter dry skin within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has worked well for my son&#x27;s eczema. On really bad days, I&#x27;ll combine it with some coconut oil.</li>
    <li> My 16 month old recently developed mild eczema.  I tried this on his legs, where there is no eczema, just dry skin.  He seemed to have an immediate allergic reaction.  He began crying right away, though he was tired and cranky, so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was the cream.  After a few minutes bits of his upper thigh became red/raised.  I washed him off and his crying stopped, though a little redness /reaction remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for the eczema he is a perfectly healthy baby, and has not taken any medications.  I read the negative reviews before putting on the cream, so I was prepared to wash it off there was a reaction... and there was.</li>
    <li> My husband and children have eczema, and I&#x27;m a frequent handwasher.  We have bottles of this in every bedroom and bathroom and I slather myself and them frequently.  It works well and the ingredients are what I&#x27;m looking for--no parabens, dyes, fragrance, etc.</li>
    <li> This lotion has really helped my eczema! I use it in my face every morning and night and hardly need steroids for my face anymore! Still need steroids for my hands, but it&#x27;s definitely helping my hands, too!</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema and the cream is good in soothing n improving her skin condition. we hv use it for more than 9 months n still keep using.</li>
    <li> Only lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well for me and my skin type.</li>
    <li> My son developed red, bloody eczema behind his knees and in the creases on his ankles when he was around 4months old.  He is now 19 months and his eczema is almost cleared thanks to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trued Gentle Naturals Eczema Cream (pasty, thick, stained clothing), Aveeno (too thin, needed dozens of applications throughout the day), Aquaphor (extremely greasy, stayed on clothing more than skin), Babyganics (nice consistency but ineffective), Baby Naturals (thick, heavily scented), Burts Bees (pasty and expensive).  All of these did NOT improve my son&#x27;s eczema one bit.  The dermatologist recommended Cetaphil cream in conjunction with a 1% or 2% cortizone cream.  I was reluctant to try the steroid based cortizone cream so I tried the regular Cetaphil cream alone and it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended Cetaphil Restoraderm which was approved by the National Eczema Association for people with Atopic Dermatitis.  I was reluctant to use it because it was both a pricey and did not seem \\&quot;natural\\&quot; compared to other products.  I tried it and we saw improvements by the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His eczema actually improved the more I used this lotion.  My son scratches behind his knees most at night in his crib so in the morning there can be some open red sores.  When I applied the Restoraderm to these areas he screeched in pain.  When I had a papercut I tried it out on myself and this lotion really stings on open sores. Because I was seeing improvement in other areas I kept applying it and tried Cortaid Hydrocortizone cream on the raw areas only at night.  Holy SMOKES, the raw areas went away in one night!  Then I continued to slather the Restoraderm over it all again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry patches on the front of his knees and his ankles have completely gone away and behind his knees are almost completely clear after only 2 months of using this regimen.  His eczema would be gone if he didn&#x27;t scratch himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other lotions, this one is easy enough to slather all over the legs and arms and face without it being greasy, sticky, thick or pasty, yet still has a lasting effect throughout the day.  Of course, more applications are needed in dryer winter months but this is definitely the best lotion we&#x27;ve found.  It does not rub off on or stain his clothing, even behind his knees where the fabric is wedged between his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this lotion on Amazon it is much cheaper than in the drug store (usually runs about $14-$20 depending where you shop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how many parents feel about using natural products but seriously, once the eczema clears you&#x27;ll feel a million times better, and then you can go back to the naturals to help maintain the moisture in the skin.  This lotion is well worth it.ver the legs and arms and face without it being greasy, sticky, thick or pasty, yet still has a lasting effect throughout the day.

    <li> Must for my kid so have it in Subscribe and Save so don&#x27;t have to run to walmart/target everytime it runs out. It always shows up on my door step.</li>
    <li> I purchased a new facial cleaner (Neutrogena Oil-Free to be exact) and I don&#x27;t know if it was the product that messed up my skin or if I had an allergic reaction, but my skin totally burned off to the point of where it was sore, red, it felt just like a bad sunburn. I went to Walgreens and asked the pharmacist what I should buy to help relieve the pain and also fix the issue fast. They recommended Cetaphil but particuarly the Restoraderm Skin moisturizer. It works great. It keeps me moisturized all day long even when I put make-up on top of it. It feels great! I usually use a Neutrogena lotion for my face and body but I think I&#x27;m going to start using this all the time now. Thanks for fixing my face, Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> Nephew cream. Moist and good</li>
    <li> excellent. seems the only one works for eczema after trying all different brands.</li>
    <li> Entire family (baby included) uses this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add a few drops of lavender essential oil to this as its unscented.</li>
    <li> I have atopic eczema for more than a decade and after using the while bottle, I don&#x27;t see any sort of improvements. This is a good moisturizer that is absorbs well by the skin. It is light, gentle and watery, so it feels good when applied on skin. However, the moisturizing effect don&#x27;t last for long. When I first applied it, it felt like my skin was drinking water, and it was soft but it did not soothe my redness nor did it aid in restoring my skin. It certainly is useless when I have flare ups especially since it only moisturizes my skin for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this if you have mild eczema and if you have atopic eczema, then you can only use this as temporary relief for less dry and non flared up skin.</li>
    <li> Has a nice clean smell and really helps my skin.  I have sjogrens an autoimmune disease that drys your skin very badly this is one of the only things I&#x27;ve gound that helps and my dermintologist recommends it</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommended this lotion and it works very well for our super dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for very dry skin without being too heavy and greasy.  For me it is more moisturizing than CeraVe cream and about as moisturizing as Cetaphil cream, but lighter feeling than Cetaphil cream.  I use this when I am using self tanner because self tanner really dries out my skin and this helps avoid that.  And there is no scent.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for my baby son&#x27;s excema (and mine too)! I would highly recommend to anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Good Seller and the product achived my spectations</li>
    <li> this product has helped greatly</li>
    <li> Another great Cetaphil Eczema product I use every day with their Restoraderm Body Wash.  I hate the condition but I&#x27;m so grateful to have found these most helpful products.</li>
    <li> With excema a problem for years, finally a cream that gives relief.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great lotion to sooth and prevent eczema.  Cannot find it in stores, so thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing the Restoraderm lotion from Cetaphil for about two years now after trying almost everything! And when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I have tried corn huskers lotion, Aveeno Eczema therapy, Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion, Olive oil, Coconut oil and the list goes on and on. This is the only product that seems to actually reduce the redness and itchiness of my eczema. Never have I been so satisfied with a product. I am 23 and started getting eczema on my face and hands when I turned about 19. In addition to having eczema on my hands, I have eczema in a very odd place (on the skin above my tear ducts between both eyes) that becomes very red and scaly, so this is always a tricky place to put lotion since it is very close to my eyes. This lightweight consistency of this lotion makes it very easy to apply it in that particular area since it is lighter (as opposed to a very thick and rich lotion). I apply the lotion twice a day (once in the morning and once at night after showering) on my face/ hands and it provides my skin with such relief from itchiness and I can see very little redness. And yes, I do apply this lotion in other areas of my face and do not get any acne, so in my experience it is safe to use on one&#x27;s face. Now, this product doesn&#x27;t heal my eczema completely but it sure is the closest I will get to a cure for eczema. I especially love that this lotion is steroid-free and fragrance-free so I can feel safe using this lotion every day. This product has worked for me and are only from my experiences but I highly recommend that anyone who has eczema or atopic dermatitis try this product.</li>
    <li> Used along with the restoraderm body wash, this cleared up my daughter&#x27;s bad eczema that we&#x27;d be battling for over a year. Great product!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I had a great experience with the product, value and deliver. Realy satisfied. I always reacomend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, it&#x27;s the only one that helps my very dry skin. the price was very reasonable. I use other products from the same brand.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema.  He has dry itchy skin on his back and chest.  After the first couple uses, his skin felt so much smoother and the dry spots were almost gone!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my 3.5 month old son who was getting eczema all over his thighs and face.  Within days of using it, his eczema started going away and now his skin is silky smooth once again!  We recently ran out and used another brand for eczema, but we noticed his face started developing it again so we went back to using Cetaphil Restoraderm.  I love the texture of the Cetaphil - silky and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily.  My husband and I have started using the Cetaphil on ourselves as well and we LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love it! I will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> Amazingly restoring moisturizer is absolutely correct. I have a very dry skin, especially on my face. In cold and harsh winter conditions, nothing else protects or soothes like this stuff does... I use it as a heavy face moisturizer all year, even though it is best in the winter for dry skin. People have noticed and told me my skin on my face looks amazing... the truth is, it&#x27;s just this stuff.</li>
    <li> It seems to help my eczema. I mix it in with my desonide, corticosteroid, to mitigate the potency when I put it on my face.</li>
    <li> My 8 yr old son has eczema and my GP recommended Cetaphil Restoraderm. After the 1st application he complained that it burned - the next day he had red blotchy patches on his skin and the following day,  brown dead skin replaced the red patches, surely an indication of  chemical burns. This is a dangerous product not suitable for all skin types which I will never use again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The lotion works great and is gentler than regular lotion. I want to mention though depending on the state or severity of your eczema, that your eczema may burn when you first apply the lotion on it. You can do either 1 of 2 things:  1. If your eczema feel a burn, put up with it until eventually you build up tolerance and not feel a burn anymore when you apply it. It took two days for me applying the lotion until I didn&#x27;t feel a burn anymore, though it will vary for different people.  OR 2. You can wait and first get rid of your eczema rash using either prescription cream or something like Cortizone-10 3.5 oz. lotion, and then afterwards begin to use this lotion.</li>
    <li> Very good for my body.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin - it was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have tried other skin lotions but this is the one that works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rub it on my hands it seems to absorb quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling.  After a couple of applications the redness is gone and the scaly look has vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hands during winter Restoraderm might help you as it has helped me.</li>
    <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an endurance swimmer and the chemicals in the pool cause major problems with my skin - when the chemistry of the pool is altered (post-chlorine, etc.) or when I go into saltwater, my skin sort of goes crazy and really gets dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go-to moisturizer of choice for years was Neutrogena Anti-Itch lotion, and when I heard they were discontinuing it, I loaded up on it. When my supply ran out, I had to find something to replace it, and I finally settled on a combination of the Cetaphil Restoraderm and [[ASIN:B000O3SS7U Eucerin External Analgesic Lotion, Calming Itch-Relief Treatment, 6.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]. The Eucerin is good for instant itch relief, and the Cetaphil is better for long-term moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love about this lotion is that it&#x27;s silky and disappears into the skin almost instantly. I LOVE that. So many lotions that treat ultra-dry skin can either be super greasy or leave a weird film on the skin. The Cetaphil is lightweight, but you can instantly feel it absorb into the skin and make a difference in the texture of the skin without making your skin look or feel as if it has been basted in oil or petroleum. It&#x27;s just a nice lotion to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to have an analgesic effect (won&#x27;t ease itch on contact) so that&#x27;s why I use it in conjunction with the Eucerin. But it has lasting effects and definitely changes the texture and health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it. I use it for everything from dry hands to cracked heels to bug bites. My daughter, who has eczema, also likes it- she hated the feeling of hand lotion, but with the Cetaphil, it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s *not* lotion. But it still works.</li>
    <li> My baby had eczema for many months...using this body wash along with the lotion had made it dissapear.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it was recommended by the pedeiatrician</li>
    <li> love this lotion. no itch all day for someone like me who has severe atopic dermatitis condition.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Restoraderm é um produto excelente para hidratar e restourar  pele do corpo e rosto.Ele foi recomendado por minha dermatologista.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for my baby.&lt;br /&gt;he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;i wanna to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;gooooooooood&lt;br /&gt;s u again cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
    <li> My toddler has eczema and nothing has helped like this!! I got a trial full size bottle at a nursing conference and was hooked - fragrance free, absorbs great (so I can put a bunch of coats on him). Pump is great but leaves some lotion in the bottle. It is worth the price in my opinion! We use it every night without fail.</li>
    <li> I alway buy this one time for year. wait sale time.</li>
    <li> Be sure to notice the dark blue National Eczema Association badge on the front and the words &#x27;Filaggrin technology\\&quot; in the description!   These body washes and lotions really work BUT the other very similar bottles, without the badge are much less effective! So if you have really bad Eczema or Ichthyosis, be sure to get the right ones!</li>
    <li> She has even got me to use it and I like it too so soft and nice on my face. It makes a big difference after a very short time, well worth the time and the little cost.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by our pediatrician to help with our toddler&#x27;s eczema.  Our toddler has had eczema since birth and we&#x27;ve been treating with aquaphor and hydrocortizone.  We were excited to try a new product to help with our son&#x27;s eczema.  Unfortunately, as soon as I put a layer of the cetaphil restoraderm on my toddler, he started screaming in pain and I was petrified to find his skin flare up in red, blister-like rash.  We immediately took him to the bathroom and washed off all the moisturizer with water.  After about 10 minutes, the rash went away and our toddler was fine.  Obviously our son is allergic to something in this moisturizer but we&#x27;re not sure what.  If you&#x27;re trying this on your infant or toddler, please test it on a small area before applying to his/her entire body.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> The rigth product to moisturize and relief my itchy skin. I use it everyday and the result is awsome. No odor.</li>
    <li> My daughter is six years old and has had eczema just about her whole life. This is the first Lotion that we have been able to use on her for a long period. Not smell really at all. I am over the top happy with it.</li>
    <li> Changed from my usual Amalactin to this and find it longer lasting, if that&#x27;s possible, plus lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;I signed up for the subscription plan.</li>
    <li> Great for eczema. Keeps your skin really moisturized for hours</li>
    <li> Still good but did not work as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is the best. This lotion is expensive, but it makes dry skin happy. The entire Cetaphil line is very good, but this one is the best. The container size is also good as it is small enough to sit on a bathroom or kitchen counter without taking up much space.</li>
    <li> I started using the moisturizer alongside the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser after my roommate recommended the brand to me. I have problematic skin, both acne plagued and dry. I use a light amount of this moisturizer on my cheeks in addition to my acne gel after washing my face, and my skin has been evening out and clearing up more recently. It feels a lot more elastic and looks much smoother.</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive skin as a moisturizer. My mother started using mine and her skin looks 20 years younger. I&#x27;ve seriously been going on and on about how different she looks. She&#x27;s 55 and her skin is plump, dewy, and looks healthier than most 30 year olds. She wasn&#x27;t crazy about how heavy it was--I suggested she use it as a night cream but she didn&#x27;t want to do that. I do suggest using it fresh out of the shower or after laying a steaming hot wash cloth across your face, and using pea sized amounts or less at a time and working it in as much as you can before using more. It IS heavy, but it absorbs well if your skin is warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this at the recommendation of a dermatologist for very angry rosacea skin with severe seb derm. Bumps, flaking, and periods where my face would just get so oily it would run in my eyes. Started using this with some medication to calm down the bumps but my mother started using it when her moisturizer ran out. I have combination skin, with lots of irritated raw patches from seb derm flakes. My mother has very sensitive, dry skin. She was using Clinique Clarifying Lotion before.</li>
    <li> I see several other people have experienced similar stinging as I did. I must be highly sensitive to one or more of the chemicals used in these Restoraderm products, because most reviewers love the lotion and I didn&#x27;t see any other reviewers mention the type of issue I experienced with the body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a recent outbreak I decided to try Restoraderm Body Wash, and when I applied it to my face and torso I noticed a bit of tingling, not quite stinging, it was just strange. I&#x27;ve previously used body washes by Aveeno, Alba, Nature&#x27;s gate and Yes To Carrots, with no ill effects. After drying off I applied Restoraderm Skin Moisturizer (which I&#x27;d also never used before) to my hands and inside of left elbow. After about 7 minutes my hands began to get irritated and burn, and then my inner left elbow began to itch and burn. They continued to worsen, and after 15 minutes I washed off every area where I&#x27;d applied the lotion. There was almost immediate relief and the stinging dissipated. I applied one of my other lotions and there was no such stinging. The next day I repeated the process with the Restoraderm body wash and lotion, and had the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer&#x27;s phone number isn&#x27;t listed anywhere on the bottles, nor on cetaphil.com, so I had to search for a phone number. I called Galderma (the mfgr) and they put me in touch with a nurse who took a report of my experience; She gave no indication as to what may have caused the stinging. Since then I&#x27;ve only used  Aveeno Skin Relief and Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil body washes, and have used Aveeno, Yes To Carrots, Neutrogena and Eucerin lotions, and have had no adverse effects whatsoever. I received a packet of papers from Galdeena in which they wanted me to give them more information, including a list of the medications I take, but I&#x27;m not giving them my personal or medical information so I threw them away. They also sent a check to reimburse me for the body wash and the lotion.</li>
    <li> Excellent, though expensive. keeps skin very well moisturized so dry-skin problems do not appear. this is essential if you want to avert skin itching.</li>
    <li> I bought this upon recommendation by a dermatologist for my son&#x27;s severe dry skin. It&#x27;s ok but I would have expected it to be better. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize any better then some other lotions we&#x27;ve used, no worse either.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream I love it, but i think the revitol eczema dermatitis cream is good as well. Check it out here: [...]</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of my baby&#x27;s eczema but it was helpful I really like the consistency !!</li>
    <li> It really helps my skin&lt;br /&gt;Soothe</li>
    <li> I use this with the body wash and it works great. Took away all hints of eczema and my kiddo&#x27;s skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> My husband buys this cream because he says it really does help his skin and helps with hydrating dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product myself, before I wrote this. I  compared it to another similar cream and found with Cetaphil Restoraderm there was a noticeable  positive difference. The cream made the skin smoother and had a longer lasting affect.</li>
    <li> My niece has eczema. Nothing on the market eases her suffering - we have tried prescription creams, medicated creams and witches brew... nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this cream arrived I phoned and told her to put it all over one arm only, go to bed, then see what the results would be in the morning. My mother phoned me and couldn&#x27;t have been more excited with the results the following day. I ordered her three more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a body cream and so it wasn&#x27;t tested on her face. But for body skin remedy, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with any other cream. Believe me, we&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> Although it took weeks of allover use twice a day, this product cleared up my husband&#x27;s skin condition, one that his dermatologist had been unable to help with for years.  He had very, very, very dry skin, and his approach was to try a little of this and that on the itchy spots when they itched.  It is now a staple in our house, and any time I see him scratch even once, I pounce on him and start that daily regimen again.  In addition he never uses soap in the shower, just Eucerin skin calming dry skin body wash, the gold container.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and I find that this Cetaphil moisturizes her skin better than any other lotions or moisturizers. I apply this after her bath while her skin is still wet.I always order this from amazon , they have the best price.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s eczema almost disappeared with this lotion. It&#x27;s just amazing!! My son does not need steroid cream anymore!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, lasts a long time.  Gentle on the skin.  No perfume.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product gave a huge relief to my son&#x27;s itchy and dry skin due to eczema. I&#x27;d recommend this even for daily/frequent use.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for Eczema relief, using this for my 2years old son, applying this lotion when the screen dry.</li>
    <li> I use this on my sons eczema with great results.</li>
    <li> I threw away all my other moisturizers when I started using this. It immediately does away with all itching and makes for very smooth skin. .</li>
    <li> This is the only skin moisturizer that my 5 month old son can use for his eczema. I&#x27;ve tried Aveeno and others, but this is non-greasy, light and safe for babies as young as 3 months. :o) The pump is nice and you can get as little or as much as you want out with ease. I have on subscribe and save (every other month). Although, Wal-Mart has the same product for same price, I still buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best product for dry skin</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Always have been looking for a moisturizing lotion that is healthy for my skin and not too greasy or leaves excess residue, and this does the trick!</li>
    <li> Our son came down with eczema last year and our doctor recommended this stuff.  It can clear up his red cheeks in no time!  We really only have to used it in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is expensive in stores and is rarely on sale.  So far, Amazon has been the best deal I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have used Cetaphil products for years and loved them.  This one made my skin feel even better for a day, then I started itching.  After looking for a reason, I found that this product contains ceramide.  Ceramide makes my skin itch.  This product also gave my adopted son a rash.  It says that it is especially formulated for children but please be cautious.</li>
    <li> Great for treating eczema&lt;br /&gt;Our pediatrician recommended this product to us and we&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the last 2 years (since our son was 1 month old)</li>
    <li> I had been seeing a dermatologist about uncontrollable dry hands and soars showing up on my hands and other parts of my body that would burn, itch and not heal. Found out it was a reaction from washing my hands throughout the day with anti bacterial hand wash. I was told to stop using the anti bacterial soap and start using Cetaphil body and hand wash at the sink as well as in the shower. I was also told to start using the skin restoring moisturizer cream twice a day. With in two days all the soars stopped burning and itching and started healing. It&#x27;s been two weeks now, I no longer have a dry skin issue and all the soars are healed up and gone. This product is kind of expensive but worth every bit of the money.</li>
    <li> My son inherited my sensitive, allergy prone skin. Consequently, as winter rolled around in upstate NY, his skin got very dry, and scaly, red excema patches appeared on his legs, torso, arms, and face. His pediatrician recommended I try this, and it works wonderfully. I slather this on after a bath, and again in the morning on areas that need it most. Over the course of one week, his skin cleared up and we didn&#x27;t have to resort to medication or medicated creams. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a child with sensitive skin and allergy problems.</li>
    <li> As an eczema sufferer, I am very optimistic about this new formulation. I&#x27;m cautious to give a full endorsement because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I&#x27;m impressed with what I see so far . When applied, it feels like a simple moisturizer but it lasts like a heavy duty thick skin therapy-- comparable to petroleum jelly, or a tub of Eucerin skin repair. I can only tell it was on my skin when I take a shower at night or the next day and I can feel the protective layer it created. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing else like this.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Like any lotion used for eczema treatment, you want to apply this within 3 minutes of getting out of the shower. This is important for creating a protective barrier and locking in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of people have complained that this burns their skin or their child&#x27;s skin. I suspect they applied this directly to an area where the eczema was flaring up. I did this once with restoraderm to part of my neck that was flaring up and yes, it will sting-- similar to any lotion that is not a simple variation on petroleum jelly or something very hypoallergenic. This is not what this lotion is for.&lt;br /&gt;First, get the inflamed site under control with your doctor&#x27;s recommended steroidcream. After this skin heals up, you use lotion to maintain the protective layer that many eczema sufferers lack. This is what Restoraderm specializes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ceramide therapy is cutting edge. Many people with eczema suffer from a deficiency in Filaggrin, a protein that helps maintain the protective layer on the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;(I can&#x27;t insert a web URL here but look up Filaggrin on wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramides act as a signaling molecule to stimulate production of more Filaggrin.&lt;br /&gt;(Look up ceramides on wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is basically medicine. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t need a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the only downside is the high cost, but this might come down over time. And it&#x27;s a small price to paycompared to the thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve dropped on dermatologists who have no idea what&#x27;s going on.</li>
    <li> My nephew, who is 7 years old, has had eczema since he was a baby. So when my 3 month old also got eczema, I called my sister for advice. She swears by Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy, and I can tell you it worked wonders for my nephew. So I bought it for my baby and started using it. The eczema never got better, it was just like we weren&#x27;t putting anything on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost two weeks, I went to amazon and started reading reviews for different products. I looked at Cerave and saw another reviewer recommended the Cetaphil Restoraderm over the Cerave because of questionable ingredients. So I ordered the Cetaphil Restoraderm. What a difference! The eczema had got so bad we were going to take him to the doctor the next day. Two applications of this and it started clearing up. We are now on the third day and his eczema spots are almost gone, his skin feels like the soft baby skin it used to feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this isn&#x27;t greasy. It was so hard to put clothes back on our baby after applying the Aveeno product, this soaks in nicely but also doesn&#x27;t feel like it just soaks away. I just bought a second bottle to keep at our in laws. It would be nice if it came in a different bottle than a pump bottle since the pump bottle can&#x27;t be transported easily. Even though this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;baby\\&quot; product it does say safe for babies as young as 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it on him I was worried it would sting like some reviewers had said. I watched his face closely and he didn&#x27;t even flinch. He didn&#x27;t have any broken skin spots, but the skin was so red and irritated I wondered if it might sting him. I have purposefully rubbed my eyes after applying the lotion on him and I do feel a little tingly sensation, so it might burn if a large amount got into eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my Grand dauther. Its a prescription medicine works real well and its a decent price. Would recoment</li>
    <li> At a recent visit to the dermatologist she recommended cetaphil products. I have tried a few different combinations of the products but they all cause my face to break out in a splotchy red rash! These restoraderm products especially burn when applied. I now have worse skin than before I stared using the products. :(</li>
    <li> Works ok but probably not moisturize enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my baby&#x27;s eczema more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. After using it multiple times a day for a couple weeks, the eczema has healed up quite a bit. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to relieve the itch quickly.  When my baby is scratching and I use this lotion on her, she continues scratching for a little while. However, she is definitely scratching less now that the condition of her skin is improving. I like that it is light and doesn&#x27;t stain like the oils and balms that I had used before.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used.  It is the first winter in many years that I have not itched constantly from dry sky.  This product is more expensive than other lotions but I use less of it so it probably isn&#x27;t more expensive in the long run.  It is difficult to find Cdetaphil with the restoraderm in local stores so I frequently have to order it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a scaly rash has been a challenge. I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for weeks, and my skin has never looked or felt better! I know it&#x27;s a benefit of all moisturizers, but it&#x27;s wonderful to see less prominent pores, smoother texture, and a reduction in fine lines. I&#x27;m so excited I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> Very happy this lotion cost a arm and a leg at the local store better deal here planning to purchase more in the future thank you .</li>
    <li> Cetaphil works great! Does not do so well on eczema, but that is what a dermatologist is for, so they can prescribe you what works.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our dermatologist for our infant son with severe eczema.  It is the only thing that keeps his skin relatively clear.  The Amazon price was around $10.00 cheaper per bottle than anywhere here in Australia.  Thank you Amazon for an amazing price, fast shipping, and a well-packaged product!</li>
    <li> This lotion works great, when I can get my daughter to use it.&lt;br /&gt;For an eczema lotion, why in the world does it burn super-irritated skin??!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Our 2yr old daughter has eczema and it defiantly helps with it tried to stop using it and the eczema got worse.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really helps keep my daughters eczema under control.</li>
    <li> It is the only lotion that calms and heals my winter dry skin and eczema. Not greasy or overly scented. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Unlike other lotions and creams Cetaphil Restoraderm proves valuable in more ways then one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After experimenting with numerous brands, this lotion works very well, feels great, and is gentle enough to be used on your face daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not clog pours, sting, or have any smell to it whatsoever making it a highly recommended choice.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lotion.  Based on the reviews I really hoped that it would help my daughters eczema.  Instead it&#x27;s just been okay.  I apply this to her skin twice a day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month in conjunction with the Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash.  It seemed to work pretty good at first.  Her skin was pretty receptive to the lotion and it did soften the rough spots and made the rest of her skin soft to the touch, however when I applied it to her face it made the patches on her face redder.  So I stopped applying it to her face and just applied to to her body.  Recently, I&#x27;ve had to stop using it after baths because she writhes in pain when I rub it on her and her dry patches turned redder.  From this reaction I have to assume it&#x27;s causing a burning sensation.  I have tried everything from organic to Aquaphor.  And nothing seems to eradicate the problem, so I continue to use this in the mornings and a different lotion after baths that doesn&#x27;t burn when I apply.  After this is gone I won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
    <li> The only thing that helps my lil one with eczema</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered for my eczema!  My skin is already nearly completely cleared up after only a week!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, still do. This is the only lotion I use though. Thick enough but not greasy. Never irritates my skin and by far is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. Been using for 2 years and will always use. Amazon is best price for it as it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I use it on my two year old who has eczema. Works so so so well!</li>
    <li> My two year old toddler has horrible eczema and this lotion actually works to clear it up and to keep her clear!  I first tried several of the lotions marketed for kids and marketed as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but nothing actually made a difference.  We have been using this lotion for about 3 months.  We apply it after a bath.  She hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since we started using it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is easy for the skin to absorb while leaving a protecting layer to serve as a barrier between the air and the skin. I have eczema so if I encounter a product that is not formulated for sensitive skin, my skin will feel a burning sensation and itches. This does its job by moisturizing my skin and protecting it from losing any moisture!</li>
    <li> my daughter has sensitive sink and this lotion has keep her out of scratching her skin.  work well for her</li>
    <li> Love this lotion helps with my eczema alot</li>
    <li> Feel better than reg. Cetaphil</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this product!!!, I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s. After a detamatogist determined that I have pityriasis alba on my face, she said there were no cures, and I should try this new product by Cetaphil, within a few days my face began to sting and burn. I trusted the dermatologist because I had been using the regular Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for years with no problem. When I returned to my dermatologist with burns &amp; blisters on my face she said that I had an allergic reaction, and to try a different moisturizing lotion...</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have found so far for my dry skin and scalp issues. After one use my problems were resolved. I now use this after each shower.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff; tried other brands, my dermatologist recommends this, so I buy it.  Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> Takes away the eczema itch and keeps my face looking young all day. Love it. (From someone who has an oily complexion)</li>
    <li> Cetaphil does it again</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used! Leaves my skin soft and even healed scars from a severe rash.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and very dry skin. It helps and makes my skin smooth. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazon is sending the old stock.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product, which has the coupon attached. And this coupon was expired before the order date. If receiving expired coupons means its a loss the worth of coupon value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not again anything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good. I will rate this 5 stars. But I am rating on the Amazon&#x27;s service.</li>
    <li> My son screamed from the burning sensation he got when I put it on his face.  He suffers from mild excema, but I have never seen him get so upset when I put lotion on his face.  I will not use this again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the service and product, recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It really work well for my 9 yrs old with sensitive skin. It keep her skin soft and smooth. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My hands take a major beating in cool weather, here in dry Utah, but this helps them stay reasonably moisturized. I partner this with moisturizing gloves at night. I may have to augment with cortisone this year, as this didn&#x27;t totally relieve my symptoms last winter, but we&#x27;ll see.  This absorbs quickly enough, and definitely does make my hands softer. It can sting if you have cuts or cracks, but I don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ll find any moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My gal who has eczema didn&#x27;t like it...says it&#x27;s stingy to her (she has a bit of broken skins due to scratching). Passed it to my husband to finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to this lotion ... after s few days of using it for my newborn, it turned to liquid/water lotion. I never will buy this type of lotion again.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 2, she has had a few patches of eczema in the same place since she was 4 months old. Her eczema is food allergy related, although she has it all the time, it flares with certain foods. I don&#x27;t think this worked, and after a while it made her skin worse. I have switched out detergent, eliminated foods, changed shampoos, and the only time her skin cleared up was when we stopped using it. So there you go. Might work for some people, but we have yet to find anything that works for us, this is no exception.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I was very skeptical at first; I normally only use high end products, but this actually out-perforned for hardly a fraction of the price. My face is beyond soft and clear. They keep their products really clean with nothing extra added including fragrances. I would definitely use this all over my body if I didn&#x27;t want it to last for my face. I think the regular formula will do for thay purpose though since my face requires much more care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every emollient, salve, lotion, moisturizer, etc. on the market.  Many do nothing; some further irritate my skin.  Restoraderm actually soothes my skin long enough to let it heal.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Keeps me well-moisturized, especially through the winter with no bad reactions nor bad scent -- it does not smell like much at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for dry skin.  It is not greasy and soaks right in.  I love it (on my 4th bottle).</li>
    <li> I have chronically dry skin.  This was recommended by my dermatologist and works like a charm.  I use it on myself and my son who unfortunately inherited my dry skin.  Have to reapply daily or even several times a day.  Claims it is only temporary effect, but my skin has improved dramatically over the past year&#x27;s regular use.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item delivered as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the better moisturizers with a few caveats according to the Skin Doctor Score...read the review at theskindoctor.com</li>
    <li> I liked the product! It is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for my husband, it was recommended by his pharmacist, and I tried it and love it.  It not only moisturizes your skin but it soothes irritation and removes redness.  Best lotion on earth.</li>
    <li> The best cream we found for baby eczema. Aquaphor was too greasy; California Baby was also good but Cetaphil helped calm the irritated skin best. Would recommend it to other parents whose baby has eczema.</li>
    <li> I have been using cetaphil for years and it has never let me down. I started using it with skingenixx retinol cream [[ASIN:B00VSEINZQ Skingenixx Collagen Retinol Anti-Aging Cream with Matrixyl 3000 Peptides]] and I am so excited about how my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I really love Cetaphil eczema ranges and I have been using it on my daughter since she was 5 mths.&lt;br /&gt;Now she is 16 mths. Really keep her moisture and most importantly, its really safe.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, rosacea, and non-specific derm issues on my face. I use Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash for my face and it&#x27;s been a game-changer for me.  Then I pair it up with this.  My bare face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 10 years!</li>
    <li> It immediately start to reduce itch and helped my wife skin to heal more quickly than Dr prescribed product that was 10 times the cost.</li>
    <li> We have tried every lotion to keep the eczema under control in our two young kids.  This is the only one that keeps it at bay for weeks at a time.</li>
    <li> My baby&#x27;s eczema depend on it.It soothes his skin.It&#x27;s an important thing to my baby and he can not leave it.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product for my grandson&#x27;s skin. It is wonderful for dry skin. I am a Cetaphil believer but did not know about the Restoraderm. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for dry skin and eczema. Hydrating, soothing and non greasy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very good value and function. Excellent watch/. Well worth the very low price. Like the style and look.very very much.</li>
    <li> Use with the body wash. Took to work to use after washing hands all day long. Not sticky or come off on your clothes. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has severe eczema and is sensitive to almost everything including eczema lotions. His doctor recommended this product. He is allergic to the regular Cetaphil lotion so we were hesitant to try this product but his doctor insisted we tried it. It worked AMAZINGLY. It&#x27;s a little pricey but totally worth it if you are suffering from eczema on a daily basis. All you itchy/sensitive guys and girls give this a shot. We are going to buy the body wash too and give that a try since we had such a great turnout with the lotion.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for dry skin .... dry skin goes away in days ... I love it because it&#x27;s non oily and does not smudge clothes</li>
    <li> I like It. My Mother use It every day and keeps her skin software and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the hands.  For my aging and dry skin I need a lactic acid to help me out so back to Amlactin.</li>
    <li> If your kid has skin alegern, this is the solution.</li>
    <li> Very very good. Helped calm my eczema.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been great at keeping my baby&#x27;s eczema prone skin well moisturized without any irritation to her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It works great. My husband has very dry dry skin and even blister on his legs every winter. My neighbor recommends me this and it is the one of the best with Aveeno for now.</li>
    <li> My two daughters are being used this product for two years. My two daughters have no skin problems. It protects the skin without making it dry.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t have eczema, I have extremely sensitive skin. I changed my soap, laundry detergent, meds and shampoo - nothing changed! I still had these red, stingy, raw patches of skin all over my body. It was summer and I was stuck wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts. A gal at a high-end skincare shop recommended that I try Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash and lotion (of course they didn&#x27;t carry it). I immediately went home and ordered both. After one shower followed by lotion, my skin had calmed. A week later, I was back to wearing shorts and tank tops! The red, peeling skin I used to have is a distant memory!</li>
    <li> wow this thing really works. it cured my hands in a week. im so glad i found this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely fantastic. I developed severe hand eczema in mid-life and do not want to overuse steroids, but a recent shot of Kenalog, Clobetasol  applied sparingly and diligent use of Restoraderm have helped my skin ( and frame of mind) immensely. This is the very best OTC lotion to combat eczema I have found and I am most grateful!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is what sealed the deal on healing my 10 year battle with ,housewife, hands. Peeling, burning, itching and bleeding. Using non scented everything in my life, no dishes, no cleaners and my hands were still a mess. Tried every non- scented healing hand cream/lotion on the market. Years and years of dermatologist appointments, prescriptions, light therapy, etc.  This product did the magic. I have a subscription to have this sent to me on a regular basis. I never go anywhere without it.  And, of course recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Cetaphil and use the face wash everyday.  Moisturizers are so expensive these days so I wanted to give the Cetaphil brand a try.  It seems to work as any other moisturizer does, which is alright with me for the price.</li>
    <li> I used this when my eczema was pretty bad and it kind of made it worse.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  I had never tried it before but it was like it was almost too moisturizing.  I know that&#x27;s weird with eczema, but it made my skin feel almost raw and it just hurt.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Restoring is the best cream for dry skin. I use it daily and its not greasy!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer/lotion available</li>
    <li> is just a very soothing lotion no scent but very effective</li>
    <li> Good quality &amp; delivery!!</li>
    <li> Works well and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and accurate description. It is very useful and powerful for dry skin in winter. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My mother loves her lotion. She also said how quickly it arrived thank you</li>
    <li> My eczema was stop itching after first using this body wash along with the moisturizer. at the second day, the eczema/break out was getting better. it is really nice product, really fast. although the smell is little wired.</li>
    <li> Helped immensely with my itchy excema.</li>
    <li> Baby was having really dry skin and breaking out on her cheeks. Tried the Aveeno wash &amp; lotion for eczema, but she broke out even worse. But after using this lotion and Cetaphil wash I see a difference in her skin, feels smoother and hopefully her skin gets better.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on very smooth and it does not leave that oily residue as other lotions. Honestly you would think if you wants baby&#x27;s skin to be hydrated &amp; moisturized you would want something that&#x27;s thick and stays on. However this product proves that it does not have to have a thick gooey consistency for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been lathering my baby with this as frequently as possible as quite honestly I&#x27;ve actually seen a dramatic change in her skin within the matter of 3 days of using it. The lotion itself has a thin feel and consistency and I love how really smooth it rubs onto her skin. Another plus is when your done, your hands aren&#x27;t sticky from a lotion that leaves oily stains or marks on your clothing. I just end up rubbing it on my hands. I will be buying another one of this to leave in her diaper bag. So worth buying!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and the Restoraderm is best lotion EVER.  Really helps moisturize and disguise this old body&#x27;s wrinkles.  It&#x27;s better than any restorative cream that sells in fancy stores for 10 times the price.</li>
    <li> my newborn baby had eczema and I was using Aquophor as recommended by the doctor. But that would made her skin too oily and also her skin used to get darker. But I started using restoraderm and it works wonders. Her eczema definitely got better and also it wont make the skin oily or spoil her clothes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was any better for my skin than regular cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I had written a review for body wash.. same goes with this.. This is for those who have ultra sensitive skin and J&amp; J or any other products doesnt suit them.. Keeps skin soft and subtle</li>
    <li> this product is recommended by our pediatrician. i tried a lot of lotions before and this is the only lotion that works for my baby&#x27;s eczema</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using this product for months now and it works the best out of any i&#x60;ve tried.  Just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for eczema. My baby has it and ebery time she itches we use it. It was recommended by her doctor. Too good to be true.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me as he gets promotional samples.  Product doesn&#x27;t smell and is not harsh or greasy.  I have it under subscribe and save and have been using it for about a year.  I needed something to replace the Neutrogena Body Moisturizer Daily Therapeutic Lotion - Fragrance Free as they discontinued the product and this is the closest I can find.  I use it daily and I would recommend it to those who are sensitive to soaps and detergents and great for those whom have eczema.  Of course, consult your doctor.</li>
    <li> My niece has eczema on her hands and this is the only lotion that has helped it heal. She puts this on repeatedly during the day and before going to bed at night. She also uses the body wash as her hand soap throughout the day. This really works for her.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  My infant daughter has pretty bad eczema and from reading some reviews for this, I decided to get it and try it out.  Guess what??  Almost instantly, she didn&#x27;t seem like she was itchy and didn&#x27;t cry when I put her down so that I could do some chores and napped pretty well that day too.  I was so excited.  Within 2 days her skin that used to feel like sandpaper feels A LOT smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried Aquaphor but it was incredibly greasy and it bugged me to death that it would get on everything.  Cetaphil Restoraderm isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs into the skin rather quickly.  I would highly recommend this product.  The only downside to it is that it&#x27;s kind of pricey (from CVS) and maybe next time I&#x27;ll order it online.  However, it works and gives me the peace of mind that my baby&#x27;s skin is healing (or at least not as itchy and red) and is a happy baby once more.  THANK YOU CETAPHIL!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product, specifically for atopic skin, is my favorite that i have tried that was not thick &amp; greasy and still relieved the flakiness of extremely dry skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My son used to have recurring scaly red patches/itchiness on his thighs and buttocks ever so often despite using Physiogel and other creams everyday. We stumbled upon this while holidaying in Tasmania while trying to find a fix for his bad skin rash. Really glad we finally found a cure for his skin condition!</li>
    <li> I have had eczema forever and nothing has reduced the inflammation and calmed my skin like this. In less than a week the cracks, bubbles and redness are on the retreat. Nobody was more surprised that it worked than me.</li>
    <li> When our daughter was born, we learned that she had eczema which needed to be contained and treated throughout the day.  When looking for options, we used Aquaphor to try to contain her diaper rash which was worse given that she had eczema.  Using this lotion throughout the day and after her bath did wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her skin is much better after two years of use and you can&#x27;t go wrong knowing this product is endorsed by the National Eczema Association.  Also with the reputation that Cetaphil has, I know this was a brand and product that I could trust!  My only gripe would be the price (in general) but am so happy to see Amazon carry this product and offer it as a subscribe and save item!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer with the Cetaphil body wash. I have very, very dry skin and used to use the expensive perfumed body wash and lotions(loved them!!) but switched to Cetaphil body wash and moisturizer and my skin is soooooo soft now.  Love it!! Glad I switched!!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;ve suffered from Eczema and dry, temperamental skin my whole 21 years of life. I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, including every type of Eucerine lotion, Cetaphil, Aveeno, CeraVe, and the list goes on. When I use the Restoraderm Cetaphil regularly, I definitely notice a decrease in my rashes and dry skin flare-ups. I also love that i&#x27;m able to use this on my face when it flares up as well, without it clogging my pores and making me look too greasy. Of course I still get my what I like to call \\&quot;hot spots,\\&quot; but that&#x27;s when a prescription strength steroid comes in handy. Overall, I absolutely love and recommend this product! Make sure to give your skin at least a few weeks to adjust before jumping to any conclusions.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for winter skin!</li>
    <li> This really helps the dryness of my skin, the moisture is very long lasting even in a very dry weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily since I purchased it but my skin is still very dry. It does relieve the itchiness from dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this calms it down.</li>
    <li> WORKS temporarily but it&#x27;s kind of greasy</li>
    <li> Love this item - have it on the subscription plan through Amazon</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written an amazon review, but I had to for this in case it helped someone else with their eczema.  I have had eczema and very dry skin since i was a kid (im 25 now).  Usually I would only get a flair up now and then, usually on my face when I would try a new makeup or a makeup remover my face wasn&#x27;t used to.  I would clear these flair ups with hydrocortisone which I have been prescribed by my doctor many times.  I moved to England last year and got a flair up not only on my face but now on my hands, it&#x27;s the worst I have ever had it.  Some days my face looks like a burn victim, and my hands are incredibly itchy, especially at night.  I used the steroid cream repeatedly, which would bring it down, but never cure it, it also would come back after i stopped using it for a few days.  I hated the fact I was using steroids knowing I might thin my skin, I also think i now have some red spots on my face due to the over use.  I came home a few weeks ago, and so upset with my skin went to see my doctor about my severe eczema I have had for a year.  He told be about cetaphil restoraderm cream.  Now I need to be honest, the first day I put it on my skin I woke up with even reder and more severe eczema.  Once again i looked like a burn victim.  I was upset that it didn&#x27;t work, but I thought I would continue to use it to give it a fair chance.  The next day my skin looked incredibly clearer, and each day after that it continued to get softer and clearer, the red spots are definitely fading, much to my happiness!  I wash my face at night (with johnsons baby shampoo, takes my makeup off and is incredibly gentle) and then I apply a layer of this cream after patting my face dry.  I must agree with some other people here that it does sting when you initially put it on.  But I think for anyone with a skin irritation already on their face it is just going to do that.  After a few minutes it sinks it and the stinging is gone.  I also put it on in the morning after my shower or after patting my face with water.  It absorbs much quicker that way.  It has been 2 weeks now since I&#x27;ve started.  This really is the best thing I have ever found for my face.  I was using Aveno but this is working way better, and is actually helping to diminish the redness from steroid use and the dry eczema on my skin.  I am so happy I went to the doctor to try this.  It hasn&#x27;t been much help to my hands, but to my face it has worked miracles.  And really lets be honest, I&#x27;m way more worried about my face at this point! Buy this cream if you have eczema on your face!! You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This help remove dry skin eczema. Keeps your skin smooth during the winter months. Its very easy to apply. Stays on for long.</li>
    <li> Kinda greasy it does work but I found other organic products to work about the same</li>
    <li> First of all - let me tell you that I have had eczema (atopic dermatits) my entire life, as long as I can remember. I&#x27;m 27 years old. For my entire life I Have used the cetaphil cream that comes in the tub. Killer deal for 20oz tubs at costco. Its good mositurizer, but doesnt do anything to heal. This year, while having a perticularily HORRIBLE flare up (something in the air or something this year, I swear I havent had this bad of skin in 10+ years) I&#x27;ve been trying new moisturizers to try to give some relief after making the choice to get off topical steriods (ugh). I went all natural, tried Shea butter, coconut oil, cold pressed olive oil, infused with lavender essential oils... tried shea moisture chamomile &amp; argan oil eczema therapy, hemp salve.... etc etc, nothing helped, and if anything made my skin worse. My trouble areas are my face, neck, wrists, forearms and inner elbows. I somehow just discovered this Restoraderm lotion (how did I not know of it sooner?!) and tried it. Duh. I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil products as long as I can remember, so I trust it and its worth a shot. Within 3 days I noticed an improvement. As of today i&#x27;ve gone through an entire bottle and am on bottle #2 and I would say I am 75% clearer. Obv its not a total healing... there is a reason why we eczema people have eczema, and its an internal battle of mine trying to find the root cause. But hey - 75% clearer, i will take that any day. YES like everyone else states it BURNS applying if you have open skin and for me it got worse the first day or 2 before It started getting better.&lt;br /&gt;For Kids i can understand not being able to use it. But if you can get it on them kiddos and immediately blow on their hot spots to cool the burning... it passes after just a few minutes. Like 2 or 3 mins and it doesnt burn anymore. If they are full body I can see not being able to use it. If your an adult, you just gotta get over the burn, its temporary... you can do it. Those are my opinions, overall i am very satisfied with this product and am setting myself up for re-order. It might be a little more spendy but totally worth it. If i could figure out how to upload a picture, I would post a before/after shot.tisfied with this product and am setting myself up for re-order. It might be a little more spendy but totally worth it. If i could figure out how to upload a picture, I would post a before/after shot.</li>
    <li> Once we started using this product along with the body wash, my daughters eczema cleared up by the next day.  Now we use it every day.  We had tried other lotions for eczema and nothing else worked.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and this lotion is the best at keeping my skin moisturized and the eczema from flaring up.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by our dermatologist for my younger ones sensitive (atopic) skin and there is no exaggeration in saying that from the very first day of application we witnessed very favorable results on her skin. We were advised to use this for a few years on a regular basis and I only hope that the effect is not temporary or addictive or something with side-effects in nature; unfortunately we may not be able to really know that until we have stopped using it (hence the 4 stars rating!).</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommended this lotion for use on our baby&#x27;s sensitive skin to alleviate and prevent rashes from the dry climate.  It&#x27;s worked great, no more rashes!  Much more effective than other baby-specific lotions on the market.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good for sensitive and dry skin. all of my famliy use this item. we really love this !</li>
    <li> I use it after a shower with the body wash. Skin feels silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt; No more itching even in very dry climates.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested by my dermatologist. It is the best lotion I ever used but I&#x27;m using it sparingly due to the cost.  I found it impossible to get in store, so I finally bought it on the internet.</li>
    <li> My son has sensitive skin and this is one product that works well for his skin. Never failed me so far.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey.  Goes on really light, soaks in, and is not greasy, not too heavy.  A really good moisturizer that lasts for awhile before you need to re-apply.  While my son does not have eczema, he gets super dry skin that makes him itch and causes scratches and sores.  While it does nothing for the itch, it keeps him moisturized so the scratching doesn&#x27;t start.  Has absolutely no smell or fragrance at all.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years.  Love it for my dry skin and itchy spots caused by Lupus DLE.</li>
    <li> I found this lotion when my husband started having reactions to some other skin lotions.  He is very sensitive to chemicals in foods and ointments, but he loves this one and it&#x27;s really helped even with his dry feet.</li>
    <li> cheap price and fast delivery is very good point</li>
    <li> This item is for my son and its a good for his itching skin as prescribe by the doctor.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion (and also the soap but I bought it at Target) for my young daughters that have very sensitive skin. It is so gentle that I am able to use it on my 4 month old.</li>
    <li> Worked well for my son.</li>
    <li> We bought this as my daughter has had problems with eczema and our pediatrician recommended it. we started using it 3 times a day, and noticed a big difference in just a few days Now her skin is really soft. When her skin is smooth, we just use it after her bath, and use it more frequently when her eczema gets bad.</li>
    <li> My had a breakout of eczema all over his body. We tried several different lotions and this one seemed to calm his irritated red skin the best. It has nice consistency, not too thick like aquaphore and not runny. There is no perfume smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I had Eczema but this cream has cleared it all, Love it</li>
    <li> My 12 month old daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product instead of Johnson&#x27;s &amp; Johnson&#x27;s for her eczema.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever! My face never feels too greasy or dry. Definitely worth the money to buy!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who works for a dermatologist recommended this lotion and body wash. My 2 year old has eczema and we have tried tons of things in the last two years to help with the appearance. Of all the prescriptions and over the counter creams, lotions, detergents, body washes-nothing has helped-UNTIL NOW. Cetaphil is AMAZING. I could not be more thrilled with the results. His arms are almost totally clear!!! His legs (the worst area) have improved dramatically, and we haven&#x27;t been using it long at all (so I&#x27;m sure we will continue to see results.) I was really beginning to think there was nothing out there. If you are skeptical, as I was, please give this a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this after sampling the same product from the doctor&#x27;s office for my 5 month old who has sever eczema. It worked great for about three weeks, but his skin is now so dry that the lotion stings when I apply it. I&#x27;d rank this as sufficient for mild-medium eczema but not recommended for severe winter eczema on dry rough skin. Baby doesn&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I super love this mosturizer. I have a sensitive skin and during winter especially my skin becomes flacky, dry and super itchy. I had to scratch my skin like really bad. I have been using many types of mosturizer from the local drug store, but nothing seems to work. This mosturizer really works for me. Skin becomes soft and less itchy. Definitely recommended for those who has sensitive and dry skin!</li>
    <li> My 5 month old son has severe eczema all over. This is the only cream which we can see improvement in a couple of hours after application. It has greatly reduced the need for steroid cream to control his eczema. I&#x27;m greatly relieved to have found a moisturiser his skin is responding to.&lt;br /&gt;No harm trying this cream if you have eczema.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that actually has an effect on my kids&#x27; exzyma.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this lotion to help with his eczema and he hasn&#x27;t had a flare up in about a year and I credit this lotion for that. It works great and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any improvement for my son&#x27;s eczema. He does not complain when i use cream but no improvements.</li>
    <li> not as oily as cetaphil lotion / cream</li>
    <li> The Best moisturizer for my very dry skin</li>
    <li> Pump was broken upon arrival. Seems to be slightly above average moisturizer recommended by my husbands dermatologist</li>
    <li> A Bit steep but definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> Very good product, calms skin</li>
    <li> The only lotion that helped my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema.  Tried aquaphor, different products by cerave, cetaphil, and aveeno, nothing worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Amlactin for a few years on the eczema my legs, decided to give this a try and I think it is more effective.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter who has very dry and sensitive skin.  She loves it and says it is way beyond expectations.  Would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I have found to keep my baby&#x27;s eczema under control. The ingredient content could have less toxic chemicals but using this is better than prescription steroid cream, so I deal with it. Make the lotion without the chemicals and I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Toddler screamed in pain when I used this.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for dry skin we&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> So good&lt;br /&gt;Thank you have&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ll take it&lt;br /&gt;Best cream I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;I really like baby skin&lt;br /&gt;So good&lt;br /&gt;Thank you have&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ll take it&lt;br /&gt;Best cream I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;I really like baby skin</li>
    <li> This stuff works works really well. My 5 month old has real bad eczema on his face. We were using aquaphor, then switched to this. This works so much better. It keeps his eczema at bay and we only have to spot treat with his prescription cream once a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using AVEENO and baby lotion but CETAPHIL is the #1 choice as a father for my infant&#x27;s skin.  It doesn&#x27;t just moisturize it but it almost cures his baby acne.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Got it in 2 days. Excellent service. The product seems to help with my dry skin. I do not have eczema, but my skin get very dry in winter.</li>
    <li> based on all those who suffer with eczema, i tried the Restoraderm product.  oh my gosh!  the first day was fine, but on the second day, my face began peeling like crazy!  it&#x27;s like the first day of a sunburn when you skin peels - only this is my face!  don&#x27;t know what to try now.</li>
    <li> Love this product and price! Super Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve tried other eczema lotions but this is by far the best. My son used to scratch until his skin starts to bleed after applying other lotions but after I use this lotion he calms right down, no scratching of bleeding.</li>
    <li> Was experiencing constant itching form dry skin. Tried several other products, but this one is working much better. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love it. This makes my body moisturized. :) I will use this one with my life.</li>
    <li> It is what the doctor prescribed for grandson under a year old, because he has Eczema. It works great for everyday lotion. It is hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> my son has atopic eczema and you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  when i started using cetaphil restoraderm on him, his skin started peeling and leaving softer smoother skin.  I used it together with the body wash, still has some more to go, especially on his knees and ankles, but his skin is better.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I buy this product a lot! Great condition! Works great for my sons eczema! Arrives on time!</li>
    <li> The combo of soap and lotion! Amazing! I&#x27;ve tried many things but this really helps immediately and helps keep away the evil eczema that nobody likes! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, lightweight body lotion for dry skin and eczema. I have used many body creams and lotions, but they were either too greasy or their effect was gone within a few hours. I was suggested to use this by a physician for extremely dry skin and so far it has made a great difference to my skin. Another recommendation was to get a humidifier or mister to reduce dry skin or scaliness in winters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema for my entire life (almost 30 years).  This lotion was a revelation.  My dermatologist recommended it to me one day and told me that it was specially formulated for eczema.  I&#x27;ve heard that before a million times from the million types of lotion I&#x27;ve used, but this really does moisturize and heal my skin better than anything you can get over the counter.  It&#x27;s also not greasy.</li>
    <li> Corisone seems to work better for me.</li>
    <li> I had a rash on my face that took away the pigment of my skin. This cream has helped with dryness and restore the pigment back. It wasn&#x27;t over night but within a month or two you start seeing results. Though there was instant dryness and irritation control.</li>
    <li> works for my nephews scaly skin. very soothing.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this one did not work on my baby.  She has eczema and it made it worse.  I do however use the shampoo and it works great!  I have learned though that it really depends on your baby.  It&#x27;s a trail and error situation where you have to find out which lotion your baby best responds to.</li>
    <li> Never in my 47 years have I found a lotion that hydrates my skin so well. It&#x27;s a little pricey but after using it, I see why. Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> It seems to keep your hands and face moister longer than most lotions (even many which are rated higher, like Lubriderm). Attractive packaging and a slightly thicker than average texture make it seem a bit more luxurious than many other lotions. Nice that it is fragrance-free. Way better than any Vaseline product, which causes rashes and itching for us sensitive-skinned folks.</li>
    <li> so far so good but have only used it a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is a well known and recommended moisturizer, so I anticipate it to work well.</li>
    <li> My wife was introduced to this lotion at a Certified Nurse Practitioner&#x27;s conference last year and we have been using it since.  This lotion has nearly no scent and leaves your skin softer but not nearly as greasy as many other lotions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my daughter , she need to apply it daily. Very good cream</li>
    <li> It is suitable for very dry skin.  Especially for Eczema.  The skin show improvement in a short timie. Very good.</li>
    <li> My pediatrician recommended this for my son when he was younger (he&#x27;s 3+ years now), as he&#x27;d have spots of dry and bumpy skin.  Those still come up now and again, but when we&#x27;re diligent about lathering it onto his arms and legs, the bumpy spots disappear.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on him or on our hands either.  We buy from Amazon as it&#x27;s less expensive than buying in the stores (unless there&#x27;s a sale).</li>
    <li> Amazing cream - keeps my son&#x27;s skin moist and beautiful. I also use it to treat severely dry winter skin on me. Literally magical!</li>
    <li> I am amazed how this is keeping my diabetic rashes under control. It does not eliminate them, but it does more good that prescription meds. I have been using this for several years and really did not pay attention when it changed the title to &amp;#34;Eczema Calming&amp;#34;. But very soon I noticed how well my skin improved. This is more comforting than Nystatin!</li>
    <li> i bought tons of this stuff as my paed said my daughter had exema but then i found out it&#x27;s got some nasty stuff in it http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query&#x3D;cetaphil+restoraderm&amp;h&#x3D;Search</li>
    <li> I do not have any skin issues such as eczema or extra dry skin  but I do like the way cetaphil  conditions and replenishes my skin.  It makes it feel soft and supple. Cetaphil makes my skin look healthy  and gives it a wonderful glow. Great product for me.</li>
    <li> Together with the body wash, results are almost immediate.</li>
    <li> This cleared my eczema up within 2 weeks! Love it. I have a monthly order.</li>
    <li> moisturizes and calms the itches without making you feel sticky and icky.</li>
    <li> i have very dry skin &amp; i use this as a night moisturizer. it&#x27;s fantastic, it has cleared up my skin and it is perfect for winter dryness.</li>
    <li> Nice light lotion.No breakouts.</li>
    <li> Non drying good for sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t feel dry or tight after using it, yet you do feel clean. I think it helps with acne, but that will vary from person to person.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing through all day&lt;br /&gt;and quick delivery^^</li>
    <li> I bought this per the recommendation of my dermatologist. Immediately, it made my skin burn and caused my eczema to become even worse, leaving a raised red rash. Horrible product for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have really dry, sensitive skin - this works well and was still gentle enough to not cause an adverse reaction</li>
    <li> My son had very sensitive skin as a baby and the pediatrician recommended Cetaphil brand. We used both the body wash and the lotion. It worked great ad smelled nice too, not like medicine.</li>
    <li> Feels light but moisturizes really well.</li>
    <li> My 4 month old has mild eczema...I use aquaphor in the morning after his bath and then use this all day long for about 2-3 times.this works great on my baby skin.</li>
    <li> keeping eczema at bay...</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY cleanser that I can use on my sensitive, dry skin. It leaves your skin hydrated and soft. If used in conjunction with the Restoraderm  moisturizer, your skin will thank you. Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know I was getting this. Scanned my baby&#x27;s body wash bottle and didn&#x27;t catch it linked to lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t intentionally or unintentionally buy this again. Way too expensive too!</li>
    <li> Slightly irritating, but the effect is the feeling is good.</li>
    <li> Awesome, used these like toilet paper</li>
    <li> somehow its manufacture year is 2015 though I ordered it in December, 2014. I&#x27;d like to know what happened</li>
    <li> I found it fits my body. :D</li>
    <li> My 4 month old son had eczema on his trunk, face and legs. I applied this lotion twice a day for a week and the eczema is gone!</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  This was recommended by our pediatrician and has worked great to reduce/remove bumps on our baby&#x27;s skin due to eczema.</li>
    <li> I like the product itself, but think it&#x27;s costly for the quantity received.  My 14 month old daughter has dry skin/eczema and our ped recommended this particular lotion.  It works great, but I think the regular Cetaphil lotion does the job almost as well (admittedly it&#x27;s greasier) for a much lower cost (we are able to purchase it at Costco for a great price).</li>
    <li> I have had eczema since birth and gone thru many products. This lotion is great. It does not sting! It has helped calm down and heal my hands and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel like paper anymore.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I keep this by my nightstand during the winter.  When things get try I use this to put instant moisture back in to my skin.  There is no scent and it lasts for a good while.  It&#x27;s non-oily but effective.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been diagnosed with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product out of desperation. I have extremely sensitive skin on my face, dry, flaky cheeks and prone to breakouts. I was using a pretty good moisturizer, but unfortunately it was discontinued. I switched to Clinique, which worked for like a week and then my skin got really dry and angry. I tried the new Neutrogena line that&#x27;s suppose to be almost all natural (whatever that actually means in the beauty world), and it tried out my cheeks so bad they were red, peeling, and painful. I bought restoraderm because cetaphil is usually pretty moisturizing, and I figured the promise to help eczema couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....as a face moisturizer, this product is pretty good. It&#x27;s still not perfect, but my cheeks are no longer dry and flaky (although still red and sensitive). My nose is still pretty dry, although a little better than it has been. The lotion is a little heavier than the traditional moisturizer, and I notice that if I put a lot on, my cheeks it will stay greasy for an hour or so (which is nice at night). The product seems buildable - I put a thin layer on in the morning which soaks in fairly quickly so I can apply makeup, and a couple layers at night for the extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s been causing breakouts on my chin, but they seem to be healing now so I haven&#x27;t decided yet if it&#x27;s something in the lotion, or just that my skin is so confused by the sudden excess moisture. I will continue to use this product for a while to see if my skin continues to improve.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and this product helped the rashes from his skin go away. The delivery was nice and fast. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> As I have atopic dermatitis my skin tends to get dry constantly. Love this product! It helped me a lot and I love the way it absorbs in the skin.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  It is not greasy and goes on very easily.  I plan to reorder after I run out.</li>
    <li> I just love the delightful scent the prodect has, even thought it comes without frangrance. Very tender and comfortable. I will keep using it even after my eczema is gone.</li>
    <li> GOT TO BUY THE GREEN LABEL. NOT THE BLUE LABEL BOTTLE.  REALLY GOOD STUFF AND NOTHING WORKS LIKE IT.  MY DERMATOLOGIST HIGHLY RECOMMENDS THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> is a good product, relationship, quality - price is fair, you can purchase recoemndar comes well packed, good overall. is recommended.</li>
