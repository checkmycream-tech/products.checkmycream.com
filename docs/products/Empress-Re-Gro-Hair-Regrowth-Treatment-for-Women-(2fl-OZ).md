      <li>The product was okay.  </li>

      <li>Feel free to contact me if you you&#x27;d like additional info :)  </li>
      <li>I saw it advertised on BET and was impressed at how it had helped other customers.</li>
      <li>Before ordering this product, I strongly suggest you do your research on the product.</li>
      <li>so I kept on using it which I strongly regret and wish I had just stopped using it whenever I noticed it.</li>
      <li>I loved it and will be ordering some more later.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying This product!!!</li>
      <li>I received this Re-Gro product on last Thursday 6-11-2015, and I have used it myself, I do my own hair most of the time.</li>
      <li>I loves it and getting ready to order some more, not to mention how fast it was shipped too!!!</li>
      <li>Great product will recommend to any one who is expericencing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;light and easy to use not greasy or heavy</li>
      <li>This product truly and quickly</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;m pregnant and because my hair cane out in patches around my edges</li>
      <li>The product did not work for me, the main ingrediant researchers aren&#x27;t sure why it works for SOME people and not all.</li>
      <li>The growth is not dramatic, but there IS fine hair filling in the crown of my head.</li>
      <li>The product does exactly what is professes to do!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t comment on its success in what it says it does at this time.  </li>
      <li>I wish the seller was more clear in describing  the product</li>
      <li>I see right now</li>
      <li>but surely I&#x27;ve added a little more to the process......</li>
      <li>When I started using this product, I had thinning at the top middle of my head and on both sides from wearing braids.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>I started seeing results within the first couple weeks.</li>
      <li>When the first product came in mail I thought &amp;#34;Oh boy here goes nothing....</li>
      <li>Anyone interested should really research how this drug works and what it&#x27;s side affects are before using it.</li>
      <li>I appreciated the Postman or Postwoman getting this hair product to me pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want anything happening to my brain.</li>
      <li>product is for a certain pattern of hair loss.</li>
      <li>I just ordered this based on all of the positive reviews i really hope it works for me.</li>
      <li>I have not seen much growth but I am sticking to this product.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous to try this product, I&#x27;ve never purchased a hair regrowth product before.</li>
      <li>The product really helped my hair.</li>
      <li>And the attitude you receive when calling to inquire about your monies are very unprofessional.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I read prior comments about the return problems this company had given others, so I placed a return receipt / signature required service  on my order.</li>
      <li>I had no results instead of a very itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>; Thanks To Re-Gro.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Wow, that was very smart.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly over a week now, and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I ws very surprised at the success I am having with this product, the bald spots are starting to fill in.</li>
      <li>I wear a lot of braids and my last style snatched my edges right out.</li>
      <li>Since I started using empress re-gro hair regrowth treatment for women I have some results of new hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months and have noticed new hair growth in an area that was &amp;#34;baby butt smooth.&amp;#34; But</li>
      <li>and I did have new hair growth.</li>
      <li>But I can see new hair.</li>
      <li>So it really looks promising if i would only just to commit to it faithfully.</li>
      <li>However this is her second bottle but seems to be better than the other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>her hair is thicker and longer (mid shoulder blade length hair) than when she first started using the product.</li>
      <li>i had to come up with clever styles to hide the quarter size bald spot right on my right temple in plain sight!  </li>
      <li>You could clearly see my scalp.</li>
      <li>not showing any progress with this product, I have had for a couple of months so far not showing any improvement</li>
      <li>so much so, I am about to place an order as I want to have it on hand when my current bottle is finished.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am now on my 2nd bottle, admittedly, I was not consistent with the 1st bottle, however since consistently using the 2nd bottle, I can state without a doubt Re-Gro works. I was balding at the crown of my head, in fact you could see what I was thinking (lol). The growth is not dramatic, but there IS fine hair filling in the crown of my head. I am very pleased with Re-Gro, so much so, I am about to place an order as I want to have it on hand when my current bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair to hard to comb through. I did not like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months on the recommendation of my stylist due to hair loss as a result of taking a medication.  My hair is growing back and the thinning has stopped.  Very happy wit the results.</li>
    <li> I have use this product in the pass, About five years ago my hair hand thin out in the middle. I fought out about ReGro product, in&lt;br /&gt;3 to 6 month my hair  was full, thick in the middle.</li>
    <li> did not order, but love this product</li>
    <li> I should have purchased more. Didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three months now and I can tell that this product does work. Even though I am wearing crochete braids, I still put the regro on every day and I can tell it&#x27;s working. My hair is getting really thick. Going to be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail between today and tomorrow I should get shampoo and conditioner today I order all the products so in a month or two I&#x27;ll let you know if it worked</li>
    <li> I ws very surprised at the success I am having with this product, the bald spots are starting to fill in. I will continue to use it as the product does what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> The product was okay.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times; can&#x27;t really say much about it, since I did not really keep up with the applications and time needed to see some improvement.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp. Noticing results already.</li>
    <li> I have been using Regrow for almost 6 months now. I started seeing results within the first couple weeks. I had thin edges and started using Regrow as directed on the box. It really works! I am very satisfied with this product. Purchase and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I chose this product to see if it would work for me after loosing my hair to chemo, For two years I have been trying to regrow my hair with not much  success. Since I started using empress re-gro hair regrowth treatment for women I have some results of new hair. I will continue using this product to get even better results.</li>
    <li> Love it ,it works well arrived on time</li>
    <li> I used the product for 2 months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth on my scalp. However I did notice small bumps in my head and a lot of itching.</li>
    <li> I saw it advertised on BET and was impressed at how it had helped other customers. I&#x27;ve yet to be impressed. Still waiting for it to work on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on the crown of my head for one year now. The hair on top of my head now is just as thick as the rest of my hair. Before using Re-Gro, the hair on the crown of my head was very thin and very short, approximately 1-1/2 inches. You could clearly see my scalp. Since using Re-Gro, its grown six inches. I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work instead it my edges out... When I opened the product was already unsealed which I didn&#x27;t like... Would I recommand this product to anyone no..</li>
    <li> I was very nervous to try this product, I&#x27;ve never purchased a hair regrowth product before. To start I only applied it once a day even though they recommended you apply it twice a day. After about a month I started to notice a weird tingly feeling and then the area where I have the thinning began to thicken. The draw back, was hair growth on my side burns. So, I stopped using it for a bit then I noticed the thinning returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month now, haven&#x27;t really been totally committed to using it as directed, but i really can see a little improvement. My sides are really really thin, and for the last 3 weeks, i wore a wig while using this product. I wash my hair this weekend, and didn&#x27;t put the wig back on because i saw some improvement on my sides. So it really looks promising if i would only just to commit to it faithfully. By the way, I&#x27;m a 47 yr old african americam. For all that posted a negative review, miracles doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but in due time.</li>
    <li> i have not used the product long enough to rate it yet. sorry that i don&#x27;t have more information on this item.</li>
    <li> AWSOME!! I think its working already! I only had it a few weeks.  Very very bad hair loss like never before; I take medication for kidney, stressful &amp; depress at times of family matters. I&#x27;ll tell everyone soon to, check my results of Re-Gro.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> does not grow hair, drips all over the skin, its hard to contain it to the specific area of no hair needed.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this product, I strongly suggest you do your research on the product. Unfortunately, I did not. Once receiving the product, my doctor informed me that the ingredients in this product would be a medical disaster for my health. I received documentation explaining why I could not use the product and returned it at MY cost. Fortunately, I read prior comments about the return problems this company had given others, so I placed a return receipt / signature required service  on my order. Wow, that was very smart. Once I knew the product had been received and signed for by the customer service supervisor, Ms. Rhonda Jones, I began to call them inquiring about my credit. It litterly took approx. 3 months for them to acknowledge that they indeed received the product EVEN after providing them the tracking information. Unbelievable! Then they take the S &amp; H from your refund, therefore after you paying to return it and them taking $30+ for shipping charges...well you do the math! And the attitude you receive when calling to inquire about your monies are very unprofessional. The countless phone calls, the time you&#x27;re placed on hold, the amount of money you lose when returning their product....it would be cheaper to just buy a wig!!!</li>
    <li> Used Empress Re-gro product before but never had a reaction. With this order my scalp was tender and red. Because it runs upon applying it also caused a red bump on my forehead. Will buy over the counter in the future and will not order from this provider again.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what is professes to do! My hair is growing!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Try it today!</li>
    <li> Sooooo when  I saw the informercial back in the summer of 2013 I just thought &amp;#34;Yeah I&#x27;m sure it does work.....&amp;#34;  But then I thought hey it&#x27;s only $20 so I&#x27;ll try it, and I did.  When the first product came in mail I thought &amp;#34;Oh boy here goes nothing....&amp;#34; But to my surprise I started seeing results within a week.  Initially I shaved the problem areas completely bald because I wanted to physically SEE the growth (yeah I&#x27;m impatient like that lol).....So I shaved them, and I put the 1ml twice a day just like the directions say and within a week I noticed a change.  After about a month I was so impressed that I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner and began to use that as well.  My routine was to use regro (as directed) twice a day, and every weekend I would wash my hair with the regro shampoo and conditioner (which I also love).  10 months in and slowly but surely I&#x27;ve added a little more to the process...... Now I apply the regro treatment twice a day (as directed) and at night before I lay down I lightly massage a very small amount emo oil into the scalp of the problem areas, tie my hair up with a satin scarf and sleep :), I also take biotin (7,500 MCG {micrograms} which equates to about 7.5 mg {miligrams}.  I posted a video review on the Regro $19.99 box if you&#x27;d like to actually SEE my growth.  If people request it I&#x27;ll do an update video......  Feel free to contact me if you you&#x27;d like additional info :)  I hope this helps everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**DISCLAIMER!!!! DRINK LOTS OF WATER WHEN TAKING BIOTIN OR THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY YOU WILL DEVELOP ACNE!!!!!! **</li>
    <li> This product does work. I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months and have noticed new hair growth in an area that was &amp;#34;baby butt smooth.&amp;#34; But a couple of weeks ago I noticed small itchy bumps in the area of use and large knots at the nap of my neck. I&#x27;ve discontinued using it until futher notice from my physician. (Appt. tomorrow) I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem with the product, I think I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. Half of my head is bald from using this product for a month. When I started using this product, I had thinning at the top middle of my head and on both sides from wearing braids. I used the minoxidil and the shampoo and my hair began to shed and shed every day until I had no hair from my crown to my forehead all the way across. When I called the manufacturers they told me that they would not refund me unless I had used the product for three months and then rudely got agitated with me and hung up on me. This product produced no results but baldness. I have to wear wigs for the rest of my life because I look like Fire Marshall Bill or like I have the onset of Cancer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly over a week now, and I can already see a huge difference. Def will keep ordering</li>
    <li> The product really helped my hair. It is healthy and growing.</li>
    <li> No improvements. A waste of money. I want a refund. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I am now growing hair again.  I am very pleased with Empress Regrow.</li>
    <li> Should of done more reasearch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is for a certain pattern of hair loss.I was misled by the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I could not use the product. I wish the seller was more clear in describing  the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is working but i can see a little (very little) hair growth. I will give it a bit more time. Shipping is great.</li>
    <li> When I received this product in the mail, the seal was broken, there were human hair around the top of the bottle and the product had leaked out in it&#x27;s package. Had to through the product away.... what a waste of money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor experience.</li>
    <li> Havnt used for a month. But I can see new hair. Woo hoo. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the four months hold.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months I have seen a differece in my hair I was thinning in the crown of my head I can see the hair is feeling in.  I truely recommend this product if your hair is thinning works perfect with shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> She has the natural thinning of hair due to age but, also her father was bald at an early age so some genetic disposition is also&lt;br /&gt;involved.  However this is her second bottle but seems to be better than the other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; advertised for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to grow out her hair for a specific cut she has in mind and she is well on her way&amp;#34; Thanks To Re-Gro.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> not showing any progress with this product, I have had for a couple of months so far not showing any improvement</li>
    <li> I guess I should have bought a bigger size of other product from the line to get any results.Did nothing for me</li>
    <li> This product contains minoxodill.  The same chemical that is in Rogaine.  Anyone interested should really research how this drug works and what it&#x27;s side affects are before using it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved these stuff for her hair. It seems to works well because I order this every other month</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my edges I wear a lot of braids and my last style snatched my edges right out. So it has a long list of do not use if...I couldn&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;m pregnant and because my hair cane out in patches around my edges Abby way I will not purchase after my delivery because what ever chemical they choose to put in must be harmful on some level.</li>
    <li> My mother uses this to regrow her hair that was thinning out.  She uses this as instructed and it has been growing her hair back.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a while just starting using it.  Can&#x27;t comment on its success in what it says it does at this time.  All I can say is was received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase this product again. I had no results instead of a very itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I had a severe skin reaction to the product. It is still happening as I write this  Severe rash and scalp discoloration with  drying to skin flaking even caused puffiness of my eyes</li>
    <li> This product along with NouriTress was and still is a life saver for me when my hair came out due to stress.  I must say the Nouritress products were better.  But I&#x27;m going to finish using the product until it finished.......</li>
    <li> The failed to specify the type of hair loss that this alleviates. I wanted to use it on my hairline. Its only for the back of the head where men usually go bald first.</li>
    <li> I loves it and getting ready to order some more, not to mention how fast it was shipped too!!!</li>
    <li> I was dissatisfied before I ended my call with the representative.  I informed her that I did not want to continue and have decided that I did not want the product.  Unfortunately, I had already given her my credit card information.  Two days later my credit card was charged $51.88.  I called and spoke with an supervisor whom was eating in my ear and very rude informed me that the order had shipped and there was nothing that I could do.  Do not order I wish I had done my research before I called these people.  I see right now this is going to take some work to get out of this mess.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! I&#x27;m really pleased with the product. I was really happy to find this product.Thanks for carrying This product!!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen much growth but I am sticking to this product. We will see if I have any changes within my hair in 4 months.</li>
    <li> It works, my hair has grown back</li>
    <li> Even though this is a product advertised for women I am trying it at it works just as good for men..</li>
    <li> i must say i am not one for promoting products.  but i MUST MUST throw this one out there for all to see. I am a person who keeps my hair in braids and therefore the edges tend to break off and eventually bald. i had to come up with clever styles to hide the quarter size bald spot right on my right temple in plain sight!  Ladies when I tell you within 2 weeks i was seeing sprouts and a month later no evidence of balding. I stood in the mirror and cried! This product truly and quickly works.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that i defintely will make sure to budget in my expenses for the month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT GREAT GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY TIME AND EFFORT, THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN, VITAMINS WORK BETTER THEN THIS DOES.. NEVER BUY AGAIN VITAMINS WORKS BETTER</li>
    <li> I received this Re-Gro product on last Thursday 6-11-2015, and I have used it myself, I do my own hair most of the time. Also, on Wed. 6-17-2015, my beautician used it in my hair and she liked using it, also. I appreciated the Postman or Postwoman getting this hair product to me pretty fast. Have a Blessed Day!</li>
    <li> This product after s period of six months use has brought bacteria buildup, flakes, and a discoloration to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Ok but not great. Did not notice as much improvement in hair regrowth as I had expected. Maybe I should have used it longer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t not work. I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
    <li> I hv a patient that is loosen hair &amp; the front top of her head she has been usin twice a day it is so so</li>
    <li> I just ordered this based on all of the positive reviews i really hope it works for me. i have begun to get the male pattern baldness due to my hormonal change because of my pcos and i am desperate i wanted to know if anyone who has used this has had box braids in their hair and does this have any affect on how it will work?</li>
    <li> I loved it and will be ordering some more later.</li>
    <li> I have thinning edged from years of wearing weaves and I thought this would be the perfect product because its made just for us African American women but WRONG it made my sides itchy, EXTREMLY DRY and flaky!! I thought that maybe that is what happened before I actually started seeing results so I kept on using it which I strongly regret and wish I had just stopped using it whenever I noticed it. After about 2 more weeks of using this product ALL of my hair had fell out!! :( It seriously wasn&#x27;t even an inch all I had left was my the hair in the middle of my head (basically my bangs) I was devastated because I ended with less hair than I started off with. So try this product at your own risk...I did grow my hair back though by getting it braided up in micros and I took these hair pills called hair formula 37 if you want to grow your hair try those they are AMAZING!! If anyone has questions I would love to tell you about the Re-gro or even the hair pills if you&#x27;d like my e-mail is ashonti.wright@yahoo.com Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I only used it a  month.  I have just started another 30 day treatment.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll see more results soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is simply applied by dropper to the affected scalp area twice a day. It takes about a minute tops.</li>
    <li> I was leery of all the possible negative reactions connected with this item.  I certainly don&#x27;t want anything happening to my brain.</li>
    <li> Great product will recommend to any one who is expericencing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;light and easy to use not greasy or heavy</li>
    <li> My mom loved this as a part of her birthday gift package of beauty essentials.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad reaction to this product,consult a doctor before using this product!</li>
    <li> The product did not work for me, the main ingrediant researchers aren&#x27;t sure why it works for SOME people and not all. Waste of money for something uncertain</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it.  not only did it not regrow my hair I was unable to get a refund of my money.  If you try it keep in mind they have your credit card number and will continue to send the product every 30 days and charge your card.  Please learn from my mistake.</li>
    <li> RE-GRO IS REALLY A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERANT IN THE HAIR.I ONLY USE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND CAN SEE THE CHANGE.</li>
    <li> i purchased a regro treatment. my hair or shall my lack of hair around my edges were thin. i purchased the regr0 treatment and within weeks i saw great results. i just purchased on last nite the shampoo and another treatment when i finish this bottle. i am amazed at how my edges have grown out, i can now wear myown hair and put aside the wigs for awhile. i would like to say thank you to the makers of regro. i salute you for a job well done. those that it didn&#x27;t work for i&#x27;m sorry. but it did work for me. i am so satisfied with the end results.</li>
    <li> The results take too long, was hoping that after a month the hair would grow back</li>
    <li> Great product, I used it as directed and I did have new hair growth. I have bought it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am impressed with the changes in my hair it looks more fuller.  I noticed that my hair is more strong and doesn&#x27;t fall.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item for my mom several times, she uses this and other products like clock work this has truly helped her hair grow back her hair is thicker and longer (mid shoulder blade length hair) than when she first started using the product.</li>
    <li> It really works great produce.  I have really enjoyed how well my hair has grown back in due to a bad perm.  Great product.</li>
