      <li>THANKS!!!</li>
      <li>It is a great color and lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get the stuff on</li>
      <li>Personally, I apply it with a Bare Escentuals \\&quot;Heavenly Face\\&quot; brush and it&#x27;s FLAWLESS.</li>
      <li>Super disapponited.</li>
      <li>This is a not so cheaply priced but definitely cheap knock off of the real deal..</li>
      <li>i purchased this foundation is maceys a while ago and was amazing thought i was saving money but same color /nc35 does match at all like the store one I bought</li>
      <li>I love the way it transforms an ordinary face in to a classy, beautiful one.</li>
      <li>The real Mac studio fix has little to almost no sent and it covers beautifully.</li>
      <li>Ok, so i love MAC products and i have a few that my mom bought me for school.</li>
      <li>I am an avid Amazon shopper (just ask my husband).</li>
      <li>this is the first time I purchase a MAC product not from MAC itself.</li>
      <li>My only beef with it is the price -- kinda spendy, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m glad I can get it online.</li>
      <li>Gives a lawless finish and sets into your skin smoothly making your face look soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>More then likely would purchase again since its just powder.</li>
      <li>Like this a lot, my second favorite foundation compacts, my favorite is chanel double perfection compact.</li>
      <li>It was not the real mac product!</li>
      <li>I bought this product, and for my surprise it was not the real thing!</li>
      <li>Next time I run out, I&#x27;m going to the mac store for sure to get the real stuff.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it fast,</li>
      <li>It stays on very well and has never seemed to add to any of my skin issues.</li>
      <li>Much easier that way.</li>
      <li>also is light physically if that matters ,,?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Optimal materials and arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this item is the real thing.</li>
      <li>I also have been using this product for years &amp; this is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Optimal materials and arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The product is the same, no damage, no funky smell, everything ok, so far.  </li>
      <li>Normally, this is a quality product!  </li>
      <li>It was overly perfumed and it went on super sheer.</li>
      <li>I love MAC cosmetics, and yes, they are much more expensive online than at the MAC counter, but I am so busy, that it is easier for me to order online.  </li>
      <li>it was a display item that it was offered as a brand new one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Guess ya live</li>
      <li>Doen&#x27;t feel natural to me.</li>
      <li>I always buy them direct at MAC counters.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to shopping directly from a Mac counter.</li>
      <li>I realized they must be old.</li>
      <li>Everything on the outside of the case looked real but the inside was totally not MAC.</li>
      <li>Color is way lighter than the real MAC shade and it is dryer, doesn&#x27;t cover up as expected!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend customers to be careful with this seller so you would not be scammed as I was.</li>
      <li>It was solid rock could barely get it on sponge aplicator had to sratch it with a pin into dust</li>
      <li>When you use your skin looks beautiful, plus you can use it as a base or powder.</li>
      <li>The sticker on the bottom of the compact is on upside down and the entire compact is lighter than a real MAC compact.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if product was old or something, but this was a let down.</li>
<li> The powder was very clumpy and looked either fake or very expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is not real MAC, and it&#x27;s immediately clear due to the quality.</li>
<li> I brought it into a MAC counter and they confirmed the powder was fake</li>
<li> Did not liked it much...</li>
<li> It was not the same color as the usual MAC product i use, it was a different weight, the container was a knock off and even the writing on the container was different.</li>
<li> I wear it, gives me a dry feeling on my skin.</li>
<li> Be careful when ordering these online!</li>
<li> This compact, however,  was was too dark, and this product is unusable for my skin tone.</li>
<li> The quality was terrible, but I guess I should have known since the price was so good.</li>
<li> the product i received expected a quality product not a cheap chinesse copy</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just trying to warn other women (and men) who use the product not to waste their money.</li>
<li> The color was not  consistent from the past orders .</li>
<li> SO even though it is a little pricey</li>
<li> but when i put it on it came out cakey, no matter how little i put on.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s started to get hard and pitted in the center.</li>
<li> Waste of time trust and money.</li>
<li> This product is not authentic.</li>
<li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
<li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
<li> I hate giving bad reviews but honestly, if I could give this no stars I would.</li>
<li> I hardly ever break out now!</li>
<li> I am not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
<li> and it is a fake.</li>
<li> The product sent to me was FAKE.</li>
<li> It seems that it is a fake product.</li>
<li> but it broke me out soo bad</li>
<li> &#x3D;/</li>
<li> I feel absolutely disappointed with this order.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Mac Studio Fix Foundation as I love this product.  I always buy them direct at MAC counters.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought it at Amazon and the price is surprisingly cheaper.  The product is the same, no damage, no funky smell, everything ok, so far.  So I&#x27;m happy that I was able to get it at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this foundation! My only beef with it is the price -- kinda spendy, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m glad I can get it online. Much easier that way. Personally, I apply it with a Bare Escentuals \\&quot;Heavenly Face\\&quot; brush and it&#x27;s FLAWLESS. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best powder on the market. Gives a lawless finish and sets into your skin smoothly making your face look soft and hydrated. Love this powder!</li>
    <li> Ok, so i love MAC products and i have a few that my mom bought me for school. I was so excited to get the stuff on but when i put it on it came out cakey, no matter how little i put on. It&#x27;s just gross.  I also have the liquid kind thats a very good product but it broke me out soo bad, i&#x27;m 14 so this was a BIG deal.</li>
    <li> This powder is fantastic when you need coverage. I actually wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone that doesn&#x27;t need to cover anything though. It stays on very well and has never seemed to add to any of my skin issues. It has become a must in my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine through lowpricecosmetics- and it is a fake. Smells different, different size application pad, not even the correct shade! I have been wearing NC35 for ten years, and when I opened this product, it was orange! The sticker on the bottom of the compact is on upside down and the entire compact is lighter than a real MAC compact. Be careful when ordering these online! I am filing a fraud claim.</li>
    <li> Great product but came a shade darker than I anticipated.. Would be good for a spring or summer look but Not for winter. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> The color was not  consistent from the past orders . I have used Mac for years. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, and for my surprise it was not the real thing! I have been using Mac products for yrs, and this specific powder was bogus. I highly recommend customers to be careful with this seller so you would not be scammed as I was.</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic. Everything on the outside of the case looked real but the inside was totally not MAC. I brought it into a MAC counter and they confirmed the powder was fake, even the shade was not NC35.</li>
    <li> The product sent to me was FAKE. It was not the same color as the usual MAC product i use, it was a different weight, the container was a knock off and even the writing on the container was different. It is disgusting that people try and scam others like this. WARNING- DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SENDER.</li>
    <li> It was not the real mac product! Next time I run out, I&#x27;m going to the mac store for sure to get the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I love MAC cosmetics, and yes, they are much more expensive online than at the MAC counter, but I am so busy, that it is easier for me to order online.  With that said, I love NC35.  It is a great color and lasts all day long. You must however know which color matches your skin tone, or you will just be guessing, and wasting your money.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received mac studio tech when it was supposed to be mac studio fix. Any one want to explain difference?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this item is the real thing. It was overly perfumed and it went on super sheer. The real Mac studio fix has little to almost no sent and it covers beautifully. This product does not compare at all. Waste of time trust and money. I&#x27;ll stick to shopping directly from a Mac counter.</li>
    <li> It is a professional product, very good. When you use your skin looks beautiful, plus you can use it as a base or powder. I recommend it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot, my second favorite foundation compacts, my favorite is chanel double perfection compact. This is a great product, I find myself still touching up during the day but it gives a nice full coverage. The seller shipped it fast,</li>
    <li> Actually it took weeks to deliver. And once I started using them I realized they must be old. It&#x27;s started to get hard and pitted in the center. Super disapponited.</li>
    <li> I exclusively use this product, and I am very familiar with what the color should be.  Normally, this is a quality product!  This compact, however,  was was too dark, and this product is unusable for my skin tone. I don&#x27;t know if product was old or something, but this was a let down.</li>
    <li> This is a not so cheaply priced but definitely cheap knock off of the real deal.. I am an avid Amazon shopper (just ask my husband). I am not being paid by anyone for this review. I&#x27;m just trying to warn other women (and men) who use the product not to waste their money. PLEASE LOOK AT THE PICTURES I POSTED AND READ THE CAPTIONS. That says it all. I hate giving bad reviews but honestly, if I could give this no stars I would. PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> i purchased this foundation is maceys a while ago and was amazing thought i was saving money but same color /nc35 does match at all like the store one I bought also is light physically if that matters ,,?</li>
    <li> NUNCA LLEGO AL DESTINO</li>
    <li> I love my MAC cover up it seems to last for ever the last one I purchased was about 11 months ago. SO even though it is a little pricey I last a long time</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! I&#x27;ve been using MAC NC35 for years and this is not the same thing. It seems that it is a fake product. Color is way lighter than the real MAC shade and it is dryer, doesn&#x27;t cover up as expected! I feel absolutely disappointed with this order.</li>
    <li> Everything was great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really liked, I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Optimal materials and arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all the amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked, I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Optimal materials and arrived very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all the amazon...</li>
    <li> It was solid rock could barely get it on sponge aplicator had to sratch it with a pin into dust so I could&lt;br /&gt;Get it on sponge</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed the product i received expected a quality product not a cheap chinesse copy I hope an explanation from you</li>
    <li> This product is counterfeit. It is not real MAC, and it&#x27;s immediately clear due to the quality.</li>
    <li> This is was a display item that it is not even close to the color offered. My wife noticed when she open the case, doesn&#x27;t bring the powder pad, in resume it was a display item that it was offered as a brand new one. I hope that nobody buy anything from this seller</li>
    <li> this is the first time I purchase a MAC product not from MAC itself. The compact received was all bumpy and looked like it was refilled. I am not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> The quality was terrible, but I guess I should have known since the price was so good. The powder was very clumpy and looked either fake or very expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess ya live and you learn!</li>
    <li> Love this concealer.  It dimished the majority of spots I have on my face.  It also reduced the breakouts I used to have. I hardly ever break out now!</li>
    <li> Cheeper then purchasing at mall. More then likely would purchase again since its just powder. Has gone more quickly then remember others</li>
    <li> Did not liked it much...&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it, gives me a dry feeling on my skin. Doen&#x27;t feel natural to me.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! THIS IS SOOOO MY COLOR! I SAVED SOME MONEY TOO! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR? I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MY MAC FROM AMAZON!!! THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. I love the way it transforms an ordinary face in to a classy, beautiful one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order Mac from Amazon. I also have been using this product for years &amp; this is not the real deal. Smells like cover girl, goes on orange, &amp; is flakey. Will never order Mac online again. What a rip off!!</li>
