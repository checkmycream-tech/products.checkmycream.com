### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very impressed with the pigment of this lipstick</li>
      <li>great lipstick</li>
      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color.</li>
      <li>It looks good from a distance but not that great up close.</li>
      <li>it looks really good on me</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have to have perfect lips for it to go on smoothly with no flaws.</li>
      <li>Good for what I bought it for.</li>
      <li>use for more that lipstick Great for eye  makeup.</li>
      <li>it feels nice</li>
      <li>I actually liked it.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s great for special FX use.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this Lipstick for creating ombre lips.</li>
      <li>I love how this looks on me.</li>
      <li>I realy love nyx products</li>
      <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS LIPSTICK....  </li>
      <li>The color does not look good on darker skin, or really any skin for that matter.</li>
      <li>Like it, but does not have a huge staying power</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great color and definitely matte.</li>
      <li>enjoy this lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Goes smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
      <li>, it wasnt smooth at all</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone, but it is a nice mixer, I mainly bought it to make gray.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for lightening other lipsticks, but not so good on its own.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going for white, you&#x27;ll want to exfoliate and powder your lips before each application, which stays kind of sticky feeling and shiny for quite a while (unless you put powder on top).</li>
      <li>imjust cant look good in white lipstick anymore, those days are passed</li>
      <li>You really need to have your lips in top shape to pull this one off.</li>
      <li>These lippies are a great way to experiment with new wild colored lipstick trend without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super cool color, though, just looks nothing like the photo.</li>
      <li>, it was SUPER cakey , it was kinda rediculous,  </li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick, but I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>I expected it would not look good on me</li>
      <li>SO good for brightening other lipstick colors or liquid lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s high maintenance.</li>
      <li>just as shown, soft creamy easy to apply, non drying.</li>
      <li>Still good value &amp; can use to lighten other colors and for unusual effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For someone who likes to experiment with different looks and who likes to cosplay, I say this works lovely.</li>
      <li>I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
      <li>It is stark but still kind of cool.</li>
      <li>very unique white color that you can not find in stores around here</li>
      <li>but it also mixes with other colors to make my own color..</li>
      <li>if your teeth aren&#x27;t as bright white as this lipstick, definitely don&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipped really fast and free - will keep the seller in mind for future cosmetic purchases.</li>
      <li>However, the consistency/formula leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>Even then it is very streaky/blotchy.</li>
      <li>, it lasted really well.</li>
      <li>I wear this on top of purple and pink lipstick.</li>
      <li>It was pretty opaque and lasted pretty long, but didn&#x27;t go on super even.  </li>
      <li>and you need several swipes to get true opaque color.</li>
      <li>While it is a little pastier than most of the other lipsticks out there, I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Since the color is so light it settles into every little line in your lips</li>
      <li>(Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.)</li>
      <li>This particular color &amp;#34;Coconut&amp;#34; is one of the ones that is okay, but not great.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, this will NOT dry out your lips, it will STAY on your lips, and it didn&#x27;t come off, even when I drank/ate things!</li>
      <li>A slight bit drying, but apply a little bit of lip balm before hand and you should be fine.</li>

<li> I’ve looked for white lipstick for a long time that’s not sheer.</li>
<li> how long lasting it is but the color didn&#x27;t look good on me :(</li>
<li> I was actually shocked at how much I liked the color.....</li>
<li> so I tried putting chapstick on first and it only made it worse</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why, but even white eyeshadows and white eyeliners are sometimes a little funky.</li>
<li> I Like it myself, because you can blend it with other colour, do recommend.</li>
<li> Not amazing as a white lipstick.</li>
<li> White goes on a bit pasty - I thought it might, white is just a difficult pigment in makeup I guess.</li>
<li> The retail price for these is about $6 which is far less expensive than other lipsticks of this type.</li>
<li> It goes on a little chalky</li>
<li> It is definitely white, but also thin.</li>
<li> I was not too disappointed however, as I bought this mainly to use as a mixer to tone down other lipsticks.</li>
<li> but it is so white that it makes my teeth look awful when I smile.  </li>
<li> White is actually a difficult colour for makeup to be.</li>
<li> i may not be applying this correctly, but it&#x27;s a little difficult to achieve an even color with this.</li>

    <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS LIPSTICK....  I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 70s party.  It was pretty opaque and lasted pretty long, but didn&#x27;t go on super even.  It worked, but not like a charm.</li>
    <li> enjoy this lipstick.  use for more that lipstick Great for eye  makeup.</li>
    <li> it looks really good on me and I got a lot of compliments. very unique white color that you can not find in stores around here</li>
    <li> I love how this looks on me.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the pigment of this lipstick (The color was Coconut).  I was doing a cosplay of a character who&#x27;s skin and lips are solid white and not only did this go on well, it lasted really well. A slight bit drying, but apply a little bit of lip balm before hand and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Lipstick for creating ombre lips. Goes smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
    <li> So I know it&#x27;s went for the lips but I got it as a lightener for my foundation or as a hilight , it was SUPER cakey , it was kinda rediculous,  then I tried using it for lipstick as it&#x27;s intended, it wasnt smooth at all and the moment I smacked my lips it separated.and was no longer on my lips ,  so I tried putting chapstick on first and it only made it worse and it was all over the place again, so I tried setting it with some white eye shadow and it caked up again and made my lips crack. I realy love nyx products so this was quite dissapointing,  I tried to make it work, but It just woldnt</li>
    <li> The color does not look good on darker skin, or really any skin for that matter. However, it&#x27;s great for special FX use.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted me to get this and pretend I was a robot.</li>
    <li> i may not be applying this correctly, but it&#x27;s a little difficult to achieve an even color with this. it&#x27;s a great color and definitely matte. but can be splotchy</li>
    <li> These lippies are a great way to experiment with new wild colored lipstick trend without breaking the bank. These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color. This particular color &amp;#34;Coconut&amp;#34; is one of the ones that is okay, but not great.  I was actually shocked at how much I liked the color.....I expected it would not look good on me I actually liked it. It is stark but still kind of cool. However, the consistency/formula leaves much to be desired. Since the color is so light it settles into every little line in your lips and you need several swipes to get true opaque color. Even then it is very streaky/blotchy. It looks good from a distance but not that great up close. You really need to have your lips in top shape to pull this one off. I tried it on without a lipliner but I definitely think it would benefit from one (Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.) I will also try a lip primer of some sort in the future. I was not too disappointed however, as I bought this mainly to use as a mixer to tone down other lipsticks. The retail price for these is about $6 which is far less expensive than other lipsticks of this type. I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
    <li> I like the lipstick because of how well it goes on and how long lasting it is but the color didn&#x27;t look good on me :(</li>
    <li> Like it, but does not have a huge staying power</li>
    <li> SO good for brightening other lipstick colors or liquid lipsticks. Reallly makes the color pop.</li>
    <li> it feels nice and i like the color.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick, but I absolutely love this. For someone who likes to experiment with different looks and who likes to cosplay, I say this works lovely. I would definitely like to buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> I Like it myself, because you can blend it with other colour, do recommend.</li>
    <li> just as shown, soft creamy easy to apply, non drying. imjust cant look good in white lipstick anymore, those days are passed but it also mixes with other colors to make my own color.. i do like rhis brand</li>

    <li> I’ve looked for white lipstick for a long time that’s not sheer. Here it is!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d have to have perfect lips for it to go on smoothly with no flaws. It&#x27;s a super cool color, though, just looks nothing like the photo.</li>
    <li> great lipstick but it is so white that it makes my teeth look awful when I smile.  if your teeth aren&#x27;t as bright white as this lipstick, definitely don&#x27;t buy.</li>

If you&#x27;re a cosplayer or just ANYONE looking for white lipstick, get this one.</li>
    <li> It goes on a little chalky</li>
    <li> I wear this on top of purple and pink lipstick. Its great.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s high maintenance.
