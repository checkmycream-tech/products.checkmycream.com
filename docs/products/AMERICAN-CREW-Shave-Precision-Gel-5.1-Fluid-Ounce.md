      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This gel gives an awesome shave.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and beats all foams and gels.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest getting a premium shave cream or soup and look into getting a badger brush if you desire a great lather.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>5 stars for great shaving.  </li>
      <li>I use a safety razor and this stuff works great</li>
      <li>Great shave gel...</li>
      <li>Provides good lubrication, however I have a problem with ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this to get a good shave.</li>
      <li>This is one innovative product!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, don&#x27;t have to use lots in order to have a great shave</li>
      <li>Honestly, Buyer-beware.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best shaving product that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Love this cooling shave gel.</li>
      <li>The minty scent is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already bought more of both of these products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I might buy more to put in my travel bag, but I can&#x27;t see using it every day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a close shave, no nicks or cuts and leaves a nice cool feeling.  </li>
      <li>Also smells nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>Razor cleans easily</li>
      <li>It provides a close, comfortable shave without clogging your razor.</li>
      <li>I accidentally picked up a tide at the Munich Airport duty free</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product due to price, scent, and most importantly; THE EXCELLENT SHAVE!</li>
      <li>Great, especially if you have a beard that you are trimming around because you get full protection</li>
      <li>there is no irritation, and it rinses off quick and easy when done.</li>
      <li>i love this item very much but&lt;</li>
      <li>Love the product from the first time i tried it.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a year or so now, and still feel it is superior to standard shaving creams.</li>
      <li>Having tried a sample of another shave cream I spontaneously picked up a tube of Crew figuring it would be at least as good.  </li>
      <li>The residue left when just a little water is added is superb for shaving.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also felt a bit greasy and runny, and it&#x27;s second ingredient listed is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a lathering agent which isn&#x27;t particularly good for sensitive skin.     </li>
      <li>and I get a nice close shave - much closer than regular shaving cream or gels out of a can.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Shave Oils, which I do like very much, but they gum up my razor.</li>
      <li>, I want a layer of this gel coating it first.</li>
      <li>My only problem is that I spend most of my time in China, where I cannot get it, even Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship here.</li>
      <li>I first came across this product in a bin of travel sized toiletries at a Nordstrom Rack and never saw it again...</li>
      <li>first I tried to get into the fancy oils shaving creams - even tried a brush briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face actually hurts more after using this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my go-to during the summer when it&#x27;s hot after a shower.</li>
      <li>Really helps for a smooth shave with my double edged safety razor.</li>
      <li>stuff really works for me.</li>
      <li>On the contrary i feel that the mint is not too much in that shaving gel</li>
      <li>My razor glides so much easier.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t put too much in your hand</li>
      <li>, if you put too much the razor will remove nothing from its thickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
      <li>and I am able the same advantage from over the counter products at major retailers.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out super fast and works really well.</li>
      <li>Although it is difficult to find, Amazon provides it at a great price</li>
      <li>My new go to shaving product.</li>
      <li>The only stuff that works for me and my thick whiskers at a fair price.</li>
      <li>As a shaving lubricate, it&#x27;s probably better than the stuff you&#x27;re going to get from a can, however it lathers on clear, so it&#x27;s hard to see where you&#x27;ve shaved before.</li>
      <li>It is clear so you can see your beard through the gel.  </li>
      <li>but you will have to rinse frequently.</li>
      <li>I bought some of this after American Crew discontinued their Classic Shave Cream.</li>
      <li>product itself smells similar to Crew&#x27;s shampoo and other hair products - adequately manly without being overbearing.</li>
      <li>very* slightly, especially if your face or hands are wet, but I definitely think of this more like a European-style shave oil than traditional American goopy foam.</li>

<li> very* slightly, especially if your face or hands are wet, but I definitely think of this more like a European-style shave oil than traditional American goopy foam.</li>
<li> it does foam a little bit depending on how much water you use to wet your face</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s really tick and hard to wash off</li>
<li> If I have to drag a series of parallel, razor-sharp slivers of metal across my face</li>
<li> I can get better results from less expensive products.</li>
<li> When I use a double edge, it protects the skin from irritation, but doesn&#x27;t protect from nicks/cuts as well as some of the other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have lasted several months on this shaving cream with every other day shaving</li>
<li> This seems to dry out in my face faster than I can shave.  </li>
<li> After 10 years of faithfully using American Crew shaving creams/gels,I will not longer be buying their shaving products as they seem to be watered down now-a-days.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t want to go back to my previous shaving products ever again.</li>
<li> Only a small dab gets your entire shave</li>
<li> I have been shaving with a Merkur double edged safety razor for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I find this just right - not too thin, not to creamy or thick; it foams *</li>
<li> When I am lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a few days I used to get a lot of irritation the next time I shave.</li>
<li> $10 down the drain.</li>
<li> I also like the scent and slight tingling</li>
<li> This gel is thick but smooth without being annoyingly dense or sticky.</li>
<li> while messaging my face before shaving i saw small amount of foam</li>
<li> This stuff is slick and it protects my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I purchased this shaving gel from salonwholesale &amp; after I complained to them about item&#x27;s content leaked all inside package, I got no response!</li>
<li> Its very thick</li>
<li> Overall the experience was terrible when using it</li>
<li> I was wrong.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very expensive for what it is.</li>
<li> However, bad experience when i opened the box.  </li>
<li> still this is the worst shaving gel I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Provides good lubrication, however I have a problem with ingrown hairs. I have used products that say it helps reduce them and they actually seem to work. Perhaps if I used the American Crew Lubricating Shave Oil along with the gel I may benefit, but I choose to buy only one product and I am able the same advantage from over the counter products at major retailers.</li>
    <li> This gel gives an awesome shave. It&#x27;s a close shave, no nicks or cuts and leaves a nice cool feeling.  Using the \\&quot;Post shave cooling lotion\\&quot; tops off the shave and I don&#x27;t get the itchy or burning feeling on my face. I&#x27;ve already bought more of both of these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been please with the American Crew line of hair products, so when I saw this Precision Shave Gel packaged with Post-Shave Cooling Lotion at Fred Meyer, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. As a shaving lubricate, it&#x27;s probably better than the stuff you&#x27;re going to get from a can, however it lathers on clear, so it&#x27;s hard to see where you&#x27;ve shaved before. It&#x27;s also felt a bit greasy and runny, and it&#x27;s second ingredient listed is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a lathering agent which isn&#x27;t particularly good for sensitive skin.     I&#x27;d suggest getting a premium shave cream or soup and look into getting a badger brush if you desire a great lather.</li>
    <li> i love this item very much but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Its very thick so don&#x27;t put too much in your hand, if you put too much the razor will remove nothing from its thickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- while messaging my face before shaving i saw small amount of foam so i won&#x27;t consider it 100% non foaming gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- its not burning at all On the contrary i feel that the mint is not too much in that shaving gel</li>
    <li> This seems to dry out in my face faster than I can shave.  And I use the companion shave oil as well.  I will not purchase again, but will continue to use in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> The only stuff that works for me and my thick whiskers at a fair price.</li>
    <li> This is about the worst shaving gel I have ever used. I have been shaving every day since I was 15 and that was only about 10 years ago yet still this is the worst shaving gel I have ever used. It is literally the same thing as Vaseline, a minty think gel that is sticky and doesn&#x27;t allow for a close shave at all. Overall the experience was terrible when using it and I would only use it if there was nothing left, even then I might use bar soap instead of this stuff.  Honestly, Buyer-beware.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and beats all foams and gels.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this after American Crew discontinued their Classic Shave Cream. I use a double edge, so I&#x27;m always looking at ways to enhance the closeness of the shave while also reducing skin irritation and nicks/cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this gel works best when I travel- since I use disposables when I go out of town. When I use a double edge, it protects the skin from irritation, but doesn&#x27;t protect from nicks/cuts as well as some of the other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might buy more to put in my travel bag, but I can&#x27;t see using it every day. I can get better results from less expensive products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving gel from salonwholesale &amp; after I complained to them about item&#x27;s content leaked all inside package, I got no response! After 10 years of faithfully using American Crew shaving creams/gels,I will not longer be buying their shaving products as they seem to be watered down now-a-days. I will keep using their hair gels though.</li>
    <li> I find this just right - not too thin, not to creamy or thick; it foams *very* slightly, especially if your face or hands are wet, but I definitely think of this more like a European-style shave oil than traditional American goopy foam.</li>
    <li> I accidentally picked up a tide at the Munich Airport duty free and I don&#x27;t want to go back to my previous shaving products ever again. The ease of use, scent, feel are in perfect combination. My only problem is that I spend most of my time in China, where I cannot get it, even Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship here. Otherwise, go for it!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shaving product that I have ever used. I have used it for over 4 years, since Crew provided. Although it is difficult to find, Amazon provides it at a great price</li>
    <li> Great, especially if you have a beard that you are trimming around because you get full protection but you can still see your beard line.  My new go to shaving product.</li>
    <li> Great shave gel...it does foam a little bit depending on how much water you use to wet your face but that&#x27;s not too big of a deal. It&#x27;s my go-to during the summer when it&#x27;s hot after a shower. I use a safety razor and this stuff works great but you will have to rinse frequently.</li>
    <li> I first came across this product in a bin of travel sized toiletries at a Nordstrom Rack and never saw it again... until I found it here! This gel is thick but smooth without being annoyingly dense or sticky. The minty scent is refreshing. It provides a close, comfortable shave without clogging your razor. If I have to drag a series of parallel, razor-sharp slivers of metal across my face, I want a layer of this gel coating it first.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for great shaving.  Razor cleans easily and I get a nice close shave - much closer than regular shaving cream or gels out of a can.  I like the ease I can use to open it up and pour it into mini-travel bottles.  I also like the scent and slight tingling (I guess from eucalyptus oil).  Wakes me up in the mornings!</li>
    <li> Love this cooling shave gel. Really helps for a smooth shave with my double edged safety razor. Doesn&#x27;t dry out super fast and works really well. Also smells nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Having tried a sample of another shave cream I spontaneously picked up a tube of Crew figuring it would be at least as good.  I was wrong.  My face actually hurts more after using this product.  $10 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Love the product from the first time i tried it. However, bad experience when i opened the box.  Received cracked container with product contents leaked out all over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan.  It&#x27;s very expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> This is one innovative product!  It is clear so you can see your beard through the gel.  It does not need to lather because it coats your skin so well.</li>
    <li> This shave gel is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s smooth, don&#x27;t have to use lots in order to have a great shave</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving product that doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Merkur double edged safety razor for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I tried to get into the fancy oils shaving creams - even tried a brush briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I found Crew&#x27;s Precision Shave Gel to be the best and cheapest on the market. The residue left when just a little water is added is superb for shaving. Only a small dab gets your entire shave completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells similar to Crew&#x27;s shampoo and other hair products - adequately manly without being overbearing. I have lasted several months on this shaving cream with every other day shaving habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product due to price, scent, and most importantly; THE EXCELLENT SHAVE!</li>
    <li> Great product! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this to get a good shave. Never buying another brand!</li>
    <li> I break out when I use name brand canned shave gels (Gillette, Edge, etc.). I&#x27;ve used Shave Oils, which I do like very much, but they gum up my razor. This stuff is slick and it protects my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;d say with any health care product... everyone is different... just keep trying products until you find one that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome.. You can see through the gel and know where you are shaving.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it for a year or so now, and still feel it is superior to standard shaving creams. My razor glides so much easier. When I am lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a few days I used to get a lot of irritation the next time I shave. With American Crew Precision Shave Gel. there is no irritation, and it rinses off quick and easy when done.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s really tick and hard to wash off</li>
