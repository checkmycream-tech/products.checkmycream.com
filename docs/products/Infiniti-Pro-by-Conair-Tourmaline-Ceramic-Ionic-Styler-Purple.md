      <li>so that&#x27;s good when I&#x27;m drying my hair at 5:30AM!  </li>
      <li>just not as good!</li>
      <li>Say good bye to frizzy hair!</li>
      <li>STILL WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>For the money, the dryer seems good.  </li>
      <li>I lost the diffuser and straightening attachment years ago while travelling but loved them while I had them.  </li>
      <li>and I have absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>Top of the line and great product.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing the Conair Infiniti Pro (paying $8 more than the price on Amazon... BOO)!</li>
      <li>So it kind of starts to slip in your hand</li>
      <li>I  OWN</li>
      <li>The diffuser is my best friend as I have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty dang good!</li>
      <li>also love that this comes with a diffuser.</li>
      <li>Love the color.  </li>
      <li>and I notice a difference in the condition of my hair for the better.  </li>
      <li>The buttons aren&#x27;t the most convenient for changing options and turning on and off while using it.</li>
      <li>Love how this dryer keeps your hair smoother and prevents frizzy dryness.</li>
      <li>color is cute too :)</li>
      <li>WILL RUN CIRCLE AROUND MOST OTHERS.&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
      <li>After a week though...I got used to the difference in weight and LOVE it now :)</li>
      <li>Love the attachments.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used one until I got this dryer, but I would recommend it for everyone because it&#x27;s better for your hair -</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s heavier than most blow dryers, but that&#x27;s because it is quality.  </li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job on my kinky curly hair.</li>
      <li>only warm!!</li>
      <li>The cool shot button is great and provides a nice, cool air flow even with the dryer set on high heat.  </li>
      <li>The ion button saves your hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
      <li>FAR STILL RUNNING STRONG LOL.</li>
      <li>Also, it dries my hair very quickly - lots of power.  </li>
      <li>It could have been much costlier and then I might not have had a chance to operate it and see for myself the great ionic function and powerful setup this guy has.</li>
      <li>Love how quick it dries my hair.</li>
      <li>I wish it would get just a tad bit hotter, but it&#x27;s an overall great product</li>
      <li>So far it seems like a good hair dryer.</li>
      <li>This was a great dryer and I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>Totally worth my every penny!</li>
      <li>I did my research for weeks to see which blow dryer would be right for my hair type, and this is the one!</li>
      <li>I got it as a replacement for my old dryer that died, and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled about all the features.</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;re accidentally hitting the cool shot button...  </li>
      <li>Unless you don&#x27;t mind the weight and the cool temp, skip this dryer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that drying my hair at a warm setting just makes my hair wavier and more stubborn to dry.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great dryer.  </li>
      <li>Also, at its hottest setting it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only reason for 4 stars, if it still had the long cord, it would be a perfect 5!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like my personal gizmo with so many functions to try on!</li>
      <li>The purple color is pretty, too!</li>
      <li>It dries my hair much faster, and it&#x27;s purple!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had far cheaper hair dryers that are lighter and have better heat settings.</li>
      <li>and I love it, the dryer is heavier because its a professional DC dryer.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this one for a gift because I loved it so much.</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer sometime in the early 2000&#x27;s because it had great reviews, even back then.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also quieter than my last one, which is nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The huge plus for me is that this dryer has a long cord, which makes styling so much more</li>
      <li>I do love the multiple settings, cool shot button.</li>
      <li>Not too hot but just right.  </li>
      <li>I finally had to replace my 7 year old hair dryer and decided to try this one because it was a good deal (got it when it was a lightning deal).  </li>
      <li>You can remove the back cover to clean the filter which is really important when choosing a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t get really hot, because it gets the job done anyway.</li>
      <li>works well enough like the diffuser more for like beauty shop</li>
      <li>Overall, given what I paid here on amazon, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It has lots of power and dries exactly as described in the write up.  </li>
      <li>love my new hair dryer and the attachments that come with it, it feels very professional and it shipped really fast too</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;In general, it dries my mid-back long hair pretty quickly, I also use the warm option</li>
      <li>It worked really well until a month ago, when it stopped getting hot.</li>
      <li>love that there are 4 heat settings- hot, warm, cool, and cold shot.</li>
      <li>It dried my hair fast without damaging it, and I love the cool shot feature.</li>
      <li>: the cord is 3 FEET shorter than the older model!</li>
      <li>When the red light is off, the ion concentrator is off.</li>
      <li>I have stubborn, wavy hair that I like drying straight and</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t if they really like this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>and I really like it a lot.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise it is fast</li>
      <li>AM VERY PICKY ABOUT HAIR APPLIANCES AND THIS DRYER</li>
      <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>That button is right where my index finger would naturally go when drying.</li>
      <li>IF MY OLDER ONE EVER</li>
      <li>Purchased as a replacement for the same model which died after more than 5 years daily service</li>
      <li>When it works, it is a decent dryer.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who cares about the health and look of their hair</li>
      <li>The dryer came with a diffuser and a concentrator, it is powerful, quiet, and efficient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I LIKE THE NEW PURPLE COLOR EXACT SAME STYLE</li>
      <li>Purchased this dryer after my first Infinity finally burned out after about 8 years of use.</li>
      <li>This gets hot enough for my hair without feeling like it&#x27;s getting fried.</li>
      <li>only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I see it as a plus, cause I do need a bit of an upper body workout :).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product, the color was undetermined so when it was delivered the color was purple</li>
      <li>and my old one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment and would definitely recommend to someone else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My first impression of this hair dryer was its weight -- it is heavy! I have stubborn, wavy hair that I like drying straight and the weight of this hair dryer makes it difficult to hold for long periods of time. Also, at its hottest setting it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I&#x27;ve found that drying my hair at a warm setting just makes my hair wavier and more stubborn to dry. As the other reviewer mentioned, the buttons are at inconvenient locations, especially the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button. That button is right where my index finger would naturally go when drying. It&#x27;s kind of annoying to have to avoid it while blow drying my hair.   I&#x27;ve had far cheaper hair dryers that are lighter and have better heat settings. Unless you don&#x27;t mind the weight and the cool temp, skip this dryer.</li>
    <li> This item is way too heavy for a hairdryer and does not get hot! only warm!! Going to return! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent dryer! I got it as a replacement for my old dryer that died, and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled about all the features. I have long thick hair, and the drier is powerful enough to dry it even on \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or low setting.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are 4 heat settings- hot, warm, cool, and cold shot. High and low settings allow to style any hair. And there&#x27;s also an ion button. The dryer came with a diffuser and a concentrator, it is powerful, quiet, and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The huge plus for me is that this dryer has a long cord, which makes styling so much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I see it as a plus, cause I do need a bit of an upper body workout :).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product, the color was undetermined so when it was delivered the color was purple and I love it, the dryer is heavier because its a professional DC dryer. The ion button saves your hair from becoming frizzy. I never knew the difference until I bought this product I would highly recommend this to anyone who cares about the health and look of their hair</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I have very thick hair so need a powerful hairdryer and this one is perfect! It&#x27;s also quieter than my last one, which is nice. The only minor drawback is it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> So far it seems like a good hair dryer. It is a bit heavy but I don&#x27;t use it very long. The buttons aren&#x27;t the most convenient for changing options and turning on and off while using it. It&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t handle or anyone else can&#x27;t if they really like this hair dryer. You can remove the back cover to clean the filter which is really important when choosing a hair dryer. It also comes with a limited 5 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  It has lots of power and dries exactly as described in the write up.  The only complaint is that it is much heavier than a normal non-ceramic dryer.  After a week though...I got used to the difference in weight and LOVE it now :)</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer sometime in the early 2000&#x27;s because it had great reviews, even back then. It finally conked out today, and I was in a pinch so I had to run to Target and buy another dryer. I ended up purchasing the Conair Infiniti Pro (paying $8 more than the price on Amazon... BOO)! I&#x27;m just hoping it lives up to this dryer. This was a great dryer and I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth! It dried my hair fast without damaging it, and I love the cool shot feature. The only con is that it&#x27;s quite heavy, but being that it lasted so long, I still have to give it five stars!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works great!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s heavier than most blow dryers, but that&#x27;s because it is quality.  It blow dries my hair without all the heat so my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz.  Best dryer I ever bought</li>
    <li> I was in a panic this morning when my blow dryer quit - it had had a short in the cord for the past year and finally gave up the ghost. I&#x27;m now here to buy my second Infiniti. This is a workhorse of a blow dryer and I have absolutely loved it.  I have ridiculously thick hair that I hate to blow dry because, let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m lazy and have other things to do with my time.  This has been the blow dryer that can get my hair dry the fastest (less than ten minutes for hair halfway down my back and super thick) without frizz or losing softness. I lost the diffuser and straightening attachment years ago while travelling but loved them while I had them.  Yes, this is a little heavy, but never anything that I&#x27;ve had issues with. It&#x27;s durable - one blow dryer for a decade? That&#x27;s pretty dang good!</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job on my kinky curly hair. I wish it would get just a tad bit hotter, but it&#x27;s an overall great product</li>
    <li> If you have thin, straight hair, buy this blow dryer. I did my research for weeks to see which blow dryer would be right for my hair type, and this is the one! The price is perfect, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For thin, straight hair, turn the ion concentrator OFF (the button on the back/bottom of the handle). When the red light is off, the ion concentrator is off. This is better for thin, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this comes with a diffuser. I&#x27;ve never used one until I got this dryer, but I would recommend it for everyone because it&#x27;s better for your hair - it&#x27;s basically like air-drying your hair but a little quicker. Essentially the diffuser diffuses the air (wow, makes sense), which causes less friction to your hair and also allows your hair to keep its natural texture. Great for curly hair too!</li>
    <li> I dry what&#x27;s left of my hair by sticking my head out of the car window for a couple minutes but. seriously, this is a first rate hair drier. My 8 year old daughter has really thick, long, black hair and this copes really well. It does not seem to be noisy close up. The heat produced is enough to nearly burn my hand if it is held too close. It is not the lightest one around  but my wife does not complain about the weight when she uses it. Purchased as a replacement for the same model which died after more than 5 years daily service I see no reason why this won&#x27;t last as long</li>
    <li> didnt realyze how big &amp; Heavy(!!) it is difficult to use because of that. works well enough like the diffuser more for like beauty shop</li>
    <li> love my new hair dryer and the attachments that come with it, it feels very professional and it shipped really fast too</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND DRYER BOUGHT IT AS A BACK UP, THE ONE I HAVE NOW IS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BOUGHT DIFFERENT BRANDS AND THEY DON&#x27;T COME CLOSE TO THE POWER THIS ONE HAS.&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY PICKY ABOUT HAIR APPLIANCES AND THIS DRYER WILL RUN CIRCLE AROUND MOST OTHERS.&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NOTHING I DON&#x27;T LIKE ABOUT IT, I LIKE THE NEW PURPLE COLOR EXACT SAME STYLE AS THE ONE I  OWN WHICH IS BLACK.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;OH, MY HAIR DRYER STILL WORKS GREAT JUST WANTED A SPARE HUBBIES RETIRING AND MONEY WILL BE A LITTLE TIGHTER SO I AM GETTING WHAT I NEED NOW JUST IN CASE PLUS HAVE A SPARE DRYER  IF MY OLDER ONE EVER QUITS.&lt;br /&gt;SO FAR STILL RUNNING STRONG LOL.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  Love the color.  It is a little bit heavier than what I had been used to, but I have adapted.</li>
    <li> I think this may be the best hair dryer I have ever used. I actually bought this one for a gift because I loved it so much. In my opinion it compares with the really expensive professional dryers, without the price tag.</li>
    <li> This is a solid hair dryer, lots of options, a little louder and heavier, but professional grade.  It dries my hair much faster, and it&#x27;s purple!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this dryer after my first Infinity finally burned out after about 8 years of use. Love how this dryer keeps your hair smoother and prevents frizzy dryness. One BIG complaint about this new version: the cord is 3 FEET shorter than the older model! I now need an extension cord to use it! That&#x27;s the only reason for 4 stars, if it still had the long cord, it would be a perfect 5! The purple color is pretty, too!</li>
    <li> I finally had to replace my 7 year old hair dryer and decided to try this one because it was a good deal (got it when it was a lightning deal).  Now have been using it for a while and I really like it a lot.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet compared to some other hair dryers - so that&#x27;s good when I&#x27;m drying my hair at 5:30AM!  Also, it dries my hair very quickly - lots of power.  Not too hot but just right.  Love the attachments.  Only con is the weight.  Does feel like it starts to get heavy and my old one didn&#x27;t.  So it kind of starts to slip in your hand and then you&#x27;re accidentally hitting the cool shot button...  Other than that, great dryer.  I will keep it!</li>
    <li> I have very thin, very fine hair and have found that the new style of blow dryers with ionic technology do nothing for my hair except to make it depressingly limp and flat.  For this reason I looked everywhere for a blow dryer without ionic technology with no success, until I came across this product. Yes, this dryer does have ionic technology. However, it also has something none of the other dryers I looked at have...an on/off switch for said technology.  Finally!  That said, the dryer is a bit heavier than I like, but I am smaller than average, so what may feel heavier to me may be unnoticeable to the next person.  Also, this dryer doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other dryers I have used in the past, even on high.  This is probably better anyway for my hair type but may not be acceptable for someone with thick hair as it will obviously take longer to dry.  The cool shot button is great and provides a nice, cool air flow even with the dryer set on high heat.  The cord is of average length, about 6 ft., so if you prefer/need a longer cord you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer! Im on my second one and each one lasted at least 4 years and helps fix frizziness and add shine more than any other hairdryer I&#x27;ve used before. Others frustrate me now - like if I have to borrow one - just not as good!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works well, and I like the on/off switch to the ion option.  However, it does seem to be exceptionally heavy, and even though I&#x27;m a generally fit woman in my 30s, I find myself switching hands a few times.  It&#x27;s about as noisy as the average hair dryer, though the pitch is a little lower (which I like).  Overall, given what I paid here on amazon, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This gets hot enough for my hair without feeling like it&#x27;s getting fried. I like the ion option however I don&#x27;t think using the ion option weighs my thin hair down like others say. It is a little heavy but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Love how quick it dries my hair. It has taken me up to 2 hrs to dry not style my hair in the past-with this dryer it took 45 minutes to dry. The diffuser is my best friend as I have very curly hair. I use the diffuser after I was my hair and it takes 30 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> Totally worth my every penny! It could have been much costlier and then I might not have had a chance to operate it and see for myself the great ionic function and powerful setup this guy has. It&#x27;s definitely not your regular low weight hair-styler but then it&#x27;s not meant to be. It&#x27;s a professional one. It&#x27;s serious about its business to give you exactly what you want. It&#x27;s like my personal gizmo with so many functions to try on! One needs a little practice to get used to handling it but it works wonders! I am overjoyed with my purchase! Say good bye to frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> This Blow Dryer works very well, much like the other Blow Dryers I have purchased from Conair.  I like to stick with a company whose products last a long time and no I don&#x27;t work for Conair.  The settings on the Dryer all work well.  I like the cold air button feature and it shifts to cold air quickly.  Not sure about the slide switches on the Dryer, I think the toggle switches may be better but only time will be the judge.  For the money, the dryer seems good.  Purchased this item in August 2012.</li>
    <li> Decent, not too heavy, does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The color is cute too :)&lt;br /&gt;In general, it dries my mid-back long hair pretty quickly, I also use the warm option a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I have&#x27;t noticed any shine or change in the condition of hair compared to other hair dryers or natural drying.</li>
    <li> I am sending this back to the manufacturer. The power to this hair dryer has been temperamental since I purchased it. When it works, it is a decent dryer. Although I don&#x27;t mind that it is heavy, someone with a whole lotta hair may get really tired using this product.</li>
    <li> Top of the line and great product.</li>
    <li> Works well, but it is so heavy and big that it is difficult to maneuver if you are drying your own hair. I chose the Prime option and spent the extra $10 because I suspected it would be too heavy, based on other reviews. It&#x27;s going back tomorrow.I do love the multiple settings, cool shot button.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairdryer. Just wish the cord was longer like the model it replaced.  Fast shipment and would definitely recommend to someone else.</li>
    <li> The only reason I marked 4 stars is that it is heavy. Otherwise it is fast and I notice a difference in the condition of my hair for the better.  I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t get really hot, because it gets the job done anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Jan 2011. It worked really well until a month ago, when it stopped getting hot. And then I noticed the end was melting in on itself. I stopped using it and contacted Conair; I received no response. Their bad customer service has caused them to lose me as a customer. It&#x27;s too bad, because I had liked this dryer, but a melting product is too big of a safety risk.</li>
    <li> Heavy and not as powerful as I expected for 1800 W.</li>
    <li> Great versatility with settings and attachments!! The best diffuser I&#x27;ve found. (But the last one had a longer, sturdier cord.)</li>
