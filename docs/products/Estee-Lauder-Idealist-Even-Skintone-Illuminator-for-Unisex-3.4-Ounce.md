      <li>I LOVE idealist</li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>My face looks so much more even toned and brighter.</li>
      <li>It feels great on my skin and gives a natural nice glow to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Love this illuminating lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>so I guess it is ok....</li>
      <li>I used it and it seems ok...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often invest I high priced skin care as I feel there are plenty of great, reasonably priced options.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says and evens out my fair and sensitive skin tone.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it online, works like a miracle with every use, my husbands comments how much clearer my face appears.</li>
      <li>and I was sent the real thing at a more affordable cost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, because of golden sparkles make the skin look better right away, but doesn&#x27;t really treat it anyhow.</li>
      <li>Came quick.  </li>
      <li>So excited to find this at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>I have struggled with my facial acne for many years and to finally get a rewarding product to encourage so many compliments</li>
      <li>It does not come in a box first of all.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Also the company I purchased the product from shipped really fast and protected the product very well.  </li>
      <li>Happy with serum but my pump for the container failed me &amp; unable to use after many attempts to reconnect the inside with the top.  </li>
      <li>This is the one product that I pay a little more for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent what I am sure accounts to thousands of dollars looking for a product and have finally found it.</li>
      <li>I saw a marked improvement of my skin.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 months, every day and every night and can&#x27;t see a significant improve</li>
      <li>I compare to the one I am using now bought from Estee Lauder directly, the product is definitely thinner and watery and the scent is also a bit off.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s fine, because of golden sparkles make the skin look better right away, but doesn&#x27;t really treat it anyhow.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It feels great on my skin and gives a natural nice glow to the skin.  Also the company I purchased the product from shipped really fast and protected the product very well.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Love this product... I hope Estee Lauder keeps making it! My face looks so much more even toned and brighter.</li>
    <li> Love this illuminating lotion.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law sees results when she uses it so I guess it is ok....I amy try is one of these days.</li>
    <li> So glad I found it online, works like a miracle with every use, my husbands comments how much clearer my face appears.</li>
    <li> Happy with serum but my pump for the container failed me &amp; unable to use after many attempts to reconnect the inside with the top.  Therefore Im trying to judge each application.  Little disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product seems authentic but the origin is questionable.  It does not come in a box first of all.  I compare to the one I am using now bought from Estee Lauder directly, the product is definitely thinner and watery and the scent is also a bit off.  Compare to all other Estee Lauder product I have, they are all made in USA while this one is stamped made in UK.  I used it and it seems ok...but I won&#x27;t purchase again.  The seller is great in shipping it very fast!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often invest I high priced skin care as I feel there are plenty of great, reasonably priced options. This is the one product that I pay a little more for. Does exactly what it says and evens out my fair and sensitive skin tone. A must havers duct for me.</li>
    <li> Great produce, great value!</li>
    <li> Great Product, Very Quick Shipping, Good Packaging  Thank You,</li>
    <li> i had never had so even skin, until this</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good price!</li>
    <li> Its thinner than the product used to be.  And the letters &amp;#34;GB&amp;#34; are written on one side of the bottle, unlike when I used to purchase it from Estee Lauder.  It makes me wonder if it is a genuine product or a fake</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my face. I have struggled with my facial acne for many years and to finally get a rewarding product to encourage so many compliments I am forever grateful to Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using Estée Lauder Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator I saw a marked improvement of my skin. I&#x27;ve spent what I am sure accounts to thousands of dollars looking for a product and have finally found it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! an the prize its even better! 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
    <li> Great price. Came quick.  I was a little worried I was going to get a water down version of the product. But that was not the case. I LOVE idealist and I was sent the real thing at a more affordable cost.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT SHE WANTED AND GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 months, every day and every night and can&#x27;t see a significant improve</li>
    <li> So excited to find this at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Love this, it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I was curious as to the expiration date on the product, and it had been blacked out. That didn&#x27;t make me happy, but it is fine. I know this product, and it is just what I  wanted.</li>
    <li> Price was great and received it right away.</li>
