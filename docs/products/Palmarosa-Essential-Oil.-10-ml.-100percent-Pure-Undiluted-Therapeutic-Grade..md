    <li> This is the first time that I have used Palmarosa oil. I love the smell and can&#x27;t wait to use it in my lotions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about which essential oil companies I use since it is so easy to alter the quality of the oil or even fake it. I feel confident that this is a real oil and of top quality. I also like the variety of oils that you can get from Plant Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be order more essential oils and blends from Plant Therapy again.</li>
    <li> Actually, I have not had a chance to use this oil as of yet. When I do get to use it, I&#x27;ll have an opinion. But for now, I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
    <li> Palmarosa is very good for the skin &amp; the oils I received are living up to expectations.</li>
    <li> This is, obviously, purely subjective because evreyone has their owns scents they like, but I ordered this based on the reviews and I thought I would like it. It is so strong it totally overwhelmed me and I actually got headaches from it. Maybe that&#x27;s what palmarosa is supposed to smell like. I was looking for a soft rose scent to add to my facial toners, but this was definitely not a soft scent. It is really powerful!</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected.  Smells great. Perfect for my uses.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as pictured. Essential Oil is a great help for many things. And aromatherapy is great in many circumstances.</li>
    <li> This is perhaps a nice fragrance to diffuse in your home, but used in the laundry, my poor husband and boys feel like they smell like they have flowery lady perfume on. It&#x27;s very strong, much stronger than I would prefer. We will use it up but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for laundry use with a house full of boys. It is a quality product, it&#x27;s just not &#x27;for me&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to essential oils, and ordered it because it was listed as an ingredient in several EO recipes I am interested in.

    <li> This has a rather unusual smell.  May take some getting used to.  I suspect it will add a nice layer when mixed with other oils.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in combination with others for a facial moisturizer and it works great!  Everything was shipped on time and intact.</li>
