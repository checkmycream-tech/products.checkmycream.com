    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair clean!! from the moment I apply it, I star feeling the tingle that makes my hair more manageable. the fragrance is so good! overall, I have notice that it brings out the natural oil of my hair and keeps it moist all day. With this shampoo, I wash my hair every other day and the look of my hair still is fantastic! I have dark brown hair and I colored as well ;)</li>
    <li> Although I have only used the product once since receiving it, I found it to be great!  It left my hair soft and silky yet not oily.</li>
    <li> Works great and leaves my hair shinning</li>
    <li> Great product. It does wonders to my hair. Gives shine to my hair as no other product does. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Super shampoo! After him, my hair became smooth as silk. They do not hover! Very economical.It smells good.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo on my keratin treated hair for a few weeks I noticed it made my hair crunchy and dry. I had to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of that feeling. It smells good but I&#x27;m not sure id buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, I do not feel that leaves hair soft and manageable with as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent for keratin treated hair!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for cleaning hair without the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Excellent for Keratin treated hair.</li>
    <li> I get regular keratin treatments from my stylist and I also color my hair red.  Red hair color is notorious for fading and mine was no exception until I started using this product.  My color now stays gorgeous and vibrant with little or no fading between salon visits.  If it wasn&#x27;t for my grey roots, I could probably double the time between colorings.  I really recommend this shampoo and it&#x27;s corresponding conditioner if you have issues with color fading.</li>
    <li> If you had your hair relaxed by this product or any relaxer I would recommend it. Also, if your hair is colored.</li>
    <li> I bought this to alternate with my GK keratin shampoo. I like it, and would recommend it to others. Not sure if i would use only this brand.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised, shipping and arrived in a timely manner.  Would do buisness with this seller again.  I love this shampoo.  It does a great job gently cleaning without striping.  I use it daily and have great results.</li>
    <li> smells great, lathers well.  love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for the price!</li>
    <li> I brought this shampoo because I recently(1 month ago) I did the keratin treatment. I never have my hair so beautiful in my life. My hair is Brazilian( Im from Brazil), dry, Afro , damage,frizz , etc.... I have try and spend money with many other products to control my hair, but nothing work. I feeling 1.000,000,000 hair, I use this shampoo today because I had color my hair, man..... my hair is shine,strait, beautiful, wonderful result, Im so happy, I me glad Marcia help my hair and other peple with damage hair, I recommended any one to do the Brazilian keratin treatment and then continue use treat color shampoo.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and the product makes my hair soft and easily manageable.  The conditioner is also excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this once and it worked wonderfully. It smells very nice and leaves hair clean and shiny. I just wish it came in bigger bottles, or I would use it exclusively.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I love that it lathers without leaving my hair stripped of its natural oils.  My only problem was that the bottle top is broken.  I am only able to pour shampoo into my hand using the press top lid by maintaining a pressure hold on the top to keep it open (so shampoo may flow out) otherwise it closes on its own.  That&#x27;s my only problem - bottle defect not problem with the shampoo itself.</li>
